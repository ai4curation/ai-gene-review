## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P50111
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein ZDS1; AltName: Full=Protein NRC1; AltName: Full=RT2GS1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ZDS1; Synonyms=CES1, CKM1, HST1, NRC1, OSS1, STM2; OrderedLocusNames=YMR273C; ORFNames=YM8156.15C;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** To yeast ZDS2/MCS1. .
- **Key Domains:** Zds1/2. (IPR040206); ZDS1_C. (IPR013941); Zds_C (PF08632)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ZDS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ZDS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ZDS1** (gene ID: HST1, UniProt: P50111) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Verified identity: ZDS1 encodes Protein Zds1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c (systematic name YMR273C), the paralog of Zds2, and functions in the Zds1/2 family that regulates the PP2A phosphatase containing regulatory subunit Cdc55. Literature cited below consistently treats Zds1/Zds2 as fungal proteins that act on PP2A-Cdc55 in budding yeast; no conflicting gene symbol usage was found for other organisms in the cited works (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014; Jonasson et al. 2016; Thai et al. 2017) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular nature: Zds1 is a non-enzymatic regulator/adaptor of the PP2A phosphatase complex that uses the B regulatory subunit Cdc55 (PP2A-Cdc55). It binds Cdc55 and helps control the subcellular localization and context-specific activity of PP2A-Cdc55, rather than acting as a catalytic enzyme itself (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, May 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, July 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Functional paradigm: Zds1/Zds2 promote the cytoplasmic/cortical pool of PP2A-Cdc55 and thereby promote mitotic entry while allowing proper mitotic exit by restricting nuclear PP2A-Cdc55 when needed. This spatial control links Zds1/2 to the Cdk1 control axis (Swe1/Mih1) and to mitotic exit (Cdc14 release) (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Cell polarity and Rho1 signaling: Zds1/Zds2 form a complex with PP2A-Cdc55 that acts as a Rho1 effector at the bud cortex to specify signaling outputs toward polarized growth and cell wall synthesis versus stress-responsive CWI signaling (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, January 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Direct 2023–2024 primary studies focused specifically on Zds1/Zds2 in S. cerevisiae are limited in the evidence retrieved here. However, the most recent mechanistic advance closely related to Zds1-regulated PP2A-Cdc55 is the demonstration that the cell wall integrity kinase Pkc1 remodels the PP2A-Cdc55–Zds1/2 complex and regulates binding of Igo/ENSA endosulfines to PP2A-Cdc55; this study quantified changes in complex composition and phosphorylation, including decreased phosphorylation at specific Zds1 sites upon activated PKC1, supporting multi-layered control of PP2A-Cdc55 by the CWI pathway (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4). URL/Date: J Biol Chem, March 2017, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M116.753004.
- Partial note on recency: While high-level 2023–2024 reviews discuss PP2A-Cdc55 logic and cell-cycle phosphatase networks, the present evidence set does not contain citable 2023–2024 primary data that newly redefine Zds1’s mechanism; therefore, recent content is summarized via contextually closest mechanistic work that integrates upstream Pkc1 with PP2A-Cdc55–Zds1/2 (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Cell-cycle control models: Zds1/2 are used as genetic and biochemical tools to manipulate PP2A-Cdc55’s spatial pools and to study mitotic entry/exit switches and checkpoint pathways (e.g., using Cdc55-NLS/NES alleles to phenocopy or rescue zds1Δ zds2Δ defects) (Rossio & Yoshida 2011) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 6-8, rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134.
- Polarity/CWI pathway dissection: The Zds1/Zds2–PP2A-Cdc55 complex is applied to parse decisions in Rho1 signaling between anabolic cell-wall synthesis and stress signaling, by manipulating Zds1/2 or Cdc55 localization and assessing β-1,3-glucan synthesis and CWI output (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.
- Phosphatase regulation mapping: Proteomics of PP2A-Cdc55 complexes under Pkc1 activation—including Zds1 phosphorylation state changes and Igo/ENSA dissociation—provide a framework for chemical-genetic and systems approaches to phosphatase regulation in growth checkpoints (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4). URL/Date: J Biol Chem, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M116.753004.

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Spatial regulation model: Expert analyses place Zds1/Zds2 as the principal determinants of cytoplasmic sequestration and cortical recruitment of PP2A-Cdc55, with ENSA-family Igo1/2 acting more prominently in the nucleus; Zds1/2 thereby enable cytoplasmic PP2A-Cdc55 to promote mitotic entry and restrict nuclear PP2A-Cdc55 to facilitate FEAR/MEN transitions (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 8-9). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Rho1 output specification: Zds1/Zds2–PP2A-Cdc55 are viewed as a Rho1 effector module that tunes signaling output by reciprocal regulation of Rho1 GAPs (Lrg1 and Sac7) and by mutually antagonistic dynamics with the Pkc1–Mpk1 CWI pathway; this concept reframes PP2A-Cdc55 not only as a mitotic phosphatase but as a cortical signaling effector that allocates Rho1 activity toward growth versus stress response (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.
- Cdk1/Swe1/Mih1 axis: By targeting Mih1/Cdc25 and promoting Swe1 downregulation via cytoplasmic PP2A-Cdc55, Zds1/Zds2 facilitate timely Cdk1 activation and mitotic entry; mislocalization of Cdc55 recapitulates zds1Δ zds2Δ phenotypes, underscoring the primacy of spatial control (Rossio & Yoshida 2011) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 6-8, rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 10-10). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134.

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Localization-function causality: Forcing Cdc55 into the nucleus (Cdc55-NLS) phenocopies zds1Δ zds2Δ (mitotic entry defects and morphology), whereas enforcing cytoplasmic localization (Cdc55-NES) rescues zds1Δ zds2Δ defects, directly quantifying the sufficiency of spatial regulation to explain functional phenotypes (Rossio & Yoshida 2011) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 6-8, rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134.
- Rho1 outputs: Loss of Zds1/Zds2 reduces β-1,3-glucan synthesis and increases chitin deposition consistent with CWI activation, providing quantitative cell wall composition readouts that map PP2A-Cdc55–Zds effects on Rho1 output (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.
- Proteomics of regulation: Quantitative mass spectrometry under activated Pkc1 shows marked reduction of Igo2 association with PP2A-Cdc55 and site-specific changes in Zds1 phosphorylation (e.g., S444/S445, S691), providing molecular readouts of CWI-dependent remodeling of the PP2A-Cdc55–Zds1/2 complex (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4). URL/Date: J Biol Chem, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M116.753004.

Primary function of Zds1 and precise mechanistic role
- Zds1 is a scaffold/adaptor for PP2A-Cdc55. It binds Cdc55 and, with Zds2, organizes the cytoplasmic/cortical pool of PP2A-Cdc55 that promotes mitotic entry (via Mih1 activation and Swe1 inhibition) and prevents inappropriate nuclear PP2A-Cdc55 activity that would oppose mitotic exit (by affecting Net1/Cfi1 and Cdc14 release) (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- As a Rho1 effector, the Zds1/Zds2–PP2A-Cdc55 complex biases Rho1 signaling toward polarized growth and β-1,3-glucan synthesis by inhibiting the GAP Lrg1, while antagonizing CWI signaling via stabilization of the GAP Sac7; this establishes pathway-selective dephosphorylation logic at the bud cortex (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.

Binding partners/complexes and putative direct targets
- Core complex: PP2A catalytic and scaffold subunits with regulatory B subunit Cdc55; Zds1 and Zds2 bind Cdc55 and co-exist within the PP2A-Cdc55 holoenzyme (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Rho1 module: Active Rho1 associates with the Zds1/Zds2–PP2A-Cdc55 complex at the bud cortex in a Zds1/2-dependent manner; Zds1’s Rho1-interacting region maps to residues 78–339 (HR2) (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.
- Upstream kinase pathway: Pkc1 interacts with the complex and remodels its composition and phosphorylation, including Zds1 sites, and reduces Igo/ENSA binding to PP2A-Cdc55 (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4). URL/Date: J Biol Chem, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M116.753004.
- Targets in cell cycle: Downstream PP2A-Cdc55 substrates influenced by Zds-mediated localization include Mih1/Cdc25, Swe1, and FEAR/MEN components such as Net1/Cfi1, thereby regulating Cdk1 activation and Cdc14 release (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3).

Subcellular localization and dynamics
- Zds1/Zds2 localize predominantly to the cortex/cytoplasm at sites of polarized growth, where they recruit/maintain Cdc55 and PP2A activity; in zds1Δ zds2Δ, cortical Cdc55 is lost and Cdc55 accumulates in the nucleus (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 8-9). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Rho1 dependence and pathway antagonism: Cortical Zds1/Cdc55 localization is Rho1-dependent during bud growth; activation of the Rho1→Pkc1→Mpk1 CWI pathway causes Cdc55 and Zds1 to leave the bud cortex, reflecting mutual exclusivity of growth versus stress outputs (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.

Pathway placement
- Cdk1/Swe1/Mih1 (morphogenesis checkpoint): Zds1-mediated cytoplasmic PP2A-Cdc55 promotes inactivation of the CDK1 inhibitor Swe1 and activation of Mih1/Cdc25, enabling mitotic entry; Zds proteins “target PP2A to Cdc25” as part of this axis (Rossio & Yoshida 2011) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 10-10, rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134.
- FEAR/MEN (mitotic exit): Downregulation of PP2A-Cdc55 by separase in early anaphase collaborates with Zds1/2 to promote Cdc14 release; nuclear exclusion of Cdc55 by Zds1/2 facilitates FEAR/MEN-driven exit (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 10-10, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201101134; Cell Cycle, 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cc.29064.
- Rho1–Pkc1 CWI and glucan synthesis: As a Rho1 effector complex, Zds1/Zds2–PP2A-Cdc55 inhibits Lrg1 to enhance β-1,3-glucan synthase-mediated growth and stabilizes Sac7 to restrain Pkc1–Mpk1 signaling, thereby specifying Rho1 outputs (Jonasson et al. 2016) (jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 2-3). URL/Date: J Cell Biol, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201508119.

Limitations and open questions
- Despite substantial mechanistic clarity, high-resolution structural information for the Zds1–Cdc55 interface and comprehensive phosphosite maps controlling Zds1’s cell-cycle dynamics remain incomplete. Direct 2023–2024 primary updates specific to Zds1/2 were not retrieved in this evidence set; thus, the recency emphasis here relies on adjacent regulatory advances (Pkc1-dependent remodeling of PP2A-Cdc55–Zds1/2) (Thai et al. 2017) (thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4).

Conclusion
Zds1 (YMR273C; UniProt P50111) is a cortical adaptor that binds the PP2A regulatory subunit Cdc55 and, with Zds2, dictates the spatial and contextual actions of PP2A-Cdc55 in budding yeast. Through localization-driven control, Zds1/2 promote mitotic entry (via Swe1/Mih1/Cdk1), enable mitotic exit (via FEAR/MEN and Cdc14 release), and act as a Rho1 effector that biases signaling toward polarized growth and β-1,3-glucan synthesis while antagonizing Pkc1–Mpk1 CWI signaling. Emerging systems-level work connects Pkc1 activity to dynamic remodeling of the PP2A-Cdc55–Zds1/2 complex and its binding partners, underscoring that Zds1 integrates growth and stress cues at the bud cortex (Rossio & Yoshida 2011; Rossio et al. 2014; Jonasson et al. 2016; Thai et al. 2017) (rossio2011spatialregulationof pages 1-2, rossio2014comparativegeneticanalysis pages 1-3, jonasson2016zds1zds2–pp2acdc55complexspecifies pages 1-2, thai2017proteinkinasec pages 2-4).
