description: 'DBP5 is an essential DEAD-box RNA helicase that functions as a key factor
  in mRNA nuclear export. It acts at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex
  where it remodels mRNP complexes and facilitates mRNA release. The protein is activated
  by interaction with Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) at the NPC. Beyond
  its primary role in mRNA export, DBP5 also participates in tRNA export and has secondary
  roles in translation termination.'

    review:
      summary: DBP5 is a well-characterized DEAD-box RNA helicase with 
        demonstrated ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. The IBA annotation is
        supported by extensive experimental evidence from multiple species, 
        representing a core molecular function conserved across eukaryotes.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core function of DBP5. The DEAD-box helicase family is 
        defined by this activity. The protein contains the diagnostic DEAD box 
        motif and Q motif characteristic of this helicase class. IBA reflects 
        legitimate phylogenetic inference of this conserved catalytic domain 
        function.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: DBP5 binds mRNA as part of its catalytic mechanism for helicase 
        activity. However, this annotation is overly generic for a protein whose
        function is specifically remodeling mRNP complexes. The binding 
        represents a means to the mechanistic end of mRNA remodeling and export,
        not a separate function.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While DBP5 does bind mRNA, describing this as a separate function 
        obscures the more informative molecular mechanism. DBP5 binds mRNA 
        transiently as substrate for ATP-dependent unwinding during the mRNA 
        export process. The IBA annotation is technically correct but less 
        informative than the actual catalytic function (RNA helicase activity). 
        This should not be listed as a core function alongside the helicase 
        activity, as it is subsidiary to that activity.

      reason: While DBP5 is involved in the post-transcriptional steps of gene
