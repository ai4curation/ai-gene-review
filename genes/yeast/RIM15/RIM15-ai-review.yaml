description: RIM15 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that integrates 
  nutrient signals (TOR, PKA, Sch9) to orchestrate entry into quiescence (G0 
  arrest). RIM15 directly phosphorylates key substrates including Igo1/2 
  (endosulfines), Rph1 (histone demethylase), and transcription factors Hsf1, 
  Msn2 to regulate stress response genes, autophagy induction, and chronological
  lifespan. Also promotes meiotic gene expression in response to glucose 
  depletion.

    review:
      summary: RIM15 is a serine/threonine protein kinase with extensive 
        experimental validation of catalytic activity across multiple direct 
        substrates (Igo1/2, Rph1, Hsf1, Msn2). IBA annotation based on 
        phylogenetic inference is appropriate.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Direct biochemical evidence confirms RIM15 phosphorylates Ser and 
        Thr residues in multiple substrates. Catalytic activity is central to 
        RIM15 mechanism of action.

    review:
      summary: RIM15 integrates signals from three major nutrient-sensing 
        kinases (TOR, PKA, Sch9) to transduce nutrient limitation signals. This 
        is a core function central to RIM15 activation of quiescence programs.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: RIM15 serves as a nutrient signal integrator that receives 
        inhibitory inputs from TOR/PKA/Sch9 and converts these into activation 
        of G0 entry program. This is signal transduction in the strict sense - 
        integrating multiple input signals to produce a cellular response.

      summary: RIM15 has a response regulatory domain (InterPro:IPR001789) 
        detected via InterPro. However, RIM15 is not known to function as part 
        of a classic two-component phosphorelay system in yeast.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: While RIM15 does contain a response regulatory domain by sequence 
        homology, it does not participate in phosphorelay signal transduction in
        yeast. RIM15 is activated by inactivation of upstream kinases (TOR, 
        PKA), not by phosphorylation as in typical phosphorelay systems. This is
        a false positive from InterPro domain annotation.

    description: RIM15 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that integrates 
      signals from TOR, PKA, and Sch9 kinases to sense nutrient (glucose and 
      nitrogen) availability. Upon nutrient limitation, RIM15 becomes active and
      catalyzes phosphorylation of downstream effectors (Igo1/2 endosulfines, 
      Rph1 histone demethylase, Hsf1 and Msn2 transcription factors) to 
      orchestrate quiescence entry and stress response programs.
