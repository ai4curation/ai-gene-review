description: 'SET1 is the catalytic component of the COMPASS complex, responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. SET1 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K4, a fundamental histone mark associated with actively transcribed genes and gene regulatory regions. SET1 also participates in DNA damage response, meiotic recombination, and telomere maintenance through both methylation-dependent and independent mechanisms.'
