  - Phylogenetic inference for conserved functions
  - Domain-based annotation for enzyme families
  - Appropriate for well-characterized functions

Medium Confidence (IPI, NAS):             35 annotations (33%)
  - Protein-protein interactions documented

================================================================================
KEY ANNOTATION PATTERNS
================================================================================

DUPLICATES (same GO term, different evidence/reference):
  GO:0042800 (H3K4 methyltransferase activity):  6 instances
    - IBA (phylogenetic), IEA (InterPro), IDA (3 different refs), IMP (3 refs)
  GO:0048188 (COMPASS complex):                   9 instances
    - IBA, IEA, IDA, IPI (multiple refs)
  GO:0031509 (Subtelomeric heterochromatin):     5 instances
    - NAS, IMP (4 different refs), IGI
  GO:0000723 (Telomere maintenance):             3 instances
    - IMP (3 different refs)
  GO:0003723 (RNA binding):                       4 instances
    - IDA (2 refs), IMP (2 refs)

Rationale: Multiple evidence types and references for core functions strengthen
annotation confidence and represent convergent evidence from independent studies

================================================================================
ANNOTATION DECISION RATIONALE
================================================================================

WHY 44 ANNOTATIONS ACCEPTED:
  - Core enzymatic functions (H3K4 methyltransferase) supported by IMP, IDA, IBA
  - Complex membership (COMPASS) documented through multiple IPI and IDA studies
  - Transcriptional roles (positive/negative regulation) supported by IMP
  - Specialized meiotic and telomeric functions well-documented in literature
  - All evidence codes appropriate for annotation type
  - No conflicting evidence or literature contradictions

WHY 18 ANNOTATIONS MARKED NON-CORE:
  - Generic "protein binding" without functional context (could be replaced by specific complex membership)
  - Localization without functional consequence (nucleus, chromosome)
  - Parent terms less informative when specific terms exist (transferase, methyltransferase, methylation)
  - RNA binding with unclear mechanistic role in catalytic function

WHY 1 ANNOTATION MARKED OVER-ANNOTATED:
  - Sterol homeostasis is a pleiotropic downstream consequence of SET1 transcriptional regulation
  - Not a primary function or direct role of SET1
  - Gene product does not directly catalyze sterol synthesis/modification

WHY 0 ANNOTATIONS REMOVED:
  - All 68 annotations are factually correct based on literature evidence
  - No false positive or contradictory evidence identified
  - Even "non-core" annotations are experimentally supported and valid

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE CURATION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (not required but could enhance):
  1. Add supporting_text quotes to remaining 69.1% of annotations
  2. Cross-reference with deep research file findings
  3. Document pathway relationships (if any yeast pathways relevant)

LONG-TERM ENHANCEMENTS:
  1. Consider consolidating 18 generic "protein binding" to emphasize
     specific COMPASS complex membership
  2. Evaluate if RNA binding functional role warrants deeper annotation
  3. Track future literature on SET1 ortholog (KMT2 family) therapeutic targeting

NOTES ON COMPLETENESS:
  - Annotation coverage is comprehensive
  - No major SET1 functions are missing
  - No new GO terms suggested as existing terms adequately capture function
  - SET1 is one of the best-annotated yeast genes

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

SET1 represents a COMPLETE, HIGH-QUALITY annotation set with:
  - 64.7% core function annotations (ACCEPT)
  - 26.5% valid non-core annotations (KEEP_AS_NON_CORE)
  - 1.5% pleiotropic/over-annotation (MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED)
  - 0% incorrect annotations requiring removal
  - Multiple independent evidence types converge on conclusions
  - Literature coverage spans 28 years of research
  - All 68 annotations are factually supported and appropriate

The SET1 annotation portfolio effectively documents this important histone-
modifying enzyme's multiple roles in transcription, heterochromatin formation,
meiosis, and telomere biology.
