## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P27614
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Carboxypeptidase S; EC=3.4.17.4; AltName: Full=GLY-X carboxypeptidase; AltName: Full=YSCS;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CPS1; Synonyms=CPS; OrderedLocusNames=YJL172W; ORFNames=J0510;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase M20A family. .
- **Key Domains:** ArgE/DapE_CS. (IPR001261); Bact_exopeptidase_dim_dom. (IPR036264); Pept_M20_carboxypep. (IPR017141); Pept_M20A. (IPR047177); Peptidase_M20. (IPR002933)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CPS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CPS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CPS1** (gene ID: CPS1, UniProt: P27614) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

**Introduction:** The **CPS1** gene of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (budding yeast) encodes **Carboxypeptidase S**, a vacuolar protease distinct from similarly named genes in other organisms. Carboxypeptidase S (also called **yeast carboxypeptidase yscS** or “Gly-X carboxypeptidase”) is a zinc-dependent exopeptidase in the M20A metallopeptidase family ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20,CPS%20is%20oriented%20with%20its)) ([pathway.yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/YEAST/NEW-IMAGE?object=EC-3.4.17.4&type=EC-NUMBER#:~:text=Synonyms%3A%20glycine%20carboxypeptidase%2C%20carboxypeptidase%20a%2C,X%20carboxypeptidase)). It catalyzes the hydrolysis of C-terminal peptide bonds, sequentially removing amino acids from peptide substrates. Notably, Carboxypeptidase S shows a preference for substrates with C-terminal **glycine or hydrophobic residues** such as leucine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20%20,Zinc%20metalloprotease)). (In fact, its EC classification 3.4.17.4, “glycine (Gly)-X carboxypeptidase,” reflects its ability to cleave C-terminal glycine from peptides ([pathway.yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/YEAST/NEW-IMAGE?object=EC-3.4.17.4&type=EC-NUMBER#:~:text=Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae%20%20EC%203,Metallocarboxypeptidases)) ([pathway.yeastgenome.org](https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/YEAST/NEW-IMAGE?object=EC-3.4.17.4&type=EC-NUMBER#:~:text=Synonyms%3A%20glycine%20carboxypeptidase%2C%20carboxypeptidase%20a%2C,X%20carboxypeptidase)).) Like the well-known vacuolar Carboxypeptidase Y (encoded by *PRC1*), Carboxypeptidase S contributes to yeast’s proteolytic system by degrading peptides into amino acids – especially under nutrient-limited conditions.

**Structure and Family:** The CPS1 gene product is synthesized as a precursor protein of about **64 kDa** (~576 amino acids) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20,CPS%20is%20oriented%20with%20its)). It belongs to the M20A family of metallopeptidases, which typically require a metal cofactor (likely Zn^2+ in this case) at the active site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20,CPS%20is%20oriented%20with%20its)). Carboxypeptidase S is considered a **zinc metallo-carboxypeptidase**, in contrast to Carboxypeptidase Y which is a serine-type carboxypeptidase ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Tyr%2C%20Val%2C%20Gly%2C%20Leu%2C%20Glu%2C,125)). The CPS1 protein contains conserved peptidase domains (e.g. peptidase M20 domain) characteristic of this family, and it likely functions as a dimeric enzyme (consistent with the presence of a bacterial exopeptidase dimerization domain in its sequence). These structural features indicate that CPS1 shares mechanistic similarities with other M20 metallopeptidases, which often act on dipeptides or small peptides. Indeed, biochemical assays show yeast vacuolar carboxypeptidases can cleave dipeptides: for example, the yeast vacuolar carboxypeptidase system (primarily Carboxypeptidase Y and S) can remove a glycine from a Gly-extended dipeptide, aiding processes like flavor precursor conversion ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20,precursor.%20The)). Such enzymatic activity underscores the role of CPS1 in liberating amino acids (especially glycine or other C-terminal residues) from peptides in the vacuole.

**Localization and Processing:** Carboxypeptidase S is a **vacuolar enzyme** that executes its function in the yeast vacuole (equivalent to the lysosome in higher eukaryotes). The CPS1-encoded polypeptide is initially produced as an **integral membrane precursor (pCPS)**, with an N-terminal signal/anchor sequence that embeds in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,drives%20sorting%20to%20the%20vacuolar)). This type II membrane topology means the bulk of the protein (including the catalytic domain) is translocated into the ER lumen, while a short N-terminal tail faces the cytosol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20,CPS%20is%20oriented%20with%20its)). After ER insertion, the Carboxypeptidase S precursor travels through the secretory pathway to reach the vacuole. **Proteolytic maturation** occurs inside the vacuole: the precursor’s transmembrane anchor is proteolytically cleaved by resident vacuolar proteases (specifically **Proteinase A (Pep4) or Proteinase B (Prb1)**) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,101%7D%20Therefore%2C%20CPS%20maturation)). This cleavage releases the mature **soluble Carboxypeptidase S (mCPS)** into the vacuolar lumen ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,drives%20sorting%20to%20the%20vacuolar)). As a result, in wild-type cells CPS1 is found as a soluble glycoprotein within the vacuole. (Experimental studies have tracked this maturation by observing a molecular weight shift: the membrane-bound precursor and the cleaved mature form can be distinguished by SDS-PAGE, although multiple N-linked glycosylation variants cause closely migrating bands ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649279/#:~:text=Defects%20in%20CPS%20maturation%20were,of%20mCPS%E2%80%94we%20term%20this%20the)).) The **N-linked glycosylation** of Carboxypeptidase S is typical of vacuolar hydrolases, and it contributes to the enzyme’s size heterogeneity on gels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649279/#:~:text=Defects%20in%20CPS%20maturation%20were,of%20mCPS%E2%80%94we%20term%20this%20the)). In summary, CPS1 undergoes a zymogen-like activation: it is delivered as an inactive membrane-tethered pro-enzyme and then activated by proteolytic removal of its anchor once safely inside the acidic vacuole.

**Vacuolar Targeting Pathways:** As a vacuolar protein, CPS1 needs to be trafficked from the Golgi to the vacuole. Yeast uses two main routes for delivering proteins to the vacuole: the **Vps10p-dependent (CPY) pathway** via endosomes (a classical route for soluble hydrolases), and an alternative **AP-3 pathway** (Adaptor Protein-3 mediated direct transport) for certain membrane cargos. Notably, Carboxypeptidase S can utilize **both pathways**. Early research demonstrated that CPS1 predominantly follows a **clathrin-dependent sorting route** similar to Carboxypeptidase Y: it exits the Golgi in clathrin-coated vesicles and requires the endosomal protein-sorting machinery for vacuolar delivery ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,bisphosphate)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649279/#:~:text=CPS,ALP%20but%20not%20CPS%20maturation)). In fact, the sorting receptor Vps10p (which binds soluble CPY) is not needed for CPS1, but **clathrin adaptors** (like Gga proteins) are involved in packaging CPS1 into vesicles at the Golgi ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,bisphosphate)). Consistent with this, mutants lacking the AP-3 complex (which would block the alternate pathway) still properly sort and mature CPS1, indicating the **endosome-mediated route** is sufficient ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649279/#:~:text=CPS,ALP%20but%20not%20CPS%20maturation)). **However, modern studies have revealed a more nuanced picture:** a 2022 proteome-wide analysis of vacuolar biogenesis found that Cps1p is one of a subset of proteins that rely **partly on AP-3** trafficking in addition to the Golgi–endosome route ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)). In AP-3 mutant cells, Cps1 still reaches the vacuole via the endosomal pathway, but some Cps1p abnormally accumulates in endosomal compartments (a “class E” phenotype) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)). This suggests **redundant or dual targeting**: under normal conditions, Carboxypeptidase S is delivered to the vacuole by both the **Vps10/clathrin pathway** and the **AP-3 pathway**, ensuring robust transport. Indeed, one study showed Cps1p (along with a few other vacuolar proteins like Ego3 and Atg22) localizes to the vacuole in wild-type cells but mislocalizes partially when either endosomal sorting or AP-3 is disrupted ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)). In summary, CPS1 is a cargo of the vacuolar protein sorting network, primarily using the canonical endosomal route but with the capacity to take an AP-3 “shortcut” to the vacuole as well ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2649279/#:~:text=CPS,ALP%20but%20not%20CPS%20maturation)).

**Ubiquitin-Dependent Sorting:** A remarkable aspect of Carboxypeptidase S trafficking is that it provided a model for understanding how membrane proteins are sorted into the lumen of the vacuole. Because Carboxypeptidase S is initially membrane-bound, cells must target it into **intralumenal vesicles** of the multivesicular body (MVB) so that it ends up inside the vacuole (rather than on the vacuole limiting membrane). The cell marks such membrane cargo with **ubiquitin** as a signal for entry into the MVB pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=Recognition%20of%20membrane%20proteins%20by,WW2%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=Rsp5%2C%20and%20the%20membrane%20proteins,of%20a%20weak%20noncanonical%20DMAPSY)). CPS1 was one of the first cargos shown to require **ubiquitin-tagging for vacuolar delivery**: the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase **Rsp5** attaches ubiquitin to the cytosolic tail of pCPS, and this ubiquitination directs Carboxypeptidase S into the MVB vesicles that bud inward at the late endosome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=weight.,34)). Mutant studies demonstrated that without Rsp5-mediated ubiquitination (or without the ESCRT machinery that recognizes ubiquitin), Cps1p fails to be sorted into the vacuole interior ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=weight.,34)). Instead, non-ubiquitinated Cps1 can remain on the vacuole membrane or get mislocalized, underscoring the importance of this signal. Moreover, **accessory adaptor proteins** help recruit the ligase Rsp5 to CPS1. For example, the membrane protein **Tul1** and its binding partner **Bsd2** bind Rsp5 and interface with Cps1p, thereby acting as adaptors that facilitate Cps1 ubiquitination ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=lumen.,34)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=vacuolar%20protease%20Cps1%2C%20and%20we,sites%20within%20the%20lipid%20bilayer)). Sullivan *et al.* (2007) reconstituted this adaptor-mediated ubiquitination in vitro, confirming that Bsd2 provides tandem PY motifs that engage Rsp5’s WW domains and enable efficient ubiquitin transfer to Cps1p ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=substrates%20contain%20%E2%80%9CPY%E2%80%9D%20motifs%20,Smf1%2C%20which%20requires%20both%20Bsd2)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=Rsp5%2C%20and%20the%20membrane%20proteins,of%20a%20weak%20noncanonical%20DMAPSY)). Disruption of BSD2 or TUL1 causes Cps1p to accumulate on the vacuole membrane instead of inside, mirroring the phenotype of failed ubiquitination ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=match%20at%20L403%20vacuolar%20protease,sites%20within%20the%20lipid%20bilayer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=mutant%20caused%20Cps1%20to%20accumulate,The)). These findings from **Pelham and colleagues** established Carboxypeptidase S as a paradigm for **ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal sorting** – a process conserved from yeast to mammals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=Recognition%20of%20membrane%20proteins%20by,WW2%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1924809/#:~:text=acts%20by%20recruiting%20Rsp5%2C%20via,2006)). In essence, CPS1 must be ubiquitinated and recognized by **ESCRT complexes** to be efficiently packaged into vesicles that deliver it as a soluble enzyme into the vacuolar lumen ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=weight.,34)). This mechanistic insight is considered a key expert analysis of how cells target membrane proteins for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole.

**Biological Function:** Carboxypeptidase S’s primary role is in **proteolysis – specifically the terminal step of peptide degradation in the vacuole**. It removes amino acids from the C-termini of peptides that result from bulk protein breakdown. Yeast cells typically undertake such protein turnover during nutrient starvation (for recycling amino acids) or during developmental transitions like sporulation. Consistent with this role, **CPS1 expression is strongly induced under low-nitrogen conditions** ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/CPS1#:~:text=Description%20Vacuolar%20carboxypeptidase%20S%3B%20targeted,yscS%20%200%20Comparative%20Info)). When yeast are starved for nitrogen, they activate a genetic program to scavenge internal resources; CPS1 is part of this nitrogen starvation response, presumably to maximize recovery of amino acids from peptides. (Regulatory studies suggest this induction might be under nitrogen catabolite derepression or general amino acid control, although the exact transcription factors were not specified in the literature ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/CPS1#:~:text=Description%20Vacuolar%20carboxypeptidase%20S%3B%20targeted,yscS%20%200%20Comparative%20Info)).) The **localization in the vacuole lumen** means Cps1p works alongside other vacuolar proteases – e.g. Proteinase A, Proteinase B, and Carboxypeptidase Y – in breaking down proteins and organelles during autophagy or nutrient stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Soluble%20vacuolar%20proteases)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=vacuolar%20proteases%2C%20proteinase%20B%20,40)). Notably, Carboxypeptidase S is somewhat **redundant** with Carboxypeptidase Y: early research showed that yeast mutants lacking both CPY and CPS still grow normally under rich conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=that%20the%20mutation%20might%20reside,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)). Even under prolonged starvation or during sporulation, **loss of both carboxypeptidases did not severely impair protein degradation** or viability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=that%20the%20mutation%20might%20reside,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)). In a classic 1981 study, Wolf and Ehmann isolated CPS1 mutants (in a CPY-deficient background) and found that **yeast can compensate for the absence of these carboxypeptidases**, likely through other peptidases and proteolytic pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=that%20the%20mutation%20might%20reside,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)). Only a minor sporulation defect was observed in double mutants, and mitotic growth was unaffected ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=that%20the%20mutation%20might%20reside,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)). This indicates that **CPS1 is not essential** for survival, thanks to overlapping functions of other enzymes (e.g. aminopeptidases that can also degrade peptides from the N-terminus). However, more subtle phenotypes emerge in specific contexts: for instance, cells lacking multiple vacuolar proteases (CPS1, PRC1, PRB1, etc.) show pronounced defects in protein turnover ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=carboxypeptidases,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)). Thus, Carboxypeptidase S serves as a “backup” or supplementary enzyme ensuring complete degradation of peptides – especially those ending in certain residues (Gly, Leu) that Carboxypeptidase Y or other proteases may remove less efficiently ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20%20,Zinc%20metalloprotease)). Its activity helps maximize the yield of free amino acids under nutrient-limited conditions.

**Pathway Integration:** In the broader picture of cellular metabolism, CPS1’s function ties into **nitrogen and sulfur metabolism** via protein catabolism. For example, by generating free amino acids, Carboxypeptidase S contributes to the pool of reusable nitrogen sources inside the cell. One practical illustration of this is in **yeast fermentation processes**: peptides imported into or generated in the vacuole can be degraded to release amino acids that feed into metabolic pathways. A recent study in brewer’s yeast highlighted that vacuolar carboxypeptidases play a role in converting certain **glutathione-bound flavor precursors** into aroma-releasing compounds ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20,precursor.%20The)). In *S. cerevisiae*, the breakdown of a dipeptide precursor (γ-glutamylcysteine-glycine conjugate) requires a carboxypeptidase to cleave the terminal glycine, followed by a γ-glutamyl transferase to remove the glutamate, liberating cysteine-bound aroma compounds ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20,precursor.%20The)). **Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY)** is the main enzyme for that glycine-cleaving step, but Carboxypeptidase S presumably can assist in similar reactions given overlapping substrate specificities. In brewing strains of yeast, researchers have measured total vacuolar carboxypeptidase activity (the sum of CPY, CPS, and possibly others) to assess its impact on flavor compound release ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=fermentation%20at%20lower%20temperatures%20does,for%20future%20flavor%20potential%20screening)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20activity%20%2841,189%20stood%20out%20from)). These studies confirm that **carboxypeptidase activity is present in all brewing yeasts** and can vary by strain, though it does not strictly limit flavor release in most cases ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=match%20at%20L219%20carboxypeptidase%20activity,189%20stood%20out%20from)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=whether%20the%20%CE%B3,3SHol%20%28data%20previously%20published%20%5B20)). Nonetheless, this represents a **real-world application** of understanding CPS1/CPY function: managing protease activity can influence the profile of metabolites (like amino acids and volatile thiols) during industrial fermentations.

**Recent Research and Expert Insights:** Modern genomic and proteomic approaches continue to shed light on CPS1. A 2014 comprehensive review of the yeast vacuolar proteome highlighted CPS1 as one of the core vacuolar hydrolases, describing it as a **zinc metallo-carboxypeptidase required for peptide degradation** in the vacuole ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20%20,Zinc%20metalloprotease)). The authors (Hecht *et al.*, 2014) emphasized that CPS1 follows a different biogenesis route than the classic CPY: being membrane-anchored, CPS1 depends on *ESCRT*-mediated sorting to reach the vacuole interior ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,103%7D%20Efficient)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=weight.,34)). This distinction has made CPS1 a valuable model for cell biologists studying protein trafficking. In 2022, Eising *et al.* published a **genome-wide vacuolar targeting map** which included CPS1, confirming and extending earlier findings on its dual-pathway sorting ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)). They found Cps1p among **64 proteins** assessed for AP-3 dependence, and observed that Cps1 requires a combination of AP-3 and endosomal pathways for full vacuolar localization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)). This kind of large-scale study underscores how **CPS1 is integrated into multiple cellular pathways**: protein sorting, nutrient signaling (nitrogen starvation response), and protein turnover. High-throughput interaction data also reflect this integration – for example, the BioGRID database (2023 update) lists **over 90 genetic or physical interactors of CPS1** in yeast ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/33588/summary/saccharomyces-cerevisiae/cps1.html#:~:text=,PTM%20Sites%2016)), including components of the vacuolar protein sorting machinery (e.g. VPS genes), other vacuolar enzymes, and regulators of proteolysis. Such network data suggest that CPS1’s function and regulation are intertwined with broader cellular processes (e.g. signaling pathways that modulate protease expression or activity). 

**Conclusion:** **Carboxypeptidase S (Cps1p)** is a well-characterized vacuolar enzyme in *S. cerevisiae* that plays a supporting role in protein degradation. It is targeted to the vacuole as a membrane-bound zymogen and activated by proteolytic processing into a soluble enzyme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20S%20,drives%20sorting%20to%20the%20vacuolar)). Its enzymatic activity – cleaving C-terminal amino acids, particularly glycine – complements other proteases to ensure complete breakdown of peptides ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=Carboxypeptidase%20S%20%20,Zinc%20metalloprotease)). While not essential for growth, CPS1 is upregulated during nitrogen starvation and helps yeast recycle nutrients under stress ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/CPS1#:~:text=Description%20Vacuolar%20carboxypeptidase%20S%3B%20targeted,yscS%20%200%20Comparative%20Info)). Decades of research, from the initial discovery of “yeast carboxypeptidase S” in 1977 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=A%20new%20carboxypeptidase%20,also%20deficient%20in%20carboxypeptidase%20Y)) to recent systems biology studies, have built a detailed understanding of CPS1’s **biochemical function, cellular trafficking, and regulation**. In expert analyses, CPS1 is frequently cited as a model for **vacuolar enzyme sorting and maturation**, illustrating key concepts like ubiquitin-driven MVB sorting ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4022603/#:~:text=weight.,34)). Ongoing interest in CPS1 also stems from its relevance to applied fields (e.g. fermentation technology) where proteolytic activity can impact product outcomes ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/12/2491#:~:text=carboxypeptidase%20,precursor.%20The)). In summary, CPS1 encodes a vacuolar carboxypeptidase that, through precise trafficking and catalytic action, contributes to the yeast cell’s ability to **degrade proteins and adapt to nutrient limitations**, with its importance and mechanistic nuances affirmed by both classical and cutting-edge research (1981–2024) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC216060/#:~:text=that%20the%20mutation%20might%20reside,in%20the%20partial%20reduction%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859911/#:~:text=expected%2C%20the%20V,3%20pathway)).
