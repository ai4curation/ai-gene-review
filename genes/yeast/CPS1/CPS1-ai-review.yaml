description: >-
  Carboxypeptidase S (yscS) is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase of the M20 family
  that functions in the vacuolar lumen to hydrolyze peptide substrates. The enzyme
  specifically cleaves the C-terminal amino acid from peptides where glycine is the
  penultimate residue (e.g., Z-Gly-Leu). CPS1 is synthesized as a type II transmembrane
  protein precursor that is delivered to the vacuole via the secretory pathway, where
  proteinase B (PrB) cleaves it to release the soluble mature enzyme into the vacuolar
  lumen. The enzyme requires two zinc ions for catalytic activity and participates in
  nitrogen metabolism by recycling amino acids from peptides, enabling growth on dipeptides
  as sole nitrogen source.

    label: metallocarboxypeptidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This is a more specific term than GO:0004180 (carboxypeptidase activity).
      CPS1 is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase of the M20 family that requires
      two zinc ions for catalysis. This is the more informative annotation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The existing carboxypeptidase activity annotations should be made more specific.
      This metallocarboxypeptidase activity annotation is actually more accurate.

    label: vacuolar membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: The precursor form of CPS1 is membrane-associated, but the mature active
      enzyme is soluble in the vacuolar lumen. PMID:1569061 showed that precursor forms
      are tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane but mature forms are soluble.
      This annotation captures the transient membrane association but not the final
      location of the active enzyme.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Reflects precursor localization rather than mature active enzyme. The fungal-type
      vacuole lumen annotation is more representative of where the enzyme functions.

  review:
    summary: This paper (PMID:17543868) is about the Vps27/Hse1 complex structure and
      function in ESCRT-mediated sorting. While CPS1 is a cargo sorted by this pathway,
      the paper does not directly demonstrate CPS1 localization to the vacuolar lumen.
      PMID:1569061 is the appropriate reference for vacuolar lumen localization.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The cited reference does not appear to directly demonstrate CPS1 localization
      to vacuolar lumen; need to verify the annotation source.
