description: >-
  Carboxypeptidase S (yscS) is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase belonging to
  the M20A subfamily of the ancient M20 metallopeptidase family (Clan MH), which spans
  all domains of life. The enzyme functions in the vacuolar lumen to hydrolyze peptide
  substrates, exhibiting strict substrate specificity for peptides with glycine in
  the penultimate (P1) position (e.g., Z-Gly-Leu). CPS1 is synthesized as a type II
  transmembrane protein precursor (77 kDa and 74 kDa glycoforms) that traffics via the
  MVB pathway with ubiquitin-dependent sorting (Lys8 ubiquitination by Rsp5). Proteinase
  B cleaves the precursor to release soluble mature enzyme into the vacuolar lumen.
  The enzyme uses the characteristic M20 di-zinc catalytic mechanism with five conserved
  metal-coordinating residues (His-Asp-Glu-Asp/Glu-His). CPS1 contributes ~60% of the
  enzymatic activity for Cbz-Gly-Leu hydrolysis and is regulated by nitrogen catabolite
  repression through GATA transcription factors (Gln3p, Gat1p), with expression increasing
  during nitrogen starvation. Represents ancestral M20 peptidase function, in contrast
  to the neofunctionalized mammalian homolog PM20D1 which evolved N-acyl amino acid
  synthase/hydrolase activity.

    summary: This is a more specific term than GO:0004180 (carboxypeptidase activity).
      CPS1 is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase of the M20 family that requires
      two zinc ions for catalysis. This is the more informative annotation.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: The precursor form of CPS1 is membrane-associated, but the mature active
      enzyme is soluble in the vacuolar lumen. PMID:1569061 showed that precursor forms
      are tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane but mature forms are soluble.
      This annotation captures the transient membrane association but not the final
      location of the active enzyme.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Reflects precursor localization rather than mature active enzyme. The fungal-type
      vacuole lumen annotation is more representative of where the enzyme functions.
