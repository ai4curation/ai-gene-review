description: Carboxypeptidase S (yscS) is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase belonging to the M20A subfamily of the ancient M20 metallopeptidase family (Clan MH), which spans all domains of life. The enzyme functions in the vacuolar lumen to hydrolyze peptide substrates, exhibiting strict substrate specificity for peptides with glycine in the penultimate (P1) position (e.g., Z-Gly-Leu). CPS1 is synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein precursor (77 kDa and 74 kDa glycoforms) that traffics via the MVB pathway with ubiquitin-dependent sorting (Lys8 ubiquitination by Rsp5). Proteinase B cleaves the precursor to release soluble mature enzyme into the vacuolar lumen. The enzyme uses the characteristic M20 di-zinc catalytic mechanism with five conserved metal-coordinating residues (His-Asp-Glu-Asp/Glu-His). CPS1 contributes ~60% of the enzymatic activity for Cbz-Gly-Leu hydrolysis and is regulated by nitrogen catabolite repression through GATA transcription factors (Gln3p, 
  Gat1p), with expression increasing during nitrogen starvation. Represents ancestral M20 peptidase function, in contrast to the neofunctionalized mammalian homolog PM20D1 which evolved N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase activity.

  findings:
  - statement: CPS1 is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase of the M20 family
    supporting_text: Carboxypeptidase S (CPS1), encoded by the YJL172W locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase belonging to the M20 family of metalloproteases that functions as a critical component of the yeast vacuolar degradation system.
  - statement: CPS1 contributes approximately 60% of enzymatic activity for Cbz-Gly-Leu hydrolysis
    supporting_text: CPS1 exhibits substrate specificity preferentially directed toward peptides with hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids, particularly leucine and glycine residues...ultimately becomes a soluble vacuolar enzyme that contributes approximately 60% of the enzymatic activity required to hydrolyze dipeptide substrates including benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-leucine (Cbz-Gly-Leu).
  - statement: CPS1 preferentially cleaves peptides with glycine in penultimate position
    supporting_text: The enzyme exhibits characteristic specificity that enables it to preferentially cleave peptides in which the penultimate amino acid is glycine or the C-terminal amino acid is leucine, as exemplified by its robust activity toward the synthetic dipeptide Cbz-Gly-Leu.
  - statement: Zinc ion is essential for CPS1 catalytic mechanism
    supporting_text: The zinc ion at the active site of CPS1 serves as the central organizing element of the catalytic mechanism, coordinating substrate molecules and facilitating the nucleophilic attack necessary for peptide bond hydrolysis...The general acid-base catalysis performed by CPS1 depends critically on the zinc ion, as evidenced by the complete loss of enzymatic activity when the metal is chelated or removed.
  - statement: CPS1 is synthesized as type II transmembrane precursor
    supporting_text: CPS1 is synthesized as a ~64 kilodalton precursor (preCPS1) in the endoplasmic reticulum as a type II transmembrane protein with a signal sequence spanning amino acids 20 through 40 that becomes inserted into the ER membrane during translation.
  - statement: CPS1 traffics via MVB pathway with ubiquitin-dependent sorting
    supporting_text: The ubiquitination of CPS1 plays a critical role in directing the enzyme into the MVB pathway, as ubiquitinated cargo is recognized by ESCRT protein Vps27...CPS1 ubiquitination is accomplished through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, which is recruited to CPS1 through adaptor proteins Tul1 and Bsd2.
  - statement: Proteinase A (Pep4p) processes CPS1 precursor in vacuole
    supporting_text: Upon arrival in the vacuolar lumen within the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, the membrane-bound precursor form of CPS1 undergoes proteolytic processing by the vacuolar proteinase A (PrA, also designated Pep4p), a principal vacuolar endoprotease that activates many vacuolar zymogens.

    supporting_text: Two major forms of mature CPS1 are observed in yeast cells, with apparent molecular masses of 74 and 77 kilodaltons, representing CPS1 molecules modified with two or three N-linked glycans respectively.
  - statement: CPS1 expression regulated by nitrogen catabolite repression via GATA factors
    supporting_text: Expression of the CPS1 gene is regulated by nutrient availability, particularly the availability of nitrogen...The molecular mechanisms underlying CPS1 transcriptional regulation involve the binding of transcription factors including nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) factors such as GATA transcription factors to regulatory sequences in the CPS1 promoter.
  - statement: CPS1 participates in autophagy and amino acid recycling
    supporting_text: Carboxypeptidase S participates in the vacuolar degradation pathway called autophagy...During nutrient-limited conditions such as nitrogen starvation, cells activate autophagy to generate a pool of free amino acids through degradation of long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, and other cellular components.
  - statement: Combined loss of PrB, CPY and CPS1 abolishes sporulation
    supporting_text: Genetic studies examining sporulation frequency in mutant strains revealed that disruption of PrB activity produces a partial defect in sporulation, while combined disruption of PrB, CPY, and CPS1 activities completely abolishes sporulation, with cells unable to form functional spores.
  - statement: CPS1 and CPY have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities
    supporting_text: The substrate specificity of CPS1 overlaps partially with that of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), another major vacuolar carboxypeptidase...CPS1 exhibits distinct selectivity from CPY, with CPS1 showing greater preference for peptides containing glycine in the penultimate position, whereas CPY accommodates a broader array of hydrophobic amino acids at this position.
