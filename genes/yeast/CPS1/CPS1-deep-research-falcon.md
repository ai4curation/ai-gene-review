## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P27614
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Carboxypeptidase S; EC=3.4.17.4; AltName: Full=GLY-X carboxypeptidase; AltName: Full=YSCS;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CPS1; Synonyms=CPS; OrderedLocusNames=YJL172W; ORFNames=J0510;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase M20A family. .
- **Key Domains:** ArgE/DapE_CS. (IPR001261); Bact_exopeptidase_dim_dom. (IPR036264); Pept_M20_carboxypep. (IPR017141); Pept_M20A. (IPR047177); Peptidase_M20. (IPR002933)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CPS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CPS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CPS1** (gene ID: CPS1, UniProt: P27614) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Executive summary
CPS1 (YJL172W) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes Carboxypeptidase S (Cps1p), a zinc-dependent metallo-carboxypeptidase of the M20 family that is synthesized as a type-II membrane precursor (pCps1). Its short cytosolic N-terminus is ubiquitinated by the HECT E3 ligase Rsp5, enabling ESCRT-dependent sorting into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and subsequent delivery to the vacuolar lumen, where vacuolar proteases (Prb1/PrA cascade) clip the transmembrane segment to yield soluble, active CPS. Cps1p functions in peptide catabolism (e.g., hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Leu) and supports nitrogen/Leu acquisition. Cps1 is a canonical cargo marker for ESCRT/MVB studies, including recent 2024 work on late endosomes and TORC1 signaling, which quantify endosomal/vacuolar distributions using high-content microscopy. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 2-4, katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 1-2, babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8)

Identity verification and symbol ambiguity
- Correct target: CPS1 here refers to yeast Carboxypeptidase S (Cps1p) encoded by YJL172W (S. cerevisiae S288C). This is distinct from human CPS1 (mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I). Reviews and primary studies consistently treat CPS1/Cps1 in yeast as a vacuolar hydrolase and ESCRT cargo. (Hecht 2014; Hurley & Stenmark 2011) (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Enzyme class: Cps1p is a zinc-dependent metallo-carboxypeptidase in the M20 peptidase family; reviews of the yeast vacuolar protease ensemble annotate CPS1 as a zinc metalloprotease. Annual Review treatments emphasize its biosynthesis as a type-II membrane precursor that becomes a soluble lumenal enzyme after vacuolar clipping. Year/URL: 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023; 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2)
- Topology: Type-II single-pass transmembrane precursor (short cytosolic N-tail; lumenal C-terminus). No evidence for a GPI anchor; instead, the TM is proteolytically removed in the vacuole to generate mature soluble Cps1p. Year/URL: 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5)
- Sorting signal: Monoubiquitination/Ub-dependent signal on the cytosolic tail mediates recognition by ESCRTs; Rsp5 (HECT E3) is required for pCPS ubiquitination and proper MVB sorting. Year/URL: 2004, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473. (katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 1-2)
- Trafficking route: ER → Golgi (TGN) → endosome (ubiquitin-dependent ESCRT sorting into intralumenal vesicles) → vacuolar lumen after MVB–vacuole fusion. Clathrin adaptors (AP‑1, GGAs) participate at TGN. Year/URL: 2018, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1804.07523; 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (feyder2018membranetraffickingin pages 7-9, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 2-4)
- Processing/activation: Vacuolar proteases (Prb1/PrA cascade) clip the TM anchor, producing mature soluble CPS; Pep4 (PrA) activates downstream proteases, linking CPS maturation to Pep4/Prb1 activities. Year/URL: 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6)

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- 2024 mechanistic insights into late endosomes: Füllbrunn et al. (J Cell Biol, 2024; doi:10.1083/jcb.202305038) dissect endosomal maturation and Ypt7 (Rab7) regulation via Gyp7, using fluorescence quantification (n ≥ 100 cells per condition; Fiji-based puncta and intensity ratios). They use canonical cargo assays and define how ESCRT components, TORC1 signaling, and endosome maturation intersect; this framework underpins interpretation of Cps1 cargo behavior in vps/ESCRT contexts. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 14-15)
- 2024 endosomal physiology quantitation: The study quantifies vacuole:PM intensity ratios, puncta counts, and vacuole number distributions with statistics (ANOVA/t-tests), setting current practice for quantifying cargo delivery and endosomal states; while their primary cargo examples include Mup1/Ypt7, their endosomal definitions and ESCRT dependencies apply directly to canonical MVB cargos such as Cps1. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 14-15)
- 2025 extension (very recent): Gao et al. (J Cell Biol, 2025; doi:10.1083/jcb.202410013) explicitly deploy mCherry‑Cps1 to probe ESCRT/MVB sorting, showing lumenal delivery in wild-type and vacuolar membrane/class E accumulation in vps4Δ and other lipid biogenesis mutants, with imaging quantification and endosomal markers. Although 2025, it represents the latest usage of Cps1 as a cargo. URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202410013. (gao2025any1isa pages 7-9)

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Canonical ESCRT cargo marker: GFP/mCherry‑Cps1 is used to assay MVB sorting fidelity. In ESCRT defects (e.g., vps4Δ), Cps1 accumulates on the vacuolar membrane or in class E compartments rather than the lumen; in wild-type, Cps1 becomes lumenal after ILV sorting. Methods include live-cell fluorescence microscopy, FM4‑64/CMAC vacuole staining, immunogold EM, and pulse‑chase immunoprecipitation for processing kinetics. Years/URLs: 2002, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4; 2004, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473; 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038. (babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 3-4, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8)
- Quantitative readouts (2024 practice): Vacuolar vs PM intensity ratios, numbers of endosomal puncta per cell (n ≥ 100 cells, three replicates), and statistical tests are current standards for quantifying cargo sorting and endosome states, and are directly applied to Cps1-based assays in recent literature. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038; 2025, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202410013. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, gao2025any1isa pages 7-9)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- ESCRT and ubiquitin: Authoritative reviews and primary studies from the Emr/Odorizzi/Babst communities established Cps1 as a founding model for ubiquitin-dependent ESCRT sorting; monoubiquitination of pCps1’s cytosolic tail is sufficient for ILV sorting, and mutation or loss of cargo ubiquitination redirects Cps1 to the vacuole limiting membrane. Year/URL: 2002, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4; 2004, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473; 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404. (babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 1-2, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2)
- E3 ligase specificity: Rsp5 is required for pCps1 ubiquitination and sorting; earlier reports considered Tul1/adapter contributions, but definitive genetic/biochemical data from Katzmann et al. show Rsp5 dependence for pCps1, while Tul1 can modify other cargo classes. Year/URL: 2004, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473. (katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 1-2)
- Endosomal maturation and TORC1 context (2024): State‑of‑the‑art JCB work delineates Ypt7-positive late endosomes as sites where ESCRT cargo sorting, lipid composition, and TORC1 signaling are integrated, refining the cellular context in which Cps1 sorting occurs. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 14-15)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Imaging quantitation standards (2024): Füllbrunn et al. quantify cargo/endosome metrics with n ≥ 100 cells per condition across three biological replicates, using Fiji, reporting vacuole:PM intensity ratios and puncta counts with t‑tests/ANOVA (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001), establishing rigorous benchmarks applied to ESCRT cargo, including Cps1. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 14-15)
- Cps1 functional biochemistry: Hecht et al. report that Cps1 contributes to hydrolysis of the synthetic dipeptide Cbz‑Gly‑Leu and is required for growth when this dipeptide is the sole nitrogen/Leu source; two mature species (~74 and 77 kDa) are observed upon vacuolar processing. Year/URL: 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 6-8)

Detailed functional annotation for CPS1 (Cps1p)
- Catalytic properties: Zinc metallo-carboxypeptidase; M20 family membership aligns with a dinuclear metal center catalytic paradigm; reviews explicitly annotate CPS as a zinc metalloprotease within the vacuolar protease set. Year/URL: 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5)
- Substrate specificity and reaction: C‑terminal peptide bond hydrolysis with activity on dipeptides such as Cbz‑Gly‑Leu; overlap with CPY specificity but distinct contributions to peptide catabolism and nitrogen assimilation. Year/URL: 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 6-8)
- Subcellular localization: pCps1 transits ER–Golgi–endosome; ubiquitination at the endosome drives ESCRT-mediated ILV inclusion; after MVB–vacuole fusion, mature CPS is soluble in the vacuolar lumen. Year/URL: 2018, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1804.07523; 2002, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4. (feyder2018membranetraffickingin pages 7-9, babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7)
- Membrane attachment: Not GPI-anchored; synthesized as a type‑II single-pass TM protein. Ubiquitination occurs on the cytosolic N-terminus (e.g., Lys8 site described in reviews), enabling ESCRT recognition. Year/URL: 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5)
- ESCRT/MVB dependence and mutant phenotypes: In vps/ESCRT mutants such as vps4Δ, GFP‑/mCherry‑Cps1 accumulates at the vacuole limiting membrane or at class E compartments, rather than the lumenal puncta/lumen, demonstrating dependence on ESCRT-0/‑I/‑II/‑III cascade and Vps4 ATPase for ILV scission and cargo incorporation. Year/URL: 2002, https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4; 2004, https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473; 2025, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202410013. (babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 3-4, gao2025any1isa pages 7-9)
- Processing and activation: Vacuolar proteases cleave the TM segment to liberate mature CPS; Prb1 (proteinase B) is implicated, with Pep4 (proteinase A) required for activation of Prb1 and other vacuolar proteases, placing CPS maturation downstream of Pep4. Year/URL: 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023. (hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6)
- Pathway context: Cps1p is a biosynthetic MVB cargo and a hallmark reporter for ubiquitin‑dependent ESCRT sorting; its trafficking intersects with endosome maturation and TORC1 signaling as defined in 2024 JCB analyses of Ypt7/Gyp7/Mon1–Ccz1 dynamics. Year/URL: 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038; 2018, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1804.07523. (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, feyder2018membranetraffickingin pages 7-9)

Common pitfalls and clarifications
- CPS1 naming is ambiguous across species; do not confuse yeast CPS1 (Cps1p, carboxypeptidase S) with human CPS1 (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I). Yeast CPS1 is a vacuolar hydrolase and ESCRT cargo; topology and trafficking clearly differ from mammalian mitochondrial enzyme CPS1. Authoritative reviews clarify this distinction. Year/URL: 2014, https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023; 2011, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404. (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2)

Embedded reference summary
| Aspect | Evidence summary | Key recent/foundational sources (year, URL) |
|---|---|---|
| Gene/protein identity & organism | CPS1 (CPS/Cps1p) encodes Carboxypeptidase S in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain S288C/YJL172W); literature consistently treats it as a vacuolar hydrolase distinct from human mitochondrial CPS1 (yeast Cps1) (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2). | Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023; Hurley & Stenmark, 2011 — https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404 |
| Enzyme class & metal dependence | Annotated as a metallo-carboxypeptidase (M20-family/M20A-like) and described as zinc-dependent in reviews of vacuolar proteases (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5). | Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023; MEROPS/UniProt annotations (see UniProt P27614) |
| Substrate specificity/biochemical activity | Experimental evidence: Cps1 contributes to hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Leu and related peptides (shows carboxypeptidase activity with preference consistent with Gly/Leu at P1); biochemical assays and genetic growth tests support role in peptide catabolism (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 6-8, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6). | Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023; enzymology studies summarized in protease reviews |
| Topology & membrane association (type-II vs GPI) | Synthesized as a type II (single-pass) transmembrane precursor (pCps) with a short cytosolic N-tail; not a GPI-anchored luminal protein. The TM anchor is proteolytically removed to yield soluble mature lumenal enzyme (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 4-5, hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2). | Hurley & Stenmark, 2011 — https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023 |
| Ubiquitination & E3(s) | Sorting requires ubiquitination of the short cytosolic tail; Rsp5 (HECT ligase) is required for pCps ubiquitination and correct MVB sorting (earlier work assessed Tul1 but Katzmann et al. demonstrated Rsp5 requirement) (katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 2-4). | Katzmann et al., 2004 — https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473; Hettema et al., 2004 (adaptors/Tul1/Bsd2) |
| ESCRT/MVB dependence & vps mutant phenotypes | Cps1 is a canonical ubiquitin-dependent MVB cargo: in ESCRT or vps (e.g., vps4) mutants GFP-/mCherry-Cps1 accumulates on vacuolar limiting membrane or at class E compartments instead of vacuolar lumen; used historically to define MVB defects (babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 3-4, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8). | Babst et al., 2002 — https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4; Katzmann et al., 2004 — https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473 |
| Subcellular localization & delivery route | Biosynthetic route: ER → Golgi (TGN) → endosome → sorted into intralumenal vesicles by ESCRT → delivered to vacuolar lumen upon MVB–vacuole fusion; vesicle packaging involves clathrin/AP-1/GGA adaptors (feyder2018membranetraffickingin pages 4-7, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 2-4). | Feyder et al., 2018 (review) — https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1804.07523; Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023 |
| Vacuolar processing/activation (Pep4/Prb1) | pCps is proteolytically clipped in the vacuole to a mature soluble form by vacuolar proteases (PrB/PrA cascade); maturation is linked to Pep4 (PrA) and Prb1 activities that activate downstream clipping (hurley2011molecularmechanismsof pages 1-2, hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 5-6). | Hurley & Stenmark, 2011 — https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155404; Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023 |
| Physiological roles (peptide/nitrogen utilization, sporulation) | Functional assays show Cps1 contributes to hydrolysis of dipeptides (e.g., Cbz-Gly-Leu), supports growth when specific dipeptides are sole nitrogen/Leu source, and affects sporulation efficiency — consistent with role in peptide catabolism and nutrient acquisition (hecht2014theproteolyticlandscape pages 6-8). | Hecht et al., 2014 — https://doi.org/10.4161/cl.28023 |
| Use as model cargo/marker and quantitation methods (esp. 2023–2024) | GFP-/mCherry-Cps1 is widely used as an MVB cargo marker; assays include fluorescence microscopy (vacuole lumen vs membrane), FM4-64 vacuolar staining, pulse-chase/IP for processing, ubiquitin blots, and quantitation of vacuole/plasma or puncta intensity (methods used in 2002–2024 studies and in Fullbrunn 2024/JCB and Gao 2025) (katzmann2004multivesicularbodysorting pages 3-4, babst2002escrtiiianendosomeassociated pages 6-7, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, gao2025any1isa pages 7-9). | Katzmann et al., 2004 — https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e03-07-0473; Babst et al., 2002 — https://doi.org/10.1016/S1534-5807(02)00220-4; Füllbrunn et al., 2024 (JCB) — https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038; Gao et al., 2025 — https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202410013 |
| Notable modern insights linking endosome maturation/TORC1 (2024) | Recent work links Cps1 trafficking and ESCRT/MVB dynamics to endosome maturation, Ypt7 cycling, and TORC1 signaling; perturbations (e.g., Gyp7/Mon1–Ccz1 manipulations, vps mutants) alter Cps1 distribution and reveal signaling/biogenesis coupling (fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 6-8, fullbrunn2024thegtpaseactivating pages 14-15, gao2025any1isa pages 7-9). | Füllbrunn et al., 2024 (JCB) — https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202305038; Gao et al., 2025 — https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202410013 |

Conclusions
CPS1 encodes the vacuolar metallo-carboxypeptidase Cps1p, a type-II transmembrane precursor that undergoes Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination and ESCRT-mediated sorting into MVB intralumenal vesicles, followed by Pep4/Prb1-dependent processing in the vacuole to a soluble enzyme. Its enzymology (zinc dependence; activity on dipeptides such as Cbz‑Gly‑Leu) underpins roles in peptide catabolism and nitrogen use. Cps1 remains a gold-standard cargo marker for dissecting ESCRT/MVB function, now contextualized by 2024 insights into late endosome maturation and TORC1 signaling with rigorous quantitative imaging approaches.
