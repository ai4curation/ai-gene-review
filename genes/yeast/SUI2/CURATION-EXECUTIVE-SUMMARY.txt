SUI2 (eIF2α) GO ANNOTATION CURATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

GENE: SUI2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha)
ORGANISM: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
UNIPROT: P20459
TOTAL ANNOTATIONS REVIEWED: 59

CURATION OUTCOMES
================================================================================

ACCEPT:                      23 annotations (39%)
  - Core mechanistic functions representing eIF2α's essential roles
  - All molecular function terms capturing mechanism
  - Complex membership and localization
  - Multiple evidence types strengthening confidence

KEEP_AS_NON_CORE:             2 annotations (3%)
  - GO:0006412 (translation) - too broad, only initiation relevant
  - GO:0010494 (stress granule) - secondary consequence of function, not primary

MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED:      11 annotations (19%)
  - All GO:0005515 (protein binding) annotations
  - Generic protein binding uninformative per GO guidelines
  - Specific interactions better captured through complex membership

REMOVE:                       2 annotations (3%)
  - GO:0003676 (nucleic acid binding) - misleading, conflates domains with function
  - GO:0003723 (RNA binding) - too generic, specific tRNA binding already annotated

MODIFY:                       1 annotation (2%)
  - GO:0043022 (ribosome binding) - too generic, propose replacement with
    specific interaction terms (translation initiation factor activity or
    methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding)

================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. MECHANISTIC ACCURACY: The review prioritized mechanistically accurate terms
   over generic protein-protein interaction annotations. Generic "protein binding"
   terms provide no functional insight compared to specific complex membership
   (eIF2 complex) or substrate binding (methionyl-initiator tRNA).

2. EVIDENCE QUALITY: Strong experimental evidence base with 13 IDA (direct
   experimental assay) annotations demonstrating extensive biochemical
   characterization of eIF2α in translation initiation systems.

3. CORE FUNCTIONAL TRIAD:
   - GO:0003743 - translation initiation factor activity (catalytic function)
   - GO:1990856 - methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding (ligand specificity)
   - GO:0005525 - GTP binding (nucleotide switch for regulation)

4. COMPLEX MEMBERSHIP: Multiple strong annotations for eIF2 complex (GO:0005850)
   with converging evidence (IBA, IPI, IMP) from phylogenetics, biochemistry, and
   genetics. Also part of multifactor complex (GO:0043614) with eIF1, eIF3, eIF5.

5. PREINITIATION INTERMEDIATES: Well-annotated for participation in:
   - 48S preinitiation complex (GO:0033290)
   - Multifactor complex (GO:0043614)
   - Formation of translation preinitiation complex (GO:0001731)

================================================================================

CURATION RATIONALE
================================================================================

REMOVED ANNOTATIONS:
  Nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676) and RNA binding (GO:0003723) were removed
  because they mischaracterize eIF2α's mechanism. The presence of RNA-binding
  domains (detected by InterPro) does not make eIF2α a general nucleic acid
  binding protein. eIF2α specifically binds a single tRNA substrate through
  GTP-dependent recognition of specific identity elements. Generic "RNA binding"
  inappropriately groups eIF2α with proteins having different binding specificity.
  The specific interaction is already captured by "methionyl-initiator methionine
  tRNA binding" (GO:1990856).

MARKED AS OVER-ANNOTATED:
  All 11 "protein binding" annotations (GO:0005515) from proteome-wide
  interaction studies are generic and uninformative. eIF2α's specific
  interactions are:
  - Heterotrimer assembly (SUI3 beta, GCD1 gamma subunits)
  - CDC123 assembly factor interaction
  - eIF2B GEF interaction
  - Multifactor complex components (eIF1, eIF3, eIF5)

  These interactions are better described by:
  - Complex membership: "eIF2 complex" (GO:0005850)
  - Functional roles: "translation initiation factor activity" (GO:0003743)
  - Substrate binding: "methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding" (GO:1990856)

  Generic "protein binding" provides no mechanistic insight per GO guidelines.

MODIFIED ANNOTATION:
  "Ribosome binding" (GO:0043022) was marked for replacement because eIF2α does
  not directly bind ribosomes in isolation. The interaction is:
  1. GTP-dependent
  2. Mediated through methionyl-tRNA substrate
  3. Part of complex assembly (43S/48S preinitiation complex)

  More specific terms better capture this mechanism:
  - "translation initiation factor activity" (GO:0003743) - already annotated
  - "methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding" (GO:1990856) - already annotated

================================================================================

CORE ANNOTATION SET (NON-REDUNDANT)
================================================================================

The following 9 annotations represent the essential, mechanistically accurate set:

MOLECULAR FUNCTION (3 terms):
1. GO:0003743 - translation initiation factor activity (multiple evidence: IBA, IEA, IDA)
2. GO:1990856 - methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding (IDA)
3. GO:0005525 - GTP binding (IDA from 2 studies)

BIOLOGICAL PROCESS (2 terms):
4. GO:0006413 - translational initiation (IBA, IEA, IDA)
5. GO:0001731 - formation of translation preinitiation complex (IDA)

CELLULAR COMPONENT (4 terms):
6. GO:0005850 - eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 complex (IBA, IPI, IMP)
7. GO:0043614 - multi-eIF complex (IDA from 2 studies)

Note: GO:0005840 (ribosome) and GO:0005737 (cytoplasm) provide additional
cellular context as appropriate supporting annotations.

================================================================================

QUALITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
1. Extensive biochemical characterization from yeast translation initiation field
2. Multiple evidence types converging on same core annotations
3. Well-supported with foundational papers (original SUI2 discovery, reconstituted
   systems, mechanistic biochemistry)
4. Appropriate specificity at molecular mechanism level

REMAINING GAPS:
1. Could benefit from GO-CAM representation to capture eIF2 kinase phosphorylation
   cascade during stress (GCN2, HRI, PKR phosphorylation sites)
2. Could enhance with specific interaction terms for subunit composition if such
   terms existed in GO
3. Stress response regulatory role could be more explicitly annotated if
   appropriate biological process terms existed

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Prioritize the core 9-term set for essential function representation
2. Consider GO-CAM representation for stress response regulatory network
3. Use "MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED" as guidance for future curation - remove generic
   protein binding annotations in other genes
4. Model annotation specificity for other translation initiation factors

- Remove GO:0003723 (RNA binding)
- Modify or remove GO:0043022 (ribosome binding)

These curation decisions align with current GO best practices emphasizing
mechanistic specificity over generic protein-protein interaction terms.
