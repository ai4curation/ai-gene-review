description: |
  SUI2 encodes eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha), the alpha
  subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF2 complex. eIF2α is a GTPase that plays a central role
  in translation initiation by delivering the formyl-methionyl-tRNA to the 40S ribosomal
  subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. The ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) binds to
  the 40S ribosome with initiator tRNA and recruits mRNA for start codon selection. Upon
  cognate codon recognition, GTP hydrolysis triggers release of the eIF2-GDP binary
  complex, which is recycled by the GEF eIF2B. eIF2α is phosphorylated at Ser-52 by
  multiple kinases (GCN2, HRI, PKR) during stress to attenuate global translation while
  maintaining GCN4 expression, making it a critical node in integrated stress responses.

  review:
    summary: eIF2α is the catalytic subunit of the eIF2 GTPase complex that delivers initiator tRNA to the ribosome. This molecular function term accurately captures its primary role in translation initiation. IBA evidence through phylogenetic comparison is appropriate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: eIF2α is fundamentally a translation initiation factor with GTPase activity. Its core function is delivering formyl-Met-tRNAi to the 40S ribosome as part of the ternary complex. This is more specific and informative than generic protein binding terms and represents a core function of the protein.

    summary: eIF2α is absolutely required for the initiation phase of translation, functioning as the central GTPase that coordinates ternary complex delivery and start codon recognition. This biological process annotation is appropriate and represents a core function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: eIF2α is essential for translation initiation as it is the catalytic component of the eIF2 complex responsible for the GTP-dependent delivery of initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosome.

  review:
    summary: eIF2α delivers initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit as part of the ternary complex, but the molecular function is better described as translation initiation factor activity which is more specific. Ribosome binding is present but is a consequence of its role in ternary complex delivery.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: |
      Ribosome binding is overly generic and does not capture the specific mechanism by which eIF2α interacts with ribosomes. eIF2α does not directly bind the ribosome in isolation - it delivers initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit as a GTP-dependent, ternary complex-mediated interaction. A more mechanistically accurate term would be formyl-Met-tRNA delivery or the existing translation initiation factor activity (GO:0003743) which is already annotated and more specific. The generic ribosome binding conflates this with other ribosomal interactions that may occur through different mechanisms.

  review:
    summary: eIF2α contains RNA-binding domains but does not directly bind nucleic acid. The binding interaction is mediated entirely through the methionyl-tRNA substrate. This IEA annotation appears to be a computational inference from InterPro domains that are present but functionally contribute to tRNA binding, not nucleic acid binding per se.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: eIF2α does not function as a nucleic acid-binding protein in the traditional sense. The RNA-binding domains identified by InterPro are structural components that facilitate methionyl-tRNA recognition, not general nucleic acid binding. eIF2α specifically recognizes and binds the methionyl-tRNA through protein-RNA interactions, but this is better captured by the term "methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding" (GO:1990856), not the generic nucleic acid binding. Including this term conflates structural domains with functional role and is misleading about eIF2α's mechanism of action.

  review:
    summary: eIF2α binds methionyl-initiator tRNA through specific protein-RNA interactions, but generic RNA binding is overly broad and misleading. The binding is strictly limited to formyl-Met-tRNAi and involves specific recognition of the methionine moiety and acceptor stem identity elements.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: While eIF2α does interact with RNA (methionyl-tRNA), the term "RNA binding" is problematic because it suggests broad RNA-binding capability or nonspecific RNA interactions. eIF2α specifically recognizes only the initiator methionyl-tRNA through GTP-dependent binding that is disrupted upon GTP hydrolysis. This specific tRNA-recognition function is far better represented by the existing annotation "methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA binding" (GO:1990856). Generic "RNA binding" inappropriately groups this with proteins that have different binding specificity and mechanisms.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

  review:
    summary: eIF2α is a component of cytoplasmic stress granules, which form when translation is attenuated during stress. The evidence from HDA (homology-derived annotation) suggests stress granule localization may be conserved. However, more mechanistically, eIF2α is involved in translational control OF stress responses, not localization to stress granules itself.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: eIF2α is phosphorylated during stress and this phosphorylation triggers translational attenuation and GCN4 upregulation. The association with stress granules is a secondary consequence of translational shutdown, not a primary function. The core function is "translation control in response to stress" rather than stress granule localization. This annotation can be retained as contextual but is not a core function of the protein. HDA evidence quality is lower than IDA/IBA.

    summary: Direct experimental evidence from thermodynamic characterization of eIF2 shows GTP-dependent binding interactions with methionyl-tRNA. GTP binding is the nucleotide-binding function but represents a mechanism for methionyl-tRNA recognition rather than a general GTPase activity. The relation between GTP binding and methionine moiety recognition is mechanistically key.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: eIF2α is a GTPase that binds GTP and hydrolyzes it during the translation initiation cycle. The GTP binding is mechanistically important because GTP binding creates a conformational state that specifically recognizes the methionine moiety on initiator tRNA. This is not generic GTP binding but GTP-regulated methionyl-tRNA recognition. The term "GTP binding" is appropriate for this molecular interaction.

    reason: Multiple IDA annotations of GTP binding from different mechanistic studies strengthen evidence.

  review:
    summary: Cytosol localization from Reactome curated pathway for GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF2α. TAS (Traced to Authoritative Source) indicates this comes from a high-quality curated database. This duplicates the IEA cytosol annotation already provided.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Multiple evidence types (IEA, TAS) for cytosol localization strengthen the annotation. The Reactome reference provides expert curation. eIF2α is a cytosolic protein essential for cytoplasmic translation initiation.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasm localization from yeast proteome subcellular localization study. Cytoplasm is a broader term than cytosol, referring to all non-nuclear cytoplasmic compartments. eIF2α is specifically a cytosolic protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While cytosol (GO:0005829) is more specific and already annotated, cytoplasm (GO:0005737) is broader and includes both cytosol and other cytoplasmic compartments. For a cytosolic translation factor, cytoplasm annotation is acceptable as non-redundant context, indicating eIF2α is found in the cytoplasmic compartment. HDA evidence is reasonable for established localization.

  review:
    summary: This is a duplicate of the IBA annotation for 48S preinitiation complex. IDA evidence from coupled release studies of translation factors confirms eIF2 association with the 48S complex during initiation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Multiple evidence types (IBA, IDA) for 48S preinitiation complex membership strengthen the annotation. The IDA evidence from studies of eIF5B and eIF1A release demonstrates eIF2 is part of the functional 48S complex. This is a core structural annotation.

  review:
    summary: Direct experimental evidence from reconstituted yeast translation initiation system showing eIF2α is required for 43S complex formation. This biological process term describes eIF2α's mechanistic role in complex assembly.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: eIF2α is absolutely essential for formation of the 43S preinitiation complex because it delivers the initiator tRNA that is the core cargo. The paper demonstrates reconstituted system dependence on eIF2 for complex assembly. This is a core process annotation showing eIF2α's mechanistic role.

  review:
    summary: eIF2α is part of the multifactor complex (MFC) containing eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF5, and initiator tRNA. This IDA evidence from yeast translational control studies confirms eIF2 association with other initiation factors in higher-order complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: eIF2α is a structural and functional component of the multifactor complex that forms during translation initiation. This is documented in early yeast in vitro studies. The MFC is a physiologically important intermediate in initiation. This represents core complex membership.

  original_reference_id: PMID:2649894
  review:
    summary: This is a duplicate of the IBA and IPI annotations for eIF2 complex. The landmark paper identifying SUI2 as eIF2α provides foundational IMP (Inferred from Mutant Phenotype) evidence. Suppressor mutations in sui2 that suppress initiator codon mutations demonstrate eIF2α's essential role in initiation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Multiple evidence types (IBA, IPI, IMP) for eIF2 complex membership provide comprehensive evidence. The original discovery paper uses mutant suppression analysis to establish SUI2 as the eIF2α gene, providing biological evidence of function. All three evidence types confirm this core annotation.

      eIF2α is the catalytic subunit of the eIF2 GTPase complex that delivers formyl-Met-tRNAi
      to the 40S ribosomal subunit in a GTP-dependent manner. The conformational state imposed
      by GTP binding creates a recognition pocket for the methionine moiety of initiator tRNA,
      enabling specific discrimination from elongator methionine tRNA. Upon recognition of the
      cognate AUG start codon, GTP hydrolysis and phosphate release trigger release of the
      eIF2-GDP binary complex, which must be recycled by eIF2B to regenerate eIF2-GTP.

    description: |
      eIF2α is the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF2 complex (alpha/beta/gamma subunits)
      that forms the molecular switch for translation control. eIF2α interactions with the beta
      subunit (SUI3) and gamma subunit (GCD1/GCD2) are essential for complex stability and
      function. Assembly is facilitated by the chaperone-like factor CDC123. eIF2α is a target
      for phosphorylation at Ser-52 by the kinases GCN2, HRI, and PKR during stress conditions,
      which inhibits the GEF activity of eIF2B and attenuates global translation while
      maintaining selective translation of stress response genes like GCN4.
