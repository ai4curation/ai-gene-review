description: 'ASF1 (Anti-Silencing Function protein 1) is a highly conserved histone
  chaperone

  that plays central roles in nucleosome assembly and disassembly. It specifically

  binds H3-H4 histone dimers and serves as a hub protein mediating interactions

  with chromatin assembly factors (CAF-1, HIRA), histone-modifying enzymes (Rtt109),

  and checkpoint kinases (Rad53). ASF1 functions in both replication-coupled chromatin

  assembly (with CAF-1) and transcription-coupled nucleosome recycling (with FACT/HIRA),

  ensuring histone H3 K56 acetylation and coordinate regulation of histone supply

  during DNA replication and transcription.

      a more specific function term describing the type of binding (histone binding,

      molecular function of ASF1.
core_functions:
- description: Histone chaperone protein that binds H3-H4 dimers and mediates their transfer
    to DNA at replication forks and during transcriptional nucleosome recycling. ASF1
    functions as a hub protein coordinating interactions with CAF-1 (replication-coupled
    assembly), HIRA (transcription-coupled assembly), Rtt109 acetyltransferase, and
    Rad53 checkpoint kinase. Core roles include DNA replication-coupled chromatin assembly,
    transcription-coupled nucleosome recycling, H3 K56 acetylation regulation, and checkpoint
    recovery.
