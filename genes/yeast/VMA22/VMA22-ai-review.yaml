    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'VMA22 is a dedicated assembly factor for the V-ATPase, not a general chaperone. GO:0051082 overstates the binding as a standalone function.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: VMA22 functions as a dedicated ER-resident assembly factor for the vacuolar H+-ATPase V0 sector, not as a general unfolded protein binding chaperone. The binding interaction is specific to V-ATPase assembly and is better captured by the assembly process annotation (GO:0070072).
