- term:
    id: GO:0005783
    label: endoplasmic reticulum
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: endoplasmic reticulum is consistent with known biology of NSG2.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Retained as supported or plausible for this gene and evidence context.

    label: sterol biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: sterol biosynthetic process is consistent with known biology of NSG2.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Retained as supported or plausible for this gene and evidence context.
- term:
    id: GO:0005789
    label: endoplasmic reticulum membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: endoplasmic reticulum membrane is consistent with known biology of NSG2.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Retained as supported or plausible for this gene and evidence context.
- term:
    id: GO:0071561
    label: nucleus-vacuole junction
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:41132095
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: nucleus-vacuole junction may be context-dependent or peripheral for NSG2.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Kept as non-core to preserve potentially valid context-specific annotation without elevating it to core function.
- term:
    id: GO:0005783
    label: endoplasmic reticulum
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:26928762

    label: sterol biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IGI
  original_reference_id: PMID:16270032
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: sterol biosynthetic process is consistent with known biology of NSG2.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Retained as supported or plausible for this gene and evidence context.
- term:
    id: GO:0051082
    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:16270032
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: unfolded protein binding is too generic or over-extended for NSG2.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Marked over-annotated because more specific terms capture the biology more accurately.
