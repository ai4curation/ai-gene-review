  SWI3 is a core structural and regulatory subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Unlike the catalytic ATPase subunits (SWI1/SWI2), SWI3 functions as a scaffold that organizes other subunits, stabilizes complex assembly, and regulates targeting to chromatin. SWI3 contains SWIRM, SANT, and leucine zipper domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. It is essential for SWI/SNF complex formation and plays regulatory roles in transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling, cell wall stress responses, and oxygen-dependent gene regulation.

    review:
      summary: SWI3 is a core component of the SWI/SNF complex, which activates 
        transcription through ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling. The complex 
        is recruited to promoters by transcription factors and remodels 
        nucleosomes to facilitate transcription factor binding and RNA 
        polymerase II recruitment. IBA evidence is appropriate as this function 
        is conserved across eukaryotes. This is a primary function of SWI3.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: SWI3 function as part of the SWI/SNF complex in positive 
        transcriptional regulation is extensively documented and represents a 
        core function. The complex is required for transcriptional activation of
        approximately 5% of yeast genes. This is supported by conservation 
        across organisms (mammalian BAF155/170, plant ATSWI3 orthologs).

    review:
      summary: SWI3 is a structural component and core subunit of the SWI/SNF 
        complex. The complex is composed of 11 subunits including SWI3, which 
        exists as a homodimer and mediates interactions with multiple other 
        subunits through its SWIRM and SANT domains. SWI3 is essential for 
        complex assembly and stability.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation represents a primary and core function - SWI3 is 
        literally a component of the SWI/SNF complex. Genetic evidence shows 
        that deletion of SWI3 abolishes functional complex formation. UniProt 
        explicitly identifies SWI3 as a component of the 1.14 MDa SWI/SNF 
        complex with specific stoichiometry (2 copies of SWI3 per complex).

    review:
      summary: SWI3 physically interacts with histone H3 and H4 tails, as 
        demonstrated by crosslinking studies showing that H3 acetylation alters 
        SWI3 crosslinking patterns at histone tails. This binding is part of the
        complex's nucleosome engagement mechanism, though SWI3 is not the 
        primary histone-binding component.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: SWI3 demonstrates histone binding capability through biochemical 
        evidence. Acetylated H3 tails alter crosslinking of SWI3 to histone 
        residues, indicating specific interactions. This binding is functional 
        for nucleosome recognition and remodeling. However, this is less central
        than complex membership or transcriptional roles.

    review:
      summary: SWI3 contains the SWIRM domain which has structural homology to 
        DNA-binding domains and was initially hypothesized to bind DNA. However,
        biochemical evidence shows SWI3 does not directly bind DNA; instead, it 
        binds through protein-protein interactions with other subunits. The 
        SWIRM domain functions primarily in protein-protein interactions within 
        the complex, not DNA binding.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: While SWI3 contains a SWIRM domain with structural homology to 
        DNA-binding domains, extensive structural and biochemical evidence 
        demonstrates that SWI3 does not directly bind DNA. The SWIRM domain 
        mutations that affect catalytic activity actually disrupt complex 
        assembly and nucleosome remodeling activity, not direct DNA binding. 
        SWI3 contributes to chromatin remodeling through complex assembly and 
        regulation, not through direct DNA contacts. The IEA annotation appears 
        to be based on domain architecture rather than functional evidence.

    review:
      summary: SWI3 localizes to the nucleus as part of the SWI/SNF complex. 
        However, under hypoxia, SWI3 undergoes rapid relocalization to the 
        cytosol, suggesting oxygen-dependent regulation of subcellular 
        localization. This is a well-established localization pattern.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: Nuclear localization is accurate but represents a cellular 
        location characteristic rather than a functional property. While SWI3 
        typically resides in the nucleus, this is secondary to its functional 
        roles. Importantly, SWI3 localization is dynamically regulated - it 
        relocates to the cytosol during hypoxia, indicating this is not a static
        feature.

      summary: SWI3 regulates transcription through multiple mechanisms

        This is the primary functional role of SWI3.
      action: ACCEPT

        cycle-dependent transcription (HO gene), cell wall stress responses, and

      summary: SWI3 is located in chromatin as part of the SWI/SNF complex that 
        remodels chromatin structure. This represents the cellular location 
        where SWI3 exerts its function.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: Localization to chromatin is accurate and represents the 
        functional location where SWI3 operates. However, this is a localization
        annotation rather than a functional annotation. The core function is 
        chromatin remodeling, not localization to chromatin.
