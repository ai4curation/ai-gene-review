description: >-
  SSA1 encodes the major constitutively expressed cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperone in S. cerevisiae
  (one of four SSA family members: SSA1-4). SSA1 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that
  functions as a foldase/holdase, assisting de novo protein folding, protein refolding after
  stress, protein translocation across ER and mitochondrial membranes, clathrin coat disassembly,
  nuclear import, tRNA import into the nucleus, and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. SSA1
  cooperates with J-domain co-chaperones (Ydj1, Sis1) that stimulate its ATPase activity and
  target it to substrates, and with nucleotide exchange factors (Sse1/Sse2, Fes1) that promote
  ADP release. In collaboration with Hsp104 and Hsp40, SSA1 participates in the disaggregation
  and reactivation of aggregated proteins. SSA1 is highly abundant (approximately 269,000
  molecules/cell) and is present in the cytoplasm, cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, cell wall,
  and vacuole membrane. It is a pleiotropic chaperone involved in numerous protein quality
  control pathways.

    description: >-
      SSA1 is the major cytoplasmic Hsp70 in S. cerevisiae, functioning as an ATP-dependent
      protein folding chaperone. It binds unfolded/misfolded proteins and uses ATP hydrolysis
      cycles to assist their folding, in cooperation with J-domain co-chaperones (Ydj1, Sis1)
      and nucleotide exchange factors (Sse1, Fes1). SSA1 assists both de novo protein folding
      (PMID:9789005) and refolding of denatured proteins (PMID:8947547, PMID:18706386). It also
      has intrinsic ATPase activity (GO:0016887) stimulated by co-chaperones and substrates
      (PMID:7737974). In collaboration with Hsp104 and Hsp40, it participates in disaggregation
      and refolding of aggregated proteins (PMID:9674429). As a heat shock protein, SSA1 is
      central to the cellular response to heat stress (PMID:24291094).
