description: >-
  HSP26 is the sole small heat shock protein (sHSP) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, belonging to the
  conserved HSP20/alpha-crystallin superfamily. It functions as a temperature-regulated molecular
  chaperone with holdase activity: at heat shock temperatures, the 24-mer oligomeric storage complex
  dissociates, and the resulting smaller species bind non-native proteins to prevent their irreversible
  aggregation (PMID:10581247). This holdase activity is ATP-independent and mechanistically distinct
  from foldase chaperones (e.g., HSP70, GroEL). HSP26 does not actively refold substrates or escort
  them between compartments; rather, it maintains client proteins in a soluble, folding-competent state
  in situ until ATP-dependent chaperones (HSP70/HSP104) can mediate refolding. HSP26 forms large
  oligomeric complexes (>500 kD) and is induced by heat shock and other stress conditions. Its
  intracellular localization (cytoplasm vs. nucleus) varies with the metabolic state of the cell
  (PMID:2645298). HSP26 also localizes to stress granules during severe heat stress (PMID:24291094).
  Unexpectedly, Hsp26 was identified as a novel RNA-binding protein that co-purifies with a small set
  of specific mRNAs (PMID:20844764), though this activity is likely moonlighting rather than a core
  function.

    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning models mapping HSP26 to protein folding. HSP26 is an
      sHSP holdase that prevents aggregation of unfolded proteins but does not actively assist protein
      folding (refolding requires the HSP70/HSP104 disaggregase system). The term "protein folding"
      (GO:0006457) implies active assistance in acquiring correct tertiary structure, which does not
      match HSP26 holdase mechanism. However, this IEA is broader than the IDA annotation for the same
      term (see below), and both share the same concern.

    reason: >-
      HSP26 is a holdase, not a foldase. It prevents aggregation of non-native proteins but does not
      actively catalyze protein folding. The GO:0006457 definition states "assisting in the covalent
      and noncovalent assembly of single chain polypeptides or multisubunit complexes into the correct
      tertiary structure," which better describes ATP-dependent foldase chaperones like GroEL/ES or
      HSP70. HSP26 maintains substrates in a folding-competent state for later refolding by other
      chaperones. The IEA mapping is too generous here. A more appropriate BP annotation would be to a
      process term reflecting prevention of protein aggregation under stress.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    HSP26 is an ATP-independent holdase chaperone that binds unfolded/misfolded proteins to prevent
    their irreversible aggregation. At heat shock temperatures, the 24-mer storage complex
    dissociates into active species that bind non-native proteins with 1:2 substrate:Hsp26
    stoichiometry. This is the core molecular function of HSP26. GO:0051082 is used as interim until
    a holdase NTR is created; GO:0140309 does not fit (carrier-specific). GO:0044183 does not fit
    (HSP26 does not actively refold).

    HSP26 forms large homo-oligomeric 24-mer complexes with tetrahedral symmetry. Self-association
    is essential for its chaperone function: the 24-mer serves as a storage/inactive form, and

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: holdase chaperone activity
  proposed_definition: >-
    Binding to an unfolded or misfolded protein to prevent its aggregation without actively
    catalyzing refolding. The holdase maintains the client protein in a soluble, folding-competent
    state. This is mechanistically distinct from foldase activity (GO:0044183) and from carrier-
    holdase activity (GO:0140309).
  justification: >-
    HSP26 and other sHSPs (CRYAA, CRYAB, HSPB6 in human) are canonical in-situ holdases that
    cannot be properly annotated with existing GO terms. GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion,
    GO:0044183 implies active refolding, and GO:0140309 is carrier-specific. See UPB project and
    go-ontology#30552.

suggested_questions:
- question: What are the specific substrate proteins that HSP26 binds during heat shock in vivo?
- question: Does HSP26 mRNA binding activity (PMID:20844764) have a physiological role, or is it an artifact of the broad substrate-binding properties of chaperones?
- question: How does HSP26 holdase activity coordinate with HSP104 disaggregase and HSP70 foldase during stress recovery?
- question: Is the temperature-dependent oligomer dissociation mechanism conserved across yeast sHSPs (e.g., Hsp42)?
