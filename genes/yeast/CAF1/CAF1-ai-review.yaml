description: CAF1 (POP2) encodes a CCR4-associated deadenylase subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex. Pop2p
  has intrinsic poly(A)-specific 3'-5' ribonuclease activity and works with Ccr4p to shorten mRNA poly(A)
  tails, promoting deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. The complex is largely cytoplasmic, concentrates
  in P-bodies, and also contributes to transcription elongation regulation.

  review:
    summary: Pop2p localizes to P-bodies, consistent with its role in mRNA decay pathways.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Reduced P-body accumulation of Pop2p is observed when Q/N-rich regions are deleted, supporting
      P-body localization.
