description: >-
  HSP60 is a mitochondrial group I chaperonin (GroEL homolog) that forms a
  tetradecameric double-ring complex in the mitochondrial matrix. It is an
  essential ATP-dependent protein folding machine that assists the folding
  of newly imported proteins after they are translocated into the
  mitochondrial matrix. HSP60 binds unfolded or partially folded polypeptides
  inside its central cavity and, in cooperation with its co-chaperonin HSP10,
  mediates ATP-dependent folding. HSP60 also protects pre-existing proteins
  against heat denaturation by binding them during thermal stress and mediating
  their refolding. Additionally, HSP60 plays roles in mtDNA maintenance as a
  component of mitochondrial nucleoids, where it binds single-stranded DNA
  and replication origins. HSP60 is required for its own assembly, as newly
  imported monomers require pre-existing functional HSP60 complex for oligomerization.

    summary: Phylogenetic inference is well supported. HSP60 is a group I chaperonin whose primary function is protein folding in the mitochondrial matrix. PMID:2645524 showed HSP60 is essential for assembly of imported proteins, and PMID:1978929 demonstrated it is required for its own de novo folding.

    label: mitochondrial inner membrane
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: HSP60 is primarily a soluble matrix protein. There is some association with the inner membrane, possibly through its role in the TIM23-PAM import machinery, but the primary active location is the mitochondrial matrix. This IBA annotation is acceptable as HSP60 may be active at the inner membrane during protein import.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: HSP60 is primarily a matrix protein; inner membrane association is secondary to its import-related functions.

    reason: HSP60 is not a resident IMS protein.

    label: cytosol
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: Reactome:R-SCE-1252255
  review:
    summary: Reactome annotation. HSP60 is synthesized in the cytosol but is rapidly imported into mitochondria. The cytosol is not where HSP60 functions.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: HSP60 functions in the mitochondrial matrix, not the cytosol. Cytosolic presence is only transient during import.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    Mitochondrial group I chaperonin (GroEL homolog) that forms a tetradecameric
    double-ring complex. Uses ATP hydrolysis to drive the folding of newly imported
    and heat-denatured proteins within its central cavity. Cooperates with the
    co-chaperonin HSP10 (GroES homolog), which caps the folding chamber and
    modulates ATPase activity. Essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and protein
    homeostasis.
