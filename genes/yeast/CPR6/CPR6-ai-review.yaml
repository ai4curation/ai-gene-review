description: >-
  CPR6 is one of two CyP-40-like cyclophilin immunophilins in S. cerevisiae (the other being CPR7).
  It is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase, EC 5.2.1.8) that functions as an Hsp90
  co-chaperone. CPR6 contains an N-terminal cyclophilin PPIase domain and a C-terminal TPR
  (tetratricopeptide repeat) domain that mediates binding to Hsp90 (HSP82/HSC82). It catalyzes the
  cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and contributes to
  protein refolding. CPR6 binds cyclosporin A. Unlike CPR7, CPR6 is not essential for normal growth.
  CPR6 interacts with Hsp90 and also associates with ribosomes.

    summary: >-
      CPR6 is a cyclophilin with well-established PPIase activity. IBA annotation is correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      PPIase activity is the core molecular function of CPR6. UniProt describes it as catalyzing
      cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds (EC 5.2.1.8). IDA evidence from
      PMID:10942767 and PMID:9191025 confirms this activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CPR6 contributes to protein folding through its PPIase activity and co-chaperone function with Hsp90.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      CPR6 participates in protein folding through two mechanisms: its PPIase catalytic activity
      (proline isomerization facilitates protein folding) and its role as an Hsp90 co-chaperone
      via its TPR domain. IDA and IPI evidence from PMID:9927435 supports this annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CPR6 is a cyclophilin that binds cyclosporin A. IBA annotation is correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cyclosporin A binding is a defining characteristic of cyclophilins. The name CPR6
      (Cyclosporin-sensitive Proline Rotamase 6) reflects this property. The IBA inference
      is well-supported phylogenetically.

      CPR6 is a PPIase co-chaperone, not an independent chaperone.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. CPR6 is primarily a PPIase that functions as an
      Hsp90 co-chaperone. While it can bind unfolded proteins in in vitro assays (PMID:10942767),
      its primary mechanism of action is proline isomerization, not independent unfolded protein
      binding. The IDA from PMID:10942767 showed chaperone-like activity in refolding assays, but
      this is secondary to its PPIase function. The core MF is GO:0003755 (PPIase activity).

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. While PMID:10942767 showed CPR6 can bind
      unfolded proteins in vitro, its primary mechanism is proline isomerization (GO:0003755)
      and its co-chaperone function with Hsp90. The unfolded protein binding observed in vitro
      is secondary to these core functions. Marking as over-annotated rather than MODIFY because
      CPR6 is not an ATP-dependent chaperone and GO:0044183 would not be appropriate.
