description: >-
  IRE1 (also known as ERN1) is a type I transmembrane serine/threonine-protein kinase
  and endoribonuclease that serves as the primary ER stress sensor in S. cerevisiae.
  It contains an N-terminal lumenal domain (residues 19-526) that senses unfolded proteins
  in the ER, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic portion with both kinase
  (residues 674-980) and KEN/endoribonuclease (residues 983-1115) domains. Upon ER stress,
  unfolded proteins bind the lumenal domain, triggering oligomerization and trans-
  autophosphorylation, which activates the endoribonuclease domain. The RNase domain
  then splices HAC1 precursor mRNA to produce mature HAC1 mRNA encoding a transcription
  factor that induces UPR target genes. IRE1 is the sole UPR sensor in yeast, unlike
  metazoans which have additional sensors (PERK, ATF6).

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. IRE1 does directly bind unfolded
      proteins via its lumenal domain (PMID:17923530), but it functions as a
      sensor/signaling molecule, not a chaperone. The binding triggers
      oligomerization and UPR activation, not protein folding.

      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is proposed for obsoletion. While
      IRE1 does bind unfolded proteins via its lumenal domain (PMID:17923530),
      this binding serves a signaling function (sensor), not a chaperone function.
      IRE1 does not assist protein folding. The unfolded protein binding by IRE1
      is mechanistically part of its sensor function in the UPR, which is already
      captured by GO:0036498. There is currently no appropriate GO MF term for
      "unfolded protein sensor activity" to use as a replacement.

      This is primarily a metazoan function (IRE1alpha/beta in mammals). Yeast

      IRE1 contributes to apoptotic signaling under prolonged ER stress. S. cerevisiae
      does not have classical apoptosis. While yeast has programmed cell death
      pathways, this specific term is too metazoan-centric for yeast IRE1.

    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:17923530
  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding based on direct demonstration
      that IRE1 lumenal domain directly interacts with unfolded proteins
      (PMID:17923530). This paper showed two regulatory steps: cluster formation
      and direct interaction with unfolded proteins.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. While the experimental evidence is
      solid that IRE1 binds unfolded proteins (PMID:17923530), the function of
      this binding is as a sensor/signal transducer, not as a chaperone. IRE1
      does not assist protein folding. The binding triggers oligomerization and
      UPR activation. There is currently no appropriate GO MF term for "unfolded
      protein sensor activity." The sensing function is best captured at the BP
      level by GO:0030968 and GO:0036498.

    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:17923530
  review:
    summary: >-
      IMP annotation for unfolded protein binding. Same study as the IDA
      annotation above (PMID:17923530).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Same reasoning as the IDA annotation. GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion.
      IRE1 binds unfolded proteins as a sensor, not a chaperone. The term does not
      accurately describe the functional role of this binding.
