description: >-
  KAR2 encodes the essential ER-resident Hsp70 chaperone BiP in S. cerevisiae. It is the yeast
  homolog of mammalian GRP78/BiP. KAR2/BiP functions as an ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
  in the ER lumen, is required for both co- and post-translational protein translocation across
  the ER membrane (acting as a molecular ratchet via the Sec61/Sec63 translocon), participates
  in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by maintaining substrate solubility, and plays a key role
  in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by regulating the Ire1 kinase. It also participates
  in karyogamy during mating. KAR2 is essential for viability and is one of the most abundant
  ER proteins (337,000 molecules/cell). Its chaperone cycle is regulated by J-domain co-chaperones
  (Sec63, Scj1, Jem1) that stimulate ATP hydrolysis, and by nucleotide exchange factors (Lhs1, Sil1).

      IBA annotation to nucleus based on phylogenetic inference from Hsp70 family members.
      KAR2/BiP is primarily an ER lumen protein with an HDEL ER retention signal (PMID:2661018).
      While some Hsp70 family members are nuclear, KAR2 is not typically described as nuclear
      in the literature. The IBA may reflect general Hsp70 family localization rather than
      KAR2-specific data.

      KAR2 is primarily an ER lumen chaperone (PMID:2661018). The nucleus annotation

      IGI annotation for cell wall beta-glucan biosynthesis. Simons et al. (1998)
      showed that double mutants defective in both BiP/Kar2p and ER glucosidases
      exhibited reduced 1,6-beta-glucan synthesis, abnormal cell wall morphology,
      and severely inhibited growth (PMID:9430631). This likely reflects the

      Karyogamy is the original phenotype for KAR2 but represents a specialized
