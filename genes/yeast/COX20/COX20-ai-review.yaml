    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:10671482
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: protein binding is too generic or over-extended for COX20.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Marked over-annotated because more specific terms capture the biology more accurately.
- term:
    id: GO:0043069
    label: negative regulation of programmed cell death
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:31752220
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: negative regulation of programmed cell death may be context-dependent or peripheral for COX20.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Kept as non-core to preserve potentially valid context-specific annotation without elevating it to core function.

    id: GO:0043069
    label: negative regulation of programmed cell death
  evidence_type: IMP
