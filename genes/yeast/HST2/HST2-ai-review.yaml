description: NAD-dependent protein deacetylase HST2, a sirtuin family member (Class
  I sirtuin). HST2 is primarily cytoplasmic but shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm
  via the CRM1 exportin. It catalyzes NAD-dependent deacetylation of lysine residues
  on histone and non-histone proteins, with strong preference for histone H4K16. Key
  roles include modulation of nuclear silencing events (rDNA heterochromatin formation
  and negative regulation of subtelomeric position effect), DNA stability maintenance,
  and lifespan extension under calorie restriction. Functionally distinct from SIR2
  in substrate specificity and localization-dependent regulation.

  review:
    summary: HST2 localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm, with dynamic shuttling
      between compartments. IBA annotation is appropriate despite HST2 being primarily
      cytoplasmic.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HST2 exhibits documented nuclear localization and performs transcriptional
      repression functions in the nucleus, enabling both telomeric and rDNA silencing
      activities. Nuclear localization is physiologically relevant despite efficient
      nuclear export that results in predominantly cytoplasmic steady-state distribution.

  review:
    summary: HST2 is a canonical member of the sirtuin family with core NAD-dependent
      histone deacetylase activity, phylogenetically conserved across kingdoms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HST2 catalyzes NAD-dependent deacetylation of acetylated lysines on histones

    summary: HST2 actively increases repression at the rDNA locus (nucleolar silencing),
      a core functional role well-documented in experimental literature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HST2 overexpression results in increased repression of rDNA heterochromatin
      formation, particularly promoting DNA stability in repetitive ribosomal DNA
      sequences. This is a key biological process function that HST2 performs through
      its deacetylase activity on histones in the rDNA locus.

    reason: While based on automated mapping from UniProtKB, this annotation is correct.
      HST2 does localize to the nucleus, and UniProt correctly lists nucleus as a

    summary: IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword "Transcription" mapping. HST2
      affects transcription through histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While HST2 influences transcriptional outcomes through its deacetylase
      activity on histones, particularly affecting silencing at telomeric and rDNA
      loci, it is more accurate to annotate this as negative regulation of transcription
      or regulation of transcription rather than the direct process of DNA-templated
      transcription. HST2 does not catalyze transcription itself but modifies chromatin
      structure to suppress transcription.

      catalyze an ADP-ribosyl transfer reaction as part of their deacetylation mechanism.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While sirtuins do generate ADP-ribose during their catalytic cycle, the
      primary annotated activity is deacetylation (hydrolysis), not transferase activity
      per se. The EC number (2.3.1.286) assigned to HST2 suggests hydrolase classification.
      More specific molecular function terms already capture HST2's enzymatic activities
      (GO:0017136, GO:0046970, GO:0034979). This annotation is technically correct
      but too general and less informative than the specific deacetylase terms.

  title: The silencing protein SIR2 and its homologs are NAD-dependent protein deacetylases.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 catalyzes NAD-dependent histone deacetylation with absolute requirement
      for NAD cofactor
    supporting_text: these enzymes also catalyze histone deacetylation in a reaction
      that absolutely requires NAD, thereby distinguishing them from previously characterized
      deacetylases
  - statement: Family activity is distinct from previously characterized histone deacetylases
    supporting_text: these enzymes also catalyze histone deacetylation in a reaction
      that absolutely requires NAD, thereby distinguishing them from previously characterized
      deacetylases
- id: PMID:10841563
  title: A phylogenetically conserved NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase activity
    in the Sir2 protein family.
  findings:
  - statement: NAD-dependent deacetylase activity is phylogenetically conserved across
      sirtuin family
    supporting_text: A phylogenetically conserved NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase
      activity in the Sir2 protein family
- id: PMID:11226170
  title: A cytosolic NAD-dependent deacetylase, Hst2p, can modulate nucleolar and
    telomeric silencing in yeast.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 is predominantly cytoplasmic (distinct from nuclear SIR2 and HST1)
    supporting_text: Here we report that yeast Hst2p and a mammalian Hst2p homologue,
      hSirT2p, are cytoplasmic in yeast and human cells, in contrast to yHst1p and
      ySir2p which are exclusively nuclear
  - statement: HST2 overexpression increases rDNA repression while derepressing subtelomeric
      silencing
    supporting_text: overexpression of yHst2p influences nuclear silencing events
      in a SIR2 strain, derepressing subtelomeric silencing while increasing repression
      in the rDNA
  - statement: HST2 can influence nuclear silencing events through extra-nuclear localization
    supporting_text: Although yHst2p cannot restore silencing in a sir2 deletion,
      overexpression of yHst2p influences nuclear silencing events in a SIR2 strain
- id: PMID:16051752
  title: HST2 mediates SIR2-independent life-span extension by calorie restriction.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 mediates lifespan extension independent of SIR2 under calorie
      restriction
    supporting_text: Sir2-independent life-span extension is mediated by Hst2, a Sir2
      homolog that promotes the stability of repetitive ribosomal DNA
  - statement: HST2 promotes stability of repetitive ribosomal DNA sequences
    supporting_text: Here, we show that Sir2-independent life-span extension is mediated
      by Hst2, a Sir2 homolog that promotes the stability of repetitive ribosomal
      DNA, the same mechanism by which Sir2 extends life span
  - statement: HST2 extends lifespan through same DNA stability mechanism as SIR2
    supporting_text: Here, we show that Sir2-independent life-span extension is mediated
      by Hst2, a Sir2 homolog that promotes the stability of repetitive ribosomal
      DNA, the same mechanism by which Sir2 extends life span
- id: PMID:16648462
  title: SirT2 is a histone deacetylase with preference for histone H4 Lys 16 during
    mitosis.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 (yeast ortholog) exhibits strong preference for histone H4K16Ac
      as deacetylation substrate
    supporting_text: SirT2 and its yeast counterpart Hst2 have a strong preference
      for histone H4K16Ac in their deacetylation activity in vitro and in vivo
  - statement: H4K16Ac deacetylation is important for chromatin condensation during
      cell cycle
    supporting_text: The enzymatic conversion of H4K16Ac to its deacetylated form
      may be pivotal to the formation of condensed chromatin
- id: PMID:17110954
  title: Nuclear export modulates the cytoplasmic Sir2 homologue Hst2.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm
    supporting_text: Hst2 moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is largely
      cytoplasmic owing to efficient nuclear export
  - statement: HST2 is largely cytoplasmic due to efficient CRM1-mediated nuclear
      export
    supporting_text: This nuclear exclusion is mediated by the exportin chromosomal
      region maintenance 1 (Crm1) and a putative leucine-rich nuclear export sequence
      in Hst2
  - statement: Nuclear export regulates HST2's transcriptional repression activity
    supporting_text: Disruption of Hst2 export shows that nuclear exclusion inhibits
      the activity of Hst2 as a transcriptional repressor
  - statement: Contains putative leucine-rich nuclear export sequence overlapping
      autoregulatory helix
    supporting_text: This nuclear exclusion is mediated by the exportin chromosomal
      region maintenance 1 (Crm1) and a putative leucine-rich nuclear export sequence
      in Hst2, which overlaps a unique autoregulatory helix
- id: PMID:30358795
  title: The cellular economy of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae zinc proteome.
  findings:
  - statement: HST2 identified as zinc-binding protein in systematic zinc proteome
      study
    supporting_text: The cellular economy of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae zinc proteome
