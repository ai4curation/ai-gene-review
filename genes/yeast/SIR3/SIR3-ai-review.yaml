description: Structural protein and core component of the Sir2-3-4 silent 
  chromatin complex. SIR3 functions as a nucleosome-binding protein critical for
  heterochromatin formation and maintenance at mating-type loci, telomeres, and 
  rDNA. Unlike SIR2 (the catalytic deacetylase), SIR3 provides the structural 
  scaffold through direct binding to histones and DNA. Forms homodimers and 
  interacts with SIR2 and SIR4 to establish transcriptional repression through 
  chromatin compaction and formation of condensed higher-order chromatin 
  structure. Also directly localizes to euchromatic origins where it 
  participates in modulating origin function through nucleosome binding without 
  requiring its catalytic activity.

    review:
      summary: IBA-seeded from phylogenetic inference. SIR3 directly localizes 
        to euchromatic origins but suppresses MCM loading (negative regulation),
        not initiation.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: SIR3 does not participate in DNA replication initiation. SIR3 
        suppresses MCM loading and origin activity (GO:0008156), which is 
        negative regulation, not initiation itself. Core machinery includes ORC,
        CDC6, CDT1, MCM2-7, not SIR3.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation. SIR3 binds nucleosomes at origins, not origins 
        themselves. Origins are DNA sequences recognized by ORC.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: SIR3 binds chromatin/nucleosomes near origins, not the origin DNA 
        itself. Origin binding is attributed to ORC (origin recognition 
        complex). This confuses SIR3 nucleosome binding with origin recognition.

      summary: SIR3 has been implicated in NHEJ through studies with Ku complex,

      action: REMOVE
      reason: SIR3 itself is not a NHEJ component or catalyst. The association 
        appears to be indirect through telomeric regulation - SIR3 represses 
        telomeric origins and helps maintain telomere structure, which affects 
        DSB signaling. SIR3 has no role in core NHEJ machinery (Ku70/80, Lig IV,
        XLF).
