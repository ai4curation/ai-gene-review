description: Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase localized to the mitochondrial matrix. SOD2 catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O2•−) to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, serving as a critical antioxidant defense mechanism against reactive oxygen species generated during mitochondrial respiration. The enzyme contains one manganese ion per subunit and functions as a homotetramer.

    summary: IBA annotation for mitochondrial localization based on phylogenetic inference across orthologous SOD2 proteins. Well-supported by multiple direct experimental observations confirming mitochondrial matrix localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SOD2 is a well-established mitochondrial protein. The mitochondrial localization is supported by extensive evidence including direct biochemical purification from mitochondria, subcellular fractionation studies, and the presence of a mitochondrial transit peptide (residues 1-26) that is cleaved upon import. IBA inference from orthologous sequences is appropriate for this annotation as SOD2 localization is conserved across eukaryotes.

    summary: IBA annotation for superoxide dismutase catalytic activity, inferred from orthologous SOD2 proteins. Core molecular function of SOD2 and highly conserved across eukaryotes. This annotation is more specific and appropriate than broader "oxidoreductase activity" annotations.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      SOD2's primary molecular function is superoxide dismutase activity. The enzyme
      catalyzes conversion of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen
      (EC 1.15.1.1). This is a highly specific and informative functional annotation
      representing the core catalytic activity. IBA inference is appropriate given
      the high conservation of this enzyme family across eukaryotes and consistent
      functional characterization of SOD2 orthologs.

      IBA annotation for manganese ion binding cofactor requirement. SOD2 requires

      SOD2 is a manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, distinguishing it from the
      iron-dependent SOD1 isoform found in the cytoplasm. The UniProt entry explicitly
      states "Binds 1 Mn(2+) ion per subunit" with specific binding residues identified
      (positions 52, 107, 194, 198). Manganese insertion is essential during import
      into mitochondria and is mechanistically coupled to the mitochondrial import
      process. This annotation is more specific and informative than generic "metal ion
      binding" annotations and reflects the specialized cofactor requirement.

    reason: >
      While technically correct that superoxide dismutase is an oxidoreductase enzyme
      (catalyzing electron transfer in the dismutation reaction), this annotation is
      overly broad and lacks specificity. The broader "oxidoreductase activity"
      encompasses thousands of diverse enzymatic activities and provides minimal
      functional information. More specific annotations like "superoxide dismutase
      activity" and "antioxidant activity" are far more informative. However, it is
      not incorrect, so retaining it as non-core is appropriate to avoid cluttering

    reason: >
      SOD2 does bind a metal ion (specifically manganese), making this annotation
      technically correct. However, it is overly general and lacks the specificity
      that makes GO:0030145 (manganese ion binding) superior. While some genes may
      require annotation at this level of generality, SOD2's cofactor requirement is
      specifically and characteristically for manganese rather than other metal ions.
      The more specific "manganese ion binding" annotation is far more informative
      and should be prioritized. Retaining this as non-core avoids redundancy.
