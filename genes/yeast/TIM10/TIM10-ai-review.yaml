description: >-
  TIM10 is an essential mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) chaperone protein
  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It forms a heterohexameric complex with TIM9 (3x TIM9 +
  3x TIM10), known as the TIM9-TIM10 complex or soluble 70 kDa complex. This complex
  functions as an ATP-independent holdase chaperone that escorts hydrophobic multi-pass
  transmembrane precursor proteins (such as the ADP/ATP carrier and other members of
  the mitochondrial carrier family) across the aqueous IMS from the TOM complex at the
  outer membrane to the TIM22 complex at the inner membrane, where they are inserted.
  TIM10 acts as a substrate sensor within the complex, recognizing the transmembrane
  domains of carrier precursors. The protein contains a characteristic twin CX3C motif
  with four conserved cysteines that form two intramolecular disulfide bonds in the
  oxidizing IMS environment; during cytoplasmic transit, these cysteines coordinate
  zinc to maintain an import-competent reduced state. TIM10 also participates in the
  transfer of beta-barrel outer membrane protein precursors to the SAM complex. The
  TIM9-TIM10 complex associates with TIM12 to dock at the TIM22 translocase for
  precursor handoff and inner membrane insertion.

      TIM10 is a peripheral component of the TIM22 complex. The soluble TIM9-TIM10
      complex docks onto the TIM22 inner membrane complex via TIM12 to deliver carrier
      precursors (PMID:9822593, PMID:9889188, PMID:12637749). Koehler et al. showed
      Tim10p is part of the 300 kDa TIM22 complex (PMID:9822593). Rehling et al.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0032977 (membrane insertase activity) is defined as binding transmembrane
      domain-containing proteins and mediating their integration into a membrane.
      TIM10 does not itself insert proteins into the membrane. Rather, TIM10 escorts
      hydrophobic precursors across the IMS and delivers them to the TIM22 complex,
      which performs the actual membrane insertion (PMID:9430585, PMID:9495346).
      TIM10 functions as a chaperone/carrier in the aqueous IMS, not as an insertase.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      TIM10 does not have insertase activity. Tim22 is the insertase that mediates
      membrane-potential-dependent insertion of carrier proteins into the inner membrane.
      TIM10 is a soluble IMS chaperone that escorts precursors to TIM22. The correct
      molecular function is unfolded protein carrier activity (GO:0140309), which
      captures the escort/holdase function of TIM10. Koehler et al. explicitly stated
      that Tim10p was required to transport carrier precursors across the outer membrane,
      while Tim12p and Tim22p mediated insertion (PMID:9430585).

      TIM10 participates in the overall process of protein insertion into the
      mitochondrial inner membrane. While TIM10 itself does not perform the insertion
      step (that is Tim22), it is an essential component of the pathway that
      chaperones precursors across the IMS to the TIM22 insertase. Multiple studies
      have shown that loss of TIM10 function blocks carrier protein import and

    summary: >-
      TIM10 contains a twin CX3C zinc-finger-like motif with four conserved cysteines
      that can bind zinc. However, zinc binding occurs specifically during cytoplasmic
      transit to stabilize the reduced form and facilitate import into mitochondria.
      In the mitochondrial IMS, the mature protein forms disulfide bonds rather than
      coordinating zinc (PMID:9495346, UniProt). The IEA from UniProt keyword mapping
      to the general metal ion binding term is acceptable but the zinc binding is
      transient and context-dependent.

      TIM10 does bind metal ions (specifically zinc) via its CX3C motifs, though this

  review:
    summary: >-
      TIM10 contains a twin CX3C motif that can coordinate zinc ions. However, zinc
      binding is context-dependent: TIM10 binds zinc in the cytoplasm (in its reduced
      form before import), but in the mitochondrial IMS the cysteines form disulfide
      bonds rather than coordinating zinc (PMID:9495346, UniProt). The RCA annotation
      from a zinc proteome study (PMID:30358795) is acceptable but should be
      understood in context.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TIM10 does bind zinc via its CX3C motifs, though this occurs in the cytoplasmic
      reduced state rather than in the functional IMS oxidized state. The annotation
      is not incorrect -- TIM10 is part of the zinc proteome -- but the zinc binding

    TIM10 functions as an unfolded protein carrier in the mitochondrial intermembrane
    space (IMS). As part of the hexameric TIM9-TIM10 chaperone complex, it binds
    hydrophobic unfolded precursor proteins (primarily mitochondrial carrier family
    members) exiting the TOM translocase and escorts them across the aqueous IMS to
    the TIM22 insertase complex at the inner membrane. TIM10 acts as a substrate
    sensor within the complex. This is an ATP-independent holdase/carrier function
