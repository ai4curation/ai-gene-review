description: Histone deacetylase HDA1 (Hda1p) is a Class II zinc-dependent HDAC forming
  a functional complex with non-catalytic subunits HDA2 and HDA3. HDA1 exhibits distinct
  substrate specificity from the Class I deacetylase RPD3, preferentially targeting
  histone H2B and H3 (particularly H3 acetylation) rather than H4. As a component
  of the HDA1 complex, Hda1p catalyzes zinc-dependent hydrolytic deacetylation of
  acetylated lysine residues on chromatin, regulating gene silencing, chromatin organization,
  and transcriptional repression particularly at H3/H2B-specific loci. The enzyme
  requires zinc as an essential structural and catalytic cofactor, distinguishing
  it mechanistically from NAD-dependent sirtuins like HST2.

    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from HDAC orthologs. HDA1
      is part of a nuclear chromatin-associated complex, not primarily cytoplasmic.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: HDA1 functions in chromatin deacetylation in the nucleus. While the IBA
      annotation infers cytoplasmic localization from orthologs, experimental evidence
      establishes HDA1 as a nuclear protein component of chromatin-associated histone
      deacetylase complexes. Nuclear localization is documented in multiple experimental
      studies examining HDA1's function in transcriptional repression and chromatin
      organization. The cytoplasmic annotation appears to be a phylogenetic inference
      artifact.

      modulates transcription by altering chromatin structure through histone deacetylation,

      would be negative regulation of transcription or regulation of transcription.

      repression, not positive regulation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is mechanistically inconsistent with HDA1's documented
      function. HDA1 catalyzes histone deacetylation that typically promotes gene
      silencing and heterochromatin formation, resulting in negative regulation of
      transcription and suppression of biosynthetic processes. While HDA1 might positively
      regulate transcription at specific loci in particular cellular contexts, the
      predominant and well-characterized mechanism is transcriptional repression.
      The ARBA inference appears to contradict experimental evidence for HDA1's core

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:8663039 is an early study demonstrating that HDA1 and HDA3 are components
      of a yeast histone deacetylase complex. This provides independent confirmation
      of HDA1 complex assembly from different experimental approach and timeframe.
      Multiple evidence sources for the same annotation (IDA from different studies)
      strengthen confidence in HDA1's role as a complex component.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation documenting functional distinctness of HDA1 complex from
      RPD3 complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:8962081 demonstrates that HDA1 and RPD3 are members of distinct,
      functionally separate histone deacetylase complexes. This further supports HDA1
      as a defined complex component and establishes its functional specialization.
      Multiple independent studies (PMID:8663039, PMID:11287668, PMID:8962081) consistently
      demonstrate HDA1's core role in the HDA1 complex assembly.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the complete set of histone tail substrates targeted by HDA1,
    and how does it differ from RPD3?
- question: Does HDA1 have preferred deacetylation sites on histone H3 and H2B, and
    how do these affect nucleosome stability and chromatin fiber structure?
- question: What are the mechanisms regulating HDA1 complex recruitment and activity
    at specific genomic loci?
- question: Does HDA1 function on non-histone substrates, and if so, with what specificity
    and functional consequence?
