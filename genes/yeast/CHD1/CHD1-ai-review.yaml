  CHD1 (Chromatin Helicase DNA-binding protein 1) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme
  that functions as a monomeric protein in yeast. It catalyzes nucleosome sliding and spacing through
  ATP hydrolysis, positioning nucleosomes into regular arrays with ~159 bp spacing. CHD1 contains
  paired N-terminal chromodomains, a central SNF2-related ATPase catalytic domain, and a C-terminal
  DNA-binding domain (SANT/SLIDE). During transcription elongation, CHD1 works with RNA Pol II elongation
  factors (Paf1, FACT) to maintain chromatin integrity as polymerase traverses nucleosomal obstacles.
  CHD1 also functions in DNA double-strand break repair, heterochromatin organization, and nucleosome
  spacing maintenance. Unlike mammalian CHD1, yeast CHD1 chromodomains do not bind H3K4me3; rather,
  CHD1 is recruited to genes via elongation factor interactions.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CHD1 localizes to the nucleus where it executes all known functions (transcription elongation, nucleosome organization, DNA repair). IBA evidence from phylogenetically conserved orthologs confirms nuclear localization across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is fundamental to CHD1's core functions. IBA annotation is well-supported by ortholog alignment and multiple experimental studies demonstrating CHD1 nuclear accumulation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CHD1 contains SANT and SLIDE domains with intrinsic histone-binding capacity. However, biochemical studies show CHD1 makes minimal direct contacts with histone proteins during nucleosome remodeling, relying predominantly on DNA interactions. IBA annotation reflects ortholog conservation but oversimplifies the actual mechanism.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While histone binding capacity exists structurally, CHD1's primary nucleosome engagement mechanism relies on DNA binding through its SANT/SLIDE domains rather than histone contacts. This is a secondary capability, not the primary functional mode. Better core terms available (chromatin binding, DNA binding).

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: CHD1 participates in sister chromatid cohesion through cohesin regulation, but this is likely a secondary consequence of CHD1's nucleosome positioning activity rather than primary function. Not core to CHD1 catalytic mechanism.

  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:14576278
  review:
    summary: HDA (homology-based annotation) suggests CHD1 localizes to mitochondria based on sequence homology or protein complex composition. However, CHD1 is primarily a nuclear protein. Multiple experimental studies show nuclear localization with no evidence of mitochondrial function.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: CHD1 is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler functioning specifically in nuclear chromatin organization and transcription. No published evidence documents CHD1 mitochondrial localization or function. Likely annotation error from proteome annotation in this HDA source.

    summary: Redundant mitochondrion annotation with same weak evidence basis (HDA from proteome). Same problematic annotation as preceding entry.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: No evidence for CHD1 mitochondrial localization. This is likely proteomics annotation artifact. All evidence supports exclusive nuclear localization. Remove redundant incorrect annotation.
