description: >-
  SSA2 encodes a constitutively expressed cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperone in S. cerevisiae,
  highly homologous to SSA1 (97% amino acid identity). SSA2 is one of four SSA family
  members (SSA1-4) and is the most abundant, with approximately 364,000 molecules/cell
  (PMID:14562106), even more than SSA1. SSA2 functions as an ATP-dependent molecular
  chaperone that assists protein folding and refolding, interacts with Hsp90 and J-domain
  co-chaperones, participates in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, tRNA nuclear
  import, and is part of the HAP1 transcriptional repressor complex. SSA2 also binds
  human histatin 5 (HTN3) and mediates its fungicidal activity (PMID:12761219). SSA2 is
  found in the cytoplasm, cytosol, nucleus, plasma membrane, cell wall, vacuole membrane,
  mitochondria, and extracellular vesicles.

    description: >-
      SSA2 is the most abundant cytoplasmic Hsp70 in S. cerevisiae (364,000 molecules/cell),
      functioning as an ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone. It is 97% identical to SSA1
      and functionally interchangeable for refolding of denatured proteins (PMID:8947547).
      SSA2 uses ATP hydrolysis cycles to assist both de novo folding of newly translated
      proteins (PMID:9789005) and refolding of stress-denatured proteins (PMID:8947547,
      PMID:9448096). It cooperates with J-domain co-chaperones (Ydj1, Sis1), nucleotide
      exchange factors (Sse1/Sse2, Fes1), and Hsp90 (HSP82/HSC82). SSA2 also has specialized
      roles in tRNA nuclear import (PMID:25853343), ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation
      (PMID:27178214), and transcriptional regulation via the HAP1 repressor complex
      (PMID:15102838).
