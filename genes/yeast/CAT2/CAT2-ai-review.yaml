description: 'Carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CAT2) is a mitochondrial and peroxisomal
  enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to
  carnitine, forming acetylcarnitine. This shuttle reaction is critical for transporting
  activated acetyl groups across the impermeable inner mitochondrial and peroxisomal
  membranes. CAT2 exists as two isoforms derived from alternative initiation: the
  mitochondrial isoform (located at the inner mitochondrial membrane) and the peroxisomal
  isoform (located in the peroxisomal matrix). The enzyme plays a central role in
  carnitine-dependent metabolic processes and stress protection, particularly in response
  to oxidative stress. CAT2 is essential for fatty acid oxidation in peroxisomes and
  supports mitochondrial metabolism by facilitating acetyl-CoA transport.'
