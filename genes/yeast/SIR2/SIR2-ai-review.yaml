description: NAD-dependent histone deacetylase and master regulator of transcriptional
  silencing and replicative lifespan. SIR2 catalyzes histone deacetylation using NAD+
  as a cofactor, functions as a core component of transcriptional silencing complexes
  at mating-type loci and telomeres (via Sir2-Sir3-Sir4), mediates rDNA silencing
  via the RENT complex, and couples metabolic status to chromatin regulation through
  NAD+ availability. Critical roles include silencing foreign promoters, suppressing
  rDNA recombination and transposon activity, maintaining telomeric/subtelomeric heterochromatin,
  regulating DNA replication, and affecting replicative lifespan through caloric restriction
  sensing.

      in rDNA and telomeres.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SIR2 suppresses recombination at rDNA repeats and telomeres, which could
      be considered part of genome stability/DNA damage response. However, this is
      not a primary function - the primary role is transcriptional silencing. Recombination
      suppression is a consequence of heterochromatin formation. IBA is reasonable
      but function is better captured by more specific terms like negative regulation
      of recombination.

    reason: SIR2 is not a DNA repair enzyme. It suppresses recombination by maintaining
      heterochromatin at rDNA and telomeres, which prevents aberrant recombination
      events. This is recombination suppression, not DNA repair. The annotation is
      over-inclusive and conflates genome stability with direct repair activities.

    reason: This annotation is mechanistically incorrect. SIR2 catalyzes deacetylation
      (removing acetyl groups), not transfer reactions. While the reaction formally
      involves transfer of the acetyl group to ADP-ribose, the enzymatic classification
      is deacetylase, not transferase. This over-generalization should be removed
