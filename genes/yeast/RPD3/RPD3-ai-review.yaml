description: 'RPD3 (Reduced Potassium Dependency 3) is a Class I histone deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.98) that functions as a catalytic
  subunit in two major chromatin-modifying complexes in S. cerevisiae. The Rpd3L complex, containing regulatory proteins like
  Ash1 and Ume6, primarily functions in transcriptional repression at specific promoters and in heat stress response. The
  Rpd3S complex, recruited via Set2-mediated H3K36 methylation, suppresses cryptic transcription within coding regions. RPD3''s
  catalytic activity is essential for both repression and activation of transcription depending on genomic context, cell cycle
  phase, and stress conditions. Key functions include: (1) negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II at mating-type
  loci and rDNA; (2) chromatin organization and heterochromatin stabilization; (3) cell cycle regulation via coordination
  of S-phase genes and G1/S/G2/M transitions; (4) heat stress response; (5) DNA replication timing control via Rpd3L; (6)
  rDNA silencing and condensation under nutrient stress. RPD3 exhibits context-dependent coactivator activity in heat-responsive
  and anaerobic gene induction. The protein localizes to the nucleus with dynamic nuclear periphery localization under genotoxic
  stress.'
