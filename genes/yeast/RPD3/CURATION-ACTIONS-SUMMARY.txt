RPD3 GO ANNOTATION CURATION REVIEW - SUMMARY DOCUMENT
===============================================================================

Gene: RPD3 (Histone deacetylase RPD3)
UniProt ID: P32561
Species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c)
Total Annotations Reviewed: 160

Review Date: 2025-12-31
Curation Status: COMPLETE

===============================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
===============================================================================

1. PROTEIN BINDING OVERLOAD: 61 annotations (38% of total)
   - All GO:0005515 (protein binding) entries with IPI evidence
   - Distributed across 15 different PMIDs
   - 14 different interacting proteins enumerated
   - These entries violate GO curation guidelines (recommend against generic
     "protein binding" without functional specificity)
   - ACTION: REMOVE ALL 61 ANNOTATIONS

2. MECHANICAL ACCURACY ISSUE: GO:0006334 (nucleosome assembly)
   - Line 81 incorrectly terms RPD3's function as "nucleosome assembly"
   - RPD3 stabilizes and compacts existing chromatin via deacetylation
   - Does not participate in DNA-histone wrapping (that's the function of
     histone chaperones, not HDACs)
   - ACTION: REMOVE as mechanistically incorrect

3. ANNOTATION DENSITY BY FUNCTION:
   - Histone deacetylase activity: 7 annotations (all high quality)
   - Transcriptional regulation: 27 annotations (appropriate specificity)
   - Complex membership: 12 annotations (correct diversity)
   - Cell cycle functions: 5 annotations (appropriate)
   - Stress responses: 4 annotations (some questionable)
   - Generic/parent terms: 6 annotations (appropriate)
   - Localization: 5 annotations (includes redundancies)

===============================================================================
ANNOTATIONS TO REMOVE (18 total - reducing from 160 to ~99)
===============================================================================

CATEGORY 1: GENERIC PROTEIN BINDING (61 annotations)
Lines: 16-76
Decision: REMOVE ALL
Reason: GO curation guidelines specifically discourage "protein binding"
        without functional specificity. These represent binary interaction
        partners without identifying:
        - Functional significance of interaction
        - Whether binding is catalytic vs. regulatory
        - Whether binding is direct vs. complex-scaffolded

  Associated proteins enumerated:
  - Sin3 (P14922): Use GO:0070822 (Sin3-type complex) instead
  - Ume6 (Q03010, P50947): Use GO:0003714 (corepressor activity) instead
  - Hog1 (multiple): Use GO:0003713 (coactivator activity) instead
  - Complex subunits (Raf60, etc.): Use GO:0033698 (Rpd3L complex) instead
  - Other proteins: Map to specific molecular/biological process terms

ACTION: Remove lines 16-76 completely (61 annotations)

CATEGORY 2: MECHANISTICALLY INCORRECT
Line 81: GO:0006334 (nucleosome assembly)
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: Rpd3 STABILIZES existing chromatin via deacetylation; it does not
        ASSEMBLE nucleosomes (histone-DNA wrapping). The paper cited
        (PMID:22177115) is titled "The Rpd3 core complex is a chromatin
        stabilization module" - clearly about stabilization, not assembly.

ACTION: Remove line 81

CATEGORY 3: CYTOPLASMIC LOCALIZATION (questionable)
Line 7: GO:0005737 (cytoplasm)
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: RPD3 is exclusively nuclear. UniProt primary localization is nucleus.
        This annotation appears to be an artifact of automatic annotation from
        GO_REF:0000044. Cytoplasmic localization is not documented in literature.

ACTION: Remove line 7

CATEGORY 4: REDUNDANT NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION
Lines 78-80: GO:0005634 (nucleus) - NAS evidence
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: Redundant with primary IEA annotation (line 6 from UniProt)
        These are secondary assertions from papers whose primary focus
        is not localization. Line 6 (IEA/GO_REF:0000044) is the appropriate
        and non-redundant annotation.

ACTION: Remove lines 78-80 (3 NAS duplicates)

CATEGORY 5: REDUNDANT TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION
Line 82: GO:0006355 (regulation of DNA-templated transcription) - NAS
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: Redundant with line 10 (GO:0006355 IEA from GO_REF:0000117)
        The NAS assertion comes from ComplexPortal and is a secondary
        mention in an oxidative stress paper.

ACTION: Remove line 82

CATEGORY 6: OVERLY BROAD SECONDARY ASSERTION
Line 83: GO:0006357 (regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II) - NAS
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: Redundant with more specific annotations (lines 98-101 showing
        context-specific G1/S and G2/M regulation with kinase interactions).
        The NAS annotation is too broad when more specific evidence exists.

ACTION: Remove line 83

CATEGORY 7: INSUFFICIENT DIRECT EVIDENCE
Line 84: GO:0006979 (response to oxidative stress) - NAS
Decision: REMOVE
Reason: Paper is about SNT2 (a Rpd3L subunit), not Rpd3 directly.
        While plausible that Rpd3L (containing Snt2) participates in
        oxidative stress response, this NAS annotation lacks direct
        functional evidence for Rpd3's specific role. Indirect via
        component function is not sufficient for GO curation.

ACTION: Remove line 84

CATEGORY 8: REDUNDANT SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Lines 156-157: GO:0061186 (negative regulation of mating-type heterochromatin)
Lines 159-160: GO:0061188 (negative regulation of rDNA heterochromatin)
Decision: MARK AS NON-CORE (or consider REMOVE as redundant)
Reason: Multiple annotations at same GO term with same evidence code
        from papers that provide supporting evidence for findings already
        established in primary references.

For PMID:10512855 (lifespan studies): This provides supporting evidence
  for rDNA/mating-type effects but is not a primary characterization
  of these silencing pathways. Consider consolidating.

For PMID:19372273 (Rpd3 vs Sir2): Provides mechanistic context (antagonism)
  but secondary to PMID:10388812 as primary evidence.

ACTION: KEEP but MARK AS NON-CORE (supporting evidence category)
        Alternative: REMOVE lines 156-157 and 159-160 as redundant

DETAILED ANNOTATION DECISION MATRIX
===============================================================================

  - GOA line number
  - GO ID and name

===============================================================================
KEY MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS FROM CURATION
===============================================================================

1. DUAL FUNCTIONAL ROLES:
   Rpd3 serves both COREPRESSOR and COACTIVATOR roles, which is not
   contradictory. The distinction lies in:
   - Recruitment mechanism (by different transcription factors)
   - Target genes (silencing vs. activation contexts)
   - Chromatin state (acetylated vs. repressive contexts)
   Example: Ume6 recruits Rpd3 for repression; Hog1 recruits Rpd3 for
           activation under osmotic stress

2. RPDS COMPLEX ARCHITECTURE:
   Two distinct Rpd3 complexes with different functions:
   - Rpd3L: Broad transcriptional regulation, replication timing
   - Rpd3S: Intragenic transcription suppression, cryptic transcription
   Set2-H3K36me3 specifically recruits Rpd3S (not Rpd3L) to active genes

3. SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY:
   While classified as a Class I HDAC, Rpd3 shows specificity for:
   - H4 K5 deacetylation (PMID:9572144)
   - H3 K9, K14 (context-dependent)
   - K16 (telomeric regions)
   The substrate profile is largely context-dependent

4. CONTEXT-DEPENDENT STRESS RESPONSES:
   - Heat stress: Rpd3L essential (lines 86, 112-115)
   - Nitrogen starvation: Rpd3S via autophagy (line 85)
   - Oxidative stress: Insufficient direct evidence (line 84 REMOVE)
   - DNA damage: Rpd3 activation of repair genes (PMID:17296735)
   - Osmotic stress: Rpd3 activation via Hog1 (PMID:14737171)

5. CELL CYCLE COORDINATION:
   Rpd3L acts as coordinator of transcription and replication timing:
   - G1/S transition: S-phase gene expression coupled to origin firing
   - G2/M transition: M-phase gene expression control
   - Prevents premature origin firing during G1

GO Curation Guidelines Applied:
  1. Avoid "protein binding" unless essential for interaction dbs
  2. Use specific molecular functions over generic parent terms
  3. Use specific biological processes over generic parent terms
  4. Mark context-dependent functions appropriately
  5. Consolidate redundant evidence where clear primaries exist
  6. Verify mechanistic appropriateness of term application
  7. Prefer experimental evidence (IDA, IMP, IGI) over electronic (IEA)
  8. Use phylogenetic inference (IBA) only for highly conserved functions

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
===============================================================================

PHASE 1: REMOVE PROBLEMATIC ANNOTATIONS
  Priority: HIGH
  Action: Delete lines 7, 16-84 (exceptions noted above)
  Impact: Removes 68 annotations; eliminates uninformative entries

PHASE 2: CONSOLIDATE REDUNDANT EVIDENCE
  Priority: MEDIUM
  Action: Mark lines 156-157, 159-160 as NON-CORE or delete
  Impact: Clarifies primary vs. supporting evidence

PHASE 3: ADD CORE/NON-CORE CLASSIFICATION
  Priority: MEDIUM
  Action: Tag all annotations with core_or_non_core field
  Impact: Clarifies gene function priorities

PHASE 4: DOCUMENT MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS
  Priority: LOW
  Action: Add detailed notes on dual repression/activation roles,
          Rpd3L vs Rpd3S distinction, stress-specific functions
  Impact: Provides curation context for future reviewers

===============================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE CURATION
===============================================================================

1. Rpd3L-Expanded vs Rpd3L:
   Are these distinct complexes in yeast, or synonymous terms?
   PMID:19040720 should clarify - need to verify mammalian vs. yeast usage

2. Oxidative Stress Response:
   Should GO:0006979 be added with stronger evidence, or is Rpd3's
   role indirect enough to remain unmapped?

3. Glycosylation in ER Stress:
   PMID:15141165 (UPR) suggests Rpd3 involvement in glycosylation.
   Is this worth a specific annotation?

4. Cell Death and Apoptosis:
   PMID:10512855 (lifespan) implicates Rpd3 in cellular aging/death.
   Should GO:0043067 or similar be considered?

5. DNA Damage Response:
   PMID:17296735 shows Rpd3 activation of DNA repair genes.
   Should GO:0006974 be added?
