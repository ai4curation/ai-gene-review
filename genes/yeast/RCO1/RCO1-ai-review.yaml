description: |
  RCO1 (Regulator of Chromatin Organization 1) is a 684-amino acid transcriptional regulatory protein that functions as an essential subunit of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex. It contains two PHD (plant homeobox) zinc finger domains that work in concert with Eaf3 to recognize H3K36-methylated nucleosomes. RCO1 exists as a homodimer within Rpd3S and serves as a central interaction hub coordinating complex assembly and nucleosome deacetylation. Through H3K36me3 recognition and allosteric activation of Eaf3's chromodomain, RCO1 enables Rpd3S to suppress cryptic transcription initiation within gene bodies and maintain proper chromatin structure during transcription elongation.

  review:
    summary: |
      IBA annotation inferred through phylogenetic analysis. RCO1 is an essential subunit of the Rpd3S
      histone deacetylase complex, which regulates transcription through deacetylation of histone tails
      in gene bodies. However, this annotation is indirect - RCO1 does not directly regulate RNAP II;
      it rather modifies chromatin structure that influences transcription. The term is too general and
      does not capture the specific mechanism of cryptic transcription suppression.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: |
      This annotation correctly captures that RCO1 participates in transcriptional regulation, but the
      term "regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II" is too broad and imprecise. RCO1's primary
      function is not to regulate RNAP II itself, but rather to suppress cryptic transcription initiation
      within gene bodies through H3K36me3-dependent nucleosome deacetylation. More specific annotations
      like "negative regulation of transcription, chromatin-dependent" (GO:0006307) or "positive regulation
      of transcription by RNA polymerase II" would be more accurate given RCO1's involvement in maintaining
      productive transcription by preventing spurious internal initiation.

      RCO1 is involved in chromatin organization as a core component of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase
      complex. The complex deacetylates histones in gene bodies and works with linker histone Hho1 to
      maintain chromatin compaction and prevent nucleosome eviction. This is appropriately classified as
      a chromatin organization function.

      This annotation is correct. RCO1's primary role is chromatin organization through nucleosome
      deacetylation and cryptic transcription suppression. The IEA mapping from UniProtKB keywords is

      RCO1 indirectly influences DNA-templated transcription by maintaining proper chromatin structure

    reason: |
      While RCO1 does influence transcription through its chromatin regulatory functions, it is not
      directly involved in DNA-templated transcription. Its effect is indirect - it modifies chromatin
      structure to prevent inappropriate transcription initiation. More specific terms like "chromatin
      organization" or "negative regulation of transcription, chromatin-dependent" would be more accurate.

      is too generic and uninformative. It does not distinguish between interaction partners or provide
      functional context. The specific interactions that matter - with Rpd3S complex subunits (Rpd3, Sin3,
      Ume1, Eaf3) - are already captured by the "part_of: Rpd3S complex" annotation. Additional specific
      partners like chaperones may be captured in separate annotations. This annotation should be marked
      non-core as it provides minimal functional information compared to complex membership annotations.

  review:

      RCO1 is part of the Rpd3S complex, which suppresses cryptic transcription initiation within gene

      The annotation is mechanistically correct - Rpd3S does negatively regulate transcription by
      suppressing cryptic initiation. However, RCO1's specific role is in H3K36me3 recognition and
      complex assembly, not direct transcription regulation. The negative regulation is a consequence
      of chromatin organization. The more specific and core function is "negative regulation of antisense

    reason: |
      RCO1 supports transcription elongation indirectly by maintaining proper chromatin structure and
      preventing nucleosome disruption during polymerase transit. However, its primary function is not
      elongation per se, but rather preventing cryptic transcription through chromatin organization.
      The "positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II" annotation better captures RCO1's
      more direct role. This elongation annotation should be marked non-core as it represents an indirect
      consequence of RCO1's chromatin regulatory function.

    summary: |
      RCO1 (as part of Rpd3S) affects DNA replication timing and initiation frequency through chromatin
      regulation. The paper "Genome-wide replication profiles indicate an expansive role for Rpd3L in
      regulating replication initiation timing or efficiency" shows Rpd3L and Rpd3S influence replication
      through chromatin state. However, this is an indirect effect mediated through chromatin organization,
      not direct replication machinery interaction.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: |
      RCO1 influences DNA replication timing indirectly through its role in chromatin organization and
      gene expression regulation. This is not a core function of RCO1. The primary function is cryptic
      transcription suppression and chromatin organization during transcription. Replication effects are
      pleiotropic consequences of altered chromatin state. This annotation should be marked non-core.

      RCO1 is directly identified as a component of the Rpd3S complex through co-immunoprecipitation
      and mass spectrometry. Two separate papers (PMID:16286007 and PMID:16286008) both identify RCO1
      in Rpd3S, representing independent confirmation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      Excellent IDA annotation. RCO1 is directly identified as a core component of Rpd3S in the landmark
      papers describing the complex composition. This is a foundational structural and functional
      annotation. Both PMID:16286007 and PMID:16286008 provide direct experimental evidence (IP-MS).

  review:
    summary: |
      RCO1 deletion increases antisense transcription from promoters positioned opposite the 3' ends of
      genes. This represents RCO1's role in maintaining promoter directionality and preventing spurious
      antisense transcription initiation. This is one of RCO1's most important and specific functions.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      Excellent IMP annotation capturing one of RCO1's most important and specific functions. Nascent
      transcript sequencing clearly shows that rco1 deletion causes derepression of antisense transcription
      at 3' gene ends, indicating RCO1 enforces transcriptional directionality through chromatin
      modification. This is more specific and mechanistically informative than broader "negative regulation
      of transcription" terms. This is a CORE function of RCO1.

      label: zinc ion binding
    description: |
      RCO1 contains two PHD (plant homeobox) zinc finger domains (residues 260-309 and 414-472)
      that coordinate zinc ions as essential structural cofactors. The zinc coordination is critical
      for proper folding of the PHD domains and their function in recognizing methylated histone
      lysine residues. The PHD domains form the histone mark recognition interface of the Rpd3S
      complex, enabling the recognition of H3K36-methylated nucleosomes. RCO1 is the central
      interaction hub of the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex, organizing and stabilizing the
      complex architecture. RCO1 exists as a homodimer (both copies essential for Rpd3S function),
      working with the chromodomain-containing protein Eaf3 to recognize H3K36-methylated
      nucleosomes and enable targeted deacetylation of histone tails in gene bodies. This zinc-dependent
      histone mark recognition is essential for suppressing cryptic transcription, maintaining
      transcriptional directionality, and preventing antisense transcription at gene ends through
      H3K36me3-dependent nucleosome deacetylation and chromatin compaction.
