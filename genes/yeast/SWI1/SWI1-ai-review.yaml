description: SWI1 is a key regulatory subunit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. It lacks catalytic ATPase activity but serves critical roles in complex assembly and targeting to promoters through interactions with transcription factors and the Mediator complex. The N-terminal prion domain mediates protein-protein interactions and can adopt an alternative amyloid conformation, while the C-terminal ARID domain weakly binds DNA but is essential for nucleosome recognition within the intact complex. Core function is nucleosome repositioning and transcriptional regulation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference to mammalian orthologs. SWI1 is a core component of the SWI/SNF complex which is recruited to promoters by transcription factors and drives regulation of transcription initiation through nucleosome remodeling. The IBA evidence is high-quality and reflects the well-characterized role of SWI1 orthologs across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The SWI/SNF complex is fundamentally a transcriptional regulator that functions by remodeling chromatin at promoters and regulatory regions to facilitate transcription initiation. SWI1 is an essential component of this process through its role in complex assembly and targeting. This is a core function of the protein. The IBA evidence reflects strong phylogenetic conservation of this function across eukaryotes, including mammalian ARID1A/ARID1B and other orthologs.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While SWI1 is indeed localized to the nucleus where it functions as part of the SWI/SNF complex, this is a location annotation rather than a functional annotation. The core function is nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional regulation, not simply being in the nucleus. This should be retained for completeness but marked as non-core.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation indicating DNA binding to cis-regulatory regions. However, SWI1 itself exhibits weak DNA binding; within the complex, DNA binding appears to occur primarily through minor groove contacts by other subunits, not through the major groove contacts typical of cis-regulatory region binding.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Multiple lines of evidence indicate this annotation is misleading. First, the isolated SWI1 ARID domain exhibits markedly weak DNA-binding affinity compared to other ARID family members, lacking proper major groove contact residues. Second, within the SWI/SNF complex, DNA binding to naked DNA is distamycin-sensitive (minor groove), indicating that other subunits mediate this interaction. Third, the primary mechanism for SWI/SNF recruitment to cis-regulatory regions is through direct or indirect interactions with DNA-bound transcription factors and the Mediator complex, not through SWI1 cis-regulatory region binding per se. The annotation conflates complex function with individual protein function.

    summary: IBA annotation correctly identifying SWI1 as a component of the SWI/SNF complex. This is a core structural component annotation reflecting the obligate membership of SWI1 in the complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SWI1 is definitively a core subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The complex is composed of 12 subunits including SWI1, and structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that SWI1 is essential for complex assembly and function. This represents a core structural and functional role.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on InterPro domain mapping. SWI1 contains an ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) that is structurally capable of DNA binding, but exhibits markedly weak DNA-binding affinity compared to other ARID proteins. Within the intact complex, SWI1 participates in nucleosome and DNA recognition, but the primary DNA-binding function appears to be mediated by other subunits.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While SWI1 does contain a DNA-binding domain (ARID) and can bind DNA weakly in vitro, this is not a core function of the protein in vivo. The weak affinity and apparent non-specificity suggest this domain's primary role is in protein-protein interactions and nucleosome positioning rather than sequence-specific DNA recognition. Within the complex context, SWI1 contributes to nucleosome recognition but other subunits provide the primary DNA-binding function. This annotation should be retained as it is technically correct but marked as non-core.

    reason: SWI1 is indeed a nuclear protein, functioning as part of the nuclear SWI/SNF complex. However, this is a location annotation, not a functional one, and should be marked as non-core. The distinction from the IBA nucleus annotation is minimal.

The complex is recruited to promoters and coding regions where it facilitates transcription initiation by remodeling nucleosomes. This represents a core biological process in which SWI1 participates. The IEA evidence is appropriate for this broad process annotation.

    reason: SWI1 does contain a zinc finger motif and the zinc ion binding is biochemically demonstrable. However, the specific functional role of this zinc finger in SWI1's mechanism is not well characterized. It likely contributes to protein-protein interactions within the complex or nucleosome binding, but zinc binding per se is not a primary functional annotation. Should be retained for structural completeness but marked as non-core.

    summary: IDA annotation from early characterization identifying ADR6 (SWI1) localization to the nucleus based on direct experimental observation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Foundational evidence for nuclear localization. While correct and important for context, this is a location annotation not a functional annotation. Should be retained for cellular component information but marked non-core.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation indicating SWI1 is required for DNA replication through its role in the SWI/SNF complex. The complex may facilitate replication by remodeling chromatin at replication origins or through other mechanisms.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While SWI1 is required for DNA replication (based on mutant phenotype), this appears to be an indirect role through chromatin remodeling at replication-relevant loci rather than a primary core function. SWI1's role in replication is secondary to its primary transcriptional and chromatin remodeling functions. Should be retained as documented but marked non-core.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: High-quality structural evidence directly demonstrating SWI1 as a core component of the SWI/SNF complex. This is essential to retain for proper annotation of SWI1's role. Multiple independent IDA annotations for complex membership are appropriate.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation demonstrating SWI1 is required for mating type switching through activation of the HO locus. This is a specific well-characterized function of the SWI/SNF complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Mating type switching is a classical SWI1 function, originally named for its role in swi(tching) mating type through HO locus expression. The IMP evidence (loss of SWI1 blocks mating type switching) directly demonstrates this essential role. This is a well-documented specific function and should be retained.
