description: 'NTE1 (Neuropathy Target Esterase homolog) is an intracellular phospholipase B that catalyzes the double deacylation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to glycerophosphocholine. This lysophospholipase enzyme plays a critical role in membrane lipid homeostasis and phospholipid turnover, particularly in response to environmental conditions like inositol availability, temperature stress, and choline presence. NTE1 activity functionally interacts with the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein Sec14p and influences transcriptional regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic genes through its impact on the OPI1 repressor.'
