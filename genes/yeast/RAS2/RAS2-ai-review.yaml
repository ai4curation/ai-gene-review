description: RAS2 is a small GTPase that serves as a key regulator of cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA) signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RAS2 cycles between
  GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states, activated by guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor CDC25 and inactivated by GAPs IRA1/IRA2. As a primary effector regulating
  adenylate cyclase activity, RAS2 controls nutrient-dependent cell growth, glucose
  sensing, metabolic enzyme regulation, stress response, and replicative lifespan
  through PKA-mediated signaling. RAS2 also functions in morphogenetic pathways including
  pseudohyphal growth and cell division polarity through Cdc42/MAPK signaling. The
  protein is farnesylated and palmitoylated, localizing to plasma membrane, ER membrane,
  and nucleus.

- description: "RAS2 serves as the primary regulator of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, acting as a molecular switch that cycles between GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states. In the active state, RAS2-GTP binds to and activates adenylate cyclase (CYR1), increasing cellular cAMP levels. This triggers cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation, which phosphorylates downstream targets controlling nutrient-dependent growth, glucose metabolism, stress resistance, and replicative lifespan determination."
