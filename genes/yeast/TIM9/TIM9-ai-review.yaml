description: >-
  TIM9 is a small mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) chaperone that forms a hexameric
  complex with TIM10 (the Tim9-Tim10 or TIM10 complex, composed of 3 copies of each subunit).
  This soluble 70 kDa complex functions as a carrier-holdase that escorts hydrophobic
  transmembrane protein precursors (carrier proteins, beta-barrel precursors) from the TOM
  complex across the aqueous IMS to the TIM22 complex for insertion into the inner membrane,
  or to the SAM complex for outer membrane beta-barrel assembly. TIM9 contains a twin CX3C
  motif that forms two intramolecular disulfide bonds in the IMS; during cytoplasmic transit
  these cysteines may coordinate zinc. TIM9 is essential for viability and plays both a
  structural role in complex assembly and a functional role in substrate recognition, with its
  N-terminal region required for efficient trapping of incoming substrates.

      The Tim9-Tim10 complex escorts carrier protein precursors across the IMS to the TIM22

      This is the core biological process that TIM9 participates in. The Tim9-Tim10 complex

      TIM9 functions as part of the Tim9-Tim10 carrier complex that escorts hydrophobic
      precursors across the IMS. However, TIM9 is more precisely a carrier-holdase (it moves
      with its cargo) than a transporter (which facilitates movement without moving itself).
      GO:0140318 "protein transporter activity" may not be the optimal term; GO:0140309
      "unfolded protein carrier activity" is more specific and accurate for TIM9 function.

      Zinc coordination is thought to occur only transiently during cytoplasmic transit,

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding based on Vial et al. (2002), who demonstrated
      that the reconstituted Tim9-Tim10 complex binds to the physiological substrate ADP/ATP
      carrier (AAC) and displays chaperone activity in refolding the model substrate firefly
      luciferase. TIM9 is the canonical carrier-holdase: it binds unfolded/hydrophobic protein
      precursors AND escorts them across the mitochondrial IMS from the TOM complex to the
      TIM22 complex. GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" captures only the binding aspect
      but misses the essential carrier/escort function. GO:0140309 "unfolded protein carrier
      activity" was created specifically for this class of proteins (go-ontology#30552) and
      is the correct replacement term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      TIM9 (as part of the Tim9-Tim10 complex) is the textbook carrier-holdase: it binds
      unfolded hydrophobic precursor proteins AND escorts them between cellular compartments
      (from TOM to TIM22/SAM across the IMS). GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" captures
      only the binding aspect. GO:0140309 "unfolded protein carrier activity" was created in
      Nov 2025 specifically for TIM carrier-holdases (go-ontology#30552). Its definition --
      "A protein carrier activity that binds to a protein in an unfolded state and escorts it
      between two different cellular components. The unfolded protein carrier prevents
      aggregation of the target protein" -- precisely describes TIM9 function. This is a
      child of GO:0140597 "protein carrier chaperone" and GO:0140104 "molecular carrier
      activity." The Tim9-Tim10 complex acts as a "chaperone-like protein that protects the
      hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guides them through the mitochondrial
      intermembrane space" (UniProt). PMID:12138093 shows the reconstituted complex is
      functional because it binds AAC and displays chaperone activity.

      NEW annotation. TIM9 (as part of the Tim9-Tim10 hexameric complex) is the canonical

      showed the reconstituted Tim9-Tim10 complex binds the ADP/ATP carrier substrate and
      displays chaperone activity. Multiple studies demonstrate the carrier/escort function:
      the complex guides hydrophobic proteins through the aqueous IMS (PMID:9822593), mediates
