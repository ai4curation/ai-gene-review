description: 'SNF2 (SWI2) is the catalytic ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin
  remodeling complex. It functions as an ATP-dependent helicase-like enzyme that catalyzes
  nucleosome repositioning and remodeling to facilitate transcriptional activation
  and DNA repair. The protein contains a characteristic helicase domain with ATP-binding
  motifs, a bromodomain for recognizing histone acetylation marks, and an AT-hook
  DNA-binding domain. SNF2 is essential for glucose-repressed gene expression, metabolic
  regulation, and genome stability.'
