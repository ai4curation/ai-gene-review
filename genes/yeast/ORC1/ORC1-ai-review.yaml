description: 'Origin recognition complex subunit 1 (ORC1) is the 120 kDa catalytic subunit of the ORC complex, essential for DNA replication initiation and mating-type transcriptional silencing. ORC1 recognizes and binds ARS consensus sequences at replication origins, recruits MCM2-7 loading factors during G1, and interacts with SIR proteins to establish heterochromatin at silent mating loci. The protein contains an N-terminal BAH (bromo-adjacent homology) domain for nucleosome binding and a C-terminal AAA+ ATPase domain for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling.'
