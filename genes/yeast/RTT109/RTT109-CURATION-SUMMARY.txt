   - Supported by: 8 crystal structures (PDB:2RIM, 2ZFN, 3CZ7, 3Q33, 3Q35, 
     3Q66, 3Q68, 3QM0)

2. Replication-Dependent Chromatin Assembly
   - H3K56 acetylation marks nascent DNA and facilitates nucleosome assembly
   - RTT109 is essential for proper RCNA pathway coordination
   - Facilitates H3-H4 transfer from Asf1 to CAF1 for nucleosome deposition
   - 7 annotations (GO:0006335, GO:0006325)

3. Genome Stability Through S-Phase DNA Damage Prevention

- Annotation set is HIGH QUALITY with strong experimental support
- Curation revealed no major errors or unsupported claims

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
================================

1. NEW ANNOTATION OPPORTUNITY
   - Add GO term for "DNA-RNA hybrid homeostasis" or "R-loop suppression"
   - RTT109 prevents R-loop accumulation via H3K14 and H3K23 acetylation
   - Currently well-supported by evidence but no explicit GO term
   - Evidence: PMID from deep research documents this mechanism

2. SUPPORTED_BY ENRICHMENT
   - 88.6% of annotations lack supporting_text (publication quotes)
   - Would benefit from adding exact quotes from key publications
   - Core curation decisions are sound; supporting_text is enhancement

3. DEEP RESEARCH INTEGRATION
   - RTT109-deep-research-perplexity.md provides extensive contextual information
   - Some details could be incorporated into core_functions descriptions
   - Already used for curation decisions

4. CONSIDERATION OF CONTEXT DEPENDENCIES
   - Some functions are highly context-dependent (H3K9 vs. H3K56 acetylation)
   - Current GO annotations do not capture Vps75 vs. Asf1 selectivity
   - Could add extension notes in future to document cofactor specificity
