description: Histone acetyltransferase RTT109 (also KAT11, Regulator of Ty1 transposition
  protein 109) catalyzes acetylation of newly synthesized histone H3 at lysines 56,
  9, 27, 14, and 23 in coordination with histone chaperone cofactors Vps75 and Asf1.
  RTT109 is absolutely essential for replication-dependent nucleosome assembly and
  genome stability, as H3K56ac marks nascent DNA and facilitates proper chromatin
  assembly while preventing double-strand break formation. RTT109 also prevents DNA-RNA
  hybrid accumulation through H3K14 and H3K23 acetylation. The enzyme exhibits a unique
  bipartite architecture with N-terminal PAT domain and C-terminal activation domain,
  undergoes autoacetylation at K290 for catalytic activation, and functions exclusively
  on newly synthesized non-nucleosomal histones during S-phase replication.

    label: histone H3K56 acetyltransferase activity
  description: RTT109 catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 on newly synthesized,
    non-nucleosomal histones during S-phase DNA replication. This is the defining,
    essential, and most extensively characterized enzymatic function of RTT109. H3K56
    acetylation specifically marks newly replicated DNA and facilitates nucleosome
    assembly.

  description: In addition to H3K56, RTT109 catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 at
    lysines 9, 27, 14, and 23 depending on histone chaperone cofactor context (Vps75
    vs Asf1). These activities contribute to chromatin assembly, R-loop suppression,
    and proper nucleosome dynamics during replication.

  description: RTT109 catalyzes lysine acetylation from acetyl-CoA cofactor on multiple
    histone H3 substrate lysine residues (K56, K9, K27, K14, K23). The enzyme undergoes
    autoacetylation at lysine 290 which stabilizes the activation domain interaction
    with the catalytic PAT domain.
