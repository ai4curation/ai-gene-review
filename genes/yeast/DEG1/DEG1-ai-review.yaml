description: DEG1 (also known as PUS3) encodes a tRNA pseudouridine(38/39) synthase that specifically modifies positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. The enzyme is a member of the TruA family of pseudouridine synthases and also modifies mRNAs in a growth-condition dependent manner. DEG1/Pus3p localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm, modifying both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. While not essential for viability, deletion causes temperature-sensitive growth defects, particularly at 37Â°C. The protein catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine without requiring cofactors, using a conserved aspartate residue (Asp151) as the nucleophile.

  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation for general pseudouridine synthase activity is accurate but too broad. DEG1/Pus3p specifically catalyzes pseudouridine formation at positions 38 and 39 in tRNA anticodon loops, as demonstrated experimentally in PMID:9430663. The more specific term GO:0160154 (tRNA pseudouridine(38/39) synthase activity) better captures the enzyme's specificity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While DEG1 does have pseudouridine synthase activity, this general term fails to capture the position-specific nature of the enzyme's activity. The experimental evidence clearly shows specificity for positions 38/39 in tRNA anticodon loops.

    summary: This IEA annotation is uninformative. While DEG1/Pus3p must bind RNA substrates to perform its catalytic function, this general term provides no functional insight.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: RNA binding is an implicit requirement for any RNA-modifying enzyme and provides no specific functional information. The specific catalytic activities (tRNA pseudouridine(38/39) synthase activity) already imply RNA binding capability. This term adds no value to understanding DEG1's function.

    description: The primary and most specific molecular function of DEG1/Pus3p is the catalysis of pseudouridine formation exclusively at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. This enzymatic activity involves isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine without requiring cofactors, using a conserved aspartate residue (Asp151) as the nucleophile. The enzyme functions as a homodimer with high substrate specificity, recognizing the L-shaped tertiary structure of tRNAs and modifying both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. This modification is critical for translation fidelity, ribosome binding affinity, and cellular adaptation to temperature stress. Loss of DEG1 causes temperature-sensitive growth defects, particularly at 37Â°C, reduced translation fidelity, and impaired tRNA function.

    description: DEG1/Pus3p exhibits a secondary but important function in mRNA pseudouridylation, particularly under specific growth conditions. Using transcriptome-wide analysis, Pus3 was shown to modify approximately 20 mRNAs and 1 ncRNA in a growth-condition dependent manner, with most targets showing increased modification during post-diauxic growth. This represents an emerging role in epitranscriptomic regulation beyond the primary tRNA modification function and is enhanced during post-diauxic growth.
