description: DEG1 (also known as PUS3) encodes a tRNA pseudouridine(38/39) synthase that specifically
  modifies positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. The enzyme is a member of the TruA family
  of pseudouridine synthases and also modifies mRNAs in a growth-condition dependent manner. DEG1/Pus3p
  localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm, modifying both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. While not
  essential for viability, deletion causes temperature-sensitive growth defects, particularly at 37°C.
  The protein catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine without requiring cofactors, using
  a conserved aspartate residue (Asp151) as the nucleophile.

  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation for general pseudouridine synthase activity is accurate but too broad.
      DEG1/Pus3p specifically catalyzes pseudouridine formation at positions 38 and 39 in tRNA anticodon
      loops, as demonstrated experimentally in PMID:9430663. The more specific term GO:0160154 (tRNA pseudouridine(38/39)
      synthase activity) better captures the enzyme's specificity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While DEG1 does have pseudouridine synthase activity, this general term fails to capture the
      position-specific nature of the enzyme's activity. The experimental evidence clearly shows specificity
      for positions 38/39 in tRNA anticodon loops.

  description: The primary and most specific molecular function of DEG1/Pus3p is the catalysis of pseudouridine
    formation exclusively at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. This enzymatic activity
    involves isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine without requiring cofactors, using a conserved
    aspartate residue (Asp151) as the nucleophile. The enzyme functions as a homodimer with high substrate
    specificity, recognizing the L-shaped tertiary structure of tRNAs and modifying both cytoplasmic and
    mitochondrial tRNAs. This modification is critical for translation fidelity, ribosome binding affinity,
    and cellular adaptation to temperature stress. Loss of DEG1 causes temperature-sensitive growth defects,
    particularly at 37°C, reduced translation fidelity, and impaired tRNA function.
