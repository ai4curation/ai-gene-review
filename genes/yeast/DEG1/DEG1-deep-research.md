# Deep Research: DEG1 (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)

## Gene Overview

**Gene Symbol:** DEG1
**Synonyms:** HRM3, PUS3
**Systematic Name:** YFL001W
**UniProt ID:** P31115
**Species:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (budding yeast)
**Protein:** Pseudouridine synthase 3 (Pus3p)

DEG1 encodes a highly conserved tRNA pseudouridine synthase responsible for the formation of pseudouridine (Ψ) at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon loop of transfer RNAs. The gene name "DEG1" stands for "Depressed Growth rate" due to the slow growth phenotype observed in deletion mutants, particularly under elevated temperature conditions [PMID:9430663 "Disruption of the DEG1 gene is not lethal but reduces considerably the yeast growth rate, especially at an elevated temperature (37°C)"].

## Core Molecular Functions

### tRNA Pseudouridine Synthase Activity (EC 5.4.99.45)

DEG1/Pus3p catalyzes the site-specific isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon stem-loop of tRNAs [PMID:9430663 "Characterization of yeast protein Deg1 as pseudouridine synthase (Pus3) catalyzing the formation of psi 38 and psi 39 in tRNA anticodon loop"]. This enzymatic activity is:

- **Position-specific**: Exclusively modifies positions 38 and 39, distinguishing it from other yeast pseudouridine synthases
- **Substrate-specific**: Acts on both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs [PMID:9430663 "both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs share a common origin for psi 38- and psi 39-synthesizing activity"]
- **Cofactor-independent**: Functions without requiring cofactors, unlike snoRNA-guided pseudouridine synthases

### RNA Binding Properties

The enzyme belongs to the TruA family of pseudouridine synthases and exhibits:

- **tRNA recognition**: Recognizes the L-shaped tertiary structure of tRNAs with high specificity
- **Homodimer formation**: Functions as a symmetric homodimer to selectively bind and modify tRNAs
- **Structural sensitivity**: Activity is sensitive to correct three-dimensional folding of the tRNA substrate [PMID:9430663 "when the tertiary structure of tRNAs is disrupted, modification by Pus3 is reduced"]

### Catalytic Mechanism

The pseudouridylation reaction proceeds through:

1. **Nucleophilic attack**: A conserved aspartate residue (Asp151) acts as the nucleophile
2. **Covalent intermediate**: Formation of a transient enzyme-RNA covalent bond
3. **Product release**: Liberation of pseudouridine-modified tRNA

## Key Biological Processes

### tRNA Processing and Modification

DEG1/Pus3p plays a critical role in tRNA maturation by:

- **Anticodon loop stabilization**: Pseudouridines at positions 38/39 provide additional hydrogen bonding, stabilizing the anticodon loop structure
- **Translation optimization**: Modified tRNAs exhibit enhanced stability and improved codon-anticodon interactions
- **Quality control**: Ensures proper tRNA folding and function before release into the cytoplasm

### Protein Synthesis Regulation

The enzyme's modifications directly impact translation through:

- **Translation fidelity**: Proper pseudouridylation maintains accurate codon recognition [PMID:12058040 "absence of pseudouridine 38 or 39 in tRNA reduces the level of natural readthrough"]
- **Ribosome binding**: Modified tRNAs show improved binding affinity to ribosomal A-site
- **Frameshift suppression**: Presence of Ψ38/39 enhances misreading and promotes frameshifting on slippery sequences [PMID:12058040 "presence of psi38 or psi39 in the tRNA anticodon arm enhances misreading of certain codons"]

### Cellular Stress Response

Under stress conditions, DEG1/Pus3p function becomes critical for:

- **Temperature adaptation**: Essential for maintaining translation efficiency at elevated temperatures
- **tRNA stability**: Prevents degradation of unmodified tRNAs under stress
- **Metabolic adaptation**: Supports continued protein synthesis during environmental changes

## Protein Structure and Domains

### Domain Architecture

DEG1/Pus3p (442 amino acids, ~50.9 kDa) contains:

- **Central PUS core domain**: Contains the conserved active site and catalytic machinery
- **N-terminal extension**: Eukaryote-specific region potentially involved in regulation
- **C-terminal extension**: May contribute to protein stability or additional RNA contacts
- **RNA-binding surfaces**: Multiple regions that recognize the L-shaped tRNA substrate

### Structural Features

Recent structural studies of human PUS3 reveal:

- **Homodimeric organization**: Symmetric dimer with two RNA-binding clefts
- **Active site architecture**: Each monomer contains a catalytic site positioned to modify adjacent uridines
- **tRNA recognition mechanism**: Specific contacts with both the anticodon stem loop and the tRNA elbow region

### Evolutionary Conservation

The protein shows remarkable conservation across species:

- **Bacterial ortholog (TruA)**: Shares core catalytic domain and mechanism
- **Human ortholog (PUS3)**: 96% sequence identity in the catalytic core
- **Conserved motifs**: Key sequence elements are invariant from bacteria to humans

## Cellular Localization and Trafficking

### Dual Localization Pattern

DEG1/Pus3p exhibits dual subcellular localization [PMID:9430663 "Deg1p localizes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy"]:

**Nuclear Localization:**
- Site of primary tRNA modification during maturation
- Co-localizes with nascent tRNA transcripts
- Approximately 5,860 molecules per cell in log phase

**Cytoplasmic Localization:**
- Provides quality control for tRNA modifications
- May respond to cellular stress signals
- Potential role in mRNA pseudouridylation

### Mitochondrial tRNA Modification

Although mitochondrial localization is uncertain, DEG1/Pus3p clearly modifies mitochondrial tRNAs [PMID:9430663 "mitochondrial tRNAArg present in DEG1-disrupted yeast strain lacking pseudouridines at position 38 or 39"], suggesting either:

- Partial import into mitochondria
- Modification before mitochondrial import
- Separate mitochondrial enzyme pool

## Impact on Translation and Cellular Function

### Translation Efficiency and Accuracy

Loss of DEG1/Pus3p results in:

- **Reduced readthrough**: Decreased natural stop codon readthrough [PMID:12058040 "absence of pseudouridine 38 or 39 in tRNA reduces the level of natural readthrough"]
- **Altered frameshifting**: Reduced +1 frameshift efficiency on slippery sequences
- **Impaired suppression**: Compromised function of suppressor tRNAs

### Specific tRNA Effects

Research demonstrates that loss of Ψ38/39 specifically affects:

- **tRNAGln function**: Particularly impairs tRNAGlnUUG under temperature stress [PMID:28134782 "Loss of Deg1/Pus3 and elimination of ψ38/39 specifically impairs tRNAGlnUUG function under temperature-induced down-regulation of wobble uridine thiolation"]
- **Anticodon loop stability**: Protects against destabilization by other modifications or mutations
- **Temperature sensitivity**: Becomes critical when other tRNA modifications are compromised

### Growth and Viability Phenotypes

DEG1 deletion causes:

- **Temperature sensitivity**: Severe growth impairment at 37°C
- **Slow growth**: Reduced growth rate even under normal conditions
- **Protein aggregation**: Enhanced protein aggregation, particularly in combination with other mutations

## Recent Discoveries and Emerging Functions

### mRNA Pseudouridylation

Recent transcriptome-wide studies revealed that Pus3 also modifies mRNAs:

- Identifies 20+ mRNA targets in addition to tRNAs
- Modifications are growth condition-dependent
- Suggests roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation
- Opens new avenues for understanding epitranscriptomic regulation

### Stress-Responsive Modifications

Evidence suggests that pseudouridylation patterns change under stress:

- Increased modification during post-diauxic growth
- Temperature-dependent modification efficiency
- Potential adaptation mechanism for environmental changes

## Commonly Over-annotated Aspects

When reviewing DEG1 annotations, be cautious of:

1. **Overly broad RNA binding**: While DEG1/Pus3p binds RNA, its specificity is limited to tRNAs (and some mRNAs)
2. **General protein synthesis**: The effect on translation is specific to pseudouridine-dependent processes
3. **Non-specific stress response**: The stress response is primarily related to translation and tRNA stability
4. **Mitochondrial localization**: Direct mitochondrial localization is not definitively established

The enzyme's high evolutionary conservation, from bacteria to humans, underscores its fundamental importance in cellular biology. Recent discoveries of its role in mRNA modification suggest broader functions in epitranscriptomic regulation. The severe phenotypes associated with its loss in yeast (temperature sensitivity, slow growth) and humans (intellectual disability) highlight the critical nature of tRNA pseudouridylation for normal cellular function and development.

Understanding DEG1/Pus3p function provides insights into the broader importance of RNA modifications in gene expression regulation and cellular adaptation to environmental changes.
