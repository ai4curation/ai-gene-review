  description: SAS3 catalyzes histone H3K14 acetylation in two distinct NuA3 complex
    forms (NuA3a at promoters for initiation, NuA3b at coding regions for elongation).

    at position 14 of histone H3 proteins.

  notes: Critical substrate-specific function well-documented but missing from existing
    annotations. See PMID:10817755 and PMID:17157260.
suggested_questions:
- question: Does SAS3 have in vivo role in histone H4 acetylation like SAS2?
- question: What is the relative contribution of SAS3 to total H3K14ac levels compared
    to GCN5?
- question: What distinguishes NuA3a vs NuA3b targeting mechanisms?
- question: Does SAS3 interact with HDAC complexes?
