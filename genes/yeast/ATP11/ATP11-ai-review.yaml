    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:27107014
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: protein binding is too generic or over-extended for ATP11.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Marked over-annotated because more specific terms capture the biology more accurately.

- term:
    id: GO:0051082
    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:10681564
  review:
    summary: 'ATP11 is a dedicated assembly factor for mitochondrial F1-ATPase, not a general chaperone. GO:0051082 overstates the binding as a standalone function.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: ATP11 functions as a dedicated assembly factor for the F1-ATPase beta subunit, not as a general unfolded protein binding chaperone. The binding interaction is specific to Atp2p assembly and is better captured by the assembly process annotation (GO:0033615).

    label: mitochondrion organization
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:2142305
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: mitochondrion organization may be context-dependent or peripheral for ATP11.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Kept as non-core to preserve potentially valid context-specific annotation without elevating it to core function.
