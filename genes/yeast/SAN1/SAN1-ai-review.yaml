  SAN1 (Sir Antagonist 1) is a nuclear E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with a central RING domain
  (residues 240-280) that plays a key role in nuclear protein quality control (PQC) in
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. San1 directly recognizes misfolded nuclear proteins through
  intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal domains containing conserved substrate-recognition
  sites, and ubiquitinates them for proteasomal degradation in conjunction with the E2
  ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Cdc34 and Ubc1 (PMID:15797381, PMID:21211726). San1 exhibits
  exquisite specificity for aberrant proteins and does not target wild-type versions of its
  substrates (PMID:15797381). Originally identified as a suppressor of SIR4 mutations, San1
  targets mutant Sir4 and Spt16 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (PMID:15078868). San1 also
  participates in cytoplasmic PQC alongside Ubr1, where misfolded cytoplasmic proteins can be
  delivered to nuclear San1 in a chaperone-dependent manner (PMID:20080635). San1 is primarily
  nuclear localized and requires nuclear localization for function (PMID:15797381). The protein
  is largely intrinsically disordered with a RING-type zinc finger as the only structured domain.

      peroxisomal proteins in yeast using overexpression of proteins under a strong TEF2

      identifying a new peroxisomal protein Pls1 (Ynl097c-b) and its role in lysine
      biosynthesis. San1 may have been detected in the screen but appears to be a

      San1 is a well-characterized nuclear protein that requires nuclear localization for

      overexpression screen where proteins were expressed under a strong constitutive
      promoter, which can lead to mislocalization artifacts. San1 is not mentioned by name
      in the paper. Given the strong evidence for nuclear localization and the absence of
      any mechanistic connection to peroxisomal function, this annotation is likely

  findings:

  findings:

        the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 directly recognizes its misfolded

        High-throughput screen for peroxisomal proteins using overexpression under strong

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: misfolded protein sensor activity
  proposed_definition: >-
    Recognition of misfolded protein conformation to initiate quality-control degradation.
    Distinct from chaperone activity in that the binding leads to ubiquitination and
    proteasomal degradation rather than refolding or prevention of aggregation.
  justification: >-
    E3 ubiquitin ligases like San1 (yeast) and SYVN1/HRD1 (human) directly recognize
    misfolded proteins, but their binding serves to target substrates for degradation
    rather than for chaperone-like protection. The existing terms GO:0031249 (denatured
    protein binding, being obsoleted) and GO:0051787 (misfolded protein binding) do not
    distinguish between binding for chaperoning vs. binding for degradation targeting.
    A new term would capture the specific molecular function of these quality control
    sensors.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Should a new GO molecular function term be created for "misfolded protein sensor
    activity" to distinguish E3 ligases that recognize misfolded substrates for degradation
    from chaperones that bind misfolded proteins to prevent aggregation?
- question: >-
    Is GO:0051787 (misfolded protein binding) an adequate replacement for GO:0031249
    (denatured protein binding) for San1, or does the degradation-targeting context
    require a more specific term?
- question: >-
    Should the peroxisomal localization (HDA, PMID:35563734) be retained as a possible
    minor localization site, or should it be removed as an overexpression artifact?
