description: Silent information regulator 4 (SIR4) is a structural component of the
  SIR2-SIR3-SIR4 silent chromatin complex. SIR4 is an architectural/scaffolding protein
  that lacks enzymatic activity itself (deacetylase function is provided by SIR2).
  It serves as a bridge between the silent chromatin machinery and nuclear organization,
  mediating interactions with telomeric proteins (RAP1, YKU80) and the nuclear periphery
  (MPS3). SIR4 functions at both telomeric and mating-type loci, maintaining heterochromatin
  through protein-protein interactions and DNA binding rather than catalytic mechanisms.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping. SIR4 does possess
      DNA-binding capability, though secondary to its adaptor role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SIR4 has demonstrable DNA-binding activity (confirmed by biochemical assays
      and in vitro reconstitution), but this is not its primary functional role. The
      protein binds DNA primarily as part of the heterotrimer complex structure and
      to stabilize chromatin interactions. This is more accurately described by more
      specific terms like "double-stranded DNA binding" (GO:0003690) or "nucleosome
      binding" (GO:0031491), both of which are already captured in the annotation
      set.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping. However, SIR4 is not directly
      involved in the catalytic process of transcription but rather in transcriptional
      repression.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is a poor characterization of SIR4 function. SIR4 is involved in
      transcriptional silencing/repression through chromatin structure modification,
      not in the process of DNA-templated transcription itself. DNA-templated transcription
      (GO:0006351) is too general and misleading, as it includes active transcription,
      which is the opposite of SIR4s silencing role. This annotation should be removed
      in favor of the more accurate "heterochromatin formation" (GO:0031507) terms
      already in the set.

      binding annotations reflect SIR4s core role in protein-protein interactions

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Protein-protein interactions are fundamental to SIR4 function. The SIR2-SIR3-SIR4
      complex is assembled through direct protein-protein interactions, and SIR4 additionally
      binds telomeric proteins RAP1 and YKU80. While "protein binding" is somewhat
      generic, it is appropriate given the central role of SIR4 as a binding partner
      in complex assembly. This represents a core function.
