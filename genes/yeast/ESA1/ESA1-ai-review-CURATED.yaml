description: "ESA1 (Essential SAS-Related protein 1) is the catalytic subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex. It catalyzes acetylation of histone H4 (at K5, K8, K12, K16), H3 (K14), H2A/H2B, and the variant H2A.Z, as well as non-histone substrates including ATG3 and PAH1. ESA1 is essential for transcriptional activation, DNA double-strand break repair, cell cycle progression, and chromatin organization. The protein also exhibits crotonyl-CoA transferase activity."

These 26 IPI entries collectively document ESA1's multiple interaction partners (NuA4 subunits, histones, kinases, etc.), which is valuable for network analysis and protein interaction databases, but less critical for functional understanding. ESA1's complex membership and enzymatic activity annotations capture the functional significance of these interactions.
