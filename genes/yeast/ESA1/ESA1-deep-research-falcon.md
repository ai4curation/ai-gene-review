# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q08649
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Histone acetyltransferase ESA1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.3.1.48 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12368900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17223684, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18245364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22020126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9520405}; AltName: Full=Protein 2-hydroxyisobutyryltransferase ESA1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.3.1.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O94446}; AltName: Full=Protein acetyltransferase ESA1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.3.1.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22539722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29765047}; AltName: Full=Protein crotonyltransferase ESA1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.3.1.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31699900};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ESA1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9520405, ECO:0000312|SGD:S000005770}; OrderedLocusNames=YOR244W; ORFNames=O5257;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MYST (SAS/MOZ) family. .
- **Key Domains:** Acyl_CoA_acyltransferase. (IPR016181); Chromo-like_dom_sf. (IPR016197); Chromo/chromo_shadow_dom. (IPR000953); HAT_MYST-type. (IPR002717); MYST_HAT. (IPR050603)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ESA1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ESA1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ESA1** (gene ID: ESA1, UniProt: Q08649) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target identity: ESA1 (YOR244W) encodes Esa1, the essential MYST-family lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) that is the catalytic subunit of the yeast NuA4 complex. This matches UniProt Q08649 (S. cerevisiae S288c) and the MYST family/domain annotations provided above (HAT_MYST-type; chromo-like features). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms within the retrieved evidence (e.g., TIP60 is the human ortholog) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3, setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and essentiality: NuA4 is a large, ~1–1.3 MDa histone acetyltransferase complex in budding yeast whose catalytic subunit is Esa1. ESA1 is essential for viability and cell-cycle progression; genetic and biochemical studies established Esa1 as the enzymatic component responsible for robust acetylation of histone H4 (and H2A to a lesser extent) in chromatin (EMBO J., 1999-09-15; doi:10.1093/emboj/18.18.5108) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3).
- Enzymatic function and substrate specificity: Esa1 catalyzes lysine acetylation using acetyl-CoA. In native NuA4 and in the catalytic Piccolo-NuA4 module, Esa1 primarily acetylates the N-terminal tails of histone H4 and H2A (and H2A.Z), achieving tetra-acetylation of H4 on nucleosomal substrates; non-histone substrates are also reported (DNA Repair, 2019-01; doi:10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.11.006; bioRxiv preprint posted 2022-07-11; doi:10.1101/2022.07.11.499577) (hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3, ji2022structureofthea pages 1-3, allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3).
- Complex membership and modular organization: Esa1 resides in both the holo-NuA4 and in the nucleosome-directed catalytic submodule Piccolo-NuA4. Piccolo minimally comprises Esa1 with Epl1, Yng2, and Eaf6; the NuA4 holoenzyme incorporates modules/platform subunits including Eaf1, Tra1, Arp4/Actin, Swc4, and Yaf9 that govern recruitment and architecture (ArXiv thesis, 2018-01; doi:10.14288/1.0340574; EMBO J., 1999) (setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42, allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3).
- Cellular localization: Esa1 functions in the nucleus on chromatin. Experimental anchor-away of Esa1 from the nucleus (AA-ESA1) and temperature-sensitive alleles (e.g., esa1-L254P) are used to dissect nuclear roles and essentiality (thesis/excerpts summarizing primary literature) (laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Architecture and long-range catalysis: Cryo-EM studies across fungi/metazoans now define how NuA4/TIP60 achieves long-range chromatin acetylation. A 2023 study of NuA4–Tip60 reveals that the HAT module is anchored to a stable core (Epl1/Eaf1/Swc4 platform) yet can reach distant nucleosomes, with the Epl1 linker being critical; shortening this linker reduces H4 acetylation over broad domains (Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2023-08; doi:10.1038/s41594-023-01056-x) (laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 18-22). Human TIP60 architecture (2024) shows EP400 as a backbone integrating modules and highlights conserved subunit relationships with yeast (EPC1/Epl1; DMAP1/Swc4; EP400/Eaf1), supporting conserved principles of organization for Esa1 orthologous systems (Nat Commun, 2024-08; doi:10.1038/s41467-024-51259-z) (laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).
- Yeast NuA4 architecture and nucleosome engagement: Cryo-EM and biochemical work indicates that the holo-NuA4 can adopt an auto-inhibited conformation with mobile catalytic elements, whereas the Piccolo module directly binds and acetylates nucleosomes efficiently; Eaf1/Eaf2 (Swc4) form a backbone connecting Actin/Arp4 to Tra1. These data refine how Esa1 is positioned relative to nucleosomes in functional states (bioRxiv preprint posted 2022-07-11; doi:10.1101/2022.07.11.499577) (ji2022structureofthea pages 1-3).
- Expanded biological roles: Recent yeast work links NuA4 to lipid metabolism and organelle morphology, showing that disrupting NuA4 causes nuclear deformation, vacuolar fragmentation, defects in nuclear–vacuole junctions/PMN, and that NuA4-dependent acetylation affects localization/function of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase Pah1 (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2024-07; doi as reported) (laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 92-95).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- DNA repair in chromatin: Rapid nuclear depletion of Esa1 (anchor-away) and mutations in NuA4 subunits impair nucleotide excision repair (NER), particularly in heterochromatin (HML), demonstrating NuA4/Esa1 is required for efficient repair in vivo. This informs strategies to modulate repair capacity and chromatin responses to genotoxic stress in model systems (DNA Repair, 2019-01; doi:10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.11.006) (hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3).
- Transcriptional coactivation: NuA4 serves as a transcriptional adaptor/coactivator that stimulates activator-driven transcription on chromatin templates; Esa1-dependent H4 acetylation loosens nucleosome–DNA contacts to promote transcription. This underlies routine use of Esa1/NuA4 perturbations to probe promoter regulation and gene-class dependencies in yeast (EMBO J., 1999-09-15; doi:10.1093/emboj/18.18.5108; ArXiv thesis, 2018-01; doi:10.14288/1.0340574) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3, setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42).
- Structural paradigms: The 2023–2024 cryo-EM structures of fungal NuA4–Tip60 and human TIP60 guide cross-species inference about Esa1 placement, module connectivity, and nucleosome engagement, enabling structure-guided hypotheses about mutational effects in yeast (Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2023-08; doi:10.1038/s41594-023-01056-x; Nat Commun, 2024-08; doi:10.1038/s41467-024-51259-z) (laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 18-22, laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Foundational biochemical definition: Allard et al. established Esa1 as NuA4’s catalytic subunit and demonstrated NuA4’s ability to fully tetra-acetylate H4 lysines in oligonucleosomes, linking Esa1 activity to transcriptional stimulation on chromatin (EMBO J., 1999-09-15; doi:10.1093/emboj/18.18.5108) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3).
- Genome maintenance perspective: Hodges et al. concluded NuA4/Esa1 is required for efficient NER in chromatin, adding to prior evidence for roles in DSB repair and replication stress tolerance, and positioning NuA4 as a central chromatin cofactor for multiple repair pathways (DNA Repair, 2019-01; doi:10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.11.006) (hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3).
- Architectural unification: Setiaputra’s synthesis and recent cryo-EM studies unify a model in which Eaf1 functions as the platform, Piccolo contains the catalytic Esa1 with Epl1/Yng2/Eaf6, and Tra1/Actin/Arp4/Swc4 stabilize recruitment and chromatin interfaces—conserved with human TIP60 modules (ArXiv thesis, 2018-01; doi:10.14288/1.0340574; Nat Commun, 2024-08; doi:10.1038/s41467-024-51259-z) (setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42, laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).

Relevant statistics and data (recent and primary)
- Acetylation breadth on H4: NuA4 can independently acetylate each of the four conserved H4 N-terminal lysines (Allard et al., 1999) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3).
- Repair efficiency impact: Anchor-away of Esa1 impairs NER genome-wide, with pronounced defects in heterochromatin regions (HML) as quantified by CPD repair assays (Hodges et al., 2019) (hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3).
- Structural resolutions and modules: Human TIP60 core subcomplex and TRRAP module resolved to ~3.2 Å; architecture maps conserved EP400/EPC1/DMAP1 relationships with yeast Eaf1/Epl1/Swc4 (Chen et al., 2024) (laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22). Fungal NuA4–Tip60 core resolved at ~3.4 Å; Epl1 linker length modulates long-range H4 acetylation over broad domains in vivo (Fréchard et al., 2023) (laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 18-22).

Mechanistic details: enzyme reaction, substrates, recognition, regulation
- Reaction and substrates: Esa1 transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to lysine epsilon-amines, preferentially on H4 and H2A tails in nucleosomes; H2A.Z is also a substrate in vivo (Allard et al., 1999; Hodges et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2022 preprint) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3, hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3, ji2022structureofthea pages 1-3).
- Nucleosome engagement and recognition: Piccolo-NuA4 exhibits features that enhance nucleosomal acetylation, including contributions from an Esa1 chromo/Tudor barrel loop and Epl1 EPcA/basic regions; biochemical/structural studies show these domains are required for nucleosome acetylation and efficient tail access (Huang/Tan analyses; prior Piccolo domain requirements) (huang2012functionalrecognitionof pages 21-27, laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 92-95).
- Double recognition model and mobility: Structural studies support a model in which the catalytic module recognizes the nucleosome surface to position Esa1 for successive H4 tail acetylation cycles, with mobility/flexibility allowing access across chromatin (bioRxiv 2022; domain studies) (ji2022structureofthea pages 1-3, huang2012functionalrecognitionof pages 21-27).
- Regulation and interfaces: The Epl1–Esa1 interaction is essential for catalytic module assembly/activity, and Eaf1 functions as a platform subunit that interconnects modules and anchors Tra1; loss of EAF1 dissociates the complex and reduces Esa1 targeting in vivo (Setiaputra, 2018; Laframboise excerpts) (setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42, laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).

Functional roles and pathways
- Transcription: Esa1/NuA4 acts as a transcriptional adaptor/coactivator, with H4/H2A acetylation loosening nucleosome–DNA interactions to facilitate activator-driven transcription on chromatin templates (EMBO J., 1999) (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3). Genome-wide syntheses indicate NuA4 contributes differentially across gene classes and housekeeping programs (Setiaputra, 2018) (setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42).
- DNA repair: NuA4 is recruited to DSBs and its acetylation promotes chromatin remodeling and H2A.Z exchange; Esa1 depletion or NuA4 subunit mutations sensitize cells to DNA damage and impair NER (Hodges, 2019; Laframboise excerpts) (hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3, laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 18-22, laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22).
- Lipid and organelle biology: NuA4/Esa1 influence phospholipid metabolism and organelle morphology, including nuclear shape and vacuole integrity, via regulation of Pah1 localization/function and NVJ/PMN processes (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2024-07) (laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 92-95).

Ambiguities and limitations
- Non-acetyl acylations: Although UniProt indicates Esa1 can catalyze non-acetyl acylations (e.g., crotonylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation) in some contexts, our current evidence set for yeast Esa1 does not provide primary 2023–2024 experimental support for these alternative acylations in S. cerevisiae; we therefore treat them as possible but not established here (setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42).

Overall conclusion
Esa1 (UniProt Q08649) is the essential yeast MYST acetyltransferase that catalyzes histone H4/H2A tail acetylation within the NuA4 complex and its Piccolo module, executing key roles in transcriptional coactivation and multiple DNA repair pathways in the nucleus. Recent 2023–2024 structural studies unify a modular architectural model and reveal mechanisms for long-range chromatin acetylation that depend on platform subunits (Eaf1/Swc4) and linker elements (Epl1), with conserved parallels to human TIP60. Emerging yeast studies extend NuA4/Esa1 function to membrane and lipid biology, linking chromatin acetylation to organelle morphology and phospholipid metabolism (allard1999nua4anessential pages 2-3, laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 18-22, laframboise2025uncoveringtheroles pages 18-22, hodges2019nua4acetyltransferaseis pages 1-3, ji2022structureofthea pages 1-3, setiaputra2018investigatingthemolecular pages 38-42, laframboise2025uncoveringtherolesa pages 92-95).
