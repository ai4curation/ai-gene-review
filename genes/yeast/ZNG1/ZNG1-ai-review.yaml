  id: NCBITaxon:559292
  label: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
description: ZNG1 encodes a zinc-regulated GTPase that functions as a zinc chaperone,
  directly transferring zinc cofactor to target metalloproteins. Its primary substrate
  is methionine aminopeptidase MAP1, which removes initiator methionine from nascent
  polypeptides. ZNG1 binds MAP1 through an N-terminal psi-PxLVp motif, transfers zinc
  from its CXCC motif to MAP1 in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner, and releases active
  MAP1 after GTP/GDP exchange. This protein exemplifies the COG0523 family of G3E
  P-loop GTPases that couple nucleotide hydrolysis to metal ion transfer, representing
  a universally conserved mechanism for metalloprotein activation that is often misannotated
  across species.
