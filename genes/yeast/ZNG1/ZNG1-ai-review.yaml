taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:559292
  label: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
description: ZNG1 encodes a zinc-regulated GTPase that functions as a zinc chaperone, directly transferring
  zinc cofactor to target metalloproteins. Its primary substrate is methionine aminopeptidase MAP1, which
  removes initiator methionine from nascent polypeptides. ZNG1 binds MAP1 through an N-terminal psi-PxLVp
  motif, transfers zinc from its CXCC motif to MAP1 in a GTP hydrolysis-dependent manner, and releases
  active MAP1 after GTP/GDP exchange. This protein exemplifies the COG0523 family of G3E P-loop GTPases
  that couple nucleotide hydrolysis to metal ion transfer, representing a universally conserved mechanism
  for metalloprotein activation that is often misannotated across species.

  justification: ZNG1 and the COG0523 family represent a distinct class of GTPases that couple nucleotide
    hydrolysis to metal ion transfer. This term would capture the unique mechanism that distinguishes
    them from other chaperones and GTPases.

  justification: More specific than zinc chaperone activity, emphasizing the direct transfer mechanism
    demonstrated for ZNG1 to MAP1.
