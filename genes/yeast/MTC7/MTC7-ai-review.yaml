description: MTC7 (Maintenance of telomere capping protein 7) is a small membrane
  protein with two transmembrane helices and an exceptionally charged C-terminal domain
  containing 8 consecutive lysines. Identified through genetic screens as a suppressor
  of cdc13-1 temperature-sensitive phenotype, MTC7 contributes to telomere maintenance
  pathways. The protein exhibits unusual structural features suggesting potential
  membrane-nuclear shuttling capabilities, with its C-terminal polybasic tract serving
  as a strong nuclear localization signal while the transmembrane domains anchor it
  to cellular membranes.

  review:
    summary: This is a placeholder annotation indicating no known molecular function.
      Based on genetic evidence showing involvement in telomere capping and the presence
      of a strong C-terminal polybasic tract, the protein likely has DNA-binding or
      protein-binding activities related to telomere maintenance.
