# MTC7 Bioinformatics Analysis Results

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the yeast MTC7 protein (Maintenance of telomere capping protein 7) reveals a small membrane protein with two transmembrane helices and a highly charged C-terminal domain. The protein shows characteristic features of a membrane-anchored protein with potential nuclear/membrane localization signals.

## Key Findings

### 1. Transmembrane Region Analysis

#### Confirmed Transmembrane Helices
- **TM1 (positions 13-33)**: 21 amino acids
  - Sequence: `SHHVLFAEPGFFLCNFFFVLL`
  - 61.9% hydrophobic residues
  - 28.6% aromatic residues
  - Average hydrophobicity: 0.60
  
- **TM2 (positions 42-62)**: 21 amino acids
  - Sequence: `FYFLFILLFIIYIAIIYFVFI`
  - 85.7% hydrophobic residues
  - 42.9% aromatic residues
  - Average hydrophobicity: 1.07
  - High aromatic content at membrane interfaces (4 residues)

Both TM helices follow the positive-inside rule with positive charges in flanking regions, consistent with proper membrane insertion topology.

### 2. Functional Domains and Motifs

#### Polybasic Regions
Two significant polybasic regions were identified:

1. **N-terminal (positions 1-8)**: `MKKEKKTP`
   - 4 lysines in 8 residues
   - Potential membrane association or regulatory role

2. **C-terminal (positions 101-112)**: `LPPQKKKKKKKK`
   - Exceptional stretch of 8 consecutive lysines
   - Strong nuclear localization signal (NLS)
   - Likely critical for nuclear import and/or membrane interactions

#### C-terminal Domain Analysis (positions 63-139)
- Total length: 77 amino acids
- 10 lysines and 5 arginines (19.5% basic residues)
- Contains multiple functional motifs:
  - Strong NLS: `KKKKKKKK` (positions 105-112)
  - Phosphorylation sites: SSR (92), TLR (114)
  - Potential palmitoylation site: CRQC (72-75)

### 3. Structural Features

#### Secondary Structure Prediction
- 18.7% alpha-helix (primarily in TM regions)
- 42.5% beta-sheet tendency
- 38.8% coil/loop regions

#### Disorder Prediction
- Significant disordered region: positions 96-119
- Sequence: `VANPALPPQKKKKKKKKGTLRTGE`
- Overlaps with the polybasic tract, suggesting flexibility for protein interactions

#### AlphaFold Structure
- High-confidence structure available in AlphaFold database
- Accession: P32633
- URL: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P32633
- Model: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/files/AF-P32633-F1-model_v4.pdb

### 4. AlphaFold Structure Analysis

#### Structure Availability
- **AlphaFold Database**: High-quality predicted structure available (AF-P32633-F1)
- **URL**: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P32633
- **PDB Download**: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/files/AF-P32633-F1-model_v4.pdb

#### Structural Confidence (pLDDT Scores)
- **Mean pLDDT**: 54.9 (moderate confidence overall)
- **Range**: 31.5 - 90.2
- **Distribution**:
  - Very high confidence (>90): 1 residue
  - Confident (70-90): 23 residues  
  - Low confidence (50-70): 57 residues
  - Very low confidence (<50): 58 residues

#### Structural Metrics
- **End-to-end distance**: 32.6 Å (relatively compact for 139 residues)
- **Radius of gyration**: 35.0 Å
- **Maximum dimension**: 28.5 Å

#### Transmembrane Region Structure
- **TM1 (13-33)**:
  - Length: 32.8 Å
  - Average rise per residue: 3.85 Å (consistent with alpha-helix)
  - Mean pLDDT: 56.4 (moderate confidence)
  
- **TM2 (42-62)**:
  - Length: 29.9 Å  
  - Average rise per residue: 3.85 Å (consistent with alpha-helix)
  - Mean pLDDT: 82.7 (high confidence)

#### Key Structural Insights
1. **Membrane Topology**: The structure shows two distinct transmembrane helices with TM2 having significantly higher confidence than TM1
2. **C-terminal Domain**: The C-terminal region (residues 63-139) shows low confidence (pLDDT <50), consistent with disorder prediction
3. **Overall Architecture**: The protein adopts an extended conformation with the C-terminal domain projecting away from the membrane regions
4. **Polybasic Regions**: Both N-terminal (1-8) and C-terminal (105-112) polybasic regions are positioned to interact with membrane phospholipids or nuclear components

### 5. Conservation Analysis

#### Recommended Species for Comparative Analysis
Fungal species identified for detailed BLAST analysis:
- Candida albicans (opportunistic pathogen)
- Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
- Neurospora crassa (model filamentous fungus)
- Aspergillus nidulans (model Aspergillus)
- Cryptococcus neoformans (basidiomycete pathogen)
- Kluyveromyces lactis (close Saccharomyces relative)

Note: Direct UniProt homolog search encountered technical issues; manual BLAST searches against these species are recommended for comprehensive conservation analysis.

## Functional Implications

### Membrane Topology
The protein likely adopts a Type II membrane protein topology:
- N-terminus in cytoplasm (with polybasic region)
- Two membrane-spanning helices
- C-terminus in cytoplasm (with strong polybasic tract)

### Subcellular Localization
Multiple features suggest dual membrane/nuclear localization:
1. Two transmembrane helices anchor the protein to membranes
2. Strong C-terminal NLS (KKKKKKKK) for nuclear import
3. Potential palmitoylation site for additional membrane association
4. Name suggests telomere-related function (nuclear)

### Potential Functional Mechanisms
1. **Membrane-Nuclear Shuttling**: The unusual combination of TM helices and strong NLS suggests potential regulated release from membranes for nuclear functions
2. **Membrane Tethering**: The C-terminal polybasic tract could interact with acidic phospholipids
3. **Protein-Protein Interactions**: The disordered C-terminal region with polybasic tract may serve as a flexible interaction platform

## Analysis Quality and Limitations

### Strengths
- Multiple complementary analyses provide consistent picture
- AlphaFold structure available for validation
- Clear identification of key functional motifs

### Limitations
- Conservation analysis limited by API issues
- Secondary structure predictions are computational (not experimental)
- Functional annotations are predictions requiring experimental validation

## Recommendations for Future Analysis

1. **BLAST Analysis**: Perform comprehensive BLAST searches against fungal genomes to identify orthologs
2. **Multiple Sequence Alignment**: Align identified orthologs to assess conservation of:
   - Transmembrane regions
   - C-terminal polybasic tract
   - Potential phosphorylation sites
3. **Structural Analysis**: Examine AlphaFold structure for:
   - Membrane insertion topology
   - C-terminal domain organization
   - Potential interaction surfaces
4. **Experimental Validation**: Key experiments would include:
   - Subcellular localization studies
   - Mutagenesis of polybasic regions
   - Membrane association assays
