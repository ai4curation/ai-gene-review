description: >-
  ATP10 (Atp10p) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial inner membrane protein required
  for assembly of the F0 sector of the mitochondrial F1-F0 ATP synthase complex.
  It functions as a specific assembly factor (chaperone) for Atp6p (subunit 6),
  binding newly synthesized Atp6p on mitochondrial ribosomes and facilitating its
  incorporation into a partially assembled ATPase subcomplex (PMID:14998992).
  Atp10p is not a subunit of the mature ATPase complex itself, nor is it a
  general-purpose chaperone; it acts specifically on Atp6p during the assembly
  process (PMID:2141026). Mutations in ATP10 cause loss of rutamycin sensitivity
  and defective F0 assembly (PMID:2141026).

      IBA annotation for mitochondrial inner membrane localization. Atp10p is
      well-established as a mitochondrial inner membrane protein. Ackerman and
      Tzagoloff (PMID:2141026) showed the protein is associated with the
      mitochondrial membrane. Tzagoloff et al. (PMID:14998992) further
      demonstrated that Atp10p is an inner membrane component that interacts
      with newly synthesized Atp6p. UniProt also records subcellular location
      as mitochondrion inner membrane. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for mitochondrial ATP synthase complex assembly. This is
      the core biological process function of Atp10p. The original
      characterization (PMID:2141026) identified ATP10 as a nuclear gene
      required for assembly of the mitochondrial F1-F0 complex, and the
      follow-up study (PMID:14998992) demonstrated that Atp10p specifically

      (PMID:14998992), with Atp6p (SGD:S000007268) in the WITH/FROM column.
      The authors proposed that Atp10p functions as an "Atp6p-specific chaperone"
      based on cross-linking experiments showing Atp10p interacts with newly
      synthesized Atp6p. However, Atp10p is not a general unfolded protein
      binder -- it is a highly specific assembly factor for a single client
      (Atp6p). It does not bind a range of unfolded proteins, nor does it
      possess a recognizable chaperone domain. The term GO:0051082 implies
      a broader substrate specificity than what is demonstrated. Atp10p's
      function is better described as stabilizing Atp6p during assembly and
      facilitating its incorporation into the F0 subcomplex, which is an
      assembly factor activity rather than a general chaperone/unfolded protein
      binding activity. This is consistent with how other mitochondrial
      assembly factors (PET100, COX20, SHY1) in this project have been
      handled, where GO:0051082 was marked as over-annotated. GO:0044183
      (protein folding chaperone) is also inappropriate because Atp10p does
      not actively fold proteins. The most appropriate MF annotation would
      be GO:0140777 (protein-containing complex stabilizing activity), which
      captures the stabilization of unassembled subunits during complex
      assembly, analogous to what IBA already provides for the closely
      related ATP11 gene.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Atp10p is a specific assembly factor for Atp6p, not a general unfolded
      protein binder. The literature (PMID:14998992) explicitly describes it

      implies broader substrate binding that is not supported by evidence.
      Atp10p does not possess a recognizable chaperone domain and does not
      actively fold proteins; it stabilizes Atp6p during F0 assembly. This is
      consistent with the handling of other mitochondrial assembly factors in
      the UPB project (PET100, COX20, SHY1), where GO:0051082 was marked as
      over-annotated. GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is also not
      appropriate because Atp10p does not catalyze protein folding. A better MF
      annotation would be GO:0140777 (protein-containing complex stabilizing
      activity), which is already used for the related assembly factor ATP11.

- description: >-
    Atp10p stabilizes newly synthesized Atp6p during assembly of the F0 sector
    of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. It binds Atp6p after translation on
    mitochondrial ribosomes and facilitates its incorporation into an intermediate
    ATPase subcomplex. In the absence of Atp10p, Atp6p is rapidly degraded.
    This is a protein-containing complex stabilizing activity, not a general
    chaperone or foldase function.
