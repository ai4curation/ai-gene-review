  TIM22 is the essential core channel-forming subunit of the TIM22 complex in the
  mitochondrial inner membrane. It forms a voltage-activated, signal-gated twin-pore
  translocase that mediates the insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the
  inner membrane. Cryo-EM of the endogenous yeast TIM22 complex at 3.8 angstrom
  resolution (Zhang et al. 2021, doi:10.1038/s41422-020-00399-0) revealed a 7-subunit
  architecture (Tim22, Tim54, Tim18, Sdh3, Tim9, Tim10, Tim12) with Tim22 possessing 4
  transmembrane helices, a C42-C141 disulfide bond between TM1 and TM2, and conserved
  charged residues (E140, D190, K127, K169) critical for function -- single mutants
  such as E140A or K127A severely impair growth. The hexameric small-Tim chaperone ring
  (Tim9/Tim10/Tim12) sits tilted approximately 45 degrees relative to the membrane
  plane. Notably, the cryo-EM structure did not reveal a clear open translocation pore
  in the captured state, fueling debate about whether TIM22 operates via
  conformationally gated pore formation in distinct functional states or via an
  insertase-like mechanism that lowers the energetic barrier for helix insertion by
  altering local bilayer properties. Canonical TIM22 substrates are 6-TM metabolite
  carriers (e.g., Aac2/Pet9 ADP/ATP carrier, Pic/Pic2 phosphate carrier, Dic1
  dicarboxylate carrier), but the substrate spectrum extends to non-canonical cargos
  including 4-TM translocase subunits (Tim17, Tim22, Tim23) and mitochondrial pyruvate
  carrier (MPC) subunits with fewer transmembrane segments. TIM22 recognizes internal
  targeting signals (not N-terminal presequences) and uses the membrane potential
  (Delta-psi) as external driving force. It is distinct from the TIM23 complex, which
  imports presequence-containing matrix proteins. Recent work has revealed functional
  crosstalk between the TIM22 complex and the Yme1 i-AAA protease quality control
  machinery: Yme1 is required for stability of the TIM22 complex and for proteostasis
  of TIM22 pathway substrates, with a small transient pool of Yme1 associating with
  TIM22 (Kumar et al. 2023, doi:10.1242/jcs.260060). Loss of Yme1 leads to
  accumulation of TIM22 substrates outside mitochondria and compromised respiration.
  Substrate delivery to the TIM22 complex is performed by the small TIM chaperones
  (Tim9-Tim10, Tim8-Tim13) in the intermembrane space.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for mitochondrion targeting sequence binding. TIM22 does bind
      targeting signals, but specifically internal targeting signals of carrier
      proteins, not the classical N-terminal matrix targeting presequences. The term
      GO:0030943 is defined broadly as "Binding to a mitochondrion targeting sequence,
      a specific peptide sequence that acts as a signal to localize the protein within
      the mitochondrion" -- this is broad enough to encompass internal targeting
      signals. Kovermann et al. (PMID:11864609) demonstrated that reconstituted Tim22
      forms a channel that "specifically responds to an internal targeting signal, but
      not to presequences." The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and the term
      is acceptable, though imprecise about the type of targeting signal recognized.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      GO:0030943 is defined broadly enough to cover internal targeting signal binding.
      TIM22 has been experimentally shown to recognize internal targeting signals of

      mitochondrial targeting signal binding" would be ideal, GO:0030943 is the best

      This Reactome pathway describes the TOM-mediated import step, not TIM22 function
      per se. TIM22 does have domains exposed to the IMS (the N-terminal and
      C-terminal regions per UniProt topology), so there is some basis for IMS
      localization, but the primary localization is the inner membrane itself. This

- description: >-
    TIM22 is the essential voltage-activated, signal-gated channel subunit of the
    TIM22 translocase that mediates insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins
    into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Tim22 has a 4-transmembrane helix
    architecture with conserved charged residues (E140, D190, K127, K169) critical
    for function and a C42-C141 disulfide bond (Zhang et al. 2021,
    DOI:10.1038/s41422-020-00399-0). The channel specifically recognizes internal
    targeting signals of carrier proteins but not N-terminal presequences, and is
    driven by the membrane potential (Delta-psi). The precise translocation mechanism
    remains debated: cryo-EM did not capture an open pore state, suggesting Tim22 may
    operate via conformationally gated pore formation in distinct functional states or
    via an insertase-like mechanism that lowers the energetic barrier for helix
    insertion by altering local bilayer properties.
