2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TIM22' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TIM22** (gene ID: TIM22, UniProt: Q12328) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — TIM22 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c; UniProt Q12328; YDL217C)

Publication date of this report: 2026-02-20.

1. Target verification (mandatory)

Identity confirmed for the requested target: TIM22 in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain S288c), corresponding to the mitochondrial inner membrane translocase subunit Tim22 and the Tim17/Tim22/Tim23 family. The yeast Tim22 is repeatedly described in yeast-focused primary literature as the essential core subunit of the TIM22 “carrier translocase” (inner-membrane insertase) that works together with yeast-specific partner subunits Tim54, Tim18, and Sdh3 plus small Tim chaperones (Tim9/Tim10/Tim12). This matches the UniProt-provided identity and distinguishes the yeast system from mammalian TIMM22 assemblies that contain Tim29 and AGK and lack Tim54/Tim18. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2, qi2021cryoemstructureof pages 1-3)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

2.1. What Tim22 is

Tim22 (gene: TIM22; locus: YDL217C) is the core, multi-pass inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) subunit of the yeast TIM22 complex, which functions as the dedicated inner-membrane insertase/translocase for hydrophobic, multi-pass “carrier pathway” substrates. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

2.2. The TIM22 pathway (carrier pathway)

In the “carrier pathway,” hydrophobic multi-pass precursors are first imported through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and then escorted through the intermembrane space (IMS) by soluble/IMS small Tim chaperones (notably Tim9/Tim10, with Tim12 involved in docking), which deliver substrates to the TIM22 translocase for insertion into the IMM. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2, kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4)

2.3. Canonical vs non-canonical TIM22 cargo

Canonical TIM22 cargos are metabolite carrier proteins with six transmembrane segments (e.g., Aac2/Pet9 ADP/ATP carrier; Pic/Pic2 phosphate carrier; Dic1 dicarboxylate carrier). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 12-15)

Non-canonical cargo spectrum has expanded beyond six-TM carriers. In yeast-focused discussions and experiments, the TIM22 pathway is described as also supporting insertion/biogenesis of some translocase subunits with four transmembrane segments (Tim17, Tim22, Tim23) and of “unconventional” clients such as mitochondrial pyruvate carrier subunits (MPCs; fewer TM helices) and proteins with odd numbers of transmembrane segments. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2022functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 30-32)

3. Molecular composition, localization, and structural organization

3.1. Complex composition (yeast)

A cryo-EM structure of the endogenous S. cerevisiae TIM22 complex defines seven subunits: Tim22, Tim18, Tim54, Sdh3, Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12. (Cell Research; published Sep 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-020-00399-0) (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

Genetic/biochemical work describes the TIM22 machinery as a ~300 kDa complex comprising a membrane module (Tim22, Tim54, Tim18, Sdh3) and a peripheral module consisting of small Tim chaperones (Tim9, Tim10, Tim12). (Journal of Cell Science; published Jul 2020; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.244632) (kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 1-4)

3.2. Subunit roles

Tim22 is described as the central core/channel subunit; Tim54 functions as an adaptor for docking small Tim chaperones; Tim18 and Sdh3 contribute to complex stability and assembly. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 1-4)

In the yeast cryo-EM model, Tim54 is membrane-anchored and appears positioned to help hold the small Tim ring in a tilted conformation, consistent with a role in organizing substrate delivery. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 2-3)

3.3. Localization and topology

Tim22 is a multi-pass IMM protein whose functional activity is in the inner membrane, with key interactions on the IMS side where small Tim chaperones deliver substrates from TOM. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

In yeast TIM22 cryo-EM, Tim22 is a four-transmembrane (4-TM) subunit; Tim18 and Sdh3 each have three TMs; Tim54 is anchored by an N-terminal TM (residues 37–71). (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

Figure-based evidence for the arrangement of Tim22, Tim54, Tim18, Sdh3 and the small Tim hexameric ring is shown in the overall architecture of the yeast TIM22 complex (Figure 1). (zhang2021structureofthe media 0583fe89)

3.4. Structural understanding and mechanistic implications

Yeast TIM22 cryo-EM was solved at 3.8 Å resolution, revealing: (i) a hexameric small-Tim ring with a ~45° tilt; (ii) a Tim22 disulfide bond between C42 and C141; and (iii) a Tim22 transmembrane surface enriched in conserved charged residues implicated in function (E140, D190, K127, K169). (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

Notably, the yeast structure did not display a clear translocation pore in the captured state. The authors discuss that this may represent an idle/intermediate conformation, and they outline alternative mechanistic models (e.g., potential pore formation in other states and/or an insertase-like mechanism that lowers the energetic barrier for helix insertion by altering local bilayer properties). (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2, zhang2021structureofthe pages 2-3)

4. Primary function and pathway placement

4.1. Primary function

Tim22’s primary function is to act as the essential core element of the TIM22 carrier translocase responsible for the insertion/biogenesis of hydrophobic multi-pass inner-membrane proteins (especially metabolite carriers) into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Tim22 is not an enzyme and does not catalyze a chemical reaction; rather, it functions as an insertase/translocase channel component in protein import. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 15-16)

4.2. Substrate specificity (functional annotation)

Based on yeast genetic/biochemical evidence, representative canonical substrates include six-TM metabolite carriers: Pic/Pic2, Aac2/Pet9, and Dic1. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 12-15)

Non-canonical substrates/cargo classes supported in the retrieved sources include:

• TIM22-pathway insertion/biogenesis of some translocase components with ~4 TM helices: Tim17, Tim22, and Tim23. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 1-4)

• Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier subunits (MPCs) as unconventional cargos (consistent with a broadened TIM22 client spectrum). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kumar2022functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 30-32)

4.3. Interacting partners and pathway integration

Within mitochondria, TIM22 pathway operation is integrated with:

• Small Tim chaperone system (Tim9/Tim10/Tim12; also Tim8/Tim13 in related contexts), which ferries substrates in the IMS and docks them to the membrane insertase. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2, kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4)

• Porin/VDAC (Por1), reported to interact with the TIM22 complex to promote carrier biogenesis. (kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 1-4)

• MICOS, reported in the context of TIM22-mediated carrier biogenesis (association of TIM22 with MICOS). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11)

• Respiratory chain component Sdh3, which is both a complex II membrane subunit and a TIM22 component (dual-role integration between metabolism/respiration and protein import). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2)

5. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

5.1. TIM22–Yme1 proteostasis crosstalk (2023 primary literature)

A 2023 Journal of Cell Science study reported functional and genetic crosstalk between the TIM22 carrier translocase and the i-AAA protease Yme1 in S. cerevisiae. Key points:

• Yme1 is required for stability of the TIM22 complex and for proteostasis of TIM22 pathway substrates. (Journal of Cell Science; published Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.260060) (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 1-2)

• A small, non-stoichiometric pool of Yme1 associates transiently with TIM22 (Yme1 interacting with Tim18-FLAG), supporting a direct physical proximity between import machinery and quality control protease. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11)

• Loss of Yme1 leads to accumulation of TIM22 substrates outside mitochondria, altered mitochondrial morphology, increased mtDNA transfer, and compromised respiration; reducing TIM22 activity (e.g., deleting Tim18) reduced cargo accumulation and promoted survival in yme1Δ contexts. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11)

Interpretation/expert analysis: This body of work supports a modern view of Tim22 not only as a constitutive import factor but as a node in a regulated proteostasis network, where import capacity and inner-membrane quality control are functionally coupled and can be genetically tuned to mitigate mitochondrial stress caused by substrate overload. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11, kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4)

5.2. 2024 authoritative mini-review synthesis (Biochemical Society Transactions)

A 2024 Biochemical Society Transactions mini-review synthesizes recent evidence that Yme1 contributes to TIM22 pathway robustness, including degradation of misfolded/unassembled small Tim chaperones (notably differential susceptibility of Tim10 vs Tim9), and that loss of Yme1 reduces TIM22 stability and import efficiency especially under heat stress. (published Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20240450) (kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4, kan2024roleofyme1 pages 2-3)

5.3. 2024 discovery of a mitochondrial mega-assembly containing multiple carrier substrates (MIMAS)

A 2024 Cell Reports paper identified MIMAS, a ~3 MDa inner-membrane mega-assembly comprising metabolite carriers (including Aac2 and others) and many respiratory chain biogenesis factors, suggesting that carrier proteins (TIM22 pathway products) can physically co-reside in large multifunctional assemblies with metabolic and respiratory biogenesis modules. (published Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.113772) (horten2024identificationofmimas pages 3-5, horten2024identificationofmimas pages 1-3)

Important limitation: the extracted text does not explicitly state that Tim22/TIM22 is a structural component of MIMAS; it documents that several carrier proteins that are canonical TIM22 cargos (e.g., AAC/Aac2) are present and crosslink to other MIMAS components, but the mechanistic connection to TIM22-mediated insertion is inferential rather than directly demonstrated in the excerpts retrieved here. (horten2024identificationofmimas pages 5-6, horten2024identificationofmimas pages 3-5)

6. Current applications and real-world implementations

6.1. TIM22 modulation as a strategy to manage mitochondrial import stress (yeast model application)

In yeast, genetic modulation of TIM22 pathway activity (e.g., deleting the TIM22 accessory subunit Tim18) was implemented to relieve the accumulation burden of TIM22 substrates in Yme1-deficient cells, suppressing defects in mitochondrial morphology and respiration-associated phenotypes. This is a concrete experimental “implementation” of TIM22 pathway tuning as an intervention in organelle proteostasis. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11)

6.2. Mitochondrial import engineering for allotopic expression (2024 Genetics)

A 2024 Genetics study evaluated practical import/biogenesis-factor overexpression strategies to improve internalization of an allotopically expressed Cox2W56R precursor in yeast. It reported that overproduction of Cox20, Oxa1, and Pse1 facilitated Cox2W56R internalization and improved respiratory growth, whereas overproducing TIM22 components had only limited benefit and overproducing TIM23-related components was detrimental. (published Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae058) (nietopanqueva2024identificationoffactors pages 1-2)

Implication: While TIM22 is central for carrier insertion, simply increasing TIM22 components may not generically improve import of engineered membrane proteins (such as allotopically expressed Cox2), emphasizing pathway/substrate specificity in mitochondrial engineering approaches. (nietopanqueva2024identificationoffactors pages 1-2)

6.3. Methods for monitoring inner-membrane insertion pathways (context)

Recent methodological work emphasizes assays adaptable to monitoring import into the inner membrane via TIM22 as part of mechanistic mitochondrial protein import studies (Methods in Enzymology; 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2024.07.033). (Note: detailed method performance metrics were not extracted in the current evidence set.) (kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4)

7. Quantitative/statistical highlights (recent studies)

7.1. TIM22 complex and chaperone module sizes

• Yeast TIM22 complex migrates at ~300 kDa by BN-PAGE (immunodecorated for Tim54 and Tim22). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 7-7)

• Small Tim chaperone module Tim9/Tim10 is described as a soluble heterohexameric complex of ~70 kDa in the IMS. (kumar2020conservedregionsof pages 1-4)

7.2. Structural metrics

• Yeast TIM22 cryo-EM resolution: 3.8 Å. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

• Small Tim ring orientation: ~45° tilt relative to the membrane. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

• Tim54 membrane anchor: N-terminal TM spanning residues 37–71. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

7.3. Functional residues and phenotype-linked data

• Tim22 disulfide: C42–C141 in yeast (between TM1 and TM2). (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

• Conserved charged residues implicated in function: E140, D190, K127, K169; single mutants (E140A or K127A) severely impair growth; combined mutants can be essentially lethal. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2)

7.4. Recent quantitative experimental conditions from 2023 TIM22–Yme1 study

• Stress dependence: effects compared at 30°C vs 37°C, with pronounced destabilization of TIM22 complex at 37°C in yme1Δ background. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 7-7)

• Replication and sampling: n=3 biological replicates; ≥50 cells scored for mitochondrial morphology analyses. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 7-7, kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11)

• Additional parameters: cycloheximide (CYH) used at 100 ng/mL in stress/translation-modulation experiments; mtDNA staining at 10 µM SYTO18 for 15 min. (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 7-7)

7.5. MIMAS quantitative parameters (2024 Cell Reports)

• MIMAS complex size: ~3 MDa, resolving into peaks at ~3.3 and ~2.5 MDa (MIMAS-A and MIMAS-B). (horten2024identificationofmimas pages 3-5, horten2024identificationofmimas pages 6-8)

• Detergent and salt sensitivity: stable over digitonin:protein ratios 4:1 to 20:1; moderately destabilized at ≥150 mM NaCl; dissociated by dodecylmaltoside or Triton X-100. (horten2024identificationofmimas pages 5-6, horten2024identificationofmimas pages 3-5)

8. Expert opinions and authoritative analysis (synthesis across sources)

8.1. TIM22 as a regulated proteostasis node

The 2023 primary study and the 2024 mini-review converge on the interpretation that TIM22 pathway throughput and assembly are actively monitored by inner-membrane quality control (Yme1), with substrate overload and small-Tim chaperone stability being key stress-sensitive points; modulating TIM22 can alleviate proteostatic stress in specific genetic contexts (yme1Δ). (kumar2023functionalcrosstalkbetween pages 10-11, kan2024roleofyme1 pages 3-4)

8.2. Structural interpretation: pore vs insertase-like action

High-resolution structural work in yeast provides a framework for mechanistic inference: while Tim22 is a 4-TM core component, the captured endogenous complex lacked a clear open pore, supporting the view that TIM22 may operate through conformationally gated or transient translocation states and/or via an insertion mechanism that locally remodels bilayer energetics to facilitate helix insertion. (zhang2021structureofthe pages 1-2, zhang2021structureofthe pages 2-3)
