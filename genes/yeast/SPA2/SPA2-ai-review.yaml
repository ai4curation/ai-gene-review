description: Polarity-associated protein SPA2 is a large scaffolding protein essential for establishing and maintaining cell polarity in budding yeast. SPA2 localizes to sites of polarized growth (bud tip, mating projection, bud neck) where it functions as a core component of the polarisome complex together with Pea2p and Bud6p. SPA2 serves as a scaffold for recruiting and organizing multiple functional modules including actin cable assembly through interaction with formin Bni1, MAPK signaling pathway components, and proteins involved in bud site selection and cytokinesis. The protein contains multiple functional domains including conserved SHD (SPA2 Homology Domain) regions critical for protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal region containing tandem repeats.

  review:
    summary: SPA2 is a core component of the incipient bud site, localizing to sites of polarized growth before the bud is morphologically evident. This early and consistent localization is a defining characteristic of SPA2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Strong experimental evidence (IDA in primary literature) demonstrates SPA2 as an early marker of polarized growth sites. IBA assignment is appropriate for this well-conserved localization property across orthologs.

  review:
