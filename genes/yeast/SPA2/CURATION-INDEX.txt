CURATION RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

TOTAL ANNOTATIONS REVIEWED: 60

ACTIONS TAKEN:
  ACCEPT: 43 (72%) - Core polarity and scaffolding functions
  KEEP_AS_NON_CORE: 10 (17%) - Secondary developmental/stress functions
  REMOVE: 5 (8%) - Uninformative or false positive annotations
  UNDECIDED: 0 (0%) - All had adequate evidence

SPECIFIC REMOVALS:
  - GO:0005515 (protein binding) × 4 entries - Generic, uninformative
  - GO:0005826 (actomyosin contractile ring) × 1 - False positive from phylogenetic inference

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. SPA2 is exceptionally well-characterized scaffolding protein
  2. Evidence quality is EXCELLENT across all annotation types
  3. Multiple evidence codes (IDA/IBA/IMP) confirm core functions
  4. Clear distinction between core and secondary functions
  5. 4 uninformative generic binding terms should be removed
  6. 1 false localization→function inference should be removed

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

STEP 1: REVIEW
  - Database curators review this entire curation package
  - Specific focus on: README-CURATION.md recommendations section
  - Approve removal of 5 problematic annotations
  - Approve non-core designation for 10 secondary functions

STEP 2: VALIDATE
  - Confirm YAML syntax of SPA2-ai-review-UPDATED.yaml
  - Run against GO database schema validation
  - Compare original vs. updated counts (54→55 net changes due to structure)

STEP 3: REPLACE
  - Backup original: SPA2-ai-review.yaml
  - Replace with: SPA2-ai-review-UPDATED.yaml
  - Update database GO annotations for SPA2

STEP 4: ARCHIVE
  - Archive all analysis documents in gene record
  - Reference this curation in gene history/provenance
  - Use as model for other scaffolding protein annotations

STEP 5: MONITOR
  - Track new SPA2-related publications
  - Update annotations if new functions identified
  - Monitor GO term definitions for compatibility

================================================================================
KEY MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS (QUICK REFERENCE)
================================================================================

CORE FUNCTIONS:
1. Polarisome scaffolding - Organizes SPA2-Pea2p-Bud6p complex
2. MAPK pathway recruitment - SPA2 recruits Mkk1/2/Mpk1p via SHD-I
3. Actin organization - Interacts with Bni1p formin for cable nucleation
4. Protein localization - Hub that targets 10+ proteins to growth sites
5. Bud site selection - Essential for bipolar budding in diploids

STRUCTURAL DOMAINS:
- N-terminus (1-150 aa): Localization domain - necessary & sufficient for targeting
- SHD-I: MAPK component recruitment
- SHD-II: Pea2p interaction - critical for complex stability
- C-terminus: Tandem repeats (25×9 aa) - likely interaction platform

FUNCTIONAL MODULES:
- Actin Module: SPA2 → Bud6p → Bni1p
- Signaling Module: SPA2 → Mkk1/2 → Mpk1p
- Localization Module: SPA2 → Msb3/4, septins, etc.

WHY GO:0005826 IS REMOVED:
- Contractile ring = myosin-driven actin contraction
- SPA2 at neck = septin ring organization, not myosin contraction
- Localization proximity ≠ functional participation

WHY GO:0005515 IS REMOVED:
- Generic protein binding is uninformative
- Specific terms already capture interactions:
  * GO:0005078 (scaffold) for MAPK recruitment
  * GO:0000133 (polarisome) for complex assembly
  * GO:0032956 (actin) for formin interaction
