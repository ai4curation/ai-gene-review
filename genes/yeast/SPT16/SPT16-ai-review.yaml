description: SPT16 is a core subunit of the FACT complex (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription), an essential
  histone chaperone that reorganizes nucleosomes during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair.
  SPT16 comprises three domains (N-terminal, middle with double PH domains, and C-terminal acidic region)
  that enable interaction with histones H3/H4 and H2A/H2B dimers, facilitating nucleosome disassembly
  during polymerase passage and nucleosome reassembly afterward. SPT16 is also known as CDC68 (cell division
  control protein 68).

    label: nucleosome disassembly
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Nucleosome disassembly is a well-established core function of SPT16/FACT during transcription
      elongation. IBA (ortholog inference) is appropriate evidence for this deeply characterized function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16 is a core component of FACT complex that actively facilitates nucleosome disassembly
      ahead of RNA polymerase II during transcription. The deep research and extensive literature (including
      Perplexity review citing structural studies showing Spt16 interactions with H3-H4 and H2A-H2B during
      nucleosome disruption) strongly support this annotation. This is a primary and essential function.

    label: regulation of DNA-templated transcription elongation
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Regulation of transcription elongation is a core function of SPT16/FACT. The complex facilitates
      passage of RNA polymerase II through chromatin by modulating nucleosome structure.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16/FACT is directly involved in promoting transcription elongation by managing nucleosome
      dynamics. The evidence includes multiple studies showing FACT travels with elongating polymerase
      II (Mason & Struhl 2003, PMID:14585989) and facilitates fidelity of transcription (evidenced by
      suppression of cryptic initiation). This is a primary function, not merely a side effect.

    label: FACT complex
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SPT16 is a core structural component of the FACT complex. This annotation represents membership
      in the complex with strong phylogenetic support.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16 forms an obligate heterodimeric complex with POB3 (Pob3p) as documented in UniProt and
      extensively in the literature. IBA evidence from orthologs (SSRP1/SPT16 in other organisms) is appropriate
      for this structural annotation.

    label: nucleus
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: SPT16 is localized to the nucleus, where it functions in chromatin-associated processes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is well-established for SPT16 through multiple studies showing chromatin-association
      and co-localization with active transcription sites. While IEA is less specific than experimental
      evidence, nuclear localization is a foundational fact confirmed by direct observation (PMID:10413469).
      This is a valid cellular component annotation.
- term:
    id: GO:0005694
    label: chromosome
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: SPT16 is localized to chromatin/chromosomes where it functions in nucleosome reorganization
      during transcription and replication.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16 specifically associates with chromatin and DNA during its biological functions. This
      is explicitly documented - UniProt states 'Colocalizes with RNA polymerase II on chromatin' and
      associates with coding regions of histone genes. The annotation is accurate and important for describing
      where the protein functions.
- term:
    id: GO:0006260
    label: DNA replication
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: SPT16 is involved in DNA replication through its role in nucleosome disassembly ahead of
      replication forks and histone recycling to daughter strands.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16/FACT is essential for normal replication fork progression. The deep research documents
      that FACT associates with replication fork components (MCM2-7, Pol alpha) and that SSRP1/SPT16 depletion
      slows replication forks. The Spt16-N domain interacts with MCM2-7 complex and fork protection complex,
      enabling parental histone recycling during replication.

    id: GO:0006281
    label: DNA repair
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: SPT16 participates in DNA repair, particularly base excision repair, through cooperation
      with chromatin remodelers.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UniProt function section states FACT plays a role in DNA repair. The deep research documentation
      mentions FACT recruitment to DNA damage sites and cooperation with remodelers to expose damaged
      DNA for repair (BER pathway). While less extensively characterized than transcription roles, the
      involvement is documented and scientifically valid.

    label: DNA-templated transcription
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: SPT16 is fundamentally involved in DNA-templated transcription through its role in nucleosome
      dynamics during transcription.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16/FACT is a transcription elongation factor essential for efficient transcription through
      chromatin. This broad annotation captures the core transcriptional role of the protein. IEA from
      UniProt keyword mapping is appropriate for this well-established function.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: SPT16 participates in DNA damage response through recruitment to damaged chromatin and cooperation
      with repair machinery.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UniProt function section mentions DNA repair role and the deep research documents FACT recruitment
      to DNA damage sites. The involvement in BER and interaction with DNA damage-responsive proteins
      supports this annotation.
- term:
    id: GO:0010468
    label: regulation of gene expression
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: While SPT16 does participate in gene expression regulation, this term is very broad and less
      informative than the specific transcription annotations already present.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is not incorrect, but it represents a general consequence of SPT16's core
      transcriptional functions rather than a distinct molecular function. More specific GO terms (transcription
      elongation, nucleosome disassembly, etc.) better capture SPT16's specific contributions to gene
      regulation. The annotation should be retained because it is accurate, but marked as non-core.
- term:
    id: GO:0034728
    label: nucleosome organization
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: Nucleosome organization is a core function of SPT16/FACT, encompassing both disassembly and
      reassembly activities during transcription and replication.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SPT16 directly organizes nucleosomes by controlling their disassembly and reassembly. This
      is documented throughout literature and is one of the defining functions of the protein. The term
      appropriately captures the holistic role of nucleosome management.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This duplicate annotation (same GO term as IBA annotation above) documents FACT complex membership
      through automated methods. Both evidence codes are valid.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Duplicate annotations with different evidence codes are acceptable in GO. The IEA source (InterPro)
      provides orthogonal confirmation of FACT complex membership. Both IBA and IEA annotations should
      be retained.

    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:11805837
  review:
    summary: SPT16 engages in multiple specific protein-protein interactions documented through mass spectrometry
      and other methods. However, 'protein binding' is a generic term that doesn't specify the functional
      nature of these interactions.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Per GO curation guidelines, 'protein binding' is discouraged when more specific molecular
      function terms are available. SPT16's interactions are better characterized through specific terms
      like 'histone binding' (GO:0042393), 'nucleosome binding' (GO:0031491), and 'identical protein binding'
      (GO:0042802). These IPI annotations document real interactions but the term lacks specificity. Retain
      but mark non-core.

    summary: Multiple instances of the same GO:0005515 term with different specific interaction partners
      from IntAct database.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Each IPI annotation documents real protein-protein interactions with different partners, but
      the generic 'protein binding' term obscures the specificity of individual interactions. More specific
      terms would be preferable. Retain these annotations as non-core given availability of more specific

      However, SPT16 primarily functions as a heterodimer with POB3 in the FACT complex.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While the identical protein binding annotation is technically supported by the IPI evidence,
      SPT16's primary functional form is the heterodimer with POB3. The homodimeric interaction may reflect
      database artifacts or may occur under specialized conditions. This annotation should be retained
      but marked non-core as it does not capture the primary functional form. SPT16 forms obligate heterodimer
      with POB3 according to UniProt and extensive literature, but can interact with itself as documented
      in IntAct.
