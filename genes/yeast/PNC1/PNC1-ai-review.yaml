description: 'Nicotinamidase (Pnc1p), a key enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway that catalyzes deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid. Plays critical roles in NAD+ metabolism and is a longevity gene responsive to caloric restriction and stress conditions. Functions in telomeric and rDNA silencing through Sir2p regulation. Localizes to cytoplasm, nucleus, and peroxisomes.'

    label: chromosome, telomeric region
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: 'Localization to telomeric chromatin is inferred computationally. While PNC1 is known to regulate telomeric silencing, the IEA inference mechanism (logical inference) is based on the IMP annotation for subtelomeric heterochromatin formation. This is acceptable as it represents a reasonable inference from the mechanistic role of PNC1, but it is not a direct experimental observation of localization to telomeric regions.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The annotation reflects PNC1s regulatory role in telomeric silencing, though based on computational inference rather than direct localization evidence. The mechanistic connection is sound: PNC1 removes nicotinamide (an inhibitor of Sir2) to enable Sir2-mediated telomeric heterochromatin formation (PMID:11901108, PMID:12736687). This is supported by IDA evidence for nuclear localization and functional involvement in telomeric silencing.'

    action: ACCEPT

    summary: 'Molecular function annotation assigned via combined automated methods, likely based on EC number (3.5.1.19) and sequence homology. This is the core enzymatic function of PNC1.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Nicotinamidase activity is the primary and well-characterized enzymatic function of PNC1. The EC number 3.5.1.19 directly classifies it as a nicotinamidase. This is strongly supported by multiple publications (PMID:12736687, PMID:11901108, PMID:19381334) demonstrating the catalytic conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid. This is a core and essential annotation.'

    summary: 'Parent term for nicotinamidase activity based on enzyme classification. GO:0008936 (nicotinamidase activity) is more specific and informative. However, the parent term is not incorrect.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is the correct parent term for the specific nicotinamidase activity. Nicotinamidases are amidohydrolases (EC 3.5.1.19), so this annotation is mechanistically accurate. While the more specific term (GO:0008936) is preferable for precision, retaining this parent term is acceptable for comprehensive annotation coverage. Parent and child GO terms can coexist.'

  review:
    summary: 'Process annotation derived from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0662: Pyridine nucleotide biosynthesis). PNC1 is involved in NAD+ salvage pathway, which recycles pyridine nucleotides. This is a reasonable but somewhat indirect annotation.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While PNC1 is mechanistically involved in NAD+ salvage (not de novo biosynthesis), GO:0019363 "pyridine nucleotide biosynthetic process" typically refers to de novo synthesis pathways (e.g., starting from tryptophan). PNC1 catalyzes salvage of nicotinamide to regenerate NAD+ in an existing pool, not biosynthesis of pyridine nucleotides de novo. The more accurate annotation would be GO:0019854 NAD metabolism because PNC1 catalyzes the first committed step in salvaging NAD+ from nicotinamide (PMID:12736687). This is NAD metabolism, not pyridine nucleotide de novo biosynthesis.'

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is correct as a parent term annotation. Zinc is a metal ion, and PNC1 binds zinc as a catalytic cofactor. While GO:0008270 (zinc ion binding) is more specific and is annotated separately, the parent term is not incorrect and provides complementary information. Parent-child GO terms are often both retained for annotation completeness.'

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'RCA (rapid curated annotation) is appropriate for identifying PNC1 as a zinc-binding protein. The source (PMID:30358795) is a comprehensive zinc proteome study that systematically identified and characterized zinc-binding sites on proteins. Zinc is essential for the catalytic mechanism of nicotinamidases, confirmed by structural studies showing zinc binding sites at positions 51, 53, and 94 in the PNC1 protein.'

    reason: 'This is a core functional annotation based on IMP evidence from PMID:11901108, which demonstrates that pnc1 deletion results in a silencing defect at telomeres and rDNA.

PNC1 catalyzes the first step - deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid - which is the entry point into the salvage pathway.

    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: 'While PMID:26195783 is cited for this annotation, this requires careful interpretation. The connection between PNC1 and DNA amplification is not as mechanistically clear as PNC1s core roles in NAD salvage and silencing. The negative regulation of DNA amplification might be an indirect consequence of Sir2p regulation and chromatin silencing. Without the full publication text, the specific experimental context is unclear. This annotation may be correct but evidence linkage would benefit from deeper investigation.'
