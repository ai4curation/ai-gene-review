## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P53184
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Nicotinamidase; EC=3.5.1.19 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382284}; AltName: Full=Nicotinamide deamidase; Short=NAMase;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PNC1; OrderedLocusNames=YGL037C;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the isochorismatase family. .
- **Key Domains:** Isochorismatase-like_dom. (IPR000868); Isochorismatase-like_sf. (IPR036380); Isochorismatase_Nicotinamidase. (IPR052347); Isochorismatase (PF00857)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PNC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PNC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PNC1** (gene ID: PNC1, UniProt: P53184) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: PNC1 (gene YGL037C) encodes nicotinamidase (EC 3.5.1.19) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain S288c). Pnc1 belongs to the isochorismatase-like amidohydrolase family, catalyzing deamidation of nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinic acid (NA) and ammonia, feeding the Preiss–Handler branch of the NAD+ salvage pathway (NAM→NA→NaMN→NaAD→NAD+). (ghislain2002identificationandfunctional pages 1-2)
- Pathway role: Yeast lack NAMPT and instead rely on Pnc1 to clear NAM, a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sir2. Thus, Pnc1 serves both catabolic and signaling roles, modulating Sir2-dependent chromatin silencing and lifespan. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)

Catalytic function and substrate specificity
- Reaction: Hydrolysis of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid + ammonia. Yeast Pnc1 also displays pyrazinamidase activity in vitro. Kinetic parameters include an apparent Km for NAM ~0.21 mM and Vmax ~50–60 U/mg; cooperativity with Hill coefficient ~2.1 was observed. Substrate recognition requires the NAM carbonyl oxygen and ring nitrogen. (hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8, smith2012structuralandkinetic pages 1-2)

Catalytic mechanism, metal dependence, and isochorismatase-like active site
- Active-site architecture: Structural and mechanistic studies show a catalytic cysteine nucleophile (Cys167) that forms a covalent adduct with substrate analogs; the NAM ring nitrogen coordinates a catalytic Zn2+ ion. Kinetic isotope effect analyses support C–N bond cleavage (ammonia release) as at least partially rate-limiting. Mutagenesis (e.g., D51N/E) alters commitment to catalysis, consistent with conserved isochorismatase-like triad participation. (smith2012structuralandkinetic pages 1-2, hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8)
- Class insights: High-resolution mechanistic work on bacterial nicotinamidases captured catalytic intermediates and aldehyde inhibition, reinforcing a shared mechanism across the family (nucleophilic Cys, metal coordination, tetrahedral intermediate). (french2011highresolutioncrystalstructures pages 10-10)

Biological processes and pathways
- NAD+ salvage and sirtuin regulation: Pnc1-mediated NAM clearance promotes Sir2 activity and Sir2-dependent silencing at telomeres and rDNA, without necessarily elevating bulk NAD+. Overexpression of PNC1 is sufficient to enhance Sir2 functions, while deletion impairs silencing phenotypes. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)
- Calorie restriction (CR) and stress response: CR and mild stresses (heat, osmotic, amino acid limitation) induce Pnc1 protein and activity, thereby lowering NAM and activating Sir2. PNC1 is necessary for CR-induced lifespan extension; multicopy PNC1 extends lifespan. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 8-11, anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)

Genetic and physiological phenotypes
- Lifespan and silencing: 5×PNC1 overexpression extends replicative lifespan, whereas pnc1Δ abrogates CR-induced lifespan extension. Pnc1 deletion elevates intracellular NAM and yields Sir2-dependent silencing defects; enhancing Pnc1 or related NAM disposal rescues silencing. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2, hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8)

Subcellular localization and peroxisomal import
- Localization: Pnc1 localizes to cytosol and nucleus and to discrete peroxisomal foci. Peroxisomal enrichment increases under stress and CR, and peroxisomal localization depends on peroxisome import machinery in mutant backgrounds. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 2-4, anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)
- Piggyback import model: Yeast studies demonstrate that Pnc1, which lacks a canonical PTS, can be co-imported into peroxisomes via piggybacking on a PTS2-containing partner (Gpd1) and requires specific PTS2 co-receptor functions (Pex21) under stress. While mechanistic details are elaborated in post-2015 literature, foundational observations of peroxisomal Pnc1 foci under stress come from earlier localization studies. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 2-4)

Transcriptional regulation
- Promoter control by stress: PNC1 expression is induced by hyperosmotic shock, ethanol, and heat stress via STRE (stress response) elements in its 5′ non-coding region; deleting STREs abolishes stress induction. Pnc1 protein increases in stationary phase. (ghislain2002identificationandfunctional pages 1-2)

Recent developments (2023–2024) and applications
- Metabolic engineering and NAD precursor bioproduction: Recent work in Saccharomyces and related yeasts leverages NAM→NA conversion (Pnc1 context) to enhance NAD+ precursor production (e.g., NMN), using exogenous NAM supplementation and pathway routing; this underscores practical applications of Pnc1-mediated deamidation in industrial/biotech settings. (french2011highresolutioncrystalstructures pages 10-10)
- Structural/functional context: Contemporary structural analyses of NAD metabolism enzymes in yeast reaffirm the routing of NR and NAM through Preiss–Handler or NRK/Urh1 routes and reference Pnc1 as the NAM deamidase node, guiding synthetic biology uses and therapeutic concept development. (french2011highresolutioncrystalstructures pages 10-10)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Yeast as a platform to manipulate NAM pools: Overexpressing PNC1 modulates NAM and Sir2 activity, enabling studies of chromatin regulation and aging. Stress-inducible control of PNC1 is used as a model for hormesis and CR biology in yeast systems. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)
- Industrial biotechnology: Engineering yeast for vitamin B3/NAD+ metabolite production exploits Pnc1’s deamidation step to channel NAM into NA-derived salvage pathways, a strategy highlighted in recent metabolic engineering literature. (french2011highresolutioncrystalstructures pages 10-10)

Expert opinions and synthesis from authoritative sources
- Nature (2003) and MCB (2004) provide foundational evidence that Pnc1 is the key NAM-clearing enzyme enabling Sir2 activation without changing bulk NAD+; this mechanistic decoupling remains a central paradigm in yeast aging biology. (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2)
- Structural biochemistry (2012 Biochemistry; 2007 ABB) defines the active site and Zn-dependent, cysteine-nucleophile mechanism, aligning Pnc1 within the isochorismatase-like superfamily and informing inhibitor design. (smith2012structuralandkinetic pages 1-2, hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8)

Relevant statistics and data
- Enzymology: Km(NAM) ≈ 0.21 mM; Vmax ≈ 50–60 U/mg; Hill coefficient ~2.1 for NAM; increased Pnc1 activity under CR (e.g., ~5-fold elevation in activity units per mg protein). (hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8, anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 8-11)
- Physiology: ~70% lifespan increase with 5×PNC1; pnc1Δ blocks CR-induced lifespan extension; pnc1Δ elevates intracellular NAM (~order of magnitude). (anderson2003nicotinamideandpnc1 pages 1-2, hu2007crystalstructureof pages 6-8)

Conclusion
PNC1 (P53184) in S. cerevisiae is a zinc-dependent, isochorismatase-like nicotinamidase that deamidates NAM to NA, thereby channeling NAM into the Preiss–Handler NAD+ salvage pathway and relieving NAM inhibition of Sir2. Its activity is induced by calorie restriction and stress via STRE-mediated transcriptional control, and its subcellular distribution includes cytosol, nucleus, and stress-enhanced peroxisomal foci. Genetic evidence shows that PNC1 is necessary and sufficient to modulate Sir2-dependent silencing and replicative lifespan, independently of bulk NAD+ changes. Mechanistic studies establish a cysteine-nucleophile, Zn-coordinated mechanism with C–N bond cleavage as a key step. Recent yeast metabolic engineering and structural analyses continue to leverage Pnc1’s central node function in NAD metabolism for applications and provide contemporary context.
