description: >-
  YDJ1 (also known as MAS5) is a Type I Hsp40/DnaJ co-chaperone that functions as a key
  regulator of Hsp70 (Ssa1) chaperone activity in S. cerevisiae. It stimulates the ATPase
  activity of Ssa1 and delivers substrate proteins to the Hsp70 machinery for folding.
  YDJ1 contains a J-domain (residues 4-72) that interacts with Hsp70 to stimulate ATPase
  activity, a zinc finger-like cysteine-rich region (residues 130-213) that contributes to
  substrate recognition, and a C-terminal peptide-binding domain. YDJ1 functions in protein
  refolding (with Hsp104/Hsp70), de novo protein folding, ERAD, protein targeting to the ER,
  and regulation of the HAP1 transcription factor in response to heme/oxygen levels. It is
  farnesylated at Cys-406 and localized primarily to the cytosol and perinuclear region.

      IBA annotation for cytosol localization is well supported. YDJ1 was shown by
      immunofluorescence to localize to the cytoplasm and perinuclear region (PMID:1869583),

      Cytosol is a well-established localization for YDJ1. Multiple independent methods

      IBA annotation for ATPase activator activity is strongly supported. YDJ1 stimulates
      the ATPase activity of Hsp70 Ssa1 (PMID:1400408, PMID:9774392), which is the core

      IBA annotation for cellular response to heat is appropriate. YDJ1 is a heat shock

      stimulates the ATPase of Hsp70 and regulates substrate binding in an ATP-dependent

      YDJ1 regulates Hsp70 ATPase activity but does not itself bind ATP. The InterPro

    reason: >-
      YDJ1 can participate in chaperone-mediated complex assembly as part of the Hsp70/Hsp90
