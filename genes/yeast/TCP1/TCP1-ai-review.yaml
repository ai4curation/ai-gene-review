description: >-
  TCP1 (also known as CCT1) encodes the alpha subunit of the chaperonin-containing T-complex
  (TRiC/CCT) in S. cerevisiae. TRiC/CCT is an essential, hetero-oligomeric, group II chaperonin
  composed of eight paralogous subunits (CCT1-8) arranged in two stacked rings of eight subunits
  each, forming a ~1 MDa complex. The complex functions as an ATP-dependent protein folding
  machine that assists the folding of actin, tubulin, and a small number of other substrates
  including WD40-repeat proteins. Each subunit contributes to the overall ATP-dependent protein
  folding chaperone activity of the complex; individual subunits do not independently fold
  substrates. TCP1/CCT1 is essential for viability and plays roles in mitotic spindle formation
  in yeast. The crystal structure of yeast CCT (PMID:21701561) reveals intrinsic asymmetry
  among the eight subunits, with each displaying unique configurations and substrate-binding
  properties.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is proposed for obsoletion. TCP1, as a subunit
      of TRiC/CCT, does interact with unfolded substrates (actin, tubulin), but this occurs
      in the context of the ATP-dependent chaperonin folding cycle, not as a standalone
      binding function. The correct replacement is GO:0140662 (ATP-dependent protein folding
      chaperone), with the qualifier contributes_to since TCP1 is a subunit of the complex.
    action: MODIFY

      contributes_to rather than enables, but the IEA annotation is correct in substance.

    description: >-
      TCP1 is the alpha subunit of the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex. It contributes to the
      complex-level ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone activity (GO:0140662) that folds
      actin, tubulin, and other substrates. Individual subunits do not independently fold
      substrates; the activity emerges from the assembled hetero-oligomeric complex. The
      crystal structure (PMID:21701561) reveals that each subunit has unique configurations
      and substrate-binding properties, suggesting specialized roles within the complex.
      TCP1 binds ATP and contributes ATPase activity to the sequential ATP hydrolysis
      mechanism that drives the chaperonin cycle.
