gene_symbol: LPL1
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:559292
  label: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
description: LPL1 encodes a lipid droplet-localized phospholipase B that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at both sn-1 and sn-2 positions. It plays dual roles in lipid droplet homeostasis and protein quality control under stress conditions, being induced by the Rpn4 transcription factor during proteotoxic stress.

  review:
    summary: 'Broad biological process term correctly reflecting LPL1 phospholipase B activity on multiple glycerophospholipids. IBA annotation from phylogenetically conserved lipase family members is well-supported by experimental evidence showing LPL1 catalyzes lipid metabolism through phospholipid hydrolysis.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This general lipid metabolic process annotation is appropriate and supported by extensive experimental evidence from Selvaraju et al. 2014 demonstrating phospholipase B activity on PE, PC, PS, PA, and PG. The IBA inference from conserved family members aligns with the biochemical characterization.'

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This lysophospholipase annotation captures only part of LPL1 activity. While LPL1 does have lysophospholipase activity (removing the second fatty acid), it primarily functions as a phospholipase B with activity on intact phospholipids, not just lysophospholipids. The more accurate term would be phospholipase B activity (GO:0102545).'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'LPL1 is biochemically characterized as a phospholipase B enzyme that cleaves both sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerophospholipids. The lysophospholipase activity is only the second step of its complete phospholipase B activity. This term is too narrow.'

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation likely derives from phylogenetic relationship to ROG1, which is a monoacylglycerol lipase. However, LPL1 has been characterized as a phospholipase B acting on phospholipids, not a monoacylglycerol lipase. No experimental evidence supports monoacylglycerol lipase activity for LPL1.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The IBA annotation appears to incorrectly transfer ROG1 function to LPL1. While both are in the same lipase family, they have diverged substrate specificities.

  review:
    summary: 'This IEA annotation from EC number mapping is partially correct but incomplete. LPL1 does have phospholipase A2 activity (cleaving sn-2 position) but it is more accurately a phospholipase B, also cleaving the sn-1 position.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While LPL1 does cleave at the sn-2 position (phospholipase A2 activity), experimental evidence shows it subsequently cleaves at sn-1, making it a phospholipase B. The IEA annotation from EC:3.1.1.4 is technically correct but misses the full enzymatic activity.'
