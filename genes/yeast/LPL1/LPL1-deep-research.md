# LPL1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) – Comprehensive Gene Report

## Function and Molecular Mechanism  
**LPL1** (YOR059C) encodes a lipid droplet phospholipase that plays a key role in lipid metabolism. The Lpl1 protein contains the **conserved G-X-S-X-G lipase motif** (a hallmark of serine hydrolases) and functions as a **broad‐specificity phospholipase B**, capable of cleaving fatty acyl chains from phospholipids ([indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br](https://indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br/DATABASE/GENES/LPL1/LPL1.report.html#:~:text=Description%3A%20Putative%20lipase%20YOR059C%3B%20Phospholipase%3B,the%20putative%20lipase%20ROG1%20family)). Biochemical assays with purified Lpl1p showed it can hydrolyze major glycerophospholipids – including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine – releasing free fatty acids from both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=interacting%20proteins%2C%20Lpl1%20is%20a,carbon%20backbone%2C%20which)). Overexpression of LPL1 correspondingly causes a decrease in cellular glycerophospholipid levels and an increase in free fatty acids, consistent with lipolytic activity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=Phospholipids%20also%20play%20a%20major,LD%20at%20the%20stationary%20phase)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=contains%20lipase%20specific%20motif%20GXSXG,In%20summary%2C%20our%20results%20demonstrate)). Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic motif abrogates Lpl1’s activity, confirming this motif is essential for its enzymatic mechanism ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=increase%20in%20free%20fatty%20acids,LD%20phospholipase)). By breaking down phospholipids, Lpl1 remodels lipid composition and contributes to the maintenance of lipid droplet structure (see below). Notably, **Lpl1 has dual functions**, linking lipid metabolism with proteostasis – it is required for efficient proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins while also governing lipid droplet dynamics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)). This dual role suggests a **mechanistic coupling between lipid droplet turnover and protein quality control** in the cell. Indeed, Lpl1’s phospholipase activity may liberate fatty acids or other lipid-derived signals that facilitate cellular stress responses, or provide building blocks for membrane synthesis during stress recovery ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=hac1%E2%88%86lpl1%E2%88%86%20mutant,A)).  

## Cellular Localization and Components  
Lpl1 is **localized to lipid droplets (LDs)**, which are cytosolic lipid storage organelles bounded by a phospholipid monolayer. Fluorescence microscopy of Lpl1-GFP fusion proteins showed that Lpl1 decorates lipid droplets, with particularly strong LD localization observed in stationary phase cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=increase%20in%20free%20fatty%20acids,LD%20phospholipase)). In logarithmic phase, Lpl1 may be present at lower levels, but as cells enter stationary phase and accumulate storage lipids, Lpl1 concentrates on the droplet surface ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=at%20sn,LD%20phospholipase%201)). This specific localization aligns with its role as an **LD-associated phospholipase**, directly acting on the phospholipid monolayer of the droplet ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=interacting%20proteins%2C%20Lpl1%20is%20a,carbon%20backbone%2C%20which)). Proteomic studies have identified Lpl1 as a lipid droplet component ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)), and no signal sequence or transmembrane domain is evident, suggesting Lpl1 is a **soluble protein that associates peripherally with droplet surfaces** (likely via hydrophobic or amphipathic regions). The restriction of Lpl1 to lipid droplets is functionally significant: by hydrolyzing droplet phospholipids, Lpl1 can modulate the surface tension and morphology of these organelles. Consistently, **deletion of LPL1 leads to abnormal lipid droplet morphology** – mutant cells lacking Lpl1 form enlarged and irregular LDs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=Phospholipids%20also%20play%20a%20major,LD%20at%20the%20stationary%20phase)), indicating a failure to properly turn over droplet phospholipids and/or droplet fusion defects. Thus, Lpl1 resides in the lipid droplet compartment (Gene Ontology (GO) cellular component: *lipid droplet*, GO:0005811) and contributes to its structural homeostasis.  

## Biological Processes and Pathways  
**Lipid Droplet Homeostasis:** Lpl1 is a critical factor in **lipid droplet organization** and lipid metabolic processes in yeast. Its phospholipase activity helps regulate the phospholipid content of the droplet surface, thereby controlling droplet size and number ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=Site%20directed%20mutagenesis%20experiments%20clearly,LD%20phospholipase%201)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=The%20lipid%20droplet%20is%20bounded,the%20cho2%CE%94%20mutant%20is%20partially)). In **LPL1** knockout cells, lipid droplets accumulate an excess of surface phospholipids (due to lack of turnover), which correlates with the formation of abnormally large “supersized” droplets ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=The%20lipid%20droplet%20is%20bounded,the%20cho2%CE%94%20mutant%20is%20partially)). Conversely, when Lpl1p is present and active, it cleaves droplet phospholipids, a process thought to produce glycerophosphodiester and fatty acid products that can be recycled by the cell ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=observation%20that%20impairing%20phospholipid%20synthesis,A)). This recycling may supply precursors for new membrane phospholipid synthesis, linking droplet catabolism to membrane biogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=hac1%E2%88%86lpl1%E2%88%86%20mutant,A)). Indeed, genetic studies support this model: deletion of **LPL1** becomes highly deleterious when combined with mutations in phospholipid synthesis genes (e.g. **CHO2** or **PSD1**, which are required for making phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=An%20interesting%20aspect%20of%20Lpl1,Hac1%20regulates)). The **cho2Δ lpl1Δ** double mutant phenocopies a **hac1Δ lpl1Δ** mutant (see below) in showing severe stress sensitivity, implying that Lpl1’s breakdown of droplet phospholipids normally compensates when phospholipid synthesis is impaired ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=hac1%E2%88%86lpl1%E2%88%86%20mutant,A)). Thus, **Lpl1 participates in glycerophospholipid catabolic process** (GO:0046475) and **lipid droplet organization** (GO:0034389) by balancing lipid storage and membrane lipid availability. 

**Proteostasis and Stress Response:** A remarkable aspect of Lpl1 biology is its involvement in **protein quality control and stress responses**. Lpl1 has been identified as a novel component of the **Rpn4-mediated proteotoxic stress response** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=available%2C%20we%20noticed%20that%20the,We)). Rpn4p is a transcription factor that upregulates proteasome genes under conditions of proteotoxic stress (e.g. misfolded protein accumulation). LPL1 was discovered to be an Rpn4 target: its promoter contains a canonical Rpn4 binding motif (PACE) and LPL1 expression is strongly induced upon proteotoxic challenge (e.g. arsenite exposure) in an Rpn4-dependent manner ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=available%2C%20we%20noticed%20that%20the,We)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=2002%29,is%20a%20target%20of%20the)). This places Lpl1 in a **stress-inducible pathway to help cells cope with misfolded proteins**. Although an **lpl1Δ single mutant** shows no obvious growth defect under various stress conditions on its own ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=degradation,multiple%20causes%20of%20proteotoxic%20stress)), it displays **synthetic sickness when the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway is also compromised** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=degradation,multiple%20causes%20of%20proteotoxic%20stress)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=However%2C%20mutants%20defective%20in%20Ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). In cells lacking both LPL1 and HAC1 (Hac1p being the transcription factor that activates the UPR), there is a dramatically reduced tolerance to proteotoxic stress (e.g. elevated temperature or amino acid analogs that cause protein misfolding) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=functions%3A%20it%20is%20required%20for,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=However%2C%20mutants%20defective%20in%20Ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). These **hac1Δ lpl1Δ** double mutants accumulate high levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and show severely impaired degradation of misfolded substrates, far worse than hac1Δ alone ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=Protein%20degradation%20defects%20in%20the,Experiment%20was)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). The UPR and Rpn4 pathways represent two parallel arms of the proteostasis network – **UPR boosts phospholipid synthesis and chaperone activity** to expand the endoplasmic reticulum and refold proteins, whereas **Rpn4 boosts proteasome capacity and, via Lpl1, phospholipid breakdown** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=regulates%20phospholipid%20metabolism,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)). The convergence of these pathways on phospholipid metabolism suggests that dynamic **membrane lipid remodeling is integral to managing proteotoxic stress**. Lpl1’s role appears to be to **facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins (indirectly)**, possibly by freeing fatty acids that can be utilized for energy or membrane synthesis needed during stress recovery ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)). In GO terms, Lpl1 is implicated in the **proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process** (GO:0043161), acting as a positive regulator of proteostasis capacity under stress conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=Protein%20degradation%20defects%20in%20the,Experiment%20was)). Overall, **Lpl1 links lipid droplet function with protein quality control**, an insight first highlighted by Weisshaar *et al.* (2017) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)). 

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Because **LPL1** is a gene from baker’s yeast (a non-pathogenic organism), it has no direct disease associations in humans. However, the study of Lpl1 sheds light on general mechanisms that could be relevant to human health – for example, the connection between lipid droplet dynamics and proteostasis has implications for neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic syndromes where protein aggregation and lipid dysregulation co-occur ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=The%20lipid%20droplet%20is%20bounded,the%20cho2%CE%94%20mutant%20is%20partially)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)). **Homologs of LPL1 do exist in higher eukaryotes**, albeit relatively uncharacterized; for instance, the human **FAM135B** gene encodes a protein with similarity to Lpl1 (sharing the lipase motif), and this gene has been noted in cancer biology studies ([indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br](https://indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br/DATABASE/GENES/LPL1/LPL1.report.html#:~:text=Homologues%20,1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039107/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20ADAM29%20and%20FAM135B,%28a)). FAM135B’s exact function is not yet defined, but its mere presence suggests an evolutionarily conserved protein family that might perform analogous lipid regulatory roles in mammals. In pathogenic fungi, secreted phospholipase B enzymes are known virulence factors (e.g. in *Candida albicans*), though **Lpl1** itself is intracellular and specific to *S. cerevisiae*.  

In yeast, the **phenotypes** of LPL1 disruption underscore its functional importance. As mentioned, **lpl1Δ mutants have enlarged or aberrant lipid droplets** visible by microscopy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=Phospholipids%20also%20play%20a%20major,LD%20at%20the%20stationary%20phase)), reflecting disturbed lipid turnover. These mutants are viable under normal conditions, but show subtle growth defects or altered stress responses in certain contexts. Notably, loss of LPL1 in combination with UPR insufficiency (hac1Δ) leads to severe growth impairment under stress (e.g. heat shock or canavanine exposure) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=However%2C%20mutants%20defective%20in%20Ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). Similarly, combining lpl1Δ with mutations in lipid synthesis (cho2Δ or psd1Δ) exacerbates defects, indicating genetic interactions that can manifest as slow growth or synthetic lethality under nutrient limitation or stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=An%20interesting%20aspect%20of%20Lpl1,Hac1%20regulates)). On a molecular level, **lpl1Δ cells (especially when stressed) accumulate excess ubiquitinated proteins** and may have subtle proteasome functional deficits ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=Protein%20degradation%20defects%20in%20the,Experiment%20was)). On the other hand, overexpression of LPL1 leads to increased phospholipid turnover (reducing phospholipid content and increasing fatty acids) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=morphology,demonstrated%20that%20the%20lipase%20motif)), which could potentially affect membrane properties and signaling. No human disease is directly tied to LPL1, but these yeast phenotypes provide a model for understanding how lipid dysregulation can impact proteome stability – a theme relevant to conditions like lipodystrophies or protein aggregation disorders.  

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
Lpl1p is a protein of approximately 651 amino acids (predicted ~73 kDa) that belongs to the **‘ROG1 family’ of lipases**, named after *Rog1p* (YGL144C) which is a monoacylglycerol lipase in yeast ([indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br](https://indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br/DATABASE/GENES/LPL1/LPL1.report.html#:~:text=Description%3A%20Putative%20lipase%20YOR059C%3B%20Phospholipase%3B,the%20putative%20lipase%20ROG1%20family)) ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/ROG1#:~:text=ROG1%20%2F%20YGL144C%20Overview%20,affects%20lipid%20droplet%20morphology%20and)). This family is defined by sequence similarity and the presence of the **active-site GXSXG motif** characteristic of **α/β-hydrolase fold lipases**. In Lpl1, this motif (with a central serine) is presumed to form part of a catalytic triad (Ser-Asp/Glu-His) common to lipases, enabling it to perform nucleophilic attack on ester bonds in phospholipids. The importance of this sequence has been confirmed experimentally: mutating the serine within GXSXG in Lpl1 abolishes its phospholipase activity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=at%20sn,LD%20phospholipase%201)). Aside from the lipase motif, Lpl1 does not have well-defined modular domains like transmembrane segments or signal peptides – it is likely a globular enzyme that associates with membranes via hydrophobic patches. **Homology modeling** (by virtue of its membership in the ROG1/lipase family) suggests Lpl1 adopts a typical lipase tertiary structure, with a β-sheet core and surrounding α-helices, and a flexible lid region that may control access to the active site (a feature seen in many lipases). Lpl1’s closest yeast paralog, Rog1p, shares the lipase motif and also localizes to lipid droplets, though Rog1 specializes in monoacylglycerol hydrolysis ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/ROG1#:~:text=ROG1%20%2F%20YGL144C%20Overview%20,affects%20lipid%20droplet%20morphology%20and)). This suggests **Lpl1 and Rog1p have diverged substrate preferences but analogous structural frameworks**, both contributing to lipid droplet lipid turnover. No high-resolution structure of Lpl1p has been reported yet, but given its enzymatic properties, it likely falls under **EC 3.1.1.5 (Phospholipase B)**. Importantly, Lpl1’s structure includes regions necessary for interaction with the lipid droplet’s phospholipid monolayer – possibly amphipathic helices that insert at the lipid-water interface. Such structural features ensure Lpl1 is properly positioned to extract and cleave phospholipid molecules within the droplet surface.  

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Under standard growth conditions, LPL1 is expressed at a basal level in yeast cells (genome-wide studies estimate on the order of a few hundred protein molecules per cell in rich medium). **Expression of LPL1 is highly regulated by cellular stress conditions.** In particular, **proteotoxic stress** triggers LPL1 upregulation: treatment of cells with arsenite (which causes protein misfolding) induces a strong increase in LPL1 mRNA and protein, largely dependent on the transcription factor Rpn4p ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=2002%29,is%20a%20target%20of%20the)). Rpn4 binds to the PACE element in the LPL1 promoter, activating its transcription as part of the coordinated stress response along with proteasome genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=available%2C%20we%20noticed%20that%20the,We)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=2002%29,is%20a%20target%20of%20the)). This induction can be viewed as the cell preparing to **remodel lipid droplets and membranes in response to protein damage**. Consistent with this, LPL1 is listed among genes whose protein abundance rises in **DNA replication stress conditions** (e.g. upon hydroxyurea treatment) ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/34458/table/saccharomyces-cerevisiae/lpl1.html#:~:text=Phospholipase%3B%20contains%20lipase%20specific%20GXSXG,response%20to%20DNA%20replication%20stress)), as determined by high-throughput proteomic analyses. Such conditions likely invoke a broad stress program overlapping with the Rpn4 regulon, again suggesting Lpl1 is part of a generalized stress adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, **nutrient status and growth phase** also influence LPL1: the protein appears most abundant in stationary phase cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=at%20sn,LD%20phospholipase%201)), when lipid droplets are prominent, whereas exponentially growing cells have lower Lpl1 levels. This pattern hints that **Lpl1 is upregulated when cells enter quiescence or face nutrient limitation**, possibly to initiate turnover of stored lipids for energy or membrane recycling. Additionally, transcriptional profiling data (e.g. during the yeast metabolic cycle) might reveal if LPL1 is co-regulated with other lipid metabolism genes. The LPL1 promoter does not only contain Rpn4 sites; it may also integrate signals from other pathways (for example, no evidence yet of Hac1p directly regulating LPL1, but Hac1’s effect on Lpl1 appears indirect via lipid synthesis interplay ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the))). In summary, **LPL1 is a stress-inducible, stationary-phase gene** with tight regulation: **Rpn4-dependent induction** under protein stress, and likely other layers of control aligning Lpl1 levels with the cell’s metabolic state. This regulated expression ensures that Lpl1p is available when needed to perform lipid droplet maintenance and support proteostasis, while avoiding unnecessary lipid breakdown in times of ample nutrients.  

## Evolutionary Conservation  
Lpl1 represents a member of a conserved eukaryotic **lipase family**. Within fungi, clear homologs of LPL1 are found in other budding yeast species and in more distantly related yeasts – these homologs share the lipase motif and presumably similar functions in lipid droplet metabolism. In *S. cerevisiae* itself, as noted, **Lpl1p is paralogous to Rog1p**, another LD-associated lipase, indicating an ancient duplication and specialization of lipase functions in yeast. When we look across kingdoms, we find that **homologous proteins exist in plants and animals** that resemble Lpl1. For example, a BLASTP search reveals that *Arabidopsis thaliana* has a protein (AT1G10040) with significant similarity to Lpl1 (Blast bitscore ~100) ([indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br](https://indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br/DATABASE/GENES/LPL1/LPL1.report.html#:~:text=Homologues%20,1)). Likewise, mammals have at least two related proteins: **FAM135A and FAM135B** in humans (and corresponding **Fam135** in mouse) which share the putative active-site motif and overall homology with Lpl1 ([indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br](https://indydb.bioinfo.cbmeg.unicamp.br/DATABASE/GENES/LPL1/LPL1.report.html#:~:text=Homologues%20,1)). These FAM135 proteins have not been characterized biochemically, but their conservation of the lipase signature suggests they could be **functional counterparts, perhaps acting on lipids in specific tissues**. Interestingly, FAM135B has been implicated in some human pathologies – its gene expression is reported to change in esophageal cancer progression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039107/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20ADAM29%20and%20FAM135B,%28a)) – though it’s unclear if this relates to a lipase activity or a structural role. The presence of Lpl1-like proteins in organisms from yeast to humans points to an **evolutionarily conserved role in lipid handling**. However, sequence identity between yeast Lpl1 and human FAM135B is quite limited, indicating they are distant homologs (the conservation is mainly at the level of key motifs and predicted secondary structure, rather than extensive sequence identity). No close ortholog of LPL1 is present in bacteria or archaea (phospholipase Bs in those domains are unrelated enzymes), so this **Lpl1/ROG1 family arose in eukaryotes**, likely to manage the unique organelle (lipid droplet) that eukaryotic cells possess. In summary, **LPL1 is conserved in fungi and has distant relatives in higher eukaryotes**, suggesting a fundamental necessity for lipid droplet phospholipid turnover across species. This conservation also raises the possibility that studying Lpl1 in yeast can inform us about similar enzymes in other organisms that might regulate lipid droplets or membrane lipid remodeling.  

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Identification and Biochemical Characterization:** Selvaraju *et al.*, 2014 (FEBS Letters) first identified YOR059C as a lipid droplet enzyme and named it **Lpl1 (Lipid droplet PhosphoLipase 1)** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=that%20yeast%20Lpl1%20exerts%20phospholipase,LD%20phospholipase%201)). In this study, the authors showed that **lpl1Δ mutants have altered LD morphology** (observed by fluorescence microscopy) and that **purified Lpl1p has phospholipase B activity** in vitro ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=morphology,demonstrated%20that%20the%20lipase%20motif)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=increase%20in%20free%20fatty%20acids,LD%20phospholipase)). The enzyme was found to act on all major glycerophospholipids, preferentially cleaving the sn-2 acyl chain first, then the sn-1, confirming Lpl1 as a broad-spectrum phospholipase  ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=contains%20lipase%20specific%20motif%20GXSXG,In%20summary%2C%20our%20results%20demonstrate)). GFP-tagging experiments confirmed **Lpl1’s localization to lipid droplets**, and site-directed mutants verified the importance of the GXSXG motif for function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=increase%20in%20free%20fatty%20acids,LD%20phospholipase)). This work established the basic function (phospholipid catabolism) and cellular role (LD maintenance) of Lpl1.  

- **Link to Proteostasis and Stress:** Weisshaar *et al.*, 2017 (Molecular Biology of the Cell) discovered **Lpl1’s role in proteotoxic stress response** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)). Using proteomics, they found Lpl1 levels increase upon arsenite exposure, and they identified an Rpn4-binding PACE element in the LPL1 promoter ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=available%2C%20we%20noticed%20that%20the,We)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=2002%29,is%20a%20target%20of%20the)). They demonstrated that **Rpn4 is required for LPL1 induction under stress**, establishing LPL1 as part of the Rpn4 regulon. Phenotypic analyses revealed that while **LPL1 deletion alone did not cause sensitivity to stressors**, it caused pronounced defects in cells already compromised for ER stress management (hac1Δ) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=degradation,multiple%20causes%20of%20proteotoxic%20stress)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=However%2C%20mutants%20defective%20in%20Ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). Double mutants lacking Lpl1 and UPR function accumulated ubiquitinated proteins and failed to degrade certain misfolded protein substrates efficiently ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=Protein%20degradation%20defects%20in%20the,Experiment%20was)). This provided evidence that **Lpl1 aids proteasome-dependent protein degradation**, likely through its impact on lipid droplets and membrane dynamics. The study connected two previously separate fields – lipid droplet biology and proteostasis – highlighting Lpl1 as a molecular link between them ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=proteins,Lpl1%20shows%20a%20synthetic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20regulates%20phospholipid,be%20mitigated%20by%20expanding%20the)). The authors proposed models wherein Lpl1-generated lipid fragments might be repurposed for membrane expansion (to help the ER handle misfolded proteins) or for energy production during stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=observation%20that%20impairing%20phospholipid%20synthesis,A)). This paper is a key reference for GO annotations relating Lpl1 to **protein catabolic process and stress responses**.  

- **Additional Literature:** Other large-scale datasets have noted Lpl1. For instance, a proteome survey of DNA replication stress response found **Lpl1p levels increase under replication stress** ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/34458/table/saccharomyces-cerevisiae/lpl1.html#:~:text=Phospholipase%3B%20contains%20lipase%20specific%20GXSXG,response%20to%20DNA%20replication%20stress)), supporting its role as a stress-responsive enzyme. Lpl1 has also been included in reviews of **lipid droplet dynamics** in yeast, often cited alongside other LD proteins (e.g., triacylglycerol lipases Tgl4/Tgl5 and steryl ester hydrolases Ldh1/Ldh2) that coordinate lipid storage mobilization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11113813/#:~:text=Lipid%20droplet%20dynamics%20in%20budding,enzymes%20involved%20in%20lipid%20metabolism)). These reviews emphasize that yeast lipid droplets, though lacking mammalian perilipins, are enriched in enzymes like Lpl1 that continually modify their lipid composition ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11113813/#:~:text=Lipid%20droplet%20dynamics%20in%20budding,enzymes%20involved%20in%20lipid%20metabolism)). Additionally, studies of related lipases (e.g., Rog1p) provide context for Lpl1’s function; Rog1 was shown to be a monoacylglycerol lipase and its deletion also perturbs LD morphology ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/ROG1#:~:text=ROG1%20%2F%20YGL144C%20Overview%20,affects%20lipid%20droplet%20morphology%20and)), indicating overlapping roles among yeast LD lipases. Collectively, the experimental evidence base for Lpl1 ranges from **biochemical assays** and **microscopy** to **genetic interaction analyses** and **proteomic profiling**, all of which contribute to a rich understanding necessary for accurate Gene Ontology curation. 

## Relevant Gene Ontology (GO) Terms and Annotations  
Based on the above evidence, Lpl1 can be annotated with several GO terms (with supporting references and typical evidence codes) that capture its molecular function, cellular localization, and biological roles:

- **Molecular Function:** *phospholipase B activity* (GO:0004620) – Lpl1p hydrolyzes phospholipids by cleaving acyl chains at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, releasing free fatty acids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=interacting%20proteins%2C%20Lpl1%20is%20a,carbon%20backbone%2C%20which)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=contains%20lipase%20specific%20motif%20GXSXG,In%20summary%2C%20our%20results%20demonstrate)). *(Supported by direct assay, IDA.)*  

- **Biological Process:** *glycerophospholipid catabolic process* (GO:0046475) – Lpl1 catalyzes the breakdown of glycerophospholipids, as evidenced by the accumulation of free fatty acids and reduction of phospholipids upon its overexpression ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=morphology,demonstrated%20that%20the%20lipase%20motif)). *(IDA – enzyme activity assays, and IMP – metabolic labeling experiments.)*  

- **Biological Process:** *lipid droplet organization* (GO:0034389) – Lpl1 is required for normal lipid droplet morphology; deletion leads to enlarged or fused droplets, indicating a role in droplet assembly/disassembly or size regulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=Phospholipids%20also%20play%20a%20major,LD%20at%20the%20stationary%20phase)). *(IMP – inferred from mutant phenotype.)*  

- **Biological Process:** *proteasome-mediated protein catabolic process* (GO:0043161) **(regulation of)** – Lpl1 contributes to efficient degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via the proteasome under stress conditions. In the absence of Lpl1 (especially when UPR is compromised), cells show defective proteasomal turnover of misfolded proteins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=Protein%20degradation%20defects%20in%20the,Experiment%20was)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349779/#:~:text=However%2C%20mutants%20defective%20in%20Ste6,By%20contrast%2C%20the%20hac1%CE%94%20mutant)). Lpl1 can thus be annotated as positively regulating proteasomal protein catabolism in stress contexts. *(IGI/IMP – inferred from genetic interaction with HAC1 and mutant phenotypes.)*  

- **Cellular Component:** *lipid droplet* (GO:0005811) – Lpl1p localizes to the lipid droplet surface in vivo, as shown by GFP-tag imaging and fractionation studies ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25014274/#:~:text=increase%20in%20free%20fatty%20acids,LD%20phospholipase)). It is a bona fide lipid droplet protein. *(IDA – direct cellular localization assays.)*  

- **Cellular Component:** *intracellular* (GO:0005622) – As an intracellular enzyme (non-secreted), Lpl1 resides in the cytoplasm associated with organelles (more specifically the lipid particle). *(NAS – stated in literature.)*  

These GO annotations, supported by peer-reviewed literature, encapsulate Lpl1’s role as a **lipid droplet phospholipase (MF)**, functioning in **lipid catabolism and droplet maintenance (BP)**, involved in **protein quality control (BP)**, and **localized to lipid droplets (CC)** in *S. cerevisiae*. The evidence cited above can be used for high-confidence manual curation of LPL1 in the Gene Ontology database, ensuring that the annotations reflect current biological knowledge of this gene.
