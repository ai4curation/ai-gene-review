description: 'Histone acetyltransferase SAS2 is the catalytic subunit of the SAS (Something About Silencing) complex, which acetylates H4K16 and H3K14 of free histones. Core component of the SAS complex (with SAS4 and SAS5), SAS2 is distinct from SAS3 which is part of the NuA3 HAT complex. SAS2 functions in transcriptional silencing at telomeres, subtelomeres, and the HML mating-type locus. The complex acetylates free histones but not nucleosomal histones, suggesting a role in pre-deposition histone modification during chromatin assembly. Autoacetylation at K168 is required for proper catalytic function.'
