description: 'Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 3 (EC 3.4.19.12), a deubiquitinating enzyme critical for protein quality control, selective autophagy (ribophagy), and transcriptional regulation. Functions as a cysteine-type serine/threonine protease that cleaves ubiquitin from target proteins in a cofactor-dependent manner, primarily in complex with regulatory protein BRE5. Core functions include removal of ubiquitin conjugates from COPII pathway proteins (SEC23), ribosomal proteins during starvation-induced autophagy, and chromatin-associated proteins (H2B).'
