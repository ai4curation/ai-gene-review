description: 'Histone acetyltransferase component of SAGA and ADA chromatin remodeling complexes. GCN5 catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 (H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac, H3K23ac, H3K27ac, H3K36ac) and H2B (H2BK11ac, H2BK16ac), as well as crotonylation. Functions as HAT module within multisubunit SAGA and SLIK complexes for global transcription activation, and in distinct ADA complex. Also acetylates nucleosomal histones through association with chromatin-modifying complexes. Contains bromodomain for reading acetyl-lysine marks.'

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'GCN5 is a well-documented component of two major HAT complexes: SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ADA. Within SAGA, GCN5 constitutes the central catalytic component of the HAT module (Grant et al., 1997). This is a core function clearly supported by multiple direct biochemical studies (PMID:9224714, PMID:9674426). IBA is appropriate because phylogenetic conservation of HAT complex architecture is well-established.'
