    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:26112308
  review:
    summary: 'Manual review: unfolded protein binding is better represented by a more specific replacement term for SQT1.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Modified to align with current curation guidance and improve term specificity.
