description: >-
  HSP104 encodes a hexameric AAA+ ATPase disaggregase that is the founding
  member of the Hsp100/ClpB family. Its core molecular function is
  ATP-dependent protein disaggregation: it threads aggregated/misfolded
  polypeptides through its central pore in an ATP-driven process, solubilizing
  protein aggregates and enabling downstream refolding by the Hsp70/Hsp40
  (Ssa1/Ydj1) chaperone system. HSP104 is essential for induced
  thermotolerance and is required for the propagation of yeast prions
  ([PSI+], [URE3], [PIN+]) by fragmenting prion fibrils into transmissible
  seeds. It also functions in stress granule disassembly during recovery from
  heat stress. HSP104 forms a homohexameric ring with two AAA ATPase domains
  (NBD1 and NBD2) per monomer, and substrate binding is regulated by
  nucleotide occupancy at NBD1. There is no direct mammalian ortholog;
  disaggregation in metazoans is performed by the Hsp70/Hsp40/Hsp110 system.

      HSP104 participates in protein refolding, though it does so indirectly

      While HSP104 does bind unfolded/aggregated polypeptides in an

          in concert with Hsp40 and Hsp70, Hsp104 can reactivate proteins
          that have been denatured and allowed to aggregate, substrates
          refractory to the action of other chaperones.
      - reference_id: PMID:16135516
        supporting_text: >-
          the affinity of Hsp104 toward polypeptides is regulated by
          nucleotides. In the presence of ATP or
          adenosine-5' -O-(3-thiotriphosphate), the chaperone formed
          complexes with RCMLa, whereas no binding was observed in the
          presence of ADP.
