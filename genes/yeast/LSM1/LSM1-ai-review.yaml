description: 'LSM1 (Lsm1p) is the defining component of the cytoplasmic Lsm1-7-Pat1 heptameric complex, which is a critical activator of mRNA decapping and a key effector of deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. Unlike other Lsm proteins (Lsm2-8) that function in U6 snRNA splicing, LSM1 is unique and forms a complex specifically involved in cytoplasmic mRNA turnover. The Lsm1-7 complex binds to poly(U) tracts at the 3'' end of deadenylated mRNAs and recruits the decapping machinery (Dcp1/Dcp2), converting capped mRNAs to susceptible substrates for 5'' to 3'' exonucleolytic degradation by Xrn1. The complex also functions in protective binding to mRNA 3'' ends. LSM1 is predominantly cytoplasmic but can also localize to P-bodies and has been detected in the nucleus.'

    description: 'LSM1 binds mRNA through its Sm domain, specifically recognizing poly(U) tracts at the 3'' end of deadenylated mRNAs.

    summary: 'IMP evidence from Tharun et al. (2000) showing LSM1-Lsm7 mutations inhibit mRNA decapping and demonstrating interaction with decapping machinery.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Tharun et al. demonstrated that lsm mutations specifically block mRNA decapping, and that Lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with Dcp1 and mRNA. This establishes the mechanistic link between LSM1 and decapping activation. Duplicate IMP annotation with different PMID is appropriate as it provides additional mechanistic detail.'
