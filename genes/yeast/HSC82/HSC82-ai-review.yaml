description: >-
  HSC82 is the constitutive (cognate) isoform of Hsp90 in S. cerevisiae. It is an ATP-dependent molecular
  chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance, and proper regulation of specific client
  proteins, particularly those involved in cell cycle control and signal transduction. HSC82 functions as a
  homodimer (and can heterodimerize with HSP82), undergoing an ATP-dependent conformational cycle that acts
  as a molecular clamp on client proteins. It interacts with the same network of co-chaperones as HSP82
  (STI1, AHA1, CDC37, SBA1, CPR6, CPR7, CNS1, SSE1, HCH1). HSC82 is expressed constitutively and accounts
  for the majority of Hsp90 protein under non-stress conditions.

      label: ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
core_functions:
- description: >-
    Primary molecular function: ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone. HSC82 binds to
    client proteins and assists their folding through an ATP-dependent conformational cycle.
    Supported by IEA from InterPro, IDA evidence for ATP hydrolysis (PMID:18492664), and
    IDA evidence for unfolded protein binding (PMID:9465043).

- description: >-
    ATPase activity is fundamental to the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. Directly demonstrated by
    IDA (PMID:18492664). Intra- and intermonomer interactions synergistically facilitate
    ATP hydrolysis.
