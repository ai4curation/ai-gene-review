description: PHD1 is a master transcriptional regulator of pseudohyphal growth and morphogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a member of the APSES (bHLH) family of fungal transcription factors, PHD1 contains a conserved DNA-binding domain that recognizes E-box consensus sequences. PHD1 functions as a major regulatory hub that integrates signals from the cAMP-PKA pathway and MAPK signaling cascades to control filamentous growth during nitrogen starvation. The protein is an inherently unstable regulator, with stability modulated by Cdk8-dependent phosphorylation of the mediator complex. When overexpressed, PHD1 induces approximately 214 genes and can independently trigger pseudohyphal growth even under nutrient-rich conditions. PHD1 directly regulates critical downstream targets like FLO11 (cell adhesion) and serves as a convergence point for multiple developmental signaling pathways. The protein localizes to the nucleus where it binds promoter regions and recruits coregulator complexes including Tup1-Cyc8 to modulate gene expression.

    label: positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation (phylogenetic inference) for PHD1's central role in transcriptional regulation of pseudohyphal genes. This is a well-established function supported by orthologous relationships to other APSES proteins and consistent with extensive experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PHD1 is a master transcriptional regulator that positively activates genes required for pseudohyphal growth. The IBA assignment is appropriate as this core function is conserved across APSES family members and phylogenetically justified. The deep research confirms that Phd1 directly binds to and activates numerous target genes during development and that overexpression induces the pseudohyphal transcriptional program. This represents a core function of the gene.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for PHD1's molecular function as a DNA-binding transcription factor activity. PHD1 contains a conserved bHLH DNA-binding domain characteristic of APSES proteins. This is supported by experimental evidence of sequence-specific binding to target promoters.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PHD1 has a conserved bHLH/APSES domain (residues ~186-292 based on UniProt annotation) that enables sequence-specific DNA binding. The IBA assignment is phylogenetically sound based on the presence of this conserved domain in related APSES transcription factors. Experimental evidence confirms direct binding to target promoters including FLO11. This is a core molecular function supporting transcriptional regulation.

  review:
    summary: IBA assignment for nuclear localization of PHD1. As a transcription factor, nuclear localization is inherent to function and well-established in the experimental literature for PHD1 and orthologous proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization of PHD1 is well-established and necessary for its function as a transcription factor. The protein contains basic residues in its DNA-binding domain consistent with nuclear localization signals and is confirmed by direct experimental evidence. IBA assignment is appropriate for conservation of this cellular component assignment across the APSES family.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for PHD1's sequence-specific DNA binding function. This is a more specific aspect of DNA-binding transcription factor activity, appropriately supported by the conserved bHLH domain that recognizes E-box consensus sequences and related variants.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Sequence-specific DNA binding is a core molecular function of PHD1 enabled by its bHLH/APSES domain. The IBA assignment reflects phylogenetic conservation of this function across APSES proteins. Multiple experimental studies demonstrate specific binding of PHD1 to target promoter sequences. This more specific term is more informative than the broader DNA binding annotation.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on InterPro domain mapping (IPR036887, IPR018004) and UniProt keywords. This is a more general term subsumed by the sequence-specific DNA binding annotation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While this annotation is technically correct, GO:0043565 (sequence-specific DNA binding) is more informative and specific. PHD1's DNA binding activity is not merely generic protein-DNA interaction but specifically recognizes E-box consensus sequences through its bHLH domain. The IEA assignment is appropriate for domain-based inference, but the sequence-specific term better captures the actual function. Keeping this as non-core while maintaining the more specific sequence-specific binding annotation is optimal.

    summary: IEA annotation for nuclear localization based on UniProt subcellular location annotation. This is a duplicate of the IBA annotation already present and redundant with that evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is essential for PHD1 function as a transcription factor. While this is a duplicate of the IBA annotation for the same term, both evidence codes are appropriate and valid. IEA based on UniProt subcellular location curation is a reasonable independent line of evidence. Retaining both is acceptable as they represent different evidence sources (IBA phylogenetic, IEA subcellular location mapping).

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW:0804 Transcription). This represents PHD1's involvement in transcriptional processes through its role as a transcriptional regulator.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is correct but very general. As a transcriptional regulator that activates pseudohyphal genes, PHD1 is indeed involved in DNA-templated transcription. However, the annotation is less specific than "positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II" (GO:0045944) which is already present and more accurately captures PHD1's role. DNA-templated transcription encompasses both activation and repression; the positive regulation annotation is more informative about PHD1's specific mechanism. Keeping this as non-core while maintaining the more specific positive regulation annotations is preferred.

    summary: HDA (high-throughput data analysis) annotation from a comprehensive study determining DNA-binding specificities for 112 yeast transcription factors, including PHD1. This study systematically mapped binding motifs using protein binding microarrays.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:19111667 (Badis et al., 2008) is a direct experimental study of PHD1 DNA-binding specificity using high-throughput methods. The HDA evidence code is appropriate for this high-throughput data. The annotation correctly assigns sequence-specific DNA binding as PHD1 was characterized as having a specific DNA-binding motif. This provides independent experimental confirmation of the IBA and other sequence-specific DNA binding annotations.

This provides a second independent HDA evidence source confirming sequence-specific DNA binding. The study reports "over a 50% increase in the number of yeast DNA-binding proteins with experimentally determined DNA-binding specificities" and directly characterized PHD1 binding. Duplicate annotations with different evidence sources are appropriate when they represent independent experimental validations.

    summary: IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype) annotation based on direct experimental evidence from the foundational Gimeno & Fink (1994) study that identified PHD1. Overexpression of PHD1 dramatically induces pseudohyphal growth even under nutrient-rich conditions, demonstrating causality.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary discovery paper for PHD1 and the IMP evidence is directly justified. The study used a visual genetic screen for pseudohyphal growth determinants and showed that PHD1 overexpression induces pseudohyphal growth on rich medium (precocious induction). This is not merely correlation but functional causation demonstrated through gain-of-function. The term GO:2000222 (positive regulation of pseudohyphal growth) precisely captures this function. This is a core annotation representing the major biological process regulated by PHD1.

    summary: IMP annotation from Borneman et al. (2006) demonstrating that PHD1 overexpression is sufficient to induce complex developmental responses. Chromatin IP-chip studies show PHD1 binding to extensive target promoters and direct evidence of transcription factor activity as a master regulator.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IMP annotation from PMID:16449570 provides strong experimental evidence for DNA-binding transcription factor activity. The study shows that PHD1 is a "target hub" protein that when overexpressed is sufficient to induce pseudohyphal growth under non-inducing conditions, demonstrating its transcription factor activity. The study used chromatin immunoprecipitation to directly demonstrate DNA binding. This provides independent confirmation of the molecular function through overexpression analysis and target mapping.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IDA is the appropriate evidence code for direct observation of nuclear localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. This represents the highest quality evidence for subcellular localization. The foundational Gimeno & Fink paper directly demonstrates PHD1 nuclear presence using tagged protein and fluorescence microscopy. This is an essential cellular component assignment for a transcription factor and is well-established.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation from the same Gimeno & Fink paper showing that PHD1 overexpression causes precocious and vigorous pseudohyphal growth. As a master transcriptional regulator of this process, PHD1 necessarily acts through positive regulation of Pol II-transcribed genes like FLO11.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IMP annotation is well-justified. PHD1 overexpression causes the pseudohyphal growth phenotype, and this phenotype depends on expression of FLO11 and other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. PHD1 is a transcriptional activator (not a repressor) that promotes expression of these developmental genes. The annotation correctly specifies both the regulatory direction (positive) and the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase II) involved. This is a core annotation representing PHD1's primary mechanism of biological action.

core_functions:
- description: Master transcriptional regulator of pseudohyphal growth and morphogenesis. PHD1 contains a conserved bHLH/APSES DNA-binding domain that enables sequence-specific binding to E-box consensus sequences in target promoters. The protein functions as a key regulatory hub integrating signals from multiple developmental pathways (cAMP-PKA, MAPK cascades, nutrient sensing) to control the filamentous growth decision during nitrogen starvation. PHD1 overexpression induces approximately 214 genes, including the critical FLO11 cell adhesion gene, and is sufficient to trigger pseudohyphal growth even under nutrient-rich conditions. The protein is inherently unstable, with stability regulated by Cdk8-mediated phosphorylation providing a nutrient-sensing mechanism where stabilization during nitrogen limitation initiates the developmental cascade. This represents PHD1's core evolved function as a master regulator of morphogenesis and cellular differentiation in baker's yeast.
