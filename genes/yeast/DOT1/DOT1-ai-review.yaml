description: "DOT1 is the unique histone H3 lysine-79 (H3K79) methyltransferase in budding yeast, catalyzing mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3K79 within nucleosomes. This modification is located uniquely within the globular histone domain rather than in the N-terminal tail, distinguishing it from other histone methyltransferases. DOT1 plays critical roles in transcriptional regulation through marking active genes, DNA damage checkpoint control by enabling Rad9 recruitment to double-strand breaks, meiotic checkpoint surveillance, and silencing of subtelomeric regions through competition with Sir proteins. The enzyme is subject to allosteric regulation by H4K16 acetylation and H2B ubiquitination, which enhance its activity at transcriptionally active chromatin."

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: "DOT1 localizes to the nucleus where it performs its enzymatic functions on chromatin. IBA evidence from phylogenetic analysis is appropriate for this well-conserved component localization."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "Nuclear localization is well-established and core to DOT1 function. Contains multiple NLS signals. IBA annotation based on ortholog conservation is appropriate."

    label: histone H3K79 methyltransferase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: "DOT1's primary molecular function is H3K79 methyltransferase activity, the founding member of this enzyme class. IBA evidence reflects strong ortholog conservation across eukaryotes."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "This is the core enzymatic activity of DOT1. H3K79 methylation requires nucleosomal context and is not processive. IBA annotation appropriately reflects the highly conserved nature of this specific function across eukaryotes."

- term:
    id: GO:0031509
    label: subtelomeric heterochromatin formation
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: "DOT1 promotes subtelomeric heterochromatin formation indirectly by preventing Sir protein mislocalization through H3K79 methylation, creating an inhospitable chromatin environment for repressive proteins."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "While DOT1 itself marks active chromatin with H3K79 methylation, loss of DOT1 causes Sir protein spreading and derepression of subtelomeric regions. This represents an important function that is conserved across organisms with similar chromatin structure. IBA annotation reflects functional conservation."

    id: GO:0006281
    label: DNA repair
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: "DOT1-mediated H3K79 methylation plays multiple roles in DNA damage repair through enabling checkpoint signaling and facilitating recruitment of repair factors to damage sites."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "H3K79 methylation is required for efficient DNA repair through multiple pathways including homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, and translesion synthesis regulation. This function is conserved across eukaryotes as evidenced by DOT1L's role in mammalian DNA damage responses. IBA annotation appropriately reflects this conservation."

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: "DOT1-mediated H3K79 methylation is essential for DNA damage checkpoint control, enabling recruitment of the Rad9/53BP1 checkpoint protein via methyl-lysine reader domains."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "H3K79 methylation is a key signal that enables recruitment of the Rad9 checkpoint protein (through its tudor domain) to double-strand breaks. This mechanism is conserved between yeast Rad9 and human 53BP1. DOT1 mutants show severe checkpoint defects. IBA annotation reflects strong functional conservation."

  review:
    summary: "InterPro-based IEA annotation recognizing DOT1 as a methyltransferase involved in DNA damage checkpoint control."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "While the annotation is correct, it is a computational inference from InterPro domain annotation rather than direct evidence. The experimental evidence (IBA and IMP) for this function is superior and this IEA annotation is superseded by stronger evidence."

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: "DOT1 localizes to telomeric and subtelomeric regions where it influences heterochromatin formation and silencing dynamics."
    action: MODIFY
    reason: "While DOT1 does localize to telomeric chromatin and affects telomeric silencing, calling it 'located_in' the telomeric region may be misleading. DOT1 is primarily a global histone methyltransferase found throughout the nucleus and euchromatic regions, with particular functional importance at telomeres. The annotation should more precisely characterize as involvement in telomeric heterochromatin rather than constitutive localization."

    summary: "DOT1 binds to nucleosomes and catalyzes methylation exclusively in nucleosomal context, showing strong substrate preference for nucleosomal over free histones."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "This annotation correctly reflects DOT1's essential interaction with nucleosomes. DOT1 has essentially no activity on free histone H3, requiring the nucleosomal context for both binding and catalytic activity."

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: "This is a broad, general annotation that is correct but captures a secondary consequence of DOT1 activity. The core function is H3K79 methylation with specific roles in checkpoint signaling and heterochromatin boundary formation. More specific annotations better capture DOT1's function."

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

    summary: "DOT1 exhibits broad methyltransferase activity, specifically acting as an H3K79 methyltransferase. This annotation is correct but overly general."
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: "While technically correct, this is an overly broad term that obscures the specific substrate and lysine residue (H3K79). The specific term GO:0031151 'histone H3K79 methyltransferase activity' is much more informative and already annotated. This general term provides no additional functional information."

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: "This is an excessively broad parent term that is technically correct but provides minimal functional information. DOT1 is specifically a methyltransferase (GO:0008168) acting on H3K79 (GO:0031151). These more specific terms already capture the functional information."

  review:
    summary: "DOT1 catalyzes histone H3K79 methylation, placing it in the broader methylation process category."
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: "This is overly broad. GO:0032259 'methylation' is a very general term that could apply to any methylation event in the cell. More specific process terms are available: GO:0031151 for the molecular function and GO:0031509 or checkpoint-related terms for biological processes."

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: "While DOT1 does affect cell cycle through its checkpoint functions, calling this 'regulation of cell cycle' is misleading. DOT1 specifically regulates checkpoint control (GO:0000077, GO:0031571, GO:0031573) not the cell cycle per se. The checkpoint terms are more precise."

    summary: "DOT1 catalyzes all three methylation states at H3K79 (me1, me2, me3) through distributive sequential catalysis. The trimethylation is catalytically distinct from monomethylation."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: "DOT1 does catalyze H3K79 trimethylation as one of three possible methylation states. While most H3K79 is monomethylated in vivo, the trimethylation activity is documented and has specific roles at centromeres during meiosis and marking active transcription."

  review:
    summary: "DOT1 has multiple protein-protein interactions documented in IntAct database from high-throughput yeast two-hybrid and biochemical studies."
    action: REMOVE
    reason: "While the annotation is technically supported by IPI evidence, 'protein binding' is excessively uninformative. It tells us nothing about which proteins, what the functional relevance is, or what the biological consequence is. This violates curation guidelines to avoid vague terms like 'protein binding'. Specific protein-protein interactions should be captured through more specific functional annotations."

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
