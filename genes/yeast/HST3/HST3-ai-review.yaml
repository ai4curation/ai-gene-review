        its requirement for Acs activity regulation, this is not a primary enzymatic
        function. HST3 is a histone deacetylase whose role in fatty acid metabolism
        is indirect, mediated through NAD-dependent regulation of Acs protein acetylation.
        The annotation overstates HST3s direct involvement in metabolic process. Better
        annotated as a regulatory cofactor effect than a metabolic process function.'
