description: TOR1 (Target of Rapamycin 1) is a 2470 amino acid serine/threonine kinase homologous to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. As a core component of TORC1 (TOR Complex 1), TOR1 serves as a master regulator of cellular growth and nutrient sensing in response to nitrogen, carbon, and amino acid availability. TOR1 phosphorylates multiple downstream targets (Tap42, Sch9, Ypk3, Stm1) to coordinate protein synthesis via translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis, while simultaneously inhibiting autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions. TOR1 localizes to multiple membrane compartments (vacuolar, plasma, endosomal, Golgi membranes) and translocates to the nucleus in response to nutrient availability where it regulates ribosomal protein gene transcription. The kinase activity is rapamycin-sensitive for TORC1-specific functions and essential for cell cycle progression and replicative aging control.

    label: protein serine/threonine kinase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation indicating TOR1 has protein serine/threonine kinase activity based on phylogenetic inference from characterized orthologs. This is the core molecular function and catalytic activity of TOR1, explicitly confirmed in UniProt with EC number 2.7.11.1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary catalytic activity of TOR1. The serine/threonine kinase activity is the defining molecular function of this protein. UniProt records confirm this with EC 2.7.11.1 designation and multiple experimental confirmations. IBA is appropriate phylogenetic inference for this well-characterized catalytic domain conserved across eukaryotes. This is a critical core function essential for all downstream signaling.

core_functions:
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0004674
    label: protein serine/threonine kinase activity
  description: Core catalytic activity. TOR1 phosphorylates serine and threonine residues on downstream effectors (Tap42, Sch9, Ypk3, Stm1, Pib2). This kinase activity is the fundamental mechanism enabling all TOR signaling functions. Multiple evidence codes (IBA, IDA, IMP, EXP) confirm this core function.
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0005524
    label: ATP binding
  description: Essential cofactor binding for kinase catalysis. ATP serves as the phosphoryl donor in TOR1-catalyzed protein phosphorylation. Required for all serine/threonine kinase activity.
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0044877
    label: protein-containing complex binding
  description: TORC1 complex assembly. TOR1 binds core TORC1 components (KOG1, LST8, TCO89) and associates with upstream regulatory proteins (PIB2 as glutamine sensor, FKBP-rapamycin as inhibitor). Complex formation is essential for all TORC1 signaling.
