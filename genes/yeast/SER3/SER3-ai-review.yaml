  label: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
description: SER3 encodes D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase 1, the enzyme that catalyzes the first and
  committed step of L-serine biosynthesis via the phosphorylated pathway. Ser3p oxidizes 3-phosphoglycerate
  to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate with concurrent reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The enzyme also exhibits alpha-ketoglutarate
  reductase activity, converting α-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. SER3 is subject to complex transcriptional
  regulation including repression by the SRG1 lncRNA in serine-replete conditions and activation by Gcn4p
  during amino acid starvation. The protein is also post-translationally regulated by TORC1-mediated phosphorylation.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This is the primary and well-established function of Ser3p. Multiple experimental studies
      confirm Ser3p catalyzes the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate with NAD+
      as cofactor. This is supported by IMP evidence in PMID:12525494.

  review:
    summary: Correct - Ser3p catalyzes the first step of the phosphorylated L-serine biosynthetic pathway.
      Loss of both SER3 and SER33 renders yeast auxotrophic for serine, confirming this role. Supported
      by IMP evidence in PMID:12525494.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is a correct but overly general annotation. While Ser3p does participate in amino acid
      biosynthesis (specifically serine), the more specific term GO:0006564 (L-serine biosynthetic process)
      is more informative and appropriate.

    label: oxidoreductase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is correct but too general. Ser3p is indeed an oxidoreductase that uses NAD+ as cofactor,
      but the more specific terms GO:0004617 (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity) and GO:0016616
      provide more informative functional descriptions.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This accurately describes the biochemical mechanism of Ser3p, which oxidizes the CH-OH group
      of 3-phosphoglycerate using NAD+ as electron acceptor. This is mechanistically correct and more
      specific than the general oxidoreductase activity term.

  review:

      a Rossmann fold domain for NAD+ binding, which is conserved across phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases.
