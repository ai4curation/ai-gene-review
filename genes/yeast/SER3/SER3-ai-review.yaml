  id: NCBITaxon:559292
  label: Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C
description: 'SER3 encodes D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase 1, the enzyme that catalyzes the first and committed step of L-serine biosynthesis via the phosphorylated pathway. Ser3p oxidizes 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate with concurrent reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The enzyme also exhibits alpha-ketoglutarate reductase activity, converting α-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. SER3 is subject to complex transcriptional regulation including repression by the SRG1 lncRNA in serine-replete conditions and activation by Gcn4p during amino acid starvation. The protein is also post-translationally regulated by TORC1-mediated phosphorylation.'

  review:
    summary: 'This is the primary and well-established function of Ser3p. Multiple experimental studies confirm Ser3p catalyzes the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate with NAD+ as cofactor. This is supported by IMP evidence in PMID:12525494.'

  review:
    summary: 'Correct - Ser3p catalyzes the first step of the phosphorylated L-serine biosynthetic pathway. Loss of both SER3 and SER33 renders yeast auxotrophic for serine, confirming this role. Supported by IMP evidence in PMID:12525494.'

  review:
    summary: 'This is a correct but overly general annotation. While Ser3p does participate in amino acid biosynthesis (specifically serine), the more specific term GO:0006564 (L-serine biosynthetic process) is more informative and appropriate.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This is correct but too general. Ser3p is indeed an oxidoreductase that uses NAD+ as cofactor, but the more specific terms GO:0004617 (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity) and GO:0016616 provide more informative functional descriptions.'

  review:
    summary: 'This accurately describes the biochemical mechanism of Ser3p, which oxidizes the CH-OH group of 3-phosphoglycerate using NAD+ as electron acceptor. This is mechanistically correct and more specific than the general oxidoreductase activity term.'
