description: >-
  HSP82 is the stress-inducible isoform of Hsp90 in S. cerevisiae. It is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone
  that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance, and proper regulation of specific client proteins,
  particularly those involved in cell cycle control and signal transduction. HSP82 functions as a homodimer,
  undergoing an ATP-dependent conformational cycle that acts as a molecular clamp on client proteins. It interacts
  with a large network of co-chaperones (STI1, AHA1, CDC37, SBA1, CPR6, CPR7, CNS1, SSE1, HCH1) that modulate
  its ATPase cycle and substrate recognition. HSP82 is required for growth at high temperatures.

  review:
    summary: >-
      HSP82/Hsp90 is a well-established protein folding chaperone. IBA annotation is consistent with the
      known function of this conserved chaperone family across eukaryotes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein folding is a core biological process for Hsp90. UniProt describes HSP82 as a "Molecular chaperone
      that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins."
      Multiple IMP and IDA evidence codes confirm involvement in de novo protein folding (PMID:10564510, PMID:9371781).

      HSP82 has well-characterized ATPase activity essential for its chaperone cycle. IBA annotation is correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ATPase activity is fundamental to Hsp90 function. Directly demonstrated by IDA (PMID:12235160) and
      multiple structural studies showing ATP binding and hydrolysis. UniProt documents extensive mutagenesis
      data affecting ATPase activity (e.g., A41V causes 98% reduction, G83D abolishes activity).

      HSP82 functions as a homodimer and forms complexes with many co-chaperones and client proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      HSP82 is a homodimer and forms well-characterized complexes with co-chaperones (STI1, AHA1, SBA1, CDC37,
      CPR6, CPR7, CNS1, SSE1). Crystal structure of HSP82-SBA1-ATP closed complex (PDB:2CG9, PMID:16625188)

      IBA annotation for plasma membrane localization of HSP82. While Hsp90 is primarily cytoplasmic,
      some evidence exists for plasma membrane association in other organisms.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      HSP82 is primarily cytoplasmic (IDA PMID:32920053, PMID:27385335). Plasma membrane localization
      is not well-established for the yeast protein specifically, but the IBA inference from orthologs
      is plausible for a minor pool. Not a core localization.

      HSP82 binds ATP as part of its chaperone cycle. Well-established by crystallography.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ATP binding is essential for Hsp90 function. Multiple crystal structures show ATP/ADP binding
      (PDB:1AM1, 1AMW, 2CG9). UniProt documents extensive ATP binding site residues. The functional
      cycle is linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis.

      HSP82 stabilizes client proteins as part of its chaperone function. IBA annotation is appropriate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein stabilization is a core function of Hsp90. IMP evidence shows HSP82 is required for
      protein maturation (PMID:27068472). UniProt states it "promotes the maturation, structural
      maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins."

      HSP82 is the heat-inducible Hsp90 isoform, centrally involved in heat stress response.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      HSP82 is named as a heat shock protein precisely because it is induced by heat stress. UniProt
      confirms it is "required for growth at high temperatures" (PMID:2674684). The gene name itself
      (HSP82 = Heat Shock Protein 82) reflects this core function.

      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. HSP82 does interact with unfolded/misfolded client proteins
      but its mechanism is better captured by GO:0140662 (ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. HSP82 is an ATP-dependent foldase; while it does bind
      unfolded/non-native proteins as part of its chaperone cycle, the binding is coupled to ATP-driven
      conformational changes. The more appropriate term is GO:0140662 "ATP-dependent protein folding
      chaperone" which captures both the binding and the active folding mechanism. IDA evidence
      from PMID:10564510 demonstrated binding to denatured substrates, but this is part of the broader
      chaperone activity.

      HSP82 is found in both cytoplasm and nucleus (IDA PMID:32920053). Perinuclear localization

      IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping. Broader than ATP binding but not incorrect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Nucleotide binding is a parent term of ATP binding. While more specific IBA and IEA annotations
      for ATP binding exist, this broader IEA annotation is not incorrect and reflects the UniProt
      keyword mapping. It is redundant with the more specific ATP binding annotation but acceptable.

      Supported by experimental evidence (IDA and IMP, PMID:12853471). HSP82 assists in proteasome
      assembly as one of its client-dependent functions. Not a core function of HSP82 per se, but

    reason: >-
      GO:0140662 is the ideal molecular function term for HSP82/Hsp90. It captures both the ATP
      dependence and the protein folding chaperone activity. HSP82 binds to client proteins and
      assists their folding through an ATP-dependent conformational cycle. This should be considered
      the primary MF annotation for HSP82.
