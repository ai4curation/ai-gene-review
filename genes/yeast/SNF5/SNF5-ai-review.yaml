description: 'SNF5 is a core regulatory and structural subunit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent
  chromatin

  remodeling complex. It serves as a critical hub that coordinates complex assembly,

  couples ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome remodeling through histone octamer anchoring,
  and

  mediates recruitment of the complex by transcriptional activators. SNF5 contains
  conserved

  arginine-rich repeat domains that directly engage the histone acidic patch and stabilize

  nucleosomes during DNA translocation. Loss of SNF5 severely impairs SWI/SNF activity,

  alters complex architecture, and reduces recruitment selectivity. SNF5 is essential
  for

  gene-specific transcriptional activation, cell differentiation programs, nucleosome

  positioning at promoters, metabolic adaptation, and DNA repair. The protein contains
  an

  N-terminal glutamine-rich region unique to yeast that functions as a metabolic sensor.

    summary: SNF5 localizes to nuclear chromatin as a component of the SWI/SNF complex.
      IEA from InterPro domain annotation is reasonable for cellular_component localization
      based on complex membership and experimentally demonstrated nuclear localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SNF5 is demonstrated to localize to nuclear chromosomes as a core SWI/SNF
      complex subunit (PMID:2233708, PMID:22932476). The term correctly identifies
      a major site of SNF5 function. IEA evidence from InterPro annotation is conservative
      and appropriate for this well-established localization. This represents core
      subcellular localization of the protein.

    reason: SNF5 is a well-established nuclear protein functioning as a SWI/SNF complex
      subunit. Multiple experimental sources confirm nuclear localization (PMID:2233708,

  review:
    summary: SNF5 directly participates in ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling as a
      core SWI/SNF complex subunit that anchors histone octamers and couples ATP hydrolysis
      to nucleosome movement. IEA from InterPro is conservative but represents a core
      function of this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Chromatin remodeling is a primary CORE function of SNF5. SNF5 is essential
      for SWI/SNF catalytic activity, directly engaging nucleosomes through arginine-rich
      repeat domains that bind the histone acidic patch (deep research). SNF5 deletion
      reduces nucleosome remodeling efficiency 2-3 fold and uncouples ATP hydrolysis
      from productive DNA translocation. This is not a secondary or peripheral function
      but rather represents SNF5's primary biochemical role. Multiple experimental
      studies demonstrate this (PMID:11163188, PMID:1459453, cryo-EM structures in
      deep research).

  review:
    summary: SNF5 is involved in transcriptional activation through its role in chromatin
      remodeling. IEA from UniProt keyword mapping is appropriate but somewhat indirect.
      SNF5 does not directly catalyze transcription but rather facilitates access
      to DNA packaged in chromatin.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While SNF5 does not directly synthesize RNA, it is legitimately involved
      in enabling DNA-templated transcription through its role in making DNA accessible
      for transcription factor and RNA polymerase II binding. SNF5 is required for
      activator- driven recruitment and for nucleosome positioning that affects transcription
      initiation and elongation. The term correctly identifies that SNF5 participation
      is necessary for transcription at many genes. IEA evidence is conservative but
      supported by multiple studies showing transcriptional defects in snf5 deletion
      strains.

  review:
    summary: SNF5 protein binding capacity is demonstrated by interaction with SWI/SNF
      complex subunits (SWI1, SWI3) in proteome-wide studies. However, the term 'protein
      binding' is overly generic and uninformative. SNF5's primary molecular interaction
      is with histone octamers and with specific SWI/SNF subunits as part of complex
      assembly. More specific GO terms describing these interactions would be more
      informative.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SNF5 does indeed bind proteins (SWI/SNF complex subunits and histone octamers),
      and the IPI evidence from proteome-wide interaction studies is valid. However,
      'protein binding' is an extremely broad molecular function term that provides
      minimal functional insight. The annotation is not incorrect, but SNF5's protein
      interactions are highly specialized (histone interactions, specific SWI/SNF
      subunit interactions) and would be better represented by more specific terms.
      Nevertheless, the annotation accurately reflects protein-protein interactions
      demonstrated in multiple high-quality proteomics studies (IntAct database, which
      curates the interaction evidence). This is marked as NON-CORE because more specific
      annotations better capture SNF5 function. The term should be retained but deprioritized
      in favor of more informative molecular function annotations.

    summary: SNF5 is a core component of SWI/SNF complex as demonstrated through cryo-EM
      structural analysis. IDA evidence from direct identification in structural studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:18644858 ("Architecture of the SWI/SNF-nucleosome complex") provides
      structural evidence of SNF5 as integral component of SWI/SNF complex through
      cryo-EM. IDA evidence from structural characterization is highly appropriate
      for cellular component annotation. This is a CORE function - SNF5 membership
      in SWI/SNF complex defines its biological role. SNF5 is not a transiently associated
      or minor component but rather a structurally essential subunit.

      IMP evidence from genetic deletion showing complex is non-functional without

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:8159677 also provides IMP evidence demonstrating SNF5 deletion ablates
      SWI/SNF complex function. This functional evidence complements structural IDA
      evidence. SNF5 is not merely a component but an essential subunit without which
      the complex cannot function properly. This represents a core cellular component
      annotation with strong functional support.

    summary: SNF5 involved in carbon catabolite activation of transcription through
      functional interaction with transcription factors. IGI evidence from genetic
      analysis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:14580348 includes analysis of SNF5 involvement in carbon catabolite
      response genes, demonstrating SNF5's role in this specific transcriptional process.
      IGI evidence from genetic functional analysis is appropriate. SNF5 participates
      in metabolic adaptation and carbon source utilization through its general transcriptional
      activation function, particularly at genes like ADH2 induced during glucose
      starvation (supported by deep research findings on SNF5's metabolic sensing
      role). This represents a specific biological process where SNF5's general chromatin
      remodeling function is applied. The annotation is valid and supported.
