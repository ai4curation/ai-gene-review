## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P14064
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transcriptional activator HAP4;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HAP4; OrderedLocusNames=YKL109W; ORFNames=YKL465;
- **Organism (full):** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Hap4_TF_heteromerisation. (IPR018287); Hap4_Hap_bind (PF10297)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HAP4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HAP4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HAP4** (gene ID: HAP4, UniProt: P14064) in yeast.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research Plan and Methodology
We verified gene/protein identity before synthesis. HAP4 (UniProt P14064) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c encodes the transcriptional activation subunit of the Hap2/3/4/5 CCAAT-binding complex, which activates respiratory and mitochondrial gene programs during the diauxic shift. We prioritized 2023–2024 peer‑reviewed and expert sources, supplemented by high‑quality preprints where they provide unique, recent insights. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 5-7, wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and complex membership: Hap4 is the activation subunit of the HAP (Hap2/3/4/5) CCAAT-binding transcription complex in budding yeast. Hap2/3/5 mediate DNA binding to CCAAT motifs, while Hap4 provides the activation domain; all are required for full activation of respiratory genes. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)
- Core biological role: The HAP complex is a central regulator of the shift from fermentation to respiration, coordinating transcription of mitochondrial/respiratory genes (e.g., cytochrome c, ATP synthase components) during the diauxic shift and ethanol utilization. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10)
- Localization and domains: Hap4 functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional activator associated with the CCAAT-bound Hap2/3/5 complex. Recent sources reaffirm its role as the activation subunit; while PF10297 (Hap4_Hap_bind) is the known Hap4–Hap complex interaction domain from databases, recent 2023–2024 literature summarized here focuses on complex function and signaling integration rather than detailed domain mapping. (wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Signal integration model: A 2023 systems study integrating proteomics and transcriptomics proposes that the HAP complex integrates SNF1 (AMPK-like) signaling, which induces HAP4 at low glucose, with PKA/TORC1 signaling, which regulates HAP5 and ribosomal programs. The model reproduces diauxic-shift dynamics with high accuracy (R2 ≈ 0.96–0.98), predicts Hap5 upregulation (~2.5-fold) as glucose falls, and supports a revised view where both Hap4 and Hap5 are dynamically regulated. URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3438615/v1 (posted Oct 2023). (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 5-7, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15)
- SNF1/AMPK and mitochondrial proteostasis context: A 2024 study on metabolic regulation of misfolded protein import into mitochondria (MAGIC pathway) highlights SNF1’s role in mitochondrial biogenesis and references Hap4 as the activation subunit of the CCAAT-bound HAP2/3 complex that promotes respiratory gene expression during nutrient shifts. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.29.534670 (posted Mar 2024). (wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)
- Promoter crosstalk around HAP4: A 2024 Nucleic Acids Research article on zinc‑cluster regulators of the fermentation-to-respiration transition reports cooperative DNA-binding behavior among regulators, including interactions at the HAP4 promoter with Rds2/Ert1, pointing to network-level control shaping HAP4 expression in glucose withdrawal. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1185 (Dec 2024). (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15)
- Aging and heme signaling: A 2024 GeroScience paper shows heme supplementation extends replicative lifespan independently of Hap4 and paradoxically reduces Hap4 protein levels (p<0.001), with MG132 proteasome inhibition failing to reverse this decrease, suggesting non‑proteasomal regulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01218-9 (May 2024). (patnaik2024lifespanregulationby pages 4-7)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Stress and inhibitor tolerance in lignocellulosic fermentation: Overexpression of HAP4 improved fermentation performance under combined acetic and formic acid stress during glucose–xylose co-fermentation; transcriptomics implicated upregulation of transport and ribosome biogenesis genes and genome‑stability factors, suggesting multiple tolerance mechanisms. URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-025-02764-3 (Jul 2025). Although 2025, it provides the most recent applied dataset. (xiao2025regulatorymechanismof pages 1-2, xiao2025regulatorymechanismof pages 8-10)
- Systems and mitochondrial fitness: Work linking SNF1 activation, Hap4 function, and mitochondrial biogenesis provides rationale for using HAP4 activation to bias respiration in engineered strains, including contexts involving proteostasis and metabolic stress. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.29.534670 (Mar 2024). (wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)
- Industrial/synthetic biology implications: Modeling indicates HAP complex activity responds to glucose and nutrient-signaling axes; leveraging this can tune respiratory capacity and timing of the diauxic shift for bioproduction processes where respiratory metabolism enhances yield or product quality. URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3438615/v1 (Oct 2023). (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 5-7)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2023 integrated model reframes HAP complex regulation as jointly controlled by SNF1 (inducing Hap4) and PKA/TORC1 (upregulating Hap5 under low glucose), supporting an “integrator” role of the HAP complex across nutrient-sensing pathways. This helps explain variable outcomes of HAP4 overexpression across studies and suggests combinatorial modulation (e.g., of TORC1/PKA) may be necessary to fully activate respiratory programs. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15)
- The 2024 NAR study underscores promoter-level crosstalk at HAP4 with other regulators of the fermentative–respiratory switch, highlighting that HAP4 expression is embedded within a broader transcription factor network (Rds2/Ert1), not a simple on/off switch. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15)
- Aging work decoupling heme-driven lifespan extension from Hap4 indicates that while Hap4 is a major driver of respiratory gene expression and has been linked to lifespan extension, upstream metabolic signals (heme) can bypass Hap4, pointing to parallel longevity pathways and cautioning against assuming Hap4 dependence in all respiration-linked phenotypes. (patnaik2024lifespanregulationby pages 4-7)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Model fit and regulatory magnitudes: The multi‑omic dynamic model reproduces diauxic-shift transitions with R2 ≈ 0.96 (DM2015) and 0.98 (DD2020). It infers Hap5 upregulation by ≈2.5-fold as glucose decreases and indicates HAP4 transcriptional response is ~10× stronger than HAP5 in a validation benchmark referencing classic data. URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3438615/v1 (Oct 2023). (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 5-7)
- Heme and Hap4 protein abundance: Heme supplementation significantly reduces Hap4 protein (p<0.001) without rescue by proteasome inhibitor MG132, despite replicative lifespan extension occurring independently of Hap4. URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01218-9 (May 2024). (patnaik2024lifespanregulationby pages 4-7)
- Mixed-acid stress application: Under co‑fermentation with acetic+formic acid, HAP4 overexpression correlates with upregulation of LEU1, ALD6, NCE103, PDR5, STL1, and PHO89, implicating TOR activation, NADPH generation, pH homeostasis, xenobiotic efflux, and glycerol uptake; these transcriptomic adjustments align with improved inhibitor tolerance and fermentation performance. URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-025-02764-3 (Jul 2025). (xiao2025regulatorymechanismof pages 8-10, xiao2025regulatorymechanismof pages 1-2)

Functional summary and localization
- Functional role: Hap4 is the activation subunit of the CCAAT-binding HAP complex that drives expression of respiratory/mitochondrial genes in response to nutrient conditions; it is induced under low glucose via SNF1 and works with Hap2/3/5 to promote oxidative metabolism during diauxic shift. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)
- Localization: Operates in the nucleus as part of a transcriptional activator complex binding CCAAT motifs in target promoters, consistent with promoter‑centric regulation of respiratory gene programs and promoter-level regulation at the HAP4 locus itself. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15, wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)
- Pathway context: Integrates signals from SNF1/AMPK and PKA/TORC1, with SNF1 upregulating HAP4 and PKA/TORC1 controlling HAP5 and ribosomal programs; together they coordinate the transcriptional reprogramming from fermentation to respiration. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 13-15)

Notes on domain annotation
- The Hap4_Hap_bind (PF10297) interaction domain is consistent with Hap4’s role as activation subunit associating with the DNA‑binding Hap2/3/5 complex, but recent 2023–2024 sources cited here focus on regulatory integration rather than structural domain mapping. Where specific domain claims are required, consult curated databases in parallel with primary literature. (wang2024metabolicregulationof pages 17-19)

Caveats and open questions
- Overexpression of HAP4 alone can increase respiratory capacity but may be insufficient to fully derepress all respiratory targets without concurrent modulation of PKA/TORC1 signaling—consistent with model predictions that the complex integrates multiple nutrient‑sensing inputs. (henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 1-5, henriques2023multiomicdataand pages 7-10)
- Heme’s reduction of Hap4 protein yet Hap4‑independent lifespan extension argues for parallel or downstream pathways affecting mitochondrial function and longevity that do not require Hap4, warranting further mechanistic dissection. (patnaik2024lifespanregulationby pages 4-7)

Conclusion
Hap4 (P14064) is the transcriptional activation subunit of the HAP CCAAT-binding complex that orchestrates the transition to respiratory metabolism by activating mitochondrial and respiratory gene expression during the diauxic shift. Recent systems work reframes HAP complex regulation as an integration point for SNF1/AMPK and PKA/TORC1, with evidence that HAP5 is dynamically regulated downstream of PKA/TORC1 while Hap4 is induced by SNF1 under low glucose. Applications span stress‑tolerant fermentation and potential lifespan modulation, though heme-driven longevity can occur independently of Hap4. Overall, HAP4’s nuclear activation role and pathway integration make it a key lever for engineering yeast respiratory metabolism and stress performance.
