description: |-
  HAP4 (Heme activator protein 4) is the transcriptional activation subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor (CBF/HAP complex), a heterotetrameric transcription factor (Hap2/3/4/5). HAP4 does not bind DNA directly but associates with the DNA-binding Hap2/3/5 heterotrimer and provides the primary transcriptional activation domains necessary for stimulating gene expression. The HAP complex regulates the diauxic shift from fermentation to respiration by activating transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and electron transport chain components in response to nutrient depletion (low glucose). HAP4 expression is induced by SNF1/AMPK signaling under low glucose conditions and is glucose-repressible. Core functions include transcriptional activation of respiratory metabolism genes and metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability.

  review:
    summary: |-
      HAP4 is annotated with generic DNA binding activity. However, the literature shows HAP4 does not directly bind DNA. The abstract of PMID:2676721 states that in hap4 mutants, "the binding of HAP2 and HAP3 (HAP2/3) is not observed in vitro," and that HAP4 "encodes a regulatory subunit of the bound complex" - not the DNA-binding subunit. PMID:16278450 confirms that "the Hap2p/Hap3p/Hap5p heterotrimer is the DNA-binding component" while "the Hap4p subunit contains the transcriptional activation domain." The IEA annotation appears to be incorrectly transferred from keyword-based mapping.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: |-
      This annotation is mechanistically incorrect. HAP4 does not directly bind DNA - it provides transcriptional activation domains to the DNA-bound Hap2/3/5 complex. The annotation misrepresents HAP4's function by conflating complex membership with direct DNA binding capability.

  review:
    summary: |-
      Nuclear localization is appropriate for HAP4, which functions as a transcriptional activator in the nucleus as part of the CCAAT-binding complex at target promoters.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |-
      Nuclear localization is correct and consistent with HAP4's role as a transcriptional regulator. This is a core cellular localization feature.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: |-
      HAP4 is annotated with DNA-templated transcription, which describes the process of RNA synthesis itself. This is overly generic for a transcriptional regulator. HAP4's specific role is not in performing transcription but in regulating it.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: |-
      This term describes the core enzymatic process (RNA polymerase activity), not HAP4's function. HAP4 regulates transcription through activation domains, not by performing the transcription reaction. More specific regulatory terms better represent its function.

  review:
    summary: |-
      HAP4 is annotated with regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. While HAP4 responds to glucose/carbohydrate availability through glucose-repressible expression, it does not directly regulate carbohydrate metabolic enzymes. Instead, it activates respiratory/mitochondrial genes that oxidize carbohydrates. The annotation conflates metabolic context with direct molecular targets.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: |-
      HAP4 regulates genes encoding respiratory proteins, not carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. The annotation overstates the scope of HAP4's direct function. GO:0043457 (regulation of cellular respiration) is more accurate.

    summary: |-
      HAP4 is annotated as a component of respiratory chain complex. However, HAP4 is a transcription factor that regulates genes encoding respiratory chain components, not a structural component of the respiratory chain itself. The source (PMID:21108829) describes HAP4 as a "transcriptional regulator" involved in "mitochondrial biogenesis," not as a complex component.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: |-
      This annotation is mechanistically incorrect. HAP4 is a transcription factor that activates genes encoding respiratory chain proteins, not a structural component of respiratory chain complexes (Complexes I-IV in the inner mitochondrial membrane). The annotation conflates transcriptional regulation of respiratory genes with structural participation in respiratory complexes. GO:0043457 (regulation of cellular respiration) is the appropriate annotation.

- description: |-
    Transcriptional activation of respiratory and mitochondrial genes. HAP4 is the primary transcriptional activation subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor complex. It provides multiple acidic activation domains that recruit histone acetyltransferase complexes (SAGA, NuA4) to activate genes encoding respiratory chain components (cytochrome c, ATP synthase subunits, electron transport chain proteins) during the diauxic shift from fermentation to respiration and in response to non-fermentable carbon sources. The activation function is mediated through interaction with Tra1p and other transcriptional machinery.
