description: POB3 is the small subunit of the FACT (Facilitates Chromatin 
  Transcription) complex, an essential heterodimeric histone chaperone that 
  works with Spt16 to dynamically reorganize nucleosomes during transcription 
  elongation, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Unlike mammalian SSRP1, yeast 
  POB3 lacks intrinsic DNA-binding capacity and instead cooperates with Nhp6 
  proteins for DNA recognition. POB3 specifically binds H2A-H2B dimers through 
  its acidic C-terminus and contributes to H3-H4 interactions through its middle
  pleckstrin homology domains. The protein is essential for cell viability and 
  localizes to active transcription sites and replication forks within 
  chromatin.

    description: Histone chaperone activity through nucleosome reorganization. 
      POB3 is the critical histone chaperone subunit of FACT that mediates 
      reversible disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes through binding to 
      H2A-H2B dimers (C-terminal acidic domain) and H3-H4 tetramers (middle 
      pleckstrin homology domains). This nucleosome dynamics activity is the 
      molecular foundation for all of POB3's functional roles.

    review:
      summary: IEA annotation based on InterPro domain IPR000969 (SSRP1/POB3). 
        However, this annotation is misleading in the context of yeast POB3. 
        While POB3 contains domains shared with SSRP1 family members, POB3 
        itself lacks intrinsic DNA-binding capacity. DNA binding in the yeast 
        FACT complex is provided by Nhp6 proteins, not POB3. The domain 
        annotation is correct at the sequence level but does not reflect actual 
        POB3 function.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: "Yeast POB3 does not directly bind DNA. Unlike mammalian SSRP1 which
        contains an HMG-box domain for DNA binding, POB3 achieves FACT function through
        cooperation with Nhp6 proteins that provide DNA-binding capability. UniProt
        itself notes: 'In contrast to the orthologous protein in animals and plants,
        this protein does not contain a HMG box DNA-binding domain. This function
        may instead be provided by the HMG box of the associated NHP6A/NHP6B proteins

      reason: While technically accurate, this term is too general for POB3's

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: FACT has documented roles in both transcription initiation and 
        elongation. IDA evidence shows POB3 promotes formation of preinitiation 
        complexes. This is a secondary but confirmed function. Core function is 
        elongation, but this initiation role is documented.
