  review:
    summary: Correct annotation. UniProt record confirms FMN cofactor requirement
      and binding sites are annotated (residues 92-94, 121, 143, 171, 240, 262, 295-299,
      319). Deep mechanistic analysis confirms FMN undergoes oxidation/reduction cycles
      during catalysis, with electrons transferred from L-lactate substrate to FMN
      cofactor, followed by reaction with O2 to regenerate oxidized flavin. This annotation
      is essential and well-supported.

  review:
    summary: Correct but overly general annotation. This enzyme is specifically an
      FMN-dependent oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.2) that catalyzes stereospecific oxidation
      of (S)-lactate to pyruvate with O2 as electron acceptor. Deep mechanistic analysis
      confirms it operates via α-hydroxyacid oxidation mechanism with strict specificity
      for (S)-lactate and large kinetic isotope effects for α-H abstraction. The more
      specific term (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase activity (GO:0003973) precisely captures
      this enzymatic function.

  findings:

      O2 as electron acceptor
    supporting_text: The haox-encoded enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of L-(S)-lactate
      to pyruvate, with O₂ serving as the electron acceptor and producing H₂O₂
  - statement: FMN-dependent α-hydroxyacid oxidation mechanism with carbanion intermediate
    supporting_text: Studies show LOX operates via a flavin-mediated α-hydroxyacid
      oxidation mechanism. The enzyme abstracts the α-hydrogen from L-lactate to form
      a carbanion, electrons are transferred to the FMN cofactor, and reduced FMN
      reacts with molecular oxygen to yield H₂O₂
  - statement: Exhibits strict specificity for (S)-lactate with large kinetic isotope
      effects
    supporting_text: The enzyme shows strict specificity for (S)-lactate (L-lactate).
      Kinetic studies indicate large kinetic isotope effects for α-H abstraction,
      consistent with direct C–H bond cleavage in the rate-limiting step
  - statement: Functions in aerobic lactate catabolism pathway linking lactate oxidation
      to acetate production
    supporting_text: LOX provides a route to feed lactate into central metabolism.
      Under aerobic conditions, LOX converts L-lactate to pyruvate which can then
      be converted via pyruvate oxidase or PDH complex into acetyl-CoA and ultimately
      acetate with ATP generation
  - statement: Enables energy production from lactate under aerobic conditions in
      fermentation environments
    supporting_text: This LOX-driven pathway effectively allows the cells to derive
      extra energy from lactate when oxygen is present. In heterofermentative lactobacilli,
      the conversion of lactate to acetate yields additional ATP and raises pH, stabilizing
      aerobic growth
  - statement: Physiological role in lactate scavenging with antimicrobial H2O2 production
    supporting_text: L. hilgardii often inhabits fermentations where lactate accumulates.
      By expressing LOX, the cells can scavenge lactate aerobically. The concomitant
      H₂O₂ production may also inhibit competing microbes

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: L-lactate oxidase activity
  proposed_definition: 'Catalysis of the reaction: (S)-lactate + O2 = pyruvate + H2O2.'
  justification: Current GO lacks a specific term for L-lactate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.2),
    despite this being a well-characterized enzyme class distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase
    (which uses NAD+) and general (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidases. Many other L-amino
    acid oxidases have specific GO terms (L-aspartate oxidase, L-glutamate oxidase,
    etc.), but L-lactate oxidase is missing. EC 1.1.3.2 represents a specific enzyme
    class with defined reaction mechanism expressed by multiple bacterial species,
    functionally distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase (GO:0140171) which uses different
    electron acceptor.
