  review:
    summary: 'Correct annotation. UniProt record confirms FMN cofactor requirement and binding sites are annotated (residues 92-94, 121, 143, 171, 240, 262, 295-299, 319). Deep mechanistic analysis confirms FMN undergoes oxidation/reduction cycles during catalysis, with electrons transferred from L-lactate substrate to FMN cofactor, followed by reaction with O2 to regenerate oxidized flavin. This annotation is essential and well-supported.'

  review:
    summary: 'Correct but overly general annotation. This enzyme is specifically an FMN-dependent oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.2) that catalyzes stereospecific oxidation of (S)-lactate to pyruvate with O2 as electron acceptor. Deep mechanistic analysis confirms it operates via α-hydroxyacid oxidation mechanism with strict specificity for (S)-lactate and large kinetic isotope effects for α-H abstraction. The more specific term (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase activity (GO:0003973) precisely captures this enzymatic function.'

  proposed_definition: 'Catalysis of the reaction: (S)-lactate + O2 = pyruvate + H2O2.'
  justification: 'Current GO lacks a specific term for L-lactate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.2), despite this being a well-characterized enzyme class distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase (which uses NAD+) and general (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidases. Many other L-amino acid oxidases have specific GO terms (L-aspartate oxidase, L-glutamate oxidase, etc.), but L-lactate oxidase is missing. EC 1.1.3.2 represents a specific enzyme class with defined reaction mechanism expressed by multiple bacterial species, functionally distinct from L-lactate dehydrogenase (GO:0140171) which uses different electron acceptor.'
