    103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372)
description: CelA (also known as Cel8A or Endoglucanase A) is a secreted endo-beta-1,4-glucanase
  (EC 3.2.1.4) belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 8 (GH8). It catalyzes the endohydrolysis
  of internal (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin, and cereal
  beta-D-glucans. The enzyme contains a GH8 catalytic domain with an open cleft/groove
  architecture characteristic of endo-acting glycosidases, plus a C-terminal type
  I dockerin domain (residues 411-477) that mediates incorporation into the cellulosome
  complex via cohesin-dockerin interactions with the primary scaffoldin CipA. CelA
  is one of the major catalytic components of the C. thermocellum cellulosome, consistently
  identified in proteomic surveys of purified cellulosomes grown on Avicel. The enzyme
  lacks its own carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and relies on the CBM of CipA for
  targeting to insoluble cellulose substrates. Structural studies at atomic resolution
  (0.94 A) have characterized the active site, identifying residues E95 (proton donor)
  and D152 (nucleophile) as key catalytic residues.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CelA is an endoglucanase that participates in cellulose degradation.
      While cellulose is a polysaccharide, the more specific term GO:0030245 (cellulose
      catabolic process) is already annotated and better represents the biological
      process. This broader term is acceptable but redundant given the more specific
      annotation. The deep research review confirms CelA's role in cellulose breakdown
      as part of the cellulosome complex [celA-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct but overly broad. CelA specifically degrades
      cellulose, which is a type of polysaccharide. The term is inferred from InterPro
      domain annotations (IPR002105 Dockerin, IPR016134 Dockerin domain, IPR036439
      Dockerin superfamily) which correctly associate the protein with polysaccharide
      degradation. Since GO:0030245 (cellulose catabolic process) is also annotated
      and is more specific, this broader term is somewhat redundant but not incorrect.
      For IEA annotations, broader parent terms are acceptable to retain alongside
      more specific ones.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CelA is a glycosyl hydrolase (GH8 family) that hydrolyzes O-glycosyl
      compounds, specifically (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages. This term is correct
      but a parent of the more specific GO:0008810 (cellulase activity) which is also
      annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct. CelA belongs to GH8 and catalyzes hydrolysis
      of beta-glucosidic bonds in cellulose. The annotation is inferred from ARBA
      rule ARBA00027782 and InterPro domains IPR002037 (Glyco_hydro_8) and IPR002105
      (Dockerin). While GO:0008810 (cellulase activity) is more specific, this parent
      term is acceptable for an IEA annotation and provides a useful grouping term.

  review:
    summary: CelA participates in carbohydrate metabolism through its role in cellulose
      degradation. This is a high-level parent term of more specific annotations already
      present.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct but very broad. It is inferred from InterPro
      records IPR002037 (Glyco_hydro_8), IPR008928 (6-hairpin_glycosidase_sf), and
      IPR012341 (6hp_glycosidase-like_sf). While the more specific GO:0030245 (cellulose
      catabolic process) better captures CelA's function, this broader term is not
      incorrect and acceptable for an IEA annotation derived from domain membership.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000003
  review:
    summary: CelA (Endoglucanase A) is definitively a cellulase with EC 3.2.1.4 activity.
      It catalyzes the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose,
      lichenin, and cereal beta-D-glucans. This is the core molecular function of
      the enzyme and the most specific appropriate MF term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation accurately represents the core molecular function of
      CelA. The enzyme is explicitly annotated as EC 3.2.1.4 (endoglucanase/cellulase)
      in UniProt, and the GO term definition matches exactly: "Catalysis of the endohydrolysis
      of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans."
      The annotation is derived from the EC number mapping (GO_REF:0000003). Proteomic
      studies identify CelA/Cel8A as a major catalytic component of the cellulosome
      with endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity [PMID:16127726, PMID:17644599]. Structural
      studies confirm the open cleft architecture characteristic of endo-acting glycosidases

  review:
    summary: CelA is a hydrolase that cleaves glycosidic bonds. This is a very broad
      parent term of the more specific cellulase activity already annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct but extremely broad. CelA is indeed a hydrolase
      (EC 3.2.1.4), but the term GO:0008810 (cellulase activity) provides much more
      informative functional information. This IEA annotation derived from UniProtKB
      keyword KW-0378 (Hydrolase) is acceptable but provides minimal functional insight
      beyond what is captured by more specific terms.

      O-glycosyl compounds) and GO:0008810 (cellulase activity).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct. CelA acts on glycosyl bonds (specifically
      beta-1,4 glucosidic bonds in cellulose). The annotation is inferred from UniProtKB
      keyword KW-0326 (Glycosidase). While more specific terms are available and already
      annotated, this intermediate-level term is acceptable for an IEA.

  review:
    summary: CelA is a cellulose-degrading endoglucanase that directly participates
      in cellulose catabolism as part of the cellulosome complex. This is the appropriate
      biological process term for this enzyme.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately represents CelA's biological role. The enzyme
      catalyzes the endohydrolysis of cellulose chains, producing new chain ends for
      exoglucanases and contributing directly to cellulose breakdown. The annotation
      is derived from UniProtKB keyword KW-0136 (Cellulose degradation). Proteomic
      analyses confirm CelA is a major component of the cellulosome, the multi-enzyme
      complex responsible for cellulose catabolism in C. thermocellum [PMID:16127726,

  review:
    summary: CelA contains a type I dockerin domain that mediates its incorporation
      into the cellulosome complex. The cellulosome (GO:0043263) is the appropriate
      cellular component annotation for this protein.
    action: NEW
    reason: 'CelA has a well-characterized dockerin domain (residues 411-477) that
      binds to type I cohesins on the CipA scaffoldin. Proteomic surveys consistently
      identify CelA as a component of purified cellulosomes. This cellular component
      annotation should be added, as the protein functions as part of the cellulosome
      complex. The InterPro domains IPR002105 (Dockerin_1_rpt), IPR016134 (Dockerin_dom),
