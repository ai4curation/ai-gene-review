## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** A3DJ77
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Endoglucanase C; EC=3.2.1.4; AltName: Full=Cellulase C; AltName: Full=Endo-1,4-beta-glucanase C; Short=EgC;
- **Gene Information:** Name=celC; OrderedLocusNames=Cthe_2807;
- **Organism (full):** Acetivibrio thermocellus (strain ATCC 27405 / DSM 1237 / JCM 9322 / NBRC 103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372) (Clostridium thermocellum).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 5 (cellulase A) family.
- **Key Domains:** Glyco_hydro_5. (IPR001547); Glyco_hydro_5_CS. (IPR018087); Glycoside_hydrolase_SF. (IPR017853); Glycosyl_hydrolase_5. (IPR050386); Cellulase (PF00150)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "celC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Acetivibrio thermocellus (strain ATCC 27405 / DSM 1237 / JCM 9322 / NBRC 103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372) (Clostridium thermocellum).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'celC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **celC** (gene ID: celC, UniProt: A3DJ77) in ACET2.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification summary
- Objective 1 (identity check): Completed. Multiple sources concur that celC (locus Cthe_2807) in Acetivibrio thermocellus (syn. Clostridium thermocellum) encodes Endoglucanase C (CelC), a non-cellulosomal endoglucanase in the glycoside hydrolase system; it resides in a celC–glyR3–licA gene cluster/operon and is repressed by a LacI-family regulator (GlyR3) that binds the celC promoter (organism, gene symbol, and function consistent with UniProt A3DJ77) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56, wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23).

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Target identity and nomenclature: celC (Cthe_2807; Endoglucanase C, CelC) encodes an endo-1,4-β-glucanase that acts on internal β-1,4 linkages of cellulose (EC 3.2.1.4). In C. thermocellum, celC is part of a non-cellulosomal cellulase locus and is co-transcribed with a local LacI-family regulator gene (glyR3) and licA, an enzyme implicated in β-glucan (lichenan) degradation (celC–glyR3–licA operon) (Newcomb 2008; Applied and Environmental Microbiology 2017) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56, wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23). URL and date examples: AEM Mar 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02751-16 (wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3).
- Cellulosome context: C. thermocellum secretes large extracellular multi-enzyme complexes (cellulosomes) assembled on the CipA scaffoldin via cohesin–dockerin interactions. Many catalytic subunits are dockerin-bearing and cellulosomal; however, some enzymes are non-cellulosomal and act as free extracellular proteins. Proteomic and genomic surveys describe >60 dockerin-containing ORFs, with a subset detected in purified cellulosomes; CelC is categorized as non-cellulosomal in transcriptional/regulatory studies rather than a dockerin-bearing component (Gold 2007; Proteomics/Journal of Bacteriology) (gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).
- GH5 catalytic mechanism: GH5 endoglucanases are typically retaining glycosidases that proceed via a double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl–enzyme intermediate; catalysis uses two acidic residues (usually glutamates) acting as nucleophile and general acid/base. CBMs, when present, are non-catalytic modules aiding substrate binding; dockerins, when present, mediate cellulosome attachment. These mechanistic/general principles are documented across GH5 members and clostridial systems (AMB Express Mar 2025 review of a GH5 enzyme; Advances in Applied Microbiology 2004) (jia2025his70ofacetivibrio pages 1-2, schwarz2004extracellularglycosylhydrolases pages 7-11). URL examples: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13568-025-01858-w (Mar 2025) (jia2025his70ofacetivibrio pages 1-2); https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2164(04)56007-0 (Jan 2004) (schwarz2004extracellularglycosylhydrolases pages 7-11).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024 sources)
- CelC-specific 2023–2024 literature could not be located in the retrieved evidence; regulatory and functional data for celC in C. thermocellum remain primarily from foundational and 2010s studies. Recent systems-level work shows LacI-family regulation and broad network effects, supporting continued relevance of celC regulation via GlyR3-like repressors (AEM 2017) (wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3). RNA-Seq and transcriptome time-course studies of ATCC 27405 during cellulose fermentation highlighted dynamic expression of cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal hydrolases and identified the celC–licA locus in the context of cellulose growth (BMC Microbiology 2011, Jun 2011, https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-11-134) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56). Where newer GH5-specific updates are concerned, mechanistic work on GH5 endoglucanases continues (e.g., GH5 processive endoglucanase domain-architecture/mechanism in 2025), but those are not CelC-specific (jia2025his70ofacetivibrio pages 1-2). Accordingly, 2023–2024 primary advances specific to CelC appear limited in our current evidence set.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Heterologous expression for thermophilic CBP chassis: CelC has been used in heterologous-expression attempts in Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12, alongside C. thermocellum CelK and CelS. Constructs employed native catalytic modules (± CBMs where present) fused to a Geobacillus signal peptide for secretion and driven by a strong promoter. In vivo Congo red and HPSEC assays in T12 detected activity for certain constructs; however, strains carrying C. thermocellum celC and celS constructs showed no detectable cellulase activity under the tested conditions. This illustrates practical challenges in porting C. thermocellum enzymes into alternative thermophilic hosts for consolidated bioprocessing (BMC Biotechnology, Jun 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-018-0453-y) (daas2018engineeringgeobacillusthermodenitrificans pages 8-10).
- System-level CBP insights: Quantitative proteomic and transcriptional studies in C. thermocellum show the cellulosome composition and expression of cellulases respond to substrate and growth phase. While not CelC-specific, these data provide operational context for applying non-cellulosomal enzymes like CelC in industrial settings and optimizing bioreactor conditions (Journal of Bacteriology Oct 2007, https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00882-07; PLoS ONE Apr 2009, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005271) (gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Operon architecture and regulation: Newcomb’s transcriptional analysis provides direct biochemical evidence that GlyR3 (LacI-family) binds the celC promoter and represses transcription; palindromic binding sites were mapped by DNase I footprinting and EMSA. Notably, the β-1,3 disaccharide laminaribiose acts as an inducer that inhibits GlyR3–DNA binding and de-represses celC. Northern blotting supports co-transcription of celC, glyR3, and licA into a ~6.3 kb transcript. These data establish celC as part of a non-cellulosomal regulon tuned to β-glucan signals, consistent with ecological deployment against mixed plant cell wall polysaccharides (Newcomb 2008) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23).
- LacI network breadth: Wilson et al. (AEM 2017) show deletion of LacI-family regulators including the GlyR3 homolog leads to strong upregulation of adjacent glycoside hydrolase genes and broader changes in cellulosome-related gene expression, indicating that celC expression is embedded in a larger regulome sensitive to carbohydrate cues. This framework is consistent with laminaribiose-mediated induction observed for celC (AEM Mar 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02751-16) (wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3).
- Cellulosomal architecture and non-cellulosomal roles: Proteomic surveys underscore that not all glycosyl hydrolases are cellulosomal and that free enzymes can complement cellulosomes extracellularly. CelC is explicitly cited as non-cellulosomal in regulatory studies, aligning with a model in which secreted free endoglucanases act synergistically with cellulosome-bound enzymes (Journal of Bacteriology Oct 2007, https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00882-07) (gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Operon transcript size and mapping: Northern blot and RT-PCR mapping show a ~6,261 bp polycistronic transcript covering celC–glyR3–licA; promoter mapping identified the celC transcription start site and a GlyR3 footprinted binding motif (Newcomb 2008) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56).
- Repressor binding and induction: EMSA and DNase I footprinting mapped a palindromic GlyR3 operator in the celC promoter; laminaribiose (0.5–10 mM in EMSA; 15 mM in promoter probe experiments) inhibited GlyR3–DNA binding, inducing celC in vitro (triplicate qRT-PCR) (Newcomb 2008) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85).
- Cellulosome composition breadth: Genomic/proteomic analyses report >60 predicted dockerin-bearing ORFs, with about one-third detected in purified complexes under given conditions, illustrating conditional inclusion and the prominence of non-cellulosomal enzymes in the extracellular hydrolytic repertoire (Journal of Bacteriology Oct 2007, https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00882-07) (gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).
- Heterologous expression outcome: In Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12, constructs encoding C. thermocellum celC (with secretion signals supplied by GtXynA SP) produced no detectable cellulase activity on plate and solution assays, highlighting engineering constraints for CelC deployment in alternative thermophiles (BMC Biotechnology Jun 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-018-0453-y) (daas2018engineeringgeobacillusthermodenitrificans pages 8-10).

Functional annotation for CelC (Cthe_2807; UniProt A3DJ77)
- Primary function and reaction: CelC is an endo-1,4-β-glucanase that cleaves internal β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose and related β-glucans (EC 3.2.1.4), a canonical GH5 activity. The GH5 retaining mechanism involves two catalytic carboxylates (typically glutamates) operating via double displacement; while this mechanistic detail is established for GH5 broadly, it has not been explicitly mapped to CelC in the evidence presented here (AMB Express 2025; Advances in Applied Microbiology 2004) (jia2025his70ofacetivibrio pages 1-2, schwarz2004extracellularglycosylhydrolases pages 7-11).
- Domain architecture and cellulosome association: Regulatory and operon studies explicitly classify CelC as non-cellulosomal; this implies absence of a dockerin module and action as a free enzyme rather than as a CipA-bound cellulosomal subunit. Whether CelC carries its own CBM has not been directly demonstrated in the sources retrieved here; some non-cellulosomal GH5 enzymes lack CBMs, while others possess them. Therefore, no definitive statement on a native CBM for CelC is made here based on the present evidence (Newcomb 2008; Journal of Bacteriology 2007) (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23, gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).
- Localization: Non-cellulosomal hydrolytic enzymes in C. thermocellum function extracellularly in the milieu of plant biomass. While a signal peptide for CelC is expected for secretion, the current evidence set does not directly report a signal peptide prediction or experimental secretion/localization data; localization is thus inferred from the non-cellulosomal designation and the extracellular nature of the cellulolytic system (Journal of Bacteriology Oct 2007, https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00882-07) (gold2007proteomicanalysisof pages 26-31).
- Operon context and regulation: celC is co-transcribed with glyR3 and licA; GlyR3 binds the celC promoter and represses transcription. Laminaribiose acts as an inducer, reducing GlyR3–DNA binding and thereby de-repressing celC. In DSM1313, deleting the GlyR3 homolog de-represses adjacent genes in the operon, consistent with regulatory control over CelC (AEM Mar 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02751-16; Newcomb 2008) (wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56).
- Substrate specificity and kinetics: Specific kinetic constants (e.g., kcat, Km on carboxymethylcellulose or lichenan) for purified C. thermocellum CelC were not identified in the retrieved evidence. Given the operon context with licA and laminaribiose-mediated induction, action on β-glucans such as lichenan and mixed-linkage β-glucans is plausible; however, we refrain from asserting substrate preferences or kinetic values for CelC without direct primary data (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23).

Evidence limitations and notes on 2023–2024 coverage
- Our tool-based retrieval did not return CelC-specific 2023–2024 primary articles. Recent literature relevant to GH5 endoglucanases and clostridial cellulases is ongoing, but CelC-focused updates appear limited in this window within the present evidence set. Foundational regulatory and operon studies (2008–2017) remain the authoritative sources for CelC’s non-cellulosomal status and regulation (newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 76-85, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationofa pages 47-56, wilson2017lacitranscriptionalregulatory pages 1-3, newcomb2008transcriptionregulationof pages 19-23). Where mechanistic GH5 details are generalized from other GH5 enzymes, we have explicitly indicated inference and provided the most relevant available sources (jia2025his70ofacetivibrio pages 1-2, schwarz2004extracellularglycosylhydrolases pages 7-11).
