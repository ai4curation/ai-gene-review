description: >-
  CelC (Endoglucanase C) is a glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) enzyme that catalyzes
  the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin, and
  cereal beta-D-glucans (EC 3.2.1.4). CelC is a non-cellulosomal enzyme, lacking a
  dockerin domain and therefore does not integrate into the cellulosome complex. The
  343 amino acid enzyme contains conserved active site residues typical of GH5 family
  members, with Gln-140 acting as proton donor and Glu-280 as nucleophile. The celC
  gene is part of a celC-glyR3-licA operon, with transcription regulated by the
  LacI-family repressor GlyR3, and induced by laminaribiose.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a parent-level biological process term that correctly captures the
      catabolic activity of CelC. As an endoglucanase that breaks down cellulose
      (a polysaccharide), CelC is involved in polysaccharide catabolism. However,
      more specific child terms (GO:0030245 cellulose catabolic process) are also
      annotated and are more informative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is accurate as cellulose is a polysaccharide and CelC participates
      in its degradation. This parent term complements the more specific cellulose
      catabolic process annotation. IEA evidence from InterPro domain and UniProtKB
      keyword mappings is appropriate for this general term.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This molecular function term is a parent term of cellulase activity (GO:0008810).
      It accurately describes the general catalytic mechanism of CelC, which hydrolyzes
      O-glycosyl bonds in cellulose.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      As a GH5 family endoglucanase, CelC hydrolyzes O-glycosyl compounds (specifically
      beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds). The InterPro-based IEA annotation is accurate.
      This parent term is retained alongside the more specific cellulase activity term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CelC is classified as a non-cellulosomal enzyme that functions extracellularly.
      Deep research confirms CelC acts as a free extracellular enzyme rather than
      as part of the cellulosome complex [file:ACET2/celC/celC-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Deep research supports extracellular localization. Non-cellulosomal hydrolytic
      enzymes in C. thermocellum function extracellularly in the milieu of plant
      biomass. While a signal peptide for CelC is expected for secretion, regulatory
      and operon studies explicitly classify CelC as non-cellulosomal, implying
      extracellular action as a free enzyme [file:ACET2/celC/celC-deep-research-falcon.md].

    label: carbohydrate metabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a high-level biological process term that accurately but very broadly
      describes CelC function. The enzyme participates in carbohydrate metabolism
      through cellulose degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While very general, this annotation is not incorrect. CelC is involved in
      carbohydrate metabolism via its cellulolytic activity. More specific child
      terms (cellulose catabolic process) provide better functional resolution.
      IEA from InterPro is reasonable for this broad term.

    label: beta-glucosidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      Beta-glucosidase activity (GO:0008422) is defined as catalysis of hydrolysis
      of terminal, non-reducing beta-D-glucose residues with release of beta-D-glucose.
      This is mechanistically distinct from cellulase/endoglucanase activity, which
      cleaves internal beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds. CelC is an ENDOglucanase, not
      an EXO-acting beta-glucosidase.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. CelC (EC 3.2.1.4) is an endoglucanase that cleaves
      internal beta-1,4-glucosidic linkages in cellulose chains. Beta-glucosidase
      (EC 3.2.1.21) is a distinct enzyme class that removes terminal glucose residues.
      The TreeGrafter prediction appears to be based on broad sequence similarity
      within glycoside hydrolases but does not accurately reflect the specific
      enzymatic mechanism of CelC. UniProt clearly annotates CelC with EC 3.2.1.4
      (cellulase), not EC 3.2.1.21 (beta-glucosidase).

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000003
  review:
    summary: >-
      Cellulase activity (GO:0008810) is defined as catalysis of the endohydrolysis
      of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans.
      This precisely matches the function of CelC as described in UniProt and confirmed
      by deep research [file:ACET2/celC/celC-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core molecular function annotation for CelC and is correctly
      assigned based on EC number mapping (EC:3.2.1.4). UniProt explicitly states
      that CelC catalyzes endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glucosidic linkages in cellulose,
      lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans. The GH5 family classification and conserved
      active site residues (Gln-140 proton donor, Glu-280 nucleophile) support
      this annotation.

    label: glucan catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      Glucan catabolic process is a biological process term that describes the
      breakdown of glucans. Cellulose is a beta-1,4-glucan, so CelC participates
      in glucan catabolism through its cellulolytic activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is accurate. CelC breaks down cellulose, which is a glucan
      (polymer of glucose). The TreeGrafter annotation correctly infers this
      biological process from sequence homology to characterized cellulases.

    label: cell surface
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      Cell surface localization is characteristic of cellulosomal enzymes that
      attach via dockerin-cohesin interactions. However, CelC (A3DJ77) is explicitly
      classified as non-cellulosomal and lacks a dockerin domain, meaning it cannot
      attach to the CipA scaffoldin on the cell surface [file:ACET2/celC/celC-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is incorrect for CelC. Deep research explicitly states that
      CelC is categorized as non-cellulosomal and acts as a free enzyme rather
      than a CipA-bound cellulosomal subunit. Regulatory and operon studies explicitly
      classify CelC as non-cellulosomal, implying absence of a dockerin module.
      Without a dockerin, CelC cannot bind to the CipA scaffoldin and would not
      be retained at the cell surface. CelC functions as a free extracellular
      enzyme, not a cell-surface-attached one.

    label: hydrolase activity

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      Hydrolase activity is a very broad molecular function term that encompasses
      all enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis reactions. CelC is a hydrolase that
      cleaves glycosidic bonds.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is correct but very general. CelC is indeed a hydrolase
      (it catalyzes hydrolysis of beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds). The annotation
      derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping. More specific child terms provide
      better functional characterization.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This molecular function term specifies that CelC acts on glycosyl bonds,
      which is accurate. It is a parent term of cellulase activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      CelC hydrolyzes glycosidic (glycosyl) bonds, specifically beta-1,4-glucosidic
      linkages. This annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping correctly places
      CelC within the glycoside hydrolase functional category.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      Cellulose catabolic process is the most specific and appropriate biological
      process term for CelC. It directly describes the enzyme's participation
      in cellulose degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core biological process annotation for CelC. As an endoglucanase
      that cleaves internal bonds in cellulose chains, CelC directly participates
      in cellulose catabolism. UniProt explicitly annotates CelC for the cellulose
      degradation pathway (UniPathway:UPA00696). This annotation is supported by
      both the EC number mapping and the UniProt pathway annotation.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the specific substrate preference of CelC - does it have higher
      activity on cellulose, lichenan, or mixed-linkage beta-glucans?
  - question: >-
      Are there kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) available for purified CelC on
      carboxymethylcellulose or other defined substrates?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Express recombinant A3DJ77 CelC and assay for endoglucanase activity
      using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or other cellulosic substrates.
      Demonstration of endoglucanase activity would confirm the GO:0008810
      annotation with experimental evidence.
  - description: >-
      Test A3DJ77 CelC for beta-glucosidase activity using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside
      as substrate. Lack of activity would support removal of the GO:0008422 annotation
      and confirm that CelC is strictly an endoglucanase.
  - description: >-
      Perform substrate specificity profiling to determine whether CelC has
      preference for cellulose versus lichenan or other beta-glucans, given the
      operon context with licA and laminaribiose-mediated induction.
