description: >-
  LicB (also known as Lam1) is a thermostable beta-glucanase (lichenase, EC 3.2.1.73)
  from Acetivibrio thermocellus (formerly Clostridium thermocellum). It is a GH16
  family glycoside hydrolase that catalyzes the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic
  linkages in mixed-linkage beta-D-glucans containing both (1->3) and (1->4) bonds,
  such as lichenan and barley beta-glucan. The enzyme contains a C-terminal type-I
  dockerin domain that enables its incorporation into the cellulosome, the large
  extracellular enzyme complex characteristic of this bacterium that efficiently
  degrades plant cell wall polysaccharides.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro domain matches (IPR002105,
      IPR016134, IPR036439 - dockerin domains). While LicB does participate in
      polysaccharide catabolism, this term is too general. The enzyme specifically
      degrades mixed-linkage beta-glucans. A more specific term like
      'beta-glucan catabolic process' (GO:0051275) would be more accurate.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term 'polysaccharide catabolic process' is overly broad. LicB is a
      lichenase that specifically hydrolyzes beta-glucans containing (1->3) and
      (1->4) linkages. UniProt confirms the catalytic activity with EC 3.2.1.73.
      A more specific biological process term should be used.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct but represents a high-level parent term. LicB does
      indeed have O-glycosyl hydrolase activity, but the specific term 'licheninase
      activity' (GO:0042972) already captures this more precisely. This annotation
      can be retained as it is not incorrect, but it provides less information than
      the more specific term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a general parent term, it is not incorrect for LicB. The enzyme
      hydrolyzes O-glycosyl bonds in beta-glucans. Since the more specific
      'licheninase activity' (GO:0042972) is also annotated, this broader term
      provides hierarchical context and is acceptable to retain.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a very high-level biological process term. While technically correct
      (lichenase participates in carbohydrate metabolism), this term is too general
      to be informative. It should be replaced with a more specific term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      'Carbohydrate metabolic process' is the grandparent term for nearly all
      sugar-related processes. For a specific enzyme like lichenase, a more
      informative term such as 'beta-glucan catabolic process' (GO:0051275)
      should be used to accurately reflect the enzyme's biological role.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0378 Hydrolase).
      While LicB is indeed a hydrolase, this is the root molecular function term for
      all hydrolases and is too general to be informative when more specific terms
      are available.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The term 'hydrolase activity' is the most general hydrolase term in GO.
      Since LicB already has the specific annotation 'licheninase activity'
      (GO:0042972), retaining this very general term adds no informational value
      and clutters the annotation set.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation comes from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0326 Glycosidase).
      It is a parent term of 'hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds'
      (GO:0004553). While correct, it is redundant given the presence of more
      specific glycosidase terms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This term correctly captures the glycosidase activity of LicB. Although it
      is a mid-level term in the hierarchy (parent of GO:0004553), it is informative
      enough to retain alongside the specific 'licheninase activity' term. It
      provides appropriate hierarchical context.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the most specific and accurate molecular function annotation for LicB.
      Licheninase activity (EC 3.2.1.73) catalyzes the hydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-
      glucosidic linkages in beta-D-glucans containing (1->3) and (1->4) bonds. This
      precisely matches the documented function of LicB.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is derived from EC number mapping (EC:3.2.1.73) and accurately
      represents the core molecular function of LicB. UniProt explicitly assigns
      EC 3.2.1.73 to this enzyme, and the catalytic activity described matches
      the GO term definition exactly. This is the primary functional annotation
      for this enzyme.

  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: UniProtKB:Q84C00
  review:
    summary: >-
      LicB contains a type-I dockerin domain (residues 267-334) that mediates
      binding to type-I cohesin domains on the CipA scaffoldin protein of the
      cellulosome. This domain architecture is characteristic of cellulosomal
      enzymes in A. thermocellus.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The UniProt entry clearly documents a dockerin domain (PROSITE pattern
      PS51766). The dockerin domain binds to cohesin domains on the scaffoldin
      protein, enabling incorporation of the enzyme into the cellulosome. This
      is a core function of the protein enabling its biological role in
      extracellular polysaccharide degradation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      LicB is a component of the cellulosome based on its dockerin domain, which
      mediates attachment to the scaffoldin. The cellulosome is the characteristic
      extracellular enzyme complex of A. thermocellus.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The presence of a type-I dockerin domain (IPR002105, PS51766) strongly
      indicates that LicB is a cellulosomal enzyme. The dockerin domain is the
      hallmark of cellulosomal enzymes in Clostridia, enabling their incorporation
      into the multi-enzyme complex via binding to cohesin domains on the scaffoldin.
