description: CelS is a major exocellulase (cellobiohydrolase) belonging to the glycoside
  hydrolase family 48 (GH48). It is one of the most abundant catalytic subunits of
  the C. thermocellum cellulosome. The enzyme catalyzes processive hydrolysis of cellulose
  from the reducing end, releasing cellobiose as the primary product (EC 3.2.1.176).
  CelS contains a C-terminal type I dockerin domain that mediates calcium-dependent
  attachment to the CipA scaffoldin protein through cohesin-dockerin interactions.
  The enzyme shows preference for crystalline and amorphous cellulose over soluble
  substrates like carboxymethyl cellulose, and works synergistically with endoglucanases
  in cellulose degradation.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CelS is involved in polysaccharide catabolism, specifically cellulose
      degradation. However, this term is too general for this enzyme. The more specific
      term GO:0030245 (cellulose catabolic process) is already annotated and better
      captures the function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While technically correct that CelS participates in polysaccharide catabolism,
      this annotation is redundant with the more specific GO:0030245 (cellulose catabolic
      process) that is already present. The enzyme specifically degrades cellulose,
      not polysaccharides in general.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This term accurately describes the general class of activity for CelS.
      As a GH48 glycoside hydrolase, CelS hydrolyzes O-glycosyl bonds. However, more
      specific terms are available and already annotated (GO:0102252).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a correct parent term for the enzyme's activity. While GO:0102252
      (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase activity, reducing end) is the most specific
      term, retaining this broader annotation from IEA is acceptable as it is not
      incorrect. The GH48 family membership (IPR000556) supports this annotation.

  review:
    summary: CelS is a secreted protein that functions extracellularly as part of
      the cellulosome complex. The protein has a signal peptide (residues 1-27) and
      is secreted.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While "extracellular region" is not wrong, a more specific and informative
      cellular component annotation would be GO:0043263 (cellulosome). CelS is a major
      component of the C. thermocellum cellulosome, attaching via its dockerin domain
      to the CipA scaffoldin. UniProt indicates "Secreted" subcellular location, and
      the presence of a type I dockerin domain (residues 673-739) indicates cellulosome
      localization.

  review:
    summary: CelS is involved in carbohydrate metabolism through its role in cellulose
      degradation. This is a very general term.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This term is too general. More specific biological process terms are already
      annotated (GO:0030245, cellulose catabolic process). The annotation from InterPro
      superfamily domains (IPR008928, IPR012341) provides only general functional
      inference. Retaining this alongside the more specific cellulose catabolic process
      term is redundant.

    label: cellulase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: CelS has cellulase activity as a member of the GH48 family. However,
      the more specific term GO:0102252 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase activity,
      reducing end) better captures its precise enzymatic function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a valid parent term for CelS activity. The enzyme is classified
      as a cellulase, specifically a cellobiohydrolase. The annotation from InterPro
      (IPR000556, Glycoside hydrolase family 48) is appropriate. While GO:0102252
      provides more specificity about the reducing-end preference, cellulase activity
      is not incorrect and represents a legitimate intermediate term in the hierarchy.

    summary: CelS is a hydrolase enzyme. This is the most general molecular function
      term for the enzyme's activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a correct but very general ancestor term. As a glycoside hydrolase,
      CelS does have hydrolase activity. This annotation derived from UniProt keyword
      mapping (KW-0378, Hydrolase) is technically accurate, though quite broad. It
      is acceptable as an IEA annotation that will be subsumed by more specific terms.

      for IEA evidence. CelS acts on beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose. The annotation

      in the C. thermocellum cellulosome. This is the core biological process for
      this enzyme.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the appropriate biological process term for CelS. The enzyme catalyzes
      hydrolysis of cellulose, releasing cellobiose. UniProt annotation explicitly
      states the enzyme "catalyzes the exohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glucosidic linkages
      in cellulose" (PMID:7883725). The annotation is supported by both InterPro domain
      (IPR000556) and UniProt keyword (KW-0136, Cellulose degradation).

      interaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While metal ion binding is correct, the more specific term GO:0005509
      (calcium ion binding) would be more accurate. UniProt annotation shows multiple
      Ca2+ binding residues in the dockerin domain (positions 679, 681, 683-685, 690,
      711-722). The calcium binding is specifically required for the dockerin domain

  review:
    summary: This is the most specific and accurate molecular function term for CelS.
      The enzyme is classified as EC 3.2.1.176, which corresponds exactly to this
      GO term. CelS processively cleaves cellobiose from the reducing ends of cellulose
      chains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function annotation for CelS and should be
      retained. UniProt records EC 3.2.1.176 for this enzyme based on experimental
      evidence (PMID:7883725). The catalytic activity annotation states "Hydrolysis
      of (1->4)-beta-D- glucosidic linkages in cellulose and similar substrates, releasing
      cellobiose from the reducing ends of the chains." This distinguishes CelS from
      non-reducing end cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91, GO:0016162).
