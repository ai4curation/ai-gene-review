description: >-
  CipB (Cellulosomal-scaffolding protein B) is a secondary scaffoldin protein in the
  Acetivibrio thermocellum cellulosome complex. Unlike the primary scaffoldin CipA,
  CipB is NOT catalytically active and does not possess hydrolase activity. It functions
  as a structural/organizing protein containing three cohesin domains that bind dockerin
  domains of catalytic enzymes, one CBM3 (carbohydrate-binding module family 3) domain
  that binds cellulose, and a C-terminal type II dockerin domain that binds to type II
  cohesins on anchoring scaffoldins for cell-surface attachment. CipB contributes to
  higher-order cellulosome assembly and organization, connecting catalytic components
  to the cell surface anchoring network. It is secreted and functions extracellularly
  as part of the cell-attached polycellulosome complex.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CipB is a non-catalytic scaffoldin protein that does not directly participate in
      polysaccharide catabolism. While the cellulosome complex as a whole degrades
      polysaccharides, CipB itself lacks any catalytic domains and functions purely
      as a structural organizing protein. The annotation appears to be inferred from
      the presence of cohesin and dockerin domains, which are associated with the
      cellulosome but do not confer catalytic activity. According to the deep research,
      CipB has "a large secreted scaffold-like component that contributes to higher-order
      assembly via its type II dockerin rather than functioning as a catalytic enzyme"
      (Bras 2012).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CipB does not directly catalyze polysaccharide breakdown. It is a non-catalytic
      scaffoldin that organizes catalytic enzymes within the cellulosome complex. The
      annotation incorrectly attributes a catalytic process to a purely structural protein.
      UniProt explicitly states CipB "Acts as a scaffolding protein in the cellulosome"
      with no mention of catalytic activity.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. CipB does NOT have hydrolase activity. The annotation
      was propagated via InterPro from the dockerin domain (IPR002105), but dockerin
      domains are protein-protein interaction modules, not catalytic domains. CipB is
      explicitly described in UniProt as a scaffolding protein that "promotes binding
      of cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes" - meaning it
      organizes enzymes that have hydrolase activity, but CipB itself lacks catalytic
      function. The deep research confirms CipB "is a large secreted scaffold-like
      component that contributes to higher-order assembly via its type II dockerin
      rather than functioning as a catalytic enzyme" (Bras 2012).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CipB is a non-catalytic scaffoldin protein. The IEA annotation from InterPro
      IPR002105 (Dockerin_1_rpt) incorrectly associates dockerin domains with hydrolase
      activity. Dockerin domains are protein-protein interaction modules that bind
      cohesin domains, enabling assembly of the cellulosome complex. CipB contains
      no glycosyl hydrolase catalytic domains. This is a clear case of over-annotation
      from automated pipelines that conflate domain presence with catalytic function.

      This annotation is correct. CipB is secreted and functions extracellularly.
      UniProt subcellular location explicitly states "Secreted. Note=Remains at cell
      surface." The protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide consistent with
      secretion (Bras 2012). CipB becomes part of cell-attached polycellulosomes by
      binding cell-surface anchoring scaffoldins via its type II dockerin.

    label: carbohydrate metabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is an overly broad annotation. While CipB is a component of the cellulosome
      which functions in carbohydrate metabolism, CipB itself does not directly participate
      in metabolic reactions. It is a structural scaffoldin that organizes catalytic
      enzymes. The annotation is derived from InterPro domains IPR001956 (CBM3) and
      IPR036966 (CBM3_sf). The CBM3 domain enables cellulose binding, not metabolic
      activity. A more appropriate BP annotation would be cellulosome assembly
      (GO:0044575).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The annotation is too broad and implies direct metabolic activity. CipB's role
      is structural/organizational - it assembles and organizes catalytic enzymes that
      perform carbohydrate metabolism. The protein's function is better captured by
      cellulosome assembly.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Similar to the polysaccharide catabolic process annotation, this incorrectly
      attributes a catalytic process to a non-catalytic scaffoldin protein. CipB does
      not directly catabolize cellulose - it organizes the catalytic enzymes that do.
      The annotation was derived from UniProt keyword KW-0136 (Cellulose degradation),
      which may have been applied broadly to cellulosome components without distinguishing
      catalytic from structural subunits.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CipB does not catalyze cellulose breakdown. It is a scaffoldin protein that
      organizes cellulolytic enzymes within the cellulosome. The "involved_in"
      relationship to a catabolic process is inappropriate for a non-catalytic
      structural protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is broadly correct but could be more specific. CipB contains a
      CBM3 (carbohydrate-binding module family 3) domain that specifically binds
      cellulose. The more specific term GO:0030248 (cellulose binding) is already
      annotated and is more informative. This general carbohydrate binding annotation
      adds little value given the more specific annotation exists.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While technically correct due to the CBM3 domain, this is redundant with the
      more specific cellulose binding annotation (GO:0030248). The CBM3 domain
      specifically binds cellulose, not carbohydrates in general. Keeping as non-core
      since it is not incorrect but is less informative than the specific term.

      This annotation is correct. CipB contains a well-characterized CBM3
      (carbohydrate-binding module family 3) domain at positions 277-435 that
      specifically binds cellulose. This domain enables CipB to anchor the
      cellulosome complex to its cellulose substrate. UniProt explicitly annotates
      this CBM3 domain, and the deep research confirms "InterPro/CBM3-superfamily
      annotations are consistent with scaffoldin-related architecture" (Bras 2012).

    label: cell wall organization

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is problematic. CipB functions in cellulose degradation of
      PLANT cell walls (the substrate), not in organization of the bacterium's own
      cell wall. The annotation was derived from UniProt keyword KW-0961 (Cell wall
      biogenesis/degradation), but this keyword conflates degradation of external
      substrates with biogenesis of the organism's own cell wall. CipB is not involved
      in A. thermocellus cell wall organization - it is part of an extracellular
      complex that degrades plant biomass.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CipB is a cellulosome component that degrades external plant cell wall material,
      not a protein involved in organizing the bacterium's own cell wall. This
      annotation confuses substrate degradation with self-organization. The GO term
      "cell wall organization" refers to organization of the organism's own cell wall,
      not degradation of external cell wall substrates.

      CipB plays a direct role in cellulosome assembly through its cohesin-dockerin
      interactions. Its three cohesin domains bind dockerin domains of catalytic enzymes,
      and its C-terminal type II dockerin binds type II cohesins on anchoring scaffoldins.
      The deep research states CipB "contributes to higher-order assembly via its type II
      dockerin" (Bras 2012). The term definition "The assembly of a cellulosome, a
      macromolecular multi-enzyme complex in bacteria that facilitates the breakdown of
