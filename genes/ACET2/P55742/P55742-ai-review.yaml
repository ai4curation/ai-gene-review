description: CelM is a putative aminopeptidase belonging to the M42 peptidase family,
  originally misannotated as an endoglucanase (hence the "cel" nomenclature). Despite
  its misleading name, CelM has been experimentally characterized as a metalloaminopeptidase
  with leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activity, requiring cobalt ions (Co2+) as a cofactor.
  The protein forms an active dodecameric complex and preferentially cleaves nonpolar
  aliphatic L-amino acid residues from the N-terminus of peptide substrates, with
  L-leucine-pNA being the optimal substrate. CelM shows no significant cellulase
  activity despite earlier erroneous reports. The protein does not contain a dockerin
  domain and is therefore not a component of the cellulosome complex. Its biological
  role may involve protein turnover or peptide processing in the cytoplasm of A.

- term:
    id: GO:0004177
    label: aminopeptidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct and supported by experimental evidence from
      Dutoit et al. (2012) PMID:23226342, who demonstrated that CelM has leucine
      aminopeptidase (LAP) activity using L-leucine-pNA as substrate. The protein
      preferentially hydrolyzes nonpolar aliphatic L-amino acid-pNA substrates at
      the N-terminus.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CelM has been experimentally demonstrated to function as an aminopeptidase.
      Although the annotation is derived from keyword mapping (IEA), it accurately
      reflects the experimentally determined function of the protein. This is a core
      molecular function of the enzyme.

    label: proteolysis
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct as CelM participates in proteolytic degradation
      through its aminopeptidase activity. The protein hydrolyzes peptide bonds at
      the N-terminus of peptides.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Aminopeptidases are proteolytic enzymes that participate in proteolysis
      by cleaving N-terminal amino acid residues from peptides. This is the appropriate
      biological process term for the enzymatic activity of CelM.

    label: peptidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct but represents a parent term of the more
      specific aminopeptidase activity annotation. CelM is a peptidase of the M42
      metallopeptidase family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a valid annotation as CelM is indeed a peptidase. However, the
      more specific term GO:0004177 (aminopeptidase activity) or GO:0070006 (metalloaminopeptidase
      activity) is more informative. This general term is acceptable as an IEA annotation
      alongside the more specific annotations.

    label: metallopeptidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct. CelM is an M42 family metallopeptidase that
      requires divalent metal cations (specifically Co2+ for optimal activity) for
      catalysis. The metal ions are essential for the enzymatic mechanism.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CelM is a metallopeptidase that requires metal ions for activity. EDTA
      chelation inhibits activity, confirming the metal-dependence of the enzyme.
      The annotation correctly reflects the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.

    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct but very general. CelM is a hydrolase that
      catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. This is a parent term of the more
      specific peptidase and aminopeptidase activity terms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While correct, this is the most general term in the hierarchy. The more
      specific annotations (aminopeptidase activity, metallopeptidase activity) are
      more informative. This annotation is acceptable as part of the IEA annotation
      set derived from keyword mapping, but provides limited functional insight beyond
      the more specific terms.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct. CelM binds divalent metal cations which
      are essential for its catalytic activity. UniProt reports binding of 2 divalent
      metal cations per subunit at defined binding sites.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CelM requires divalent metal cations for activity. UniProt documents
      metal binding sites at residues 65, 168, 199, 221, and 307. While cobalt provides
      optimal activity in vitro, the in vivo metal cofactor may differ. The general
      metal ion binding term is appropriate given this uncertainty.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:23226342
  review:
    summary: This is the most appropriate and specific molecular function term for
      CelM. The protein is an M42 family metalloaminopeptidase that cleaves N-terminal
      amino acids using a metal-dependent catalytic mechanism.
    action: NEW
    reason: This term should be added as a new annotation based on the experimental
      characterization by Dutoit et al. (2012). CelM is a metalloaminopeptidase that
      requires metal ions for catalysis and cleaves N-terminal amino acids from peptide
      substrates. This is more specific than both aminopeptidase activity and metallopeptidase
      activity.
