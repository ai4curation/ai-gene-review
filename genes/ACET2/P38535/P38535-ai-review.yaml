description: >
  XynX is a cell surface-anchored xylanase from Acetivibrio thermocellus (formerly Clostridium thermocellum).
  Despite its UniProt annotation as "Exoglucanase XynX" with EC 3.2.1.91 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase),
  experimental evidence demonstrates that XynX is primarily a GH10 family endo-1,4-beta-xylanase that
  hydrolyzes xylan, not cellulose. The enzyme has a modular architecture consisting of a signal peptide,
  a thermostabilizing domain (TSD) that functions as a xylan-binding domain (CBM22), a GH10 catalytic
  domain, two CBM9 carbohydrate-binding modules, and three C-terminal SLH (S-layer homology) domains.
  Unlike cellulosomal enzymes which contain dockerin domains, XynX is anchored directly to the bacterial
  cell surface via its SLH domains. The enzyme displays xylanase activity with substrate preference for
  insoluble xylan and shows binding to xylan and lichenan but minimal activity toward cellulose substrates.
  XynX operates at thermophilic conditions with optimal activity at 65-70 degrees Celsius, consistent with
  the thermophilic nature of A. thermocellus. NOTE: The UniProt annotation for XynX as "Exoglucanase" with
  EC 3.2.1.91 appears to be historically incorrect. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates this is a
  GH10 family xylanase. The presence of SLH domains rather than dockerin distinguishes XynX as a
  non-cellulosomal, cell-surface-anchored enzyme. A UniProt entry update to correct the EC number to
  3.2.1.8 (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase) would be beneficial.

    summary: >
      XynX is involved in polysaccharide catabolism, specifically the degradation of xylan, which is
      a hemicellulosic polysaccharide. This annotation is appropriate but overly broad for the enzyme's
      specific function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While XynX does participate in polysaccharide catabolism, this term is too general. The enzyme
      specifically catalyzes xylan degradation, not general polysaccharide catabolism. A more specific
      biological process term would be xylan catabolic process (GO:0045493), which accurately reflects
      XynX's role as a xylanase that hydrolyzes beta-1,4-xylosidic linkages in xylan. The deep research
      review confirms XynX is a GH10 endo-beta-1,4-xylanase.

      This is a valid parent term for xylanase activity. The GH10 catalytic domain of XynX hydrolyzes
      O-glycosyl bonds (specifically beta-1,4-xylosidic linkages). While more specific terms exist,
      this IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping (GH10, CBM9, CBM22) is technically correct
      as a general classification. It appropriately captures the broad enzymatic mechanism.

    reason: >
      While technically correct (xylan is a carbohydrate and XynX contributes to its metabolism),
      this term is extremely broad and provides little specific information about XynX's function.
      More informative terms like xylan catabolic process (GO:0045493) better describe the enzyme's
      role. This annotation is retained as a non-core function since it represents an IEA from
      InterPro domain mapping that accurately but non-specifically captures XynX's involvement in
      carbohydrate processing.

      This term correctly indicates that XynX is involved in breaking down carbohydrates. However,

      involvement in carbohydrate degradation. The more specific term xylan catabolic process
      (GO:0045493) would better capture the enzyme's function, but this annotation remains valid
      as a parent term.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation derives from the EC number 3.2.1.91 assigned to XynX in UniProt. However,
      experimental evidence indicates XynX is primarily a xylanase, not a cellobiosidase. This
      annotation appears to be erroneous.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      Despite UniProt's assignment of EC 3.2.1.91 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase), experimental
      characterization of XynX demonstrates it is a GH10 family xylanase, not a cellobiosidase.
      The deep research review confirms XynX exhibits negligible cellulase activity while being
      highly active on xylan. The enzyme's GH10 catalytic domain is characteristic of
      endo-1,4-beta-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8), not cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91, typically GH6 or GH48).
      The misleading UniProt name "Exoglucanase XynX" likely reflects an early mischaracterization.

      This annotation is incorrect. XynX is a xylanase, not a cellulase. Experimental characterization
      demonstrated that XynX shows minimal activity toward cellulose substrates, while being highly
      active on xylan. The UniProtKB keyword "Cellulose degradation" (KW-0136) that generated this

      The correct biological process annotation should be xylan catabolic process (GO:0045493).

      to bind xylan and lichenan. A more informative annotation would be xylan binding (GO:2001062),
      which accurately reflects the substrate specificity of XynX's binding modules.
