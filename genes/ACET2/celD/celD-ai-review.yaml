    103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372)
description: Endoglucanase D (CelD) is a glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) enzyme
  that catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose,
  lichenin, and cereal beta-D-glucans (EC 3.2.1.4). The enzyme is a component of the
  Acetivibrio thermocellus cellulosome, a large extracellular multi-enzyme complex
  that efficiently degrades crystalline cellulose. CelD contains a C-terminal type
  I dockerin domain (residues 579-649) that mediates binding to type I cohesin domains
  on the scaffoldin protein CipA, enabling incorporation into the cellulosome. The
  enzyme requires Ca2+ as a cofactor. The dockerin domain contains two EF-hand calcium-binding
  motifs that are essential for the calcium-dependent cohesin-dockerin interaction.
  CelD is secreted via a signal peptide (residues 1-41) and functions extracellularly
  as part of the cellulosome complex anchored to the bacterial cell surface.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is derived from InterPro domain mappings (IPR002105 Dockerin,
      IPR016134 Dockerin domain, IPR036439 Dockerin domain superfamily). While CelD
      does participate in polysaccharide catabolism, this term is overly broad for
      an enzyme with well-characterized cellulose-specific activity. The more specific
      term GO:0030245 'cellulose catabolic process' is already annotated and better
      captures the function. Deep research confirms CelD is specifically an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase
      (EC 3.2.1.4) that cleaves internal beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages in cellulose
      (celD-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The term GO:0000272 'polysaccharide catabolic process' is a parent term
      of GO:0030245 'cellulose catabolic process'. Since CelD is specifically an endoglucanase
      (EC 3.2.1.4) that acts on cellulose, lichenin, and cereal beta-D-glucans as
      stated in UniProt, the more specific cellulose catabolic process term is more
      appropriate. This IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping is not incorrect
      but represents an over-annotation when the more specific term is available.

    summary: This annotation is derived from ARBA rule ARBA00027782 and InterPro domains
      IPR001701 (Glyco_hydro_9) and IPR002105 (Dockerin). While technically correct
      as CelD does hydrolyze O-glycosyl compounds, this is an overly general term.
      The more specific GO:0008810 'cellulase activity' is already annotated and better
      represents the molecular function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: GO:0004553 'hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds' is a
      parent term of GO:0008810 'cellulase activity'. CelD is specifically classified
      as EC 3.2.1.4 (cellulase/endo-1,4-beta-glucanase) in UniProt with the catalytic
      activity described as 'Endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in
      cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans'. The more specific cellulase
      activity term should be preferred.

      While correct, this is an extremely broad parent term and the more specific

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: GO:0005975 'carbohydrate metabolic process' is a very high-level term
      that encompasses essentially all carbohydrate metabolism. CelD functions specifically
      in cellulose degradation as evidenced by its UniProt keywords (Cellulose degradation,
      Glycosidase) and EC classification (3.2.1.4). The GO:0030245 'cellulose catabolic

    summary: This annotation is derived from InterPro domain IPR004197 (Cellulase_Ig-like)
      and EC number mapping (EC:3.2.1.4). This is the core molecular function of CelD.
      The UniProt entry explicitly states EC=3.2.1.4 and describes the catalytic activity
      as 'Endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin
      and cereal beta-D-glucans'. CelD belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9)
      as indicated by CAZy database cross-reference.

      term of GO:0008810 'cellulase activity'. Since CelD is specifically classified
      as a cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4), the more specific term already annotated is preferred

  review:
    summary: This annotation is derived from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0136 Cellulose
      degradation). This accurately reflects the biological process in which CelD
      participates. As an endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) that cleaves internal beta-1,4-glucosidic
      bonds in cellulose, CelD directly contributes to cellulose catabolism within
      the cellulosome complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GO:0030245 'cellulose catabolic process' is the appropriate biological
      process term for CelD. The UniProt entry lists 'Cellulose degradation' as a
      keyword and describes the function as catalyzing endohydrolysis of glucosidic
      linkages in cellulose. This is a core function term representing the primary
      biological role of this endoglucanase in the A. thermocellus cellulosome.

    summary: This cellular component annotation captures the localization of CelD
      within the cellulosome complex. CelD contains a type I dockerin domain (residues

      The dockerin domain is annotated in UniProt and literature confirms CelD binding
      to CipA-derived mini-scaffoldins.
    action: NEW
    reason: GO:0043263 'cellulosome' is a critical cellular component annotation that
      is missing from the current GOA annotations. The UniProt entry clearly indicates
      CelD has a dockerin domain (residues 579-649) that mediates cellulosome incorporation
      via cohesin-dockerin interactions. The protein is secreted (signal peptide 1-41)
      and functions as part of the extracellular cellulosome. Deep research confirms
      CelD binding to CipA-derived constructs.

    summary: CelD contains a type I dockerin domain that specifically binds to type
      I cohesin domains on scaffoldin proteins like CipA. This molecular function
      annotation would capture the important cohesin-dockerin interaction that enables
      cellulosome assembly. The dockerin domain is annotated in UniProt with clear
      evidence from sequence analysis.
    action: NEW
    reason: GO:1990311 'type-I cohesin domain binding' precisely describes the molecular
      function of the dockerin domain present in CelD. The UniProt entry annotates
      residues 579-649 as a dockerin domain. Type I dockerins bind type I cohesins,
      which is how CelD is incorporated into the cellulosome via the CipA scaffoldin.
      This is a significant molecular function that enables the multi-enzyme complex
      formation essential for efficient cellulose degradation.
