description: >-
  CelX is a cellulosome-associated protein from Acetivibrio thermocellus that contains an SGNH hydrolase
  domain and a type I dockerin domain. Despite being annotated as a "putative endoglucanase," the protein's
  domain architecture strongly suggests esterase rather than cellulase activity. The SGNH hydrolase fold
  (InterPro: IPR013830, Pfam: Lipase_GDSL_2) is characteristic of serine esterases/lipases, not glycoside
  hydrolases. The dockerin domain enables attachment to the cellulosome scaffoldin, suggesting a role in
  lignocellulose degradation, but as an accessory esterase (possibly a feruloyl esterase or acetylxylan
  esterase) rather than a true cellulase. The "cellulase" annotation appears to be a historical misannotation
  based on genomic context (proximity to celE) rather than biochemical characterization of CelX itself.
  The original paper (PMID:3066698) primarily characterizes CelE, mentioning celX only as a secondary ORF
  identified in the upstream region.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on the presence of the dockerin domain (InterPro: IPR002105, IPR016134, IPR036439)
      which is associated with cellulosome components. While CelX is likely part of the cellulosome complex
      and therefore participates in polysaccharide degradation, the role would be as an accessory esterase
      (removing ester-linked substituents from polysaccharides) rather than directly cleaving glycosidic bonds.
      The annotation is acceptable as a broad descriptor of the biological context but may be an over-annotation
      since it implies direct polysaccharide backbone cleavage.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The dockerin domain indicates cellulosome association, suggesting involvement in plant cell wall
      degradation. However, based on the SGNH hydrolase catalytic domain, the protein likely functions as an
      accessory esterase that assists in polysaccharide degradation by removing ester-linked side groups rather
      than cleaving the polysaccharide backbone directly. This is a peripheral rather than core function description.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from InterPro:IPR002105 (Dockerin type I repeat), which is a non-catalytic
      domain for cellulosome attachment. The dockerin domain does not confer glycoside hydrolase activity;
      it is a protein-protein interaction module that binds to cohesin domains on the scaffoldin. This
      annotation is a clear example of guilt-by-association: because dockerin domains are found in cellulases,
      the presence of dockerin led to this glycoside hydrolase annotation, even though the catalytic domain
      (SGNH hydrolase) does not hydrolyze O-glycosyl compounds.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The SGNH hydrolase domain (Pfam: Lipase_GDSL_2, InterPro: IPR013830) present in CelX is characteristic
      of serine esterases, not glycoside hydrolases. SGNH hydrolases catalyze ester bond cleavage using a
      Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, while glycoside hydrolases use different mechanisms (retaining/inverting)
      and have distinct catalytic residues. The annotation is based on the dockerin domain which only indicates
      cellulosome association, not enzymatic activity. The original publication (PMID:3066698) does not
      provide experimental evidence for glycoside hydrolase activity of CelX.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from TreeGrafter phylogenetic inference based on the SGNH hydrolase domain
      (PANTHER family PTN002411393 - lysophospholipase L1 family). While the domain architecture is consistent
      with the SGNH hydrolase superfamily that includes lysophospholipases, this specific activity annotation
      is likely too specific for a bacterial cellulosome component. SGNH hydrolases in cellulosome contexts
      typically function as carbohydrate esterases (feruloyl esterases, acetylxylan esterases) rather than
      phospholipid-cleaving enzymes.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The SGNH hydrolase domain correctly identifies the enzyme family, but lysophospholipase activity is
      unlikely for a cellulosome-associated enzyme. The biological context (cellulosome, plant cell wall
      degradation) strongly suggests this enzyme functions as a carbohydrate esterase involved in lignocellulose
      degradation. SGNH hydrolases in this context typically remove ester-linked substituents (ferulic acid,
      acetyl groups) from plant cell wall polysaccharides. A more appropriate annotation would reflect
      general esterase activity or, more specifically, carbohydrate esterase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on EC:3.2.1.4 mapping. However, the EC number assignment appears to be
      erroneous. The protein's catalytic domain is an SGNH hydrolase (serine esterase fold), not a glycoside
      hydrolase fold. True cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4) belong to glycoside hydrolase families (GH5, GH6, GH7,
      GH8, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH48, etc.) and have completely different structural folds and catalytic
      mechanisms from SGNH hydrolases. The "putative endoglucanase" annotation in UniProt appears to be
      based on genomic context and dockerin domain presence rather than biochemical characterization or
      sequence analysis of the catalytic domain.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The protein structure is definitively SGNH hydrolase (PDB:2VPT at 1.40 A resolution shows the SGNH
      fold for residues 9-149). SGNH hydrolases are serine esterases with a catalytic mechanism involving
      a Ser-His-Asp triad and do not possess the active site architecture required for glycoside bond
      cleavage. The cellulase annotation is contradicted by the solved crystal structure. The original
      name "celX" and "putative endoglucanase" designation appear to be historical artifacts from the
      genomic context of discovery (adjacent to celE) rather than functional characterization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This broad annotation based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0378 (Hydrolase) is correct. The SGNH hydrolase
      domain is indeed a hydrolase that catalyzes ester bond hydrolysis. This is the most appropriate
      of the molecular function annotations for this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The SGNH hydrolase domain definitively encodes hydrolase activity. The broad term is appropriate
      given uncertainty about the specific substrate. This correctly captures the enzymatic function
      without the problematic over-specificity of the glycoside hydrolase or lysophospholipase annotations.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0326 (Glycosidase), which is incorrectly applied
      to this protein. The SGNH hydrolase fold is characteristic of esterases, not glycosidases. The
      keyword appears to be propagated from the erroneous "cellulase/endoglucanase" annotation rather
      than from structural or sequence evidence of glycosidase activity.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The protein contains an SGNH hydrolase domain (serine esterase superfamily), not a glycoside
      hydrolase domain. The catalytic mechanism of SGNH hydrolases involves ester bond cleavage,
      not glycosidic bond cleavage. The crystal structure (PDB:2VPT) confirms the SGNH fold.
      This annotation should be removed as it is structurally and mechanistically incorrect.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0136 (Cellulose degradation). While the protein
      is likely part of the cellulosome complex and may contribute to overall cellulose degradation
      through removal of ester-linked substituents that impede access to cellulose, it does not directly
      catabolize cellulose (break down the cellulose polymer). This annotation conflates participation
      in a cellulose-degrading system with direct cellulose catabolism.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      CelX likely functions as an accessory esterase in lignocellulose degradation rather than a true
      cellulase. SGNH hydrolases in cellulosome contexts typically remove ester-linked ferulic acid or
      acetyl groups from hemicellulose, which facilitates access to cellulose but does not constitute
      cellulose catabolism. A more accurate annotation would reflect involvement in plant cell wall
      degradation or, more specifically, hemicellulose modification.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The presence of a type I dockerin domain (aa 162-224) strongly indicates that CelX is a component
      of the cellulosome, the extracellular multi-enzyme complex that degrades plant cell walls. This
      is the most well-supported annotation for this protein based on domain architecture. The deep
      research confirms that dockerin-bearing enzymes are secreted and assembled on scaffoldins via
      cohesin-dockerin binding (file:ACET2/P15329/P15329-deep-research-falcon.md).

    reason: >-
      The dockerin domain (InterPro: IPR002105, IPR016134, IPR036439; PROSITE: PS00448, PS51766) is the
      signature module for cellulosomal proteins. It binds to cohesin domains on the scaffoldin protein,
      anchoring CelX within the cellulosome complex. This cellular component annotation is strongly
      supported by the domain architecture.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Based on the SGNH hydrolase domain (Pfam: Lipase_GDSL_2, InterPro: IPR013830, IPR051532), CelX is
      predicted to have esterase activity. The UniProt domain annotation includes Ester_Hydrolysis_Enzymes

    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The SGNH hydrolase superfamily (Gene3D: 3.40.50.1110, SUPFAM: SSF52266) consists of serine
      esterases/lipases that hydrolyze ester bonds. The catalytic domain structure (residues 9-149,
      solved at 1.40 A in PDB:2VPT) confirms this fold. In the context of the cellulosome, this
      esterase activity likely targets ester-linked substituents on plant cell wall polysaccharides.
