  label: Acetivibrio thermocellus
description: >-
  Xyloglucanase Xgh74A is a GH74 family endo-xyloglucanase that is a major component of
  the Acetivibrio thermocellus cellulosome. It catalyzes the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic
  linkages in xyloglucan, preferentially cleaving at unbranched glucose residues in the backbone
  to produce xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, XLLG). The enzyme contains a
  C-terminal type I dockerin domain that mediates attachment to the CipA scaffoldin protein,
  thereby incorporating it into the extracellular cellulosome complex. It has high specific
  activity on tamarind seed xyloglucan (295 U/mg) with optimal activity at pH 6.4 and 75C,
  and shows only low activity on CMC and no activity on amorphous cellulose, indicating
  recognition of xylosidic side chains present in xyloglucan. Crystal structures have been
  determined revealing an open binding groove accommodating long oligosaccharides.

    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation infers involvement in polysaccharide catabolic process based on
      InterPro domain matches (dockerin domains IPR002105, IPR016134, IPR036439) and UniProtKB
      keywords. Xgh74A does function in polysaccharide catabolism, specifically xyloglucan
      degradation, as demonstrated experimentally (PMID:16207921). However, this term is
      very broad and lacks specificity for the actual substrate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this annotation is correct in a general sense - Xgh74A does participate in
      polysaccharide catabolism - it is overly broad. However, the more specific term
      GO:2000899 (xyloglucan catabolic process) is already annotated with IDA evidence,
      making this broader IEA annotation acceptable as a correctly inferred parent term.
      The enzymatic evidence from PMID:16207921 demonstrates hydrolysis of xyloglucan
      producing oligosaccharides.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation from InterPro/ARBA infers a general O-glycosyl hydrolase activity
      based on domain matches. Xgh74A is indeed an O-glycosyl hydrolase, specifically an
      endo-xyloglucanase that cleaves beta-1,4-glucosidic linkages. The more specific term
      GO:0033946 (xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity) is annotated with
      experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct parent term for the experimentally validated xyloglucan-specific
      endo-beta-1,4-glucanase activity (GO:0033946). The enzyme hydrolyzes O-glycosyl bonds
      in xyloglucan as demonstrated in PMID:16207921. The crystal structure study (PMID:16772298)
      further characterized the active site and substrate binding.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This TreeGrafter-generated annotation correctly identifies involvement in xyloglucan
      metabolism based on phylogenetic inference (PANTHER:PTN005180743). Xgh74A is experimentally
      demonstrated to hydrolyze xyloglucan. However, the more specific child term GO:2000899
      (xyloglucan catabolic process) is already annotated with IDA evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct but broad annotation. The enzyme specifically catalyzes xyloglucan
      catabolism, which is a child process of xyloglucan metabolic process. Since the more
      specific term is already annotated with experimental evidence, this IEA serves as
      a correctly inferred parent term. The TreeGrafter phylogenetic inference correctly
      places this GH74 family enzyme in the xyloglucan metabolism pathway.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This very broad IEA annotation from UniProtKB-KW:KW-0378 (Hydrolase) simply indicates
      that the protein has hydrolase activity. While technically correct, this term provides
      minimal informational value given the more specific annotations available.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct but very high-level annotation that is a grandparent of the
      experimentally validated specific activity. The UniProtKB keyword mapping correctly
      identifies the protein as a hydrolase. More specific child terms (GO:0016798, GO:0004553,
      GO:0033946) are also annotated, providing greater specificity.

      correctly classifies this enzyme as acting on glycosyl bonds, consistent with its

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation infers involvement in cellulose catabolism from UniProtKB-KW:KW-0136
      (Cellulose degradation). However, experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that
      Xgh74A is NOT a cellulase - it has only very low activity on CMC and NO activity
      on amorphous cellulose. Its primary substrate is xyloglucan, a hemicellulose.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. PMID:16207921 explicitly states that Xgh74A has "low
      activity on CMC" and "no activity on amorphous cellulose", indicating it does not
      function in cellulose catabolism. The UniProt keyword "Cellulose degradation" appears
      to be a misattribution likely based on its cellulosome association and GH74 family
      membership, but experimental evidence clearly shows xyloglucan is the primary substrate.
      The enzyme's recognition of xylosidic side chains distinguishes it from true cellulases.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IDA annotation correctly captures the specific molecular function of Xgh74A.
      The enzyme was biochemically characterized and shown to hydrolyze xyloglucan with
      high specificity (295 U/mg on tamarind seed xyloglucan), cleaving every fourth
      beta-1,4-glucan bond in the backbone to produce decorated cellotetraose units
      (XXXG, XLXG, XXLG, XLLG). The crystal structure (PMID:16772298) further confirmed
      this activity and identified the catalytic residues.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the most specific and accurate MF annotation for Xgh74A, directly supported
      by experimental evidence demonstrating endo-xyloglucanase activity. The enzyme
      belongs to GH74 family known for this activity, and the hydrolysis pattern
      producing decorated cellotetraose units is characteristic of endo-xyloglucanases.
      This represents the core molecular function of the protein.

      This IDA annotation correctly identifies Xgh74A as a cellulosome component. The
      enzyme contains a C-terminal type I dockerin domain that mediates incorporation
      into the cellulosome by binding to cohesin modules on the CipA scaffoldin protein.
      Proteomic studies have confirmed Xgh74A as a major extracellular cellulosome
      component in C. thermocellum.
    action: ACCEPT

      This is the correct CC annotation for Xgh74A. The presence of a functional type I
      dockerin domain (experimentally validated through proteomic detection in cellulosome
      preparations) indicates localization to the cellulosome complex. The enzyme was
      identified as one of "two new major subunits in the cellulosome" in PMID:16207921.
      Additional proteomic studies (Gold & Martin 2007, Zverlov et al. 2005 Proteomics)

      This IDA annotation correctly identifies Xgh74A as involved in xyloglucan catabolism.
      The enzyme specifically degrades xyloglucan (a hemicellulose) by hydrolyzing the

      hemicellulose as part of lignocellulose deconstruction.
