description: >-
  XynZ (Xylanase Z) is a modular cellulosomal enzyme from Acetivibrio thermocellus
  (formerly Clostridium thermocellum) with dual catalytic activities. The protein
  contains four distinct domains: an N-terminal CE1 feruloyl esterase domain that
  removes ferulate and acetyl decorations from xylan, a CBM6 carbohydrate-binding
  module that targets xylan substrates, a type I dockerin domain that mediates
  incorporation into the cellulosome via binding to cohesin domains on the CipA
  scaffoldin, and a C-terminal GH10 endo-1,4-beta-xylanase catalytic domain that
  cleaves internal beta-1,4 linkages in xylan backbones. The protein is exported
  and functions as part of the extracellular cellulosome complex, where it
  contributes to the coordinated degradation of plant cell wall hemicellulose.
  The GH10 domain shows optimal activity around 70C, consistent with the
  thermophilic lifestyle of this organism. XynZ produces xylo-oligosaccharides,
  primarily xylobiose, as hydrolysis products.

      summary: >-
        This annotation is based on InterPro domains (Dockerin) and UniProt keywords.
        While XynZ does participate in polysaccharide catabolism, specifically xylan
        degradation, this term is overly broad. The protein's primary catabolic
        activity is specifically on xylan, a type of hemicellulose, not polysaccharides
        in general. The more specific term GO:0045493 (xylan catabolic process) is
        already annotated and should be preferred.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: >-
        While technically correct since xylan is a polysaccharide, this term is too
        general for XynZ which has well-characterized xylan-specific activity. The
        GH10 domain specifically catalyzes endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity, and
        the more specific annotation to GO:0045493 (xylan catabolic process) is
        more informative. This IEA annotation adds no information beyond the
        existing xylan catabolic process annotation.

        This annotation is inferred from the GH10 and dockerin InterPro domains.
        The term correctly captures the general enzymatic mechanism of the GH10
        xylanase domain but is less specific than endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity
        (GO:0031176) which is the precise function of the GH10 domain.

        This is a valid parent term annotation based on InterPro domain prediction.
        While more specific terms exist (GO:0031176), hierarchical IEA annotations
        to parent terms are acceptable as they correctly capture the enzyme class.
        The GH10 domain does indeed hydrolyze O-glycosyl compounds (beta-1,4-xylosidic
        linkages in xylan).

      label: feruloyl esterase activity
    description: >-
      The N-terminal CE1 domain provides feruloyl esterase activity,
      removing ferulate and acetyl decorations from substituted xylans.
      This accessory activity facilitates access of the xylanase domain
      to the xylan backbone.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Has the feruloyl esterase activity of the CE1 domain been directly
      demonstrated experimentally, and what is the substrate specificity?
      While the CE1 domain is predicted to have feruloyl esterase activity
      based on sequence similarity, direct experimental validation would
      strengthen the annotation.
  - question: >-
      What is the relative contribution of the CBM6 domain to substrate
      binding and catalytic efficiency on different xylan substrates?
      Understanding CBM6 function would support the proposed modification
      of the carbohydrate binding annotation to the more specific xylan
      binding term.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Direct assay of feruloyl esterase activity using the isolated CE1
      domain or full-length protein with ferulated xylan substrates.
      This would provide experimental evidence for the proposed new annotation
      to GO:0030600 (feruloyl esterase activity).
  - description: >-
      Binding assays comparing xylan vs other carbohydrate substrates
      for the CBM6 domain. This would support the proposed modification
      from general carbohydrate binding to specific xylan binding.
