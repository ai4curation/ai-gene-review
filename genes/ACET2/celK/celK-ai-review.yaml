description: CelK (also known as Cel9K, locus Cthe_0412) is a major cellulosomal cellulase
  belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) in Acetivibrio thermocellus (formerly
  Clostridium thermocellum). It functions as a cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase (EC
  3.2.1.91) that hydrolyzes beta-1,4-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, releasing cellobiose
  and cellotriose from the non-reducing ends of cellulose chains. The enzyme has a
  modular architecture consisting of a CBM4 carbohydrate-binding module, an Ig-like
  domain, the GH9 catalytic domain, and a C-terminal type I dockerin domain that mediates
  integration into the cellulosome complex. CelK works synergistically with Cel48S
  (the major GH48 cellobiohydrolase) in the cellulosome to efficiently degrade crystalline
  cellulose.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CelK is a cellulase that degrades cellulose, which is a polysaccharide.
      The annotation to polysaccharide catabolic process is correct but overly broad.
      CelK specifically catalyzes the breakdown of cellulose (a beta-1,4-glucan),
      not polysaccharides in general.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While cellulose is a polysaccharide and CelK does participate in polysaccharide
      catabolism, this term is too general. The more specific term GO:0030245 (cellulose
      catabolic process) already exists in the annotation set and accurately captures
      the biological process. This broader term provides less informative annotation.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CelK is a GH9 family glycoside hydrolase that hydrolyzes beta-1,4-glucosidic
      bonds in cellulose. This annotation is correct but too general - the enzyme
      has specific cellobiohydrolase activity (EC 3.2.1.91) rather than generic glycosyl
      hydrolase activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0016162 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase activity) is more
      specific and preferred, this parent term is technically accurate. Since the
      more specific term is already annotated, this broader annotation is acceptable
      as it provides correct hierarchical coverage. IEA annotations often propagate
      from broader InterPro signatures and this is consistent with the enzyme's function.

  review:
    summary: CelK is a secreted protein that incorporates into the extracellular cellulosome
      complex via its dockerin domain. The signal peptide (residues 1-27) is cleaved
      upon secretion. Proteomics confirms CelK is abundant in cellulosome preparations
      from cellulose-grown cells.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While CelK is secreted to the extracellular region, a more specific cellular
      component annotation would be GO:0043263 (cellulosome), as CelK is a bona fide
      cellulosomal enzyme that integrates via dockerin-cohesin interactions. The cellulosome
      is a defined extracellular multi-enzyme complex in C. thermocellum.

  review:
    summary: CelK participates in carbohydrate metabolism by degrading cellulose.
      This annotation is correct but extremely broad - CelK's specific role is in
      cellulose catabolism.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a very high-level biological process term that is technically
      accurate but provides minimal information. Since more specific BP annotations
      exist (GO:0030245 cellulose catabolic process), this broad term is acceptable
      as hierarchical context but not informative as a standalone annotation. IEA
      from InterPro is appropriate for this level of granularity.

    label: cellulase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: CelK has cellulase activity as a GH9 family enzyme. However, the GO definition
      of cellulase activity (GO:0008810) specifically refers to endohydrolysis, whereas
      CelK functions as a cellobiohydrolase (exo-acting, EC 3.2.1.91) releasing cellobiose
      from non-reducing ends.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0008810 (cellulase activity) is defined as "catalysis of the endohydrolysis
      of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose". CelK is classified as EC
      3.2.1.91 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase), which is an exo-acting enzyme
      that releases cellobiose from the non-reducing ends. The correct annotation
      is GO:0016162 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase activity), which is already
      present in the annotation set.

  review:
    summary: 'This is the most accurate molecular function annotation for CelK. The
      enzyme is classified as EC 3.2.1.91 (cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase), which
      matches this GO term exactly. UniProt catalytic activity annotation confirms:
      "Hydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and cellotetraose,
      releasing cellobiose from the non-reducing ends of the chains."'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the correct and most specific molecular function annotation for
      CelK. The annotation is derived from EC:3.2.1.91 mapping, which is the experimentally
      determined enzyme classification for this protein. This represents the core
      catalytic function of CelK.

  review:
    summary: CelK is indeed a hydrolase - it catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of
      beta-1,4-glucosidic bonds. This annotation is correct but extremely general.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the root molecular function term for hydrolases. While technically
      accurate, it provides minimal information. More specific annotations (GO:0016162,
      GO:0004553, GO:0016798) are already present and preferred. This broad term is
      acceptable as it provides hierarchical consistency but is not informative as

    summary: CelK hydrolyzes glycosyl bonds (specifically beta-1,4-glucosidic linkages
      in cellulose). This annotation is correct and at an appropriate intermediate
      level of specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This term accurately describes CelK's molecular function at an intermediate
      level of specificity. While GO:0016162 is more specific, this parent term is
      correctly applied. IEA annotation from InterPro domain signatures appropriately
      captures this level of function.

  review:
    summary: CelK is directly involved in cellulose catabolism as a major cellulosomal
      cellulase. The enzyme degrades crystalline cellulose to cellobiose and cellotriose
      as primary products. This is the most appropriate biological process annotation
      for CelK.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the correct and most specific biological process annotation for
      CelK. The enzyme's primary biological role is cellulose degradation as part
      of the cellulosome complex. This annotation accurately represents the core biological
      process in which CelK participates.

  review:
    summary: CelK contains a C-terminal type I dockerin domain (residues 828-894)
      that mediates integration into the cellulosome via interaction with cohesin
      domains on the CipA scaffoldin protein. Proteomics confirms CelK is one of the
      most abundant cellulosomal enzyme subunits.
    action: NEW
    reason: This annotation is not currently in the GOA file but is strongly supported
      by the domain architecture (dockerin domain) and proteomics data showing CelK
      as a major cellulosomal component. This is the most specific and accurate cellular
      component annotation.
