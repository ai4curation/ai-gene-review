description: >
  SdbA (Scaffolding dockerin binding protein A) is an anchoring scaffoldin in the
  Acetivibrio thermocellus (formerly Clostridium thermocellum) cellulosome system.
  It is a non-catalytic cell surface protein that functions to tether the primary
  scaffoldin CipA (and its associated enzyme complement) to the bacterial cell envelope.
  SdbA contains a single type II cohesin domain that specifically binds the C-terminal
  type II dockerin (XDocII) of CipA, and three SLH (S-layer homology) domains that
  mediate attachment to the peptidoglycan/cell wall. Unlike cellulosomal enzymes,
  SdbA has NO catalytic activity and does NOT bind carbohydrates directly - its
  function is purely structural/scaffolding. Genetic deletion studies show that
  sdbA mutants have moderate (14-25%) reductions in cellulose hydrolysis, indicating
  functional redundancy with other anchoring scaffoldins (OlpB, Orf2p).

    review:
      summary: >
        This annotation is INCORRECT. SdbA is a non-catalytic anchoring scaffoldin
        that does NOT participate in polysaccharide catabolism. The protein lacks
        any glycosyl hydrolase domains or catalytic activity. The InterPro mapping
        from the cohesin domain (IPR002102) is erroneous - cohesin domains mediate
        protein-protein interactions with dockerin domains, not carbohydrate degradation.
        The deep research confirms that SdbA is best annotated as a noncatalytic,
        cell-surface anchoring scaffoldin.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >
        SdbA contains a type II cohesin domain that binds dockerin, not carbohydrates
        or polysaccharides. The protein has no enzymatic activity whatsoever. It
        functions solely as a structural adaptor to tether cellulosomes to the cell
        surface via SLH-mediated cell envelope binding. The annotation derives from
        an incorrect InterPro2GO mapping that conflates structural similarity between
        cohesin and CBM domains with functional similarity.

    review:
      summary: >
        This annotation is correct but overly broad. SdbA is indeed secreted and
        localized extracellularly, but it is specifically anchored to the cell surface
        via its SLH domains. The UniProt subcellular location annotation Secreted
        supports this, though GO:0009986 (cell surface) would be more specific given
        the SLH-mediated cell envelope attachment.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >
        While technically correct that SdbA is in the extracellular region, this term
        is too general. SdbA is specifically tethered to the cell surface via its
        three SLH domains which bind cell envelope components (peptidoglycan). The
        protein does not freely diffuse in the extracellular space but is surface-
        associated. A more accurate annotation would reflect its cell surface localization.

    review:
      summary: >
        This annotation is INCORRECT. SdbA does NOT bind carbohydrates. The type II
        cohesin domain binds the type II dockerin domain of CipA (a protein-protein
        interaction), not carbohydrates. This erroneous annotation stems from the
        InterPro mapping of cohesin domains (IPR002102) and the CBM superfamily
        (IPR008965), which share structural similarity but have completely different
        functions. Cohesin-dockerin interactions are protein-protein, calcium-dependent
        binding events, not carbohydrate binding.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >
        SdbA cohesin domain specifically binds the dockerin domain of CipA scaffoldin
        - this is a well-characterized protein-protein interaction, not carbohydrate
        binding. The structural similarity between cohesin domains and CBM domains
        (both belong to beta-sandwich fold families) has led to erroneous functional
        annotation. The correct molecular function is type-II dockerin domain binding,
        which accurately describes SdbA role in capturing CipA for cell surface
        anchoring.

        SdbA plays a direct role in cellulosome assembly by providing an anchoring
        point for the CipA scaffoldin at the cell surface. While SdbA does not
        participate in the type I cohesin-dockerin interactions that recruit enzymes
        to CipA, it is essential for the final step of cellulosome architecture:
        tethering the assembled complex to the cell. Genetic studies show that
