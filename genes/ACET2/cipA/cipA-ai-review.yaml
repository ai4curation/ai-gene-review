  label: Acetivibrio thermocellus (strain ATCC 27405 / DSM 1237 / JCM 9322 / NBRC

description: CipA is the primary cellulosomal scaffoldin protein in Acetivibrio thermocellus
  (formerly Clostridium thermocellum). It is a large (1853 aa) non-catalytic structural
  protein that serves as the central organizing scaffold of the cellulosome - a supramolecular
  multi-enzyme complex that efficiently degrades plant cell wall polysaccharides.
  CipA contains nine type I cohesin domains that bind dockerin-bearing catalytic enzymes
  (cellulases, hemicellulases), a central CBM3a carbohydrate-binding module that targets
  the complex to crystalline cellulose, and a C-terminal type II dockerin (with associated
  X module) that anchors the cellulosome to cell-surface proteins bearing type II
  cohesins (SdbA, OlpB, Orf2p). CipA does NOT possess any catalytic/enzymatic activity
  - its function is purely structural and organizational, bringing multiple enzymes
  into proximity for synergistic cellulose degradation.

    label: polysaccharide catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: CipA is involved in polysaccharide catabolism but only indirectly through
      its scaffolding role. CipA itself has no catalytic activity; it organizes dockerin-bearing
      enzymes that perform the actual hydrolysis. The annotation captures participation
      in the process but overstates direct involvement.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While CipA is essential for efficient polysaccharide degradation by the
      cellulosome, it is not directly involved in the catabolic process itself. CipA
      is a non-catalytic structural organizer that assembles multiple cellulases and
      hemicellulases into a multienzyme complex. The scaffoldin promotes enzyme synergy
      but does not catalyze any reactions. This annotation is acceptable as a secondary/non-core
      function reflecting its organizational role in the process.

    label: hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is INCORRECT. CipA has no hydrolase activity whatsoever.
      It is a non-catalytic scaffoldin protein that organizes enzymes but does not
      itself possess any enzymatic function. This appears to be an erroneous transfer
      from the dockerin domain (IPR002105), which is also present in catalytic cellulosomal
      enzymes.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: CipA is explicitly described in the literature as a non-catalytic scaffolding
      glycoprotein (UniProt CC-FUNCTION). The UniProt function annotation states that
      CipA acts as a scaffolding protein in the cellulosome and promotes binding of
      cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes - note it promotes
      binding TO catalytic domains, it does not have catalytic activity itself. The
      deep research confirms CipA is a non-catalytic structural organizer (cipA-deep-research-falcon.md).
      The InterPro domain IPR002105 (Dockerin_1_rpt) is present in both scaffoldins
      and catalytic enzymes; the hydrolase activity annotation was incorrectly transferred
      because dockerins are commonly found in hydrolases, but the scaffoldin CipA
      only uses its dockerin (type II) for anchoring to cell-surface proteins, not
      for catalysis. This is a clear over-annotation error.

    summary: This annotation is correct. CipA is a secreted protein that functions
      in the extracellular space, either cell-surface anchored or as part of cell-free
      cellulosomes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UniProt explicitly states that CipA is secreted and remains at the cell
      surface. The deep research confirms that CipA-enabled cellulosomes are predominantly
      cell surface-associated through anchoring scaffoldins bearing SLH domains. C.
      thermocellum also produces cell-free (diffusible) cellulosomes that operate
      at a distance from the bacterial surface. The protein has a signal peptide (residues
      1-28) and functions extracellularly.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is too general and misrepresents CipA's role. CipA does
      not metabolize carbohydrates; it organizes enzymes that do. This is an overly
      broad annotation derived from the CBM3 domain.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: CipA's CBM3a domain binds cellulose but does not metabolize it. The protein's
      role is structural - organizing the cellulosome for efficient carbohydrate degradation.
      A more appropriate annotation would be GO:0044575 (cellulosome assembly) which
      captures the actual biological process CipA participates in. The annotation
      to carbohydrate metabolic process incorrectly implies direct metabolic activity.

      participation in the catabolic process.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: CipA is essential for efficient cellulose catabolism via the cellulosome,
      but it does not itself degrade cellulose. Its CBM3a module targets the complex
      to cellulose substrate, and its cohesins organize the catalytic enzymes that
      perform hydrolysis. The annotation reflects involvement in the process but should
      be considered non-core since CipA's primary function is structural organization
      (cellulosome assembly) rather than direct catalysis.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is misleading. CipA is involved in PLANT cell wall DEGRADATION
      (as a target substrate), not in bacterial cell wall organization. The UniProt
      keyword mapping appears to have conflated cell wall degradation with cell wall
      organization.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: CipA functions in the degradation of plant cell walls (cellulose, hemicellulose),
      not in organizing the bacterial cell wall. While CipA is anchored at the cell
      surface, its function is to organize the cellulosome for degrading extracellular
      plant material, not to organize the bacterium's own cell wall. The UniProt keywords
      include Cell wall biogenesis/degradation which likely triggered this annotation,
      but the context is substrate degradation, not endogenous cell wall organization.
      This is a semantic error in the automated annotation pipeline.

- description: Comprehensive interactome analysis of CipA cohesin domains to quantify
    the full repertoire of dockerin-bearing proteins recruited to the cellulosome
    in vivo.
  hypothesis: While the cohesin-dockerin interaction is well-characterized structurally,
    the complete set of CipA interaction partners in vivo remains incompletely defined.
