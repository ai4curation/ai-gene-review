- **UniProt Accession:** Q06851
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cellulosomal-scaffolding protein A; AltName: Full=Cellulose-integrating protein A; AltName: Full=Cellulosomal glycoprotein S1/SL; AltName: Full=Cohesin; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=cipA; OrderedLocusNames=Cthe_3077;
- **Organism (full):** Acetivibrio thermocellus (strain ATCC 27405 / DSM 1237 / JCM 9322 / NBRC 103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372) (Clostridium thermocellum).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** CarboxyPept-like_regulatory. (IPR008969); CBM2/CBM3_carb-bd_dom_sf. (IPR008965); CBM3. (IPR001956); CBM3_sf. (IPR036966); Cohesin_dom. (IPR002102)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "cipA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Acetivibrio thermocellus (strain ATCC 27405 / DSM 1237 / JCM 9322 / NBRC 103400 / NCIMB 10682 / NRRL B-4536 / VPI 7372) (Clostridium thermocellum).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'cipA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **cipA** (gene ID: cipA, UniProt: Q06851) in ACET2.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: Objectives verified and evidence gathered from primary and recent literature. Below is a comprehensive, cited research report on cipA (Cthe_3077; UniProt Q06851) from Acetivibrio thermocellus (Clostridium thermocellum), including identity verification, functional annotation, domain architecture, localization, roles in cellulose degradation, recent developments, applications, expert analysis, and quantitative data.

Comprehensive research report: cipA (Cthe_3077; UniProt Q06851) in Acetivibrio thermocellus

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Gene/protein identity: cipA encodes the primary cellulosomal scaffoldin (often termed “CipA”) in Clostridium thermocellum (synonym: Acetivibrio thermocellus), locus Cthe_3077. Classical and mechanistic literature consistently identifies CipA as the main non-catalytic scaffoldin of the C. thermocellum cellulosome, organizing dockerin-bearing enzymes into a multienzyme complex and linking the complex to the cell surface via anchoring scaffoldins (SdbA/OlpB/Orf2p). This aligns with UniProt Q06851 annotations. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 1-4)

Key concepts, definitions, and current understanding
- Cellulosome: a supramolecular multi-enzyme complex that deconstructs plant cell wall polysaccharides. In C. thermocellum, the primary scaffoldin CipA contains multiple type I cohesins that bind enzymatic subunits carrying type I dockerins, a cellulose-targeting CBM3a, and a C-terminal X–dockerin module (type II) that binds anchoring scaffoldins bearing type II cohesins. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 37-40)
- Cohesin–dockerin specificity: Type I cohesins on CipA bind type I dockerins on catalytic subunits; the C-terminal type II dockerin (on CipA’s X–Doc dyad) binds type II cohesins on anchoring scaffoldins (no cross-specificity between types I and II). Coh–Doc interactions are Ca2+-dependent and among the strongest non-covalent protein–protein interactions; dockerins carry duplicated EF-hand-like Ca2+-binding motifs and can support dual-binding modes, though stoichiometry is 1:1. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbinding pages 46-49, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 40-42)
- Central role of CipA: Genetic and systems studies demonstrate that the primary scaffoldin CipA is essential for high-efficiency cellulose degradation in C. thermocellum; secondary scaffoldins contribute but are less critical. C. thermocellum deploys both cell-bound and cell-free cellulosomes. Science Advances (2016) provides a detailed systems analysis with functional deletion evidence. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1501254 (Feb 2016). (xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)

Protein architecture and domains (alignment with UniProt/IPR domains)
- Domain map: 2 CohI – CBM3a – 7 CohI – X–DocII, totaling nine type I cohesins with a central family 3a CBM and C-terminal X–dockerin (type II). This corroborates the reported modular architecture and the presence of CBM3/CBM3_sf and cohesin domains. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 37-40, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50)
- CBM3a function: targets crystalline cellulose to increase local enzyme concentration and synergize hydrolysis; CBM3a is the prevalent cellulosomal CBM in C. thermocellum. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)
- Cohesins and dockerins: nine type I cohesins on CipA integrate numerous dockerin-bearing CAZymes; dockerins are ~70 aa with duplicated segments yielding two potential binding interfaces and Ca2+ dependence. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 7-9, santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbinding pages 46-49, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 40-42)
- Anchoring via X–DocII and SLH-bearing partners: CipA’s X–DocII binds type II cohesins on anchoring scaffoldins (e.g., SdbA, OlpB, Orf2p), which tether the complex to the cell wall through surface-layer homology (SLH) modules. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 37-40, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 7-9)

*Table: Concise table summarizing CipA (Cthe_3077) domain architecture, roles, localization, system context, and recent 2023–2024 application-relevant literature with evidence citations.*

Primary function, pathway context, and localization
- Function: CipA is a non-catalytic structural organizer that assembles multiple cellulases and hemicellulases into a multienzyme complex through high-affinity type I cohesin–dockerin interactions, thereby enhancing synergistic cellulose and plant cell wall deconstruction. Its CBM3a targets the complex to cellulose, and its C-terminal X–DocII connects the complex to the cell via anchoring scaffoldins. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)
- Localization: CipA-enabled cellulosomes are predominantly cell surface-associated through anchoring scaffoldins bearing SLH domains. C. thermocellum also produces cell-free (diffusible) cellulosomes that operate at a distance from the bacterial surface, consistent with secondary scaffoldins lacking SLH modules. (pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 7-9, xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)
- Pathway context: CipA is central to the exoproteome that deconstructs cellulose to cellodextrins for uptake and metabolism. Disruption of the primary scaffoldin alters expression of CAZymes and transport systems, underscoring its systems-level role in lignocellulose conversion. (xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)

(lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 19-20)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Designer/synthetic cellulosomes: Modular scaffoldins and cohesin–dockerin pairs are widely used to build designer cellulosomes that recapitulate CipA-like architecture to enhance biomass deconstruction; design considerations include dockerin/cohesin selection, linker composition, and CBM choice. Results consistently show enhanced hydrolysis versus equivalent free-enzyme mixtures, though stability and context-dependence remain challenges in industrial settings. (lindic2025structuralandfunctional pages 4-5, li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 10-10)
- Immobilization and materials functionalization: CBM-driven binding (including CBM3a derivatives) enables enzyme immobilization on cellulose and cellulose-like supports for biocatalysis and biosensing, aligning with CipA’s CBM3a targeting principle. 2024 examples include use of CBMs to functionalize cellulose materials and immobilize fusion proteins for improved performance. (li2024harnessingcellulosebindingprotein pages 10-10)
- Consolidated bioprocessing and heterologous expression: Prior implementations have expressed CipA variants and cellulosomal components in other clostridia to secrete self-assembling mini-cellulosomes, illustrating cross-species deployment of CipA-like scaffoldins and informing current CBP strategies. URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-117 (Aug 2013). ()

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Mechanistic consensus: Primary scaffoldin CipA integrates enzymes via type I cohesins, targets cellulose via CBM3a, and anchors to the cell via type II interactions—yielding a highly synergistic macromolecular machine. Expert reviews emphasize the unmatched strength and specificity of cohesin–dockerin interactions and the functional necessity of Ca2+. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbinding pages 46-49)
- Systems-level importance of CipA: Experimental deletions and exoproteome analyses support that CipA is the dominant determinant of high cellulose solubilization efficiency in C. thermocellum; intact CipA-mediated assembly affects gene regulation, transport, and particle-scale deconstruction mechanisms. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1501254 (Feb 2016). (xu2016dramaticperformanceof pages 1-2)

Relevant quantitative statistics and data
- Domain and module counts: CipA carries nine type I cohesins and a single CBM3a, with a C-terminal X–DocII dyad. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 37-40)
- System enzyme complement: The C. thermocellum genome encodes approximately 70+ dockerin-containing cellulosomal proteins in addition to free CAZymes, underscoring the potential multivalency of CipA-centered complexes. (pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 1-4)
- Binding properties: Cohesin–dockerin complexes are Ca2+-dependent, with dockerins containing duplicated EF-hand-like loops and capable of dual-binding orientations; the interaction is among the strongest non-covalent protein–protein interactions reported for modular assemblies. (santos2025unconventionalcohesindockerinbinding pages 46-49, pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 40-42)

Ambiguity check and domain alignment
- Ambiguity: The symbol “cipA” can be ambiguous across organisms; the organismal context here is explicitly C. thermocellum (A. thermocellus). All cited sources that name CipA refer to the C. thermocellum primary scaffoldin Cthe_3077, matching UniProt Q06851. (pinheiro2010novelinsightinto pages 47-50, pinheiro2009functionalinsightsinto pages 1-4)
- Domain/family alignment: Literature-confirmed domains (cohesins, CBM3a, X–DocII; anchoring via SLH-bearing secondary scaffoldins) align with UniProt/IPR annotations for cohesin domains (IPR002102) and CBM3-related domains (IPR001956; IPR036966).

Conclusions
CipA (cipA; Cthe_3077; UniProt Q06851) is the primary scaffoldin of A. thermocellus/C. thermocellum cellulosomes. Its modular architecture—nine type I cohesins, a central CBM3a, and a C-terminal X–dockerin (type II)—orchestrates assembly of numerous dockerin-bearing CAZymes and anchors the complex to the cell surface through SLH-bearing secondary scaffoldins. CipA is essential for high-efficiency cellulose deconstruction, functioning at the interface of enzyme synergy, substrate targeting, and cell-surface attachment, with additional evidence for cell-free complexes in the exoproteome. Recent 2023–2024 advances emphasize modular engineering of CBMs/cohesins for designer cellulosomes and materials functionalization, reinforcing the translational value of the CipA paradigm.
