  label: Acetivibrio thermocellus
description: >-
  XynY (Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase Y) is a modular cellulosomal hemicellulase from Acetivibrio thermocellum
  (formerly Clostridium thermocellum). The enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) and
  catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-xylosidic linkages in xylans, producing xylo-oligosaccharides.
  XynY has a complex multi-domain architecture comprising two N-terminal CBM22 carbohydrate-binding modules,
  a central GH10 catalytic domain, a CE1 feruloyl esterase domain, and a C-terminal type-I dockerin domain
  that mediates integration into the cellulosome via interaction with cohesin domains of the CipA scaffoldin.
  The enzyme functions extracellularly as part of the cellulosome complex, contributing to the degradation
  of plant cell wall hemicellulose. XynY displays optimal activity at pH 6.8 and 75 degrees Celsius,
  consistent with the thermophilic lifestyle of the organism.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from InterPro domain mappings (dockerin domains IPR002105, IPR016134, IPR036439
      and polysaccharide degradation keyword KW-0624). While polysaccharide catabolic process is accurate,
      XynY specifically functions in xylan catabolism, which is a more specific child term. The annotation
      is not incorrect but is less informative than the more specific GO:0045493 (xylan catabolic process)
      which is also annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is accurate as xylan is a polysaccharide, and XynY contributes to plant cell wall
      polysaccharide degradation. However, this is a parent term of the more specific xylan catabolic
      process (GO:0045493). Both can be retained as the broader term captures the enzyme's role in
      cellulosome-mediated polysaccharide degradation.

    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from InterPro domain matches (IPR001000 GH10 domain, IPR002105 dockerin,
      IPR044846 GH10 family). The GH10 catalytic domain of XynY is indeed a glycoside hydrolase that
      hydrolyzes O-glycosyl compounds. However, this is a very general parent term; the more specific
      endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity (GO:0031176) is also annotated and is more informative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct parent term for endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity. While not as informative as
      the more specific term GO:0031176, retaining parent terms in IEA annotations is acceptable as
      they capture the broader enzymatic class.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from InterPro domain matches (IPR001000 GH10 domain, IPR044846 GH10 family).
      Carbohydrate metabolic process is a very broad parent term. XynY specifically participates in
      xylan catabolic process (GO:0045493), which is the appropriate specific biological process term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct but very general parent term. The annotation accurately captures that XynY
      is involved in carbohydrate metabolism (specifically catabolism of xylan). IEA mappings to
      broad parent terms are acceptable alongside more specific annotations.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0378 Hydrolase). Hydrolase activity
      is the most general molecular function term for enzymes catalyzing hydrolysis reactions. XynY
      has much more specific molecular functions including endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity (GO:0031176).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct but very general parent term. While the more specific GO:0031176

      term from keyword mapping is acceptable for IEA annotations.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from InterPro CBM-CenC domain (IPR003305) and glycosidase keyword
      (KW-0326). The term is accurate as XynY hydrolyzes glycosyl bonds in xylan. This is an
      intermediate term between the general GO:0016787 (hydrolase activity) and the specific
      GO:0031176 (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a correct intermediate-level molecular function term. XynY's GH10 domain hydrolyzes
      beta-1,4-xylosidic bonds, which are glycosyl bonds. The annotation is accurate.

      This annotation derives from EC number mapping (EC:3.2.1.8). The enzyme is classified as
      EC 3.2.1.8 (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase) in UniProt based on experimental characterization.
      PMID:7717969 demonstrated that recombinant XynY rapidly hydrolyzed oat spelt, wheat and
      rye arabinoxylans and displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase.
      This is the core molecular function of the enzyme.
    action: ACCEPT

      endo-1,4-beta-xylanase activity is well-characterized biochemically. The GH10 catalytic

      This IPI annotation indicates XynY binds to CipA (Q06851), the scaffoldin protein of the
      cellulosome. The interaction is mediated by the type-I dockerin domain of XynY binding
      to cohesin domains of CipA. PMID:14623971 reports the crystal structure of the cohesin-dockerin
      complex from C. thermocellum at 2.2 Angstrom resolution, revealing the structural basis
      of cellulosome assembly. However, protein binding (GO:0005515) is too general and

      This is a second IPI annotation for protein binding with CipA (Q06851), based on
      PMID:17360613 which demonstrated the dual binding mode of dockerin modules to cohesins.
      The study showed that the internal sequence duplication within the dockerin allows
      it to bind cohesins in two orientations. As with the previous annotation, protein
      binding is too general; GO:1990311 (type-I cohesin domain binding) is more appropriate.

      XynY contains a C-terminal esterase domain classified as CE1 (carbohydrate esterase family 1)
