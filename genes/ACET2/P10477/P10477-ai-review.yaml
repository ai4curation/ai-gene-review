description: >
  CelE (CtCel5C-CE2) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in plant cell wall degradation.
  It contains an N-terminal GH5 cellulase domain (CtCel5C), a central type I dockerin module
  for cellulosome integration, and a C-terminal CE2 esterase domain (CtCE2). The GH5 domain
  displays endo-1,4-beta-glucanase activity against cellulose, beta-glucan, and CMC. The CE2 domain
  exhibits both acetylxylan esterase and glucomannan deacetylase activities, with strong preference
  for glucomannan. Uniquely, the CE2 domain also functions as a cellulose-binding module through
  its catalytic site region, potentiating the cellulase activity of the appended GH5 domain on
  recalcitrant substrates.

      CelE functions in the catabolism of multiple polysaccharides including cellulose, xylan,

      breakdown, though more specific terms (cellulose catabolic process, xylan catabolic process,

      The N-terminal GH5 domain (CtCel5C) catalyzes endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic
      linkages in cellulose, with demonstrated activity against CMC and barley beta-glucan
      (PMID:3066698, PMID:1991028).

      The C-terminal CE2 domain catalyzes deacetylation of acetylated polysaccharides,
      with strong preference for glucomannan (KM 0.019 mM) over xylan (KM 2.7 mM).
      This activity removes protective acetyl groups to expose substrates for attack
      by other enzymes (PMID:19338387).

      Uniquely among CE2 family members, the CtCE2 domain binds cellulose through its
      active site region (KD 33 uM for cellohexaose). This binding potentiates the
      cellulase activity of the appended GH5 domain on recalcitrant substrates (PMID:19338387).

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the relative contribution of the cellulase vs esterase activities to plant cell wall degradation?
  - question: Does the cellulose-binding function of the CE2 domain have regulatory significance beyond substrate targeting?
  - question: Are there other CE2 family members that have gained cellulose-binding function through similar mechanisms?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: Quantify the enhancement of cellulase activity on natural plant cell wall substrates when CtCE2 cellulose binding is intact vs abolished
    hypothesis: The cellulose-binding function of CtCE2 significantly enhances cellulase activity on crystalline cellulose
  - description: Determine whether CtCE2 cellulose binding affects cellulosome assembly or localization
    hypothesis: Cellulose binding by CtCE2 may help anchor the cellulosome to its substrate
  - description: Characterize the deacetylation activity on native plant cell wall polysaccharides from different plant sources
    hypothesis: The preference for glucomannan may reflect the substrate composition of natural plant cell walls
