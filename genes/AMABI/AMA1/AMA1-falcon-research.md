Below is the comprehensive research report for the AMA1 gene (UniProt ID A8W7M4) from Amanita bisporigera, with detailed discussion on its function, localization, biological roles, structural features, expression regulation, evolutionary conservation, and key experimental evidence—all of which serve as critical basis for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation curation.

1. Introduction  
The Amanita bisporigera gene AMA1 encodes the alpha‑amanitin proprotein, a central precursor in the biosynthesis of amatoxins—a group of bicyclic octapeptide toxins that function by binding non‑competitively to RNA polymerase II and significantly slowing transcription elongation. Because amatoxins are among the most potent inhibitors of eukaryotic transcription, understanding AMA1 is of both fundamental and practical importance. This report integrates molecular genetics, biochemical mechanisms, cellular localization studies, regulation analyses, and evolutionary investigations to elucidate the role of AMA1 in toxin biosynthesis and its subsequent relevance in defense and disease phenotypes (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1).

2. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
AMA1 is a member of the MSDIN gene family and is responsible for encoding a short, 35‑residue precursor peptide that ultimately gives rise to the mature toxin alpha‑amanitin. The precursor is modular in design, consisting of a 10‑amino acid N‑terminal leader sequence, an 8‑amino acid core region (with a highly conserved toxin motif, IWGIGCNP), and a 17‑amino acid follower sequence (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24). The leader and follower regions, although removed during processing, serve as vital recognition elements for the post‑translational modification machinery (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4).  

After translation, the AMA1 precursor peptide undergoes extensive post‑translational modifications. Initially, specific proteolytic cleavages remove the flanking leader and follower sequences. This step is critical because these regions, although not present in the mature toxin, are essential for ensuring proper folding and for the recognition by processing enzymes (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1). Following cleavage, the core toxin region is macrocyclized to form a cyclic peptide. This cyclization is catalyzed by the specialized enzyme prolyl oligopeptidase B (POPB), which recognizes conserved proline residues bordering the core toxin region. POPB executes a two‑step process consisting of an initial hydrolytic cleavage to release an intermediate peptide followed by a transpeptidation reaction that covalently joins the termini to form the bicyclic structure (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 110-113, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 7-9, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 117-119).

In the mature alpha‑amanitin toxin, a unique tryptathionine cross‑bridge is formed between a tryptophan and a cysteine residue. This critical modification imparts outstanding chemical stability and resistance to both thermal and proteolytic degradation, ensuring that even minute quantities of the toxin remain bioactive. At the molecular level, the cyclic toxin exerts its lethal effect by binding to RNA polymerase II, thereby interfering with the enzyme’s ability to synthesize mRNA. By blocking transcription elongation, alpha‑amanitin ultimately disrupts cellular protein synthesis and leads to cell death (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 41-46). Overall, the efficiency and precision of the post‑translational modifications exemplify a finely tuned biosynthetic pathway in which each processing step is critical for generating one of nature’s most potent toxins (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 5-6).

Detailed biochemical investigations have shown that the AMA1 precursor is initially produced as a linear polypeptide. The leader and follower sequences, though not incorporated into the mature product, are indispensable for proper substrate recognition and effective modification by POPB (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4). The macrocyclization reaction catalyzed by POPB locks the core into a rigid conformation; this rigidity is essential not only for stability but also for high‑affinity binding to RNA polymerase II (walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 7-9, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 117-119). In certain studies, additional modifications—including hydroxylation steps possibly mediated by flavoprotein monooxygenases—have been implicated in fine‑tuning the chemical properties of the mature toxin, although these steps remain under investigation (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 46-48, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 119-122).

3. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
Expression analyses indicate that AMA1 is highly active in the fruiting body of Amanita bisporigera, with transcript levels peaking in strategic tissues such as the pileus (cap) and stipe (stem). qRT-PCR data document distinct spatial and temporal patterns during mushroom development, with maximal expression corresponding to periods of rapid tissue expansion and maturation (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2). Such regulation suggests that toxin production is developmentally coordinated to match periods when the fruitbody is most exposed to predation and environmental threats.

At the subcellular level, the AMA1 precursor is synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Following its synthesis, the precursor is believed to enter specialized intracellular compartments—potentially vesicles or vacuole‑like structures—where it undergoes post‑translational modification. Immunolocalization studies employing anti‑amanitin antibodies have demonstrated that the mature toxin is not evenly distributed throughout the cells but is compartmentalized within specific regions of the basidiocarp, such as the hymenial cells of the gills (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 2-3, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 3-4). Moreover, the colocalization of POPB with amanitin within these compartments supports the model that both synthesis and processing of the toxin occur in defined intracellular locales (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 6-8, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 8-9). This compartmentalization is likely essential both for the efficient maturation of the toxin and for protecting the fungal cell from its own potent secondary metabolite (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 107-110, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4).

Further studies reveal that AMA1 expression is not globally uniform but is concentrated in tissues where defense is most critical. For example, the pileus and the hymenium, which are directly exposed to the environment and potential fungivores, display a markedly higher accumulation of alpha‑amanitin. In these regions, toxins may be stored in vesicular structures that facilitate rapid release in response to external challenges (li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 2-3). Such precise intracellular targeting is a hallmark of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in fungi and underscores the sophisticated regulatory networks that control toxin production (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 8-9, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 9-10).

4. Biological Processes Involvement  
AMA1 is integrally involved in the biosynthesis of amatoxins—a canonical example of fungal secondary metabolism. The gene’s role is embedded within a complex biochemical network that not only produces cyclic peptide toxins but also ensures that these potent compounds are synthesized in response to ecological pressures. In Amanita bisporigera, the production of alpha‑amanitin is tightly linked with fruitbody development; transcript levels of AMA1 peak during the early elongation and mid‑development stages of the mushroom, suggesting that toxin production is synchronized with the growth and differentiation of critical tissues (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2).  

The biological process of amatoxin biosynthesis involves coordinated transcriptional activation of AMA1, translation of its precursor peptide, and subsequent enzymatic processing by POPB and possibly other modifying enzymes. In addition to providing chemical defense against predators and microbial competitors, the production of alpha‑amanitin may function in intraspecies signaling and in the regulation of developmental events within the fungus (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2). Because these processes occur as part of the secondary metabolic pathways in Amanita bisporigera, AMA1 is appropriately annotated under GO terms related to "secondary metabolite biosynthetic process" as well as "peptidyl‑posttranslational modification" (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 5-6).

From an ecological perspective, the robust production of alpha‑amanitin confers a significant selective advantage by deterring consumption by insects and other fungivores. This chemical defense is particularly crucial given the slow growth rate and vulnerability of the mushroom fruitbody. Thus, AMA1’s activity is not only central to toxin biosynthesis but also plays a direct role in mediating ecological interactions and promoting fungal survival in competitive environments (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2).

5. Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Although AMA1 functions in the wild as a defense mechanism in Amanita bisporigera, the mature toxin produced—alpha‑amanitin—is of profound clinical significance in humans. Upon accidental or intentional ingestion of amatoxin‑producing mushrooms, victims are exposed to a toxin that exerts its detrimental effects by inhibiting RNA polymerase II. This inhibition disrupts mRNA synthesis, leading to rapid and extensive cellular damage, particularly in hepatocytes, which explains the hallmark clinical presentation of amatoxin poisoning: initial gastrointestinal distress, a latent phase, and later fulminant liver failure (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 46-48).

It is important to note that while AMA1 itself is not pathogenic, its product is directly responsible for the lethal phenotype observed in mushroom poisoning cases. The extremely high potency of alpha‑amanitin means that even minute quantities can result in fatal outcomes. Clinical and toxicological studies have documented how amatoxin poisoning leads to multi‑organ failure, and such findings underscore the need for accurate functional annotation—in this case, associating AMA1 with "toxin biosynthetic process" and "RNA polymerase II inhibitor activity" in the GO framework (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 76-78). The severe disease outcomes tied to amatoxin exposure have also motivated research into detection, decontamination, and therapeutic intervention strategies, further highlighting the broader relevance of understanding AMA1 function beyond basic fungal biology (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 19-22).

6. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The AMA1 gene product is best understood as a precursor peptide whose structure is defined by a short, modular architecture. The precursor comprises three regions: an N‑terminal leader peptide of approximately 10 amino acids, a central core region of 8 amino acids, and a C‑terminal follower peptide of roughly 17 amino acids (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24). The leader peptide likely facilitates recognition by the processing enzyme POPB, and its short length and specific amino acid composition are conserved among toxin‑producing strains (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4).  

The core peptide contains the nearly invariant motif IWGIGCNP, which is crucial for the formation of the mature toxin’s bicyclic structure. Within this motif, the cysteine residue is particularly important as it participates in creating the tryptathionine bridge—a unique covalent bond between tryptophan and cysteine that defines the chemical rigidity and stability of alpha‑amanitin (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 7-9). The follower peptide is thought to influence the conformation of the precursor and enhance the efficiency of processing by ensuring that the core sequence is presented in the optimal orientation for enzymatic cleavage and cyclization (walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 107-110).

While the AMA1 precursor does not possess large, globular domains typical of many enzymes, its short conserved motifs are critical for its function and are the subject of intense study using bioinformatics and comparative sequence analysis. These domains are hallmarks of RiPP precursor peptides and provide a molecular signature that is used to annotate and classify AMA1 within the broader group of cyclic peptide toxins (walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2).

7. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Transcriptional regulation of AMA1 is dynamic and tightly controlled during the developmental cycle of Amanita bisporigera. Expression studies using qRT-PCR have shown that AMA1 transcripts are most abundant during early to mid‑developmental stages of the fruiting body, particularly during periods of rapid tissue elongation (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2). This expression pattern is not uniform; rather, transcripts are more highly concentrated in tissues that are directly exposed to environmental stressors, such as the pileus and lamellae, where robust chemical defense is most advantageous (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2).

Standardization of expression data using validated reference genes—for instance, β‑actin and NADH dehydrogenase—has confirmed that the observed fluctuations in AMA1 transcript levels are statistically significant and correlate with distinct developmental phases. The decline in transcript levels observed during the late maturation and wilting phases likely reflects a strategic downregulation of toxin biosynthesis once the primary phase of defense is over, possibly to conserve energy or prevent self‑toxicity (li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, li2014molecularcloningof pages 2-4).

Moreover, the differential expression of AMA1 suggests the existence of sophisticated upstream regulatory elements that may respond to both internal developmental cues and external environmental signals, such as nutrient availability or the presence of predators. Such regulatory mechanisms ensure that toxin production is deployed precisely when and where it is most needed, aligning the biosynthetic output with the physiological demands of the mushroom (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2).

8. Evolutionary Conservation  
Comparative studies have underscored the evolutionary conservation of AMA1 among toxin‑producing Amanita species. Sequence alignments demonstrate that the critical leader, core, and follower regions of AMA1 are highly conserved across diverse isolates, reinforcing the notion that these segments are under strong purifying selection due to their essential role in producing a potent toxin (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 104-107). The conservation of the core motif IWGIGCNP is particularly striking, as it is preserved in Amanita bisporigera as well as in related genera such as Galerina and Lepiota, though some divergence is noted in non‑toxin–producing species (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 46-48).

Within Amanita, the AMA1 gene is a representative member of the MSDIN gene family—a multigene family that has undergone expansion through gene duplication and subsequent diversification. The diversification of this family is thought to be driven by the need to produce a repertoire of cyclic peptide toxins that can defend against a wide range of predators and competitors, while the core functional motif remains conserved to maintain the critical inhibitory activity against RNA polymerase II (walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 2-3). Additionally, the observation of conserved intron‑exon boundaries in AMA1 among related species further indicates an ancestral origin and long‑term stability of the gene structure, with horizontal gene transfer events potentially contributing to the spread of toxin biosynthetic capabilities among distantly related fungal taxa (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 101-104, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 6-8).

These evolutionary insights not only affirm the fundamental role of AMA1 in the biosynthesis of amatoxins but also provide a robust framework for annotating the gene as “evolutionarily conserved” within GO, reflecting its critical function in the survival strategies of toxin‑producing mushrooms (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 224-227).

9. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature Overview  
A broad range of experimental approaches has been employed to characterize AMA1 and its role in amatoxin biosynthesis. Initial molecular cloning studies successfully isolated the full-length AMA1 cDNA from Amanita bisporigera, revealing a 35‑residue precursor peptide with the expected leader, core, and follower organization (li2014molecularcloningof pages 2-4, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4). Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed the presence of conserved motifs that are crucial for processing. These findings were further substantiated by RACE-PCR methods and sequencing efforts that provided robust methodological support for AMA1’s structure (li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, li2014molecularcloningof pages 2-4).

Functional assays have played an essential role in establishing the biosynthetic pathway. Recombinant expression experiments, in which the AMA1 precursor was incubated with the candidate enzyme POPB, demonstrated that the precursor can be efficiently processed into a cyclic peptide bearing the hallmark features of alpha‑amanitin (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 110-113, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 7-9). Structural studies, particularly those using X‑ray crystallography of POPB in complex with substrate analogs, have elucidated key aspects of the enzymatic mechanism. These studies have identified critical residues and conformational changes necessary for both proteolytic cleavage and macrocyclization, providing molecular-level insights into how the AMA1 precursor is converted into its active toxin form (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 117-119, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 119-122).

Additionally, quantitative gene expression studies using qRT-PCR have mapped the temporal and spatial distribution of AMA1 transcripts in fruiting bodies, correlating high transcript levels with developmental stages where toxin production is most pronounced (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2). Complementary biochemical assays—including HPLC and mass spectrometry—have confirmed the presence of alpha‑amanitin in tissues with high AMA1 expression, thereby linking gene expression directly to toxin accumulation (li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 78-80).

Immunolocalization techniques further contribute to the overall picture by showing that both the AMA1 precursor (and by extension, its processed product, alpha‑amanitin) and the processing enzyme POPB are confined within defined subcellular compartments. Confocal microscopy has revealed that these molecules are primarily localized in specific cell types within the basidiocarp, particularly in the hymenium and lamellae, where they likely function in chemical defense (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 2-3, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 3-4, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 6-8). Such data have been critical for verifying cellular localization and providing functional context to the gene’s activity.

Finally, comparative and phylogenetic analyses across toxin‑producing fungi have demonstrated the conserved nature of AMA1 and its placement within the broader MSDIN gene family. Sequence alignments, conservation of intron‑exon boundaries, and the detection of homologous sequences in genera such as Galerina and Lepiota provide compelling evidence for an evolutionary lineage dedicated to cyclic peptide biosynthesis (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 101-104, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24). Taken together, these multiple lines of investigation offer comprehensive support for the current functional annotation of AMA1 and highlight its pivotal role in amatoxin biosynthesis (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1).

10. Integration with Systems Biology and Biotechnological Perspectives  
From a systems biology perspective, AMA1 is a critical node within a complex gene network that governs secondary metabolism, developmental regulation, and chemical defense in Amanita bisporigera. Transcriptomics and proteomics data indicate that AMA1 co‑operates with other genes involved in peptide processing, transport, and storage to form a coordinated pathway that ensures effective toxin production during critical developmental stages (li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6). Systems‑level analyses have also underscored the role of environmental inputs—such as nutrient availability and predation pressure—in modulating AMA1 expression, further linking toxin biosynthesis to adaptive ecological responses.

From a biotechnology standpoint, the unique properties of alpha‑amanitin—its high potency and structural stability—have spurred interest in its potential therapeutic applications, including its use as a payload in antibody‑drug conjugates for targeted cancer treatments. In this context, a deep understanding of the AMA1 biosynthetic pathway is invaluable for efforts aimed at heterologous production or synthetic biology approaches that seek to replicate or modify this pathway for controlled drug delivery (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 224-227). The precise regulatory elements and efficient enzymatic processing observed in the AMA1 system serve as a model for designing robust production systems in industrial biotechnology.

11. Challenges and Future Research Directions  
Despite substantial progress, several challenges remain in fully elucidating the AMA1 system. One key area is the detailed mechanistic analysis of the interaction between the AMA1 precursor and its processing enzyme POPB. Although structural studies have provided initial insights, further work employing site‑directed mutagenesis, advanced kinetics, and high‑resolution imaging will be necessary to pinpoint the molecular determinants of substrate recognition and catalysis (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 117-119, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 119-122).

Moreover, the regulatory networks governing AMA1 transcription and its developmental modulation are not yet completely understood. Future studies aimed at characterizing the promoter regions, transcription factor binding sites, and epigenetic modifications associated with AMA1 will be essential for a complete picture of its regulation (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2). Expanding comparative genomic analyses to include non‑toxin–producing Amanita species and related fungal taxa could shed light on the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the diversification of the MSDIN gene family and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying horizontal gene transfer events (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 101-104, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 6-8).

Furthermore, integration of proteomic and metabolomic data with transcriptomic profiles will help to build a comprehensive model of the secondary metabolic network in Amanita bisporigera, clearly delineating the roles of AMA1 and its associated enzymes in toxin biosynthesis and storage. Such holistic approaches are likely to reveal new regulatory or processing factors that may serve as targets for biotechnological manipulation or therapeutic intervention (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1).

12. Implications for Gene Ontology Annotation  
The extensive experimental evidence and multifaceted analyses discussed above collectively support the functional annotation of AMA1 under several GO categories. Under molecular function, AMA1 can be annotated as a “ribosomally synthesized peptide precursor” involved in “cyclic peptide biosynthetic process” as well as indirectly under “RNA polymerase II inhibitor activity” due to the activity of its processed product, alpha‑amanitin (walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 46-48). For biological process, AMA1 belongs to the “secondary metabolite biosynthetic process” and “peptidyl‑posttranslational modification” categories, reflecting its role in a highly regulated biochemical pathway tied to defense and developmental regulation (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1). In terms of cellular component, the expression and immunolocalization data justify annotations such as “cytoplasm” and “vesicle” or “vacuole,” where the toxin biosynthesis and processing machinery is compartmentalized (luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 2-3, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 3-4). Finally, the evolutionary conservation and critical nature of AMA1 in the ecology of toxin‑producing Amanita species warrant its classification as an “evolutionarily conserved peptide” within fungal secondary metabolism (luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 101-104).

13. Conclusion  
In summary, the AMA1 gene of Amanita bisporigera (UniProt ID A8W7M4) encodes the alpha‑amanitin proprotein—a short, ribosomally synthesized precursor that undergoes a series of essential post‑translational modifications to produce a potent cyclic peptide toxin. The precursor’s modular structure (a 10‑residue leader, an 8‑residue core, and a 17‑residue follower) is highly conserved and ensures faithful processing by the dedicated prolyl oligopeptidase POPB. The mature alpha‑amanitin acts by binding RNA polymerase II and inhibiting transcription, which is responsible for the lethal outcomes seen in amatoxin poisoning. Expression of AMA1 is developmentally regulated and spatially restricted within the mushroom fruiting body, ensuring efficient toxin production where protection is most needed. Additionally, the conservation of AMA1 across toxin‑producing Amanita species and its inclusion in the MSDIN gene family underscore its evolutionary importance. Multiple lines of experimental evidence—including molecular cloning, qRT-PCR profiling, chromatographic toxin assays, structural analyses of processing enzymes, and immunolocalization studies—provide a robust foundation for the functional annotation of AMA1. These findings support its assignment to GO categories relating to peptide biosynthetic processes, post‑translational processing, RNA polymerase II inhibition, specific subcellular localization, and evolutionary conservation. The integration of these detailed molecular, cellular, biochemical, and evolutionary insights not only advances our understanding of fungal toxin biosynthesis but also offers a model for the annotation of other RiPP pathways, with implications for ecological defense strategies, clinical toxinology, and biotechnological applications (li2014molecularcloningof pages 4-6, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-1, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 1-2, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 5-6, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 1-4, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 21-24, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 7-9, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 104-107, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 107-110, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 110-113, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 145-149, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 224-227, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 46-48, li2014molecularcloningof pages 1-2, li2014molecularcloningof pages 2-4, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 1-2, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 2-3, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 3-4, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 6-8, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 8-9, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 9-10, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 2-3, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 3-4, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 4-5, mitchell2014themechanismsunderlying pages 7-9, mitchell2015themechanismsof pages 51-56, vogt2019discoveryofnovel pages 13-15, vogt2019discoveryofnovel pages 18-21, vogt2019discoveryofnovel pages 23-23, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 16-19, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 36-38, walton2018biosynthesisofthe pages 4-7, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 101-104, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 117-119, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 119-122, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 124-128, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 142-145, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 163-164, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 164-164, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 164-169, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 190-193, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 198-201, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 201-204, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 245-247, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 30-32, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 41-46, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 66-68, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 78-80, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 85-88, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 93-96, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 10-10, luo2010colocalizationofamanitin pages 4-6, luo2012ribosomalbiosynthesisof pages 7-7, mitchell2014themechanismsunderlying pages 6-7, mitchell2015themechanismsof pages 69-74, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 161-163, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 19-22, walton2018thecyclicpeptide pages 76-78).
