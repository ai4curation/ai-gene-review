description: AMA1 encodes the alpha-amanitin proprotein, a 35-residue precursor peptide that is the primary substrate for biosynthesis of one of nature's most deadly toxins. This MSDIN family gene produces a modular peptide with N-terminal leader (10 aa), core toxin (8 aa containing conserved IWGIGCNP motif), and C-terminal follower (17 aa) regions. Following ribosomal synthesis, the precursor undergoes extensive post-translational modifications including proteolytic cleavage by prolyl oligopeptidase B (POPB), macrocyclization, and formation of a unique tryptathionine cross-bridge. The mature bicyclic octapeptide alpha-amanitin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, drastically slowing transcription elongation and causing fatal hepatotoxicity in humans upon mushroom ingestion.

  review:
    summary: Alpha-amanitin toxin derived from AMA1 functions in the extracellular region where it serves as a defense mechanism. The mature toxin is present in mushroom tissue and exerts its lethal effects when consumed by organisms, requiring extracellular localization to function as an anti-herbivory deterrent
    action: NEW
    reason: Extracellular localization is essential for AMA1-derived alpha-amanitin to function as a defensive toxin. The mature bicyclic peptide must be present in extracellular spaces (mushroom tissue) to be effective against consuming organisms that ingest the fungus, causing RNA polymerase II inhibition and hepatotoxicity
