  label: Daphnia pulex
description: >-
  DpuGr29 is a gustatory receptor (GR) from the water flea Daphnia pulex,
  belonging to the 7TM chemoreceptor superfamily. Unlike classical GPCRs, GRs
  function as ligand-gated ion channels with inverted membrane topology (C-terminus
  extracellular). D. pulex has 58 GRs but notably lacks odorant receptors (ORs),
  making GRs (along with ionotropic receptors) the primary chemosensory receptors
  in this crustacean. DpuGr29 belongs to subfamily 1 (Grs1-29 and Grs47-54) and is
  predicted to function in contact chemosensation in antennular or feeding appendage
  neurons. No direct experimental characterization of DpuGr29 ligand specificity or
  cellular expression has been published.

    label: male courtship behavior
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is inferred from Drosophila Gr32a and Gr33a, which are involved
      in male courtship behavior by detecting inhibitory pheromones that suppress
      male-male courtship. However, D. pulex reproduces primarily by cyclical
      parthenogenesis, with males appearing only under stress conditions. The
      annotation of male courtship behavior to a crustacean GR based on Drosophila
      genes involved in insect-specific courtship rituals (wing extension, licking,
      copulation attempts) is not phylogenetically appropriate.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Male courtship behavior as defined in GO (GO:0008049) specifically describes
      "behavior of a male for the purpose of attracting a sexual partner" with
      Drosophila melanogaster cited as the example organism. The behavior involves
      insect-specific courtship rituals including wing extension and vibration.
      While Drosophila Gr32a and Gr33a function in detecting pheromones that modulate
      courtship, Daphnia pulex is a crustacean that reproduces primarily through
      parthenogenesis, with males being facultative. There is no evidence that
      crustacean GRs play any role in courtship behavior. The phylogenetic inference
      across such divergent arthropod lineages (insects vs. branchiopod crustaceans)
      for a highly species-specific behavioral process is not justified.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from Drosophila GR genes
      that function in chemosensory behavior. Given that GRs are chemoreceptors that
      detect chemical stimuli and trigger behavioral responses, this annotation is
      appropriate for DpuGr29. Daphnia relies heavily on chemosensory detection for
      predator avoidance, food finding, and environmental sensing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Chemosensory behavior (GO:0007635) is defined as "behavior that is dependent
      upon the sensation of chemicals." GRs are established chemoreceptors across
      arthropods. Daphnia pulex has an expanded GR repertoire (58 genes) and relies
      heavily on chemosensory detection for predator avoidance (kairomone detection),
      food finding, and environmental sensing. The phylogenetic inference from
      Drosophila GRs to Daphnia GRs for this general chemosensory function is
      well-supported, as the fundamental role of GRs as chemoreceptors mediating
      behavioral responses is conserved across arthropods.

    summary: >-
      This cellular component annotation is inferred from Drosophila Gr32a and Gr33a
      expression in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) which have axons projecting
      to the brain. While crustacean chemosensory neurons also have axonal projections,
      there is no direct evidence for DpuGr29 localization to axons specifically.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from Drosophila GRN expression
      patterns. Crustacean chemosensory neurons are expected to have similar morphology
      with axonal projections to central ganglia. However, there is no direct evidence
      for DpuGr29 expression pattern or subcellular localization in Daphnia. The
      inference is plausible but unverified. Without expression data showing DpuGr29
      in neurons with axons, this remains speculative.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is inferred from Drosophila GR expression in gustatory receptor
      neurons, where GRs localize to dendrites that contact tastant molecules. GRs
      in chemosensory neurons are expected to localize to dendritic membranes where
      ligand detection occurs, but direct evidence for DpuGr29 is lacking.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The annotation is phylogenetically inferred from Drosophila GRN morphology.
      Chemoreceptors typically localize to dendritic/ciliary membranes of sensory
      neurons where they contact chemical stimuli. However, there is no published
      expression or localization data for DpuGr29 in Daphnia. The inference is
      reasonable based on general GR biology but remains unverified for this
      specific gene.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is inferred from Drosophila GR expression in gustatory receptor
      neurons. GRs are expressed in neurons, so presence in the neuronal cell body
      (soma) is expected for protein synthesis/trafficking, though the functional
      site is typically dendrites/cilia.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The annotation indicates DpuGr29 is active in neuronal cell bodies, inferred
      from Drosophila GRN expression patterns. While GRs are neuronally expressed
      proteins and would be present in cell bodies, this is less informative than
      dendritic localization which represents the functional site. No direct
      expression data exists for DpuGr29 in Daphnia neurons.

      This annotation is based on UniProt subcellular location prediction indicating

      GRs are established 7-transmembrane receptors that localize to the plasma
      membrane. The UniProt entry shows 8 predicted transmembrane helices consistent
      with the 7TM chemoreceptor superfamily. Plasma membrane localization is
      essential for chemoreceptor function in detecting external chemical stimuli.

      (membrane) is a more general term than GO:0005886 (plasma membrane), both

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on InterPro domain IPR013604 (7TM_chemorcpt) mapping
      to taste perception. For aquatic organisms like Daphnia, the distinction
      between taste (contact chemosensation) and smell (olfaction/distant
      chemosensation) is less clear than in terrestrial organisms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term GO:0050909 (sensory perception of taste) implies terrestrial-style
      gustation, but Daphnia lives in aquatic environments where chemicals are
      detected in solution. The distinction between taste and smell in aquatic
      organisms is blurred. A more appropriate annotation would be GO:0007606
      (sensory perception of chemical stimulus), which is the parent term that
      encompasses both taste and smell without implying a specific modality. Given
      no direct evidence for DpuGr29 ligands or expression site, we cannot determine
      if this gene functions in contact chemosensation vs. distant chemosensation.
