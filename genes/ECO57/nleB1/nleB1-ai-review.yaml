description: >-
  NleB1 (Non-LEE-encoded type III effector B1) is a protein-arginine N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
  that is secreted by the type III secretion system (T3SS) into host cells during EHEC infection.
  The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to the guanidino
  nitrogen of arginine residues on host target proteins, primarily death domain-containing proteins
  such as FADD (Arg117), TRADD (Arg235), and RIPK1 (Arg603). This unusual post-translational modification
  disrupts homotypic and heterotypic death domain interactions required for death receptor signaling
  complex assembly, thereby inhibiting TNF/TRAIL/Fas-mediated apoptosis, necroptosis, and NF-kappaB
  activation. NleB1 also glycosylates GAPDH at Arg197/Arg200, preventing GAPDH-TRAF2 interaction.
  The enzyme requires Mn2+ as a cofactor and contains a GT-A fold with a characteristic DXD motif
  and HEN catalytic triad. NleB1 undergoes auto-GlcNAcylation which is required for activity toward
  death domain-containing substrates. Importantly, NleB1 is a signaling modulator/effector that
  manipulates host cell processes rather than a classical toxin that directly kills cells
  (nleB1-deep-research-falcon.md).

    summary: >-
      NleB1 is secreted via the type III secretion system into the extracellular milieu
      and then translocated directly into host cells. The annotation reflects that the
      protein leaves the bacterial cytoplasm and enters the extracellular space
      transiently before entering host cells (PMID:30619781, PMID:28522607).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is correct as NleB1 is a T3SS effector that is secreted from the
      bacterium. UniProt confirms the subcellular location as "Secreted" with subsequent
      translocation to "Host cytoplasm" via T3SS. The IEA annotation based on UniProt
      subcellular location vocabulary mapping is appropriate.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from the UniProt keyword "Toxin" (KW-0800) mapping to GO.
      However, the GO definition of toxin activity requires "Interacting selectively with
      one or more biological molecules in another (target) organism, initiating pathogenesis
      (leading to an abnormal, generally detrimental state)." While NleB1 is a virulence
      factor, it is fundamentally different from classical toxins. NleB1 is a signaling
      modulator that manipulates host cell processes by enzymatically modifying host
      proteins - it does NOT directly kill or damage cells like true toxins (e.g., Shiga
      toxin which inhibits protein synthesis, hemolysin which lyses cells by pore formation).
      NleB1 actually INHIBITS cell death (apoptosis, necroptosis) rather than causing it
      (nleB1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear case of SPKW over-annotation. The UniProt keyword "Toxin" is
      applied broadly to bacterial virulence factors, but the GO term "toxin activity"
      has a specific definition that does not fit NleB1. Key distinctions:
      1) True toxins (Shiga toxin, diphtheria toxin, hemolysins) directly damage/kill cells
      2) NleB1 is a T3SS effector that MODULATES host signaling without direct cytotoxicity
      3) NleB1 actually SUPPRESSES host cell death pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis)
      4) The mechanism is enzymatic modification of host proteins to subvert signaling,
         not direct cellular damage
      5) PMID:30619781 explicitly notes that inhibitors of NleB1 "were not significantly
         toxic to mammalian cells" and did not cause "significant macrophage death"
      The appropriate GO terms for NleB1's function are process terms like
      GO:0052041 (symbiont-mediated suppression of host programmed cell death),

        supporting_text: "The kinetic parameters of NleB1 (150 nM at 30°C) were calculated as follows: Vmax: 2,975.3 ± 125 RLU/min/μg protein; Km: 379 ± 43 μM; Kcat (s-1): 50, Kcat/Km (s-1, M-1): 130,703.4"

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Should UniProt keyword "Toxin" be applied to T3SS effectors that modulate host signaling
      without direct cytotoxic activity? The current mapping leads to inappropriate GO annotations.
  - question: >-
      What is the relative importance of different NleB1 substrates (FADD, TRADD, RIPK1, GAPDH)
      for virulence during natural infection?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Comparative analysis of NleB1 activity on different death domain proteins to establish
      substrate hierarchy and physiological relevance during infection.
    hypothesis: FADD may be the primary physiological target based on structural and kinetic data
  - description: >-
      Structural characterization of NleB1-substrate complexes to understand substrate recognition
      and guide inhibitor development.
    hypothesis: Substrate recognition involves specific interactions with death domain fold
