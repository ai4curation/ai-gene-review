description: 'Shiga toxin 2A subunit (Stx2A) is the catalytic A chain of the AB5
  Shiga toxin holotoxin produced by EHEC O157:H7. It is an rRNA N-glycosylase
  (EC 3.2.2.22) that depurinates a specific adenine in the sarcin-ricin loop of
  28S rRNA, thereby inactivating ribosomes and halting protein synthesis. This
  ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) activity leads to cell death and is the
  primary mechanism by which Shiga toxin causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
  Stx2A represents a TRUE TOXIN with direct cytotoxic activity, in contrast to
  type III effectors like NleB1 that modulate signaling without direct cytotoxicity.'

    label: modulation of process of another organism
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: Correct but overly broad. Stx2A modulates host translation by inactivating
      ribosomes, which falls under this term. The more specific terms (rRNA N-glycosylase,
      negative regulation of translation) are more informative.

    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Correct parent term. rRNA N-glycosylases hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond
      between adenine and ribose in rRNA. This is appropriately captured by the more
      specific child term GO:0030598.

    label: negative regulation of translation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Correct and core biological process. Stx2A inhibits translation by
      depurinating the sarcin-ricin loop of 28S rRNA, blocking elongation factor-dependent
      GTPase activity and halting ribosome function. This is the mechanism of toxicity.

    label: rRNA N-glycosylase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Core molecular function. Stx2A is an rRNA N-glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.22)
      that removes adenine A4324 from the sarcin-ricin loop of 28S rRNA. This is
      the defining enzymatic activity of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs).
      Cryo-EM (2023) and X-ray structures (2024) confirm the mechanism and P-stalk
      recruitment interface.

    label: toxin activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: LEGITIMATE toxin annotation. Unlike type III effectors (e.g., NleB1)
      that modulate signaling, Stx2A is a TRUE TOXIN with direct cytotoxic activity.
      It inactivates ribosomes, halts protein synthesis, and causes cell death.
      This is the defining virulence factor of EHEC O157:H7 and causes hemolytic
      uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. The GO definition of toxin activity requiring
      initiating pathogenesis leading to an abnormal, generally detrimental state
      is clearly met by Stx2A.
    action: ACCEPT

    Stx2A is a TRUE TOXIN with direct cytotoxic activity. Unlike type III effectors
    that modulate signaling, Stx2A directly inactivates ribosomes, halts protein
    synthesis, and causes cell death. This is the defining virulence factor of
    EHEC O157:H7 and causes hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans.
