Title: Functional Annotation of Drosophila Git (CG16728; UniProt Q95RG8): ARF-GAP scaffolding with dPix–PAK at integrin-linked adhesions and emerging roles in Hippo signaling

Abstract
Git (CG16728) in Drosophila melanogaster encodes an ARF GTPase-activating protein that scaffolds with the Rho-family GEF dPix and the serine/threonine kinase PAK at focal-adhesion-like sites. In epithelia, the dPix–Git complex localizes basally and modulates myosin II to maintain tissue architecture; in developing muscles, integrin→Git→PAK signaling suppresses filopodia during muscle–tendon attachment. Recent work implicates a Vap33–RtGEF(dPix)–Git–Arf79F module in activating Hippo signaling and coordinating with V-ATPase-dependent endolysosomal control. This report synthesizes function, localization, pathway integration, and recent developments (with emphasis on 2023) with quantitative evidence and direct citations.

Identity verification and gene/protein context
- Gene/protein match: Git corresponds to Drosophila dGIT/CG16728 and functions as an ARF GTPase-activating protein that forms a conserved PIX(dPix)–GIT–PAK complex; Drosophila studies use endogenous tags and functional genetics to define Git’s role and targeting (via a paxillin-binding C-terminus) to basal focal-adhesion-like structures (May 22, 2019; PLOS Genetics) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 2-4, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 13-14).
- Organism: All experimental evidence cited is in Drosophila melanogaster (egg chamber epithelium, embryonic/larval tissues, developing muscles) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 8-10, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13).
- Domains/complex features supported in Drosophila literature: ARF-GAP family assignment; paxillin-binding domain (PBD) in Git’s C-terminus required for basal/focal targeting; recruitment of dPix and PAK into a functional module downstream of integrins (2018–2019 primary literature) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 13-14, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- ARF GTPase-activating protein (ARF-GAP): Proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis on ARF small GTPases to inactivate them. Git is an ARF-GAP that scaffolds with dPix (Rho-family GEF) and PAK to coordinate adhesion and cytoskeletal signaling in vivo (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 2-4, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 27-28, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17).
- PIX–GIT–PAK module: A conserved adhesion-localized complex. In Drosophila epithelia, Git targets the complex basally via a paxillin-binding domain, and dPix recruits/activates PAK to temper myosin II contractility and preserve epithelial organization (PLOS Genetics, 2019; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008083) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 6-8, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 2-4, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17).
- Integrin-linked adhesion signaling: In developing muscles, integrin signaling relies on Git to recruit PAK; Git/PAK act downstream of integrins to suppress filopodia as myotubes establish tendon attachment (Journal of Cell Science, Aug 2018; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.217133) (richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 8-11).
- Hippo pathway connection: A 2023 preprint identifies Vap33–RtGEF(dPix)–Git–Arf79F interactions that stimulate Hippo signaling, with genetic evidence placing Git in a module that counteracts Arf79F (ARF1 ortholog) and coordinates with V-ATPase-driven vesicle acidification (bioRxiv, July 10, 2023; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.10.548302) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 1-4, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 25-28).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Hippo activation via Vap33–RtGEF–Git–Arf79F: AP-MS in embryos showed Vap33 binds RtGEF (dPix) and Git as high-confidence interactors; co-IPs confirm Vap33–RtGEF and Vap33–Hpo associations; in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs) detect Git–Vap33, Git–Arf79F, Arf79F–Hpo proximity in larval epithelia. Functionally, Vap33 overexpression rescues elevated Diap1 in RtGEF mutant clones; Git RNAi rescues reduced Diap1 in Vha68-2 (V-ATPase) mutants; Arf79F knockdown rescues lgl mutant Hippo defects. Model: Lgl/Vap33 promote RtGEF/Git to restrain Arf79F, thereby activating Hpo (bioRxiv, 2023; URL above; posted July 10, 2023) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 1-4, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 25-28).
- Pathway crosstalk with V-ATPase: V-ATPase activity negatively regulates Hippo signaling (reduced Yki nuclear export/target repression). Vap33 activates Hippo and counteracts V-ATPase; Git genetically modifies Hippo output in the V-ATPase mutant context (bioRxiv, 2023) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 4-8, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 21-25).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Epithelial morphogenesis assays: Endogenous tagging of dpix and git, live/confocal imaging, and quantitative morphometrics/pMRLC staining in egg chambers provide a tractable system to interrogate adhesion–cytoskeletal control of tissue architecture and myosin regulation in vivo (PLOS Genetics, 2019) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 8-10, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 6-8, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13).
- Muscle–tendon attachment model: Quantitative time-lapse analysis of filopodial dynamics in LT myotubes under integrin, Git, and Pak perturbations offers a live model for adhesion-dependent protrusion control (J Cell Sci, 2018) (richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 8-11).
- Hippo signaling readouts: Eye-disc mosaic clone systems measuring Diap1 and ex-lacZ, combined with AP-MS/PLA, enable in vivo mapping of Git-centered complexes that tune growth signaling (bioRxiv, 2023) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 4-8, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 18-21).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Adhesion-scaffold perspective: Primary in vivo evidence supports Git as a paxillin-directed ARF-GAP scaffold that positions dPix and PAK at focal-adhesion-like domains to modulate actomyosin and morphogenesis; the necessity of Git’s C-terminal paxillin-binding domain for basal targeting underscores conserved adhesion logic (PLOS Genetics, 2019) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 13-14, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13).
- Signaling integration: 2018–2019 studies establish Git at the convergence of integrin adhesions, Rho-family signaling, and PAK-mediated actin regulation; 2023 extends this to growth control via Hippo, implicating ARF GTPases (Arf79F) and endolysosomal acidification (V-ATPase) in Git-centered control nodes (richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 1-4, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Epithelial myosin regulation (egg chamber): dpix or git loss increases phospho-MRLC (pMRLC) intensity at basal membranes by approximately two-fold and also elevates apical pMRLC (~1.5–2-fold), correlating with lateral junction collapse and multilayering; reducing RhoGEF2 dosage rescues egg production and morphology (PLOS Genetics, 2019; DOI above) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 8-10, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 6-8).
- Localization: Endogenous dpix-Venus and git-tRFP co-localize basally in polarized, filament-like patterns; deletion of Git’s paxillin-binding C-terminus abolishes basal enrichment, demonstrating the targeting mechanism (PLOS Genetics, 2019) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17).
- Muscle filopodia suppression: Integrin diβ gain-of-function prematurely suppresses filopodia at stage 15, but this suppression fails in Git or Pak maternal+zygotic mutants (quantified filopodia counts and lengths), placing Git/PAK downstream of integrins (J Cell Sci, Aug 2018; DOI above) (richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 8-11).
- Hippo pathway quantification: In eye discs, Vha68-2 knockdown reduces ex-lacZ (Yki target) and Yki levels; Vap33 overexpression reduces Diap1; Git RNAi rescues Diap1 reduction in Vha68-2 mutants; Arf79F RNAi or Sec71DN rescues elevated Diap1 in lgl mutants (bioRxiv, 2023) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 4-8, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 25-28).

Mechanistic function, pathways, and localization of Git
- Biochemical function and substrate inference: Git is an ARF-GAP; mammalian orthologs inactivate ARF1. In Drosophila, genetic and proximity data connect Git to Arf79F (ARF1 ortholog) and Hpo, supporting a model where Git restrains Arf79F to promote Hippo activation; this is bolstered by the observation that Arf79F knockdown reduces Diap1 and is epistatic to lgl (bioRxiv, 2023). While direct in vivo ARF-GAP catalytic assays for Drosophila Git substrates are not presented in these studies, the genetic and interaction data fit ARF1/Arf79F as the physiologic target class (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14).
- Adhesion and cytoskeletal control: In epithelia, dPix–Git localizes to basal, focal-adhesion-like structures and leading edges; Git’s paxillin-binding domain mediates targeting; the complex limits myosin II activity and ensures monolayer integrity and proper egg chamber elongation (PLOS Genetics, 2019) (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 10-13, dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 16-17).
- Integrin-mediated protrusion control: In developing muscles, Git/PAK execute integrin signals to terminate exploratory filopodia as attachments form, linking adhesion maturation to actin remodeling (J Cell Sci, 2018) (richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 8-11).
- Hippo growth control: RtGEF(dPix)–Git associates with Hpo in a Vap33-dependent network; Git modulates Hippo outputs alongside V-ATPase activity, positioning Git at the interface of adhesion-cytoskeletal cues and growth control (bioRxiv, 2023) (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 1-4, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 25-28).

Open areas and cautions
- Direct catalytic measurements in fly tissues (ARF-GAP activity and ARF substrate specificity) remain to be demonstrated in vivo in Drosophila; current evidence is genetic, localization, and interaction-based, with inference from mammalian GIT–ARF1 relationships (portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 8-11, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14).
- Tissue breadth: Strong in vivo evidence exists for follicular epithelium and muscle–tendon contexts; synaptic roles for Git specifically were not directly documented in the provided evidence set, although the dPix–Git–PAK axis is broadly conserved and has been linked to synaptic biology in other systems (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 28-29).

Conclusion
Drosophila Git (CG16728) is a focal-adhesion–targeted ARF-GAP scaffold that partners with dPix and PAK to tune actomyosin and morphogenesis, and it integrates integrin signals to regulate protrusive behavior during muscle–tendon attachment. Emerging 2023 data connect Git to Hippo growth control through a Vap33–RtGEF–Git–Arf79F axis, coordinated with V-ATPase-regulated vesicle acidification. Together, these studies position Git as a key node linking adhesion mechanics, Rho/ARF GTPase signaling, and tissue growth control in vivo (dent2019thedpixgitcomplex pages 6-8, richier2018integrinsignalingdownregulates pages 6-8, portela2023thedrosophilatumour pages 11-14).
