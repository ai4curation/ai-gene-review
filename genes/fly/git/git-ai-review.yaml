description: ARF GTPase-activating protein that functions as a multidomain 
  scaffold protein, forming a conserved dPix-Git-PAK complex at focal 
  adhesion-like sites. Git stimulates GTP hydrolysis on ARF family GTPases 
  (particularly Arf79F, the fly ARF1 ortholog), acts as a molecular adaptor 
  targeting the complex basally via its paxillin-binding domain, and regulates 
  actomyosin dynamics, synaptic vesicle recycling, and Hippo pathway signaling.

    review:
      summary: Git localizes to presynaptic active zones and is involved in 
        synaptic vesicle recycling. IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and
        supported by direct evidence in Drosophila from PMID:24882013.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation reflects conserved synaptic localization across
        the GIT family. Direct Drosophila evidence shows dGIT at presynaptic 
        active zones (IDA from PMID:24882013) and involvement in synaptic 
        vesicle recycling (IMP from PMID:24882013). The synapse annotation 
        appropriately captures this localization.

    review:
      summary: Git contains a well-characterized ARF-GAP domain and functions as
        a GTPase activating protein for ARF family members. This is a core 
        molecular function supported by domain architecture and 
        genetic/interaction data.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: GTPase activator activity is the primary enzymatic function of 
        Git. The protein contains an ArfGAP domain (aa 32-168) with a C4-type 
        zinc finger, and genetic evidence places Git upstream of Arf79F in Hippo
        signaling (PMID:38240353). This represents a core function.

    review:
      summary: While Git was originally named for "G protein-coupled receptor 
        kinase interacting protein", evidence for direct GPCR signaling 
        regulation in Drosophila is limited. The IBA annotation likely derives 
        from mammalian orthologs where this connection is better established.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The GIT family was initially identified through interaction with 
        G-protein coupled receptor kinases in mammals, but direct evidence for 
        this role in Drosophila Git is lacking. The primary functions of dGit 
        appear to be in adhesion-cytoskeletal signaling, synaptic function, and 
        Hippo pathway regulation. Keep as non-core pending additional 
        Drosophila-specific evidence.

          involving RtGEF, Git, and Arf79F.
        supporting_text: "Altogether, our data suggest that Lgl acts via Vap33 to
          activate the Hippo pathway by a dual mechanism: (1) through interaction
          with RtGEF, Git and Arf79F, and (2) through interaction and inhibition of
          the V-ATPase, thereby controlling epithelial tissue growth."
