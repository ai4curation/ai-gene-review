  label: Drosophila melanogaster
description: >-
  Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Ccs delivers copper to SOD1 and is
  essential for SOD1 activation, protein stability, and proper disulfide bond formation.
  CCS-null mutants phenocopy SOD1 deficiency with reduced lifespan, hypersensitivity to
  oxidative stress, and loss of cytosolic aconitase activity. Uniquely among characterized
  CCS proteins, Drosophila Ccs lacks the N-terminal MXCXXC copper-binding motif but retains
  the C-terminal CXC motif essential for copper transfer. Despite some annotations, Ccs is
  NOT itself a superoxide dismutase enzyme - those IEA annotations derive from misannotation
  of the UniProt record.

    summary: >-
      INCORRECT. This annotation derives from the erroneous UniProt classification of Ccs as
      a superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1). Ccs is NOT an SOD enzyme - it is the copper
      chaperone for SOD1 that delivers copper and promotes SOD1 stability. The actual
      superoxide dismutase enzyme in the pathway is SOD1/dSod1 [PMID:18948262 "CCS-null
      mutants phenotypically resemble SOD1-null mutants"].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is an over-annotation. While Ccs indirectly contributes to oxidant detoxification
      by activating SOD1, the direct cellular oxidant detoxification activity belongs to
      SOD1 itself. Ccs functions as a copper chaperone upstream of this process
      [PMID:18948262].

  review:
    summary: >-
      INCORRECT. This annotation derives from Rhea mapping based on UniProt's erroneous
      EC 1.15.1.1 assignment. Ccs does NOT have superoxide dismutase activity - it is
      the copper chaperone for SOD1. The dismutation of superoxide is catalyzed by SOD1,
      not Ccs [PMID:18948262 "Copper is inserted into the SOD1 apoprotein by a specific
      chaperone, the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS)"].

  review:
    summary: >-
      Accept. As a copper chaperone, Ccs must bind copper to transfer it to SOD1.
      Drosophila Ccs uniquely lacks the N-terminal MXCXXC copper-binding motif
      but retains the C-terminal CXC domain III motif that is essential for copper
      transfer [PMID:18948262 "domain III contains a critical CXC copper-binding

  review:
    summary: >-
      Over-annotation. Ccs does not directly metabolize superoxide. It functions
      upstream as a copper chaperone that activates SOD1. SOD1 is the enzyme that
      directly metabolizes superoxide. The term "superoxide metabolic process"
      belongs on SOD1, not Ccs [PMID:18948262].

  review:
    summary: >-
      INCORRECT. This annotation derives from UniProt keyword mapping. Ccs does not
      have antioxidant activity - it is a copper chaperone. The antioxidant activity
      (superoxide dismutation) is performed by SOD1, which Ccs activates. Ccs itself
      does not directly scavenge reactive oxygen species [PMID:18948262].

  review:
    summary: >-
      INCORRECT. This annotation derives from UniProt keyword mapping. Ccs is not
      an oxidoreductase - it does not catalyze redox reactions. While CCS does
      have disulfide isomerase-like activity that oxidizes the intramolecular
      disulfide in SOD1, this is not oxidoreductase activity in the classic sense.
      The SOD oxidoreductase activity belongs to SOD1, not Ccs [PMID:18948262].

      Keep as non-core. CCS-null mutants show ~30% reduction in median adult
      lifespan. However, this is a downstream consequence of SOD1 inactivation
      rather than a direct molecular function of Ccs. The lifespan phenotype

      The study demonstrates that Ccs is required for SOD1 activation and

      of SOD1 protein (reduced to ~25% of normal), demonstrating that Ccs is
      required not just for SOD1 activity but for protein stability. This
      stabilization requires copper insertion and/or disulfide oxidation by Ccs.
