description: 'Cell adhesion molecule with extraordinary molecular diversity (38,016 potential isoforms) that mediates isoform-specific homophilic binding for self-recognition. Functions as an axon guidance receptor and is essential for dendrite self-avoidance, preventing sister branches from the same neuron from crossing. Also has immune functions through secreted isoforms that bind bacteria.'

    summary: 'Dscam1 has well-documented secreted isoforms that lack the transmembrane domain and are released into the hemolymph. Watson et al., 2005 (PMID:16109846) detected secreted Dscam1 proteins in the hemolymph that function in immune recognition by binding bacteria. The deep research confirms alternative splicing produces soluble ectodomains that accumulate in the extracellular space for pathogen recognition.'

  review:
    summary: 'While Dscam1 is indeed a cell adhesion molecule by structure, its primary function is actually in homophilic repulsion and self-avoidance rather than adhesion. The protein mediates isoform-specific homophilic binding that leads to repulsion between sister dendrites and axons, not stable adhesion. The term cell adhesion is misleading for a protein whose binding triggers avoidance.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'Dscam1 functions primarily in self-recognition leading to repulsion/avoidance rather than adhesion.
