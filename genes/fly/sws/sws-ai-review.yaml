description: 'Neuropathy target esterase sws (Swiss cheese) is a phospholipase B enzyme that deacylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) at both sn-1 and sn-2 positions, generating glycerophosphocholine. Essential for membrane lipid homeostasis and cell survival in both neurons and glia of the adult brain. Acts as a noncanonical regulatory subunit for PKA-C3, inhibiting its kinase activity while being tethered to ER membranes. Progressive loss of function leads to age-dependent neurodegeneration, glial hyperwrapping, and neuronal apoptosis. The vertebrate ortholog NTE is the target of organophosphate compounds that cause delayed neuropathy.'
