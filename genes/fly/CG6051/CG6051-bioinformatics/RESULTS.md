# Bioinformatics Analysis Results for Drosophila CG6051 (Q9VB70)

## Analysis Summary

This analysis was performed to verify the domain structure and functional annotations of the Drosophila CG6051 gene, particularly to:
1. Confirm the presence and location of the FYVE zinc finger domain
2. Investigate phosphatase domain claims from GO annotations
3. Search for regulatory motifs (TOS motif)
4. Analyze conservation with human LST2/ZFYVE28

## Key Findings

### 1. FYVE Zinc Finger Domain - CONFIRMED ✓

**Location:** Positions 909-969 (61 amino acids)

**Evidence:**
- Contains 8 cysteine residues at positions typical for FYVE domains (relative positions: 7, 10, 23, 26, 31, 34, 53, 56)
- High basic residue content (21.3%) characteristic of PI3P-binding FYVE domains
- Contains conserved FYVE motifs:
  - RRHHCR motif at position 927-932 (zinc coordination)
  - RVC motif at position 959-961 (conserved in FYVE domains)
- Domain structure matches canonical FYVE domain architecture

**Functional Implication:** The FYVE domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes, suggesting CG6051 is involved in endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics.

### 2. Phosphatase Domains - NOT FOUND ✗

**Analysis performed:**
- Comprehensive search for all major phosphatase catalytic signatures:
  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP): HC[LIVM]AGR motif
  - Dual specificity phosphatase (DSP): HC[LIVM]{5}R motif
  - Serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1/PP2A/PP2C) signatures
  - Acid phosphatase motifs
  - Histidine phosphatase motifs
  - Cysteine-based phosphatase motifs

**Result:** NO canonical phosphatase active sites detected

**Conclusion:** The GO annotations suggesting phosphatase activity (GO:0004721, GO:0008138, etc.) appear to be **INCORRECT**. These annotations should be removed or re-evaluated.

### 3. TOS Motif - NOT FOUND ✗

**Analysis:**
- Searched for canonical TOS motif: F[DE][LIVM][DE][LIVM]
- Searched for human LST2 TOS sequence: FDIDI
- Searched for TOS-like variants

**Result:** No TOS motifs detected in CG6051

**Note:** Human LST2 contains TOS motifs (including FDIDI at position 401-405), but this regulatory element is NOT conserved in the fly ortholog.

### 4. Conservation with Human LST2/ZFYVE28

**Human LST2 (Q9HCC9):** 887 amino acids
**Fly CG6051 (Q9VB70):** 989 amino acids

**Conserved features:**
- Both have C-terminal FYVE domains (Human: 815-875, Fly: 909-969)
- Both FYVE domains contain 8-9 cysteines for zinc coordination
- Both lack phosphatase catalytic domains
- Both are annotated as negative regulators of EGFR signaling

**Divergent features:**
- Fly protein is 102 amino acids longer
- Human has TOS motifs for mTOR regulation; fly does not
- Low overall sequence identity (~5-6%) despite functional conservation
- Different disordered region distributions

### 5. Additional Functional Regions

**Identified in CG6051:**
- Proline-rich region: 902-904 (potential SH3-binding)
- PolyQ stretch: 832-838 (7 glutamines)
- Acidic region: 442-450 (9 consecutive D/E residues)
- Multiple predicted disordered regions throughout the protein

## Biological Interpretation

### Confirmed Functions:
1. **Endosomal trafficking:** FYVE domain binds PI3P on early endosomes
2. **EGFR signaling regulation:** Likely acts as a negative regulator through endosomal sorting/trafficking
3. **Protein-protein interactions:** Multiple disordered regions suggest scaffolding function

### Rejected Functions:
1. **Phosphatase activity:** No catalytic domains present - GO annotations appear incorrect
2. **Direct mTOR regulation:** No TOS motif present unlike human ortholog

## Recommendations for GO Annotation Updates

### Annotations to REMOVE:
- GO:0004721 (phosphoprotein phosphatase activity) - No evidence
- GO:0008138 (protein tyrosine/serine/threonine phosphatase activity) - No evidence
- GO:0106306 (protein serine kinase activity) - No evidence
- GO:0106310 (protein serine kinase activity) - No evidence

### Annotations to KEEP/ADD:
- GO:0005543 (phospholipid binding) - Supported by FYVE domain
- GO:0032266 (phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding) - Specific FYVE function
- GO:0042059 (negative regulation of EGFR signaling) - Supported by homology
- GO:0031901 (early endosome membrane) - FYVE domain localizes to early endosomes

## Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded values (contains hardcoded domain positions and expectations)

## Provenance and Methods

**Data Sources:**
- UniProt entries: Q9VB70 (CG6051), Q9HCC9 (human LST2)
- Domain annotations from UniProt feature table
- Motif patterns from PROSITE and literature

**Analysis Tools:**
- Custom Python scripts using Biopython
- Regular expression pattern matching for motif detection
- Pairwise sequence alignment using BLOSUM62 matrix

**Confidence Level:** HIGH
- FYVE domain presence: Definitive
- Absence of phosphatase domains: Definitive

## Conclusion

The bioinformatics analysis definitively confirms that CG6051 contains a C-terminal FYVE zinc finger domain but **lacks any phosphatase catalytic domains**. The phosphatase-related GO annotations appear to be erroneous and should be removed. The protein likely functions in endosomal trafficking and EGFR signaling regulation through its FYVE domain-mediated membrane interactions, not through phosphatase activity.
