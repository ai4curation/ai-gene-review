# CG6051 in *Drosophila melanogaster*: Comprehensive Gene Report

**Gene Overview:** CG6051 (also known as **blr2**) is an uncharacterized protein-coding gene in the fruit fly *D. melanogaster*. It encodes a predicted zinc-finger protein that contains a C-terminal FYVE domain, implicating it in membrane-associated functions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=cd15731%20%20Location%3A901%20%E2%86%92%20965,Drosophila%20melanogaster)). While CG6051 has not been deeply studied in flies, it is orthologous to human **ZFYVE28** (also called LST2) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)), a protein known to participate in growth factor signaling pathways. Below, we provide a detailed summary of CG6051’s predicted function, localization, biological roles, disease relevance, protein features, expression, evolutionary conservation, and key literature evidence.

## 1. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms

CG6051 is **predicted to function as a metal ion-binding protein**, likely coordinating a zinc ion via its zinc-finger domain ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). The defining feature is a FYVE-type zinc finger near the C-terminus, which typically binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=cd15731%20%20Location%3A901%20%E2%86%92%20965,Drosophila%20melanogaster)). Through this FYVE domain, CG6051 is believed to associate with early endosomes and potentially **mediate endocytic or signaling processes**. Indeed, the human ortholog ZFYVE28/LST2 plays a role in cell signaling feedback: LST2 is a substrate of mTORC1 kinase and, when active, helps inhibit the upstream EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)). The absence of LST2 leads to heightened EGFR activity in mammalian cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)), suggesting that CG6051 might similarly act as a **negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling** in flies. In summary, although direct biochemical data are lacking in *Drosophila*, CG6051 is likely involved in **endosome-related mechanisms** (such as receptor trafficking or signal attenuation) via its lipid-binding FYVE domain and zinc-chelating motifs.

## 2. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components

Based on protein domain analysis, CG6051 is **predicted to localize to early endosomal membranes** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). FYVE domains are known to target proteins to PI3P-enriched endosomal compartments, and CG6051’s FYVE finger (annotated around amino acids 900–965) strongly implies an endosomal membrane attachment ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=cd15731%20%20Location%3A901%20%E2%86%92%20965,Drosophila%20melanogaster)). Alliance genome annotations specifically indicate CG6051 is active at the **early endosome membrane (a cellular component)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). This localization aligns with the protein’s presumed role in endocytic trafficking. No experimental immunolocalization for CG6051 has been reported yet, but by analogy to its human counterpart (which shows a punctate cytosolic distribution when tagged ([europepmc.org](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19460345#:~:text=regulator%20of%20EGF%20receptor%20signaling,be%20dissipated%20upon%20inhibition%20of))), CG6051 likely resides in the cytoplasm on endosomal vesicles. There is no evidence of a signal peptide or transmembrane segment, so CG6051 is not a membrane-spanning receptor itself but rather a **peripheral membrane-associated protein** on endosomes. Its presence on early endosomes positions it to interact with incoming signaling receptors or participate in vesicle dynamics.

## 3. Biological Processes Involvement

**Biological processes** associated with CG6051 are inferred primarily from homology and domain function, as direct genetic studies in flies are minimal. Given its endosomal localization, CG6051 is thought to participate in **endocytic trafficking and signal modulation**. For example, the human LST2/ZFYVE28 protein mediates a feedback loop that dampens EGFR signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)). This suggests CG6051 may be involved in the **negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway** (a process observed for its ortholog) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)) ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/589692#:~:text=Gene%20Ontology%20Biological%20Process)). More broadly, FYVE-domain proteins often contribute to **vesicle transport, endosome maturation, or receptor down-regulation** in cells. In *Drosophila*, CG6051 could similarly help recruit or organize molecular complexes on endosomes that ensure proper trafficking or degradation of signaling receptors. 

Notably, CG6051 was included in at least one large-scale screen for genes required in meiosis and fertility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864285/#:~:text=upregulated%20within%20meiotically%20active%20tissues,towards%20the%20understanding%20of%20their)). Although CG6051 did not emerge as a top hit for a specific meiotic phenotype in that study, its inclusion indicates it is expressed in germline tissues and was tested for roles in reproduction. The vast majority of such tested genes had human/mouse homologs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864285/#:~:text=effects%20on%20meiosis%20and%20fertility,their%20biological%20significance%20during%20reproduction)), reinforcing that CG6051 is among **conserved genes of unknown function** scrutinized for essential processes. In summary, **CG6051’s prospective biological processes** include endosome-mediated signal transduction and possibly developmental or reproductive roles, but these assignments remain to be experimentally validated in flies.

## 4. Disease Associations and Phenotypes

Currently, **no direct disease associations or mutant phenotypes** have been reported for CG6051 in *D. melanogaster*. The gene is annotated as uncharacterized, and no specific fly disease models involve CG6051 to date (consistent with the lack of GeneRIF entries for functional studies ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=GeneRIFs%3A%20Gene%20References%20Into%20Functions))). Flies carrying transposon insertions in CG6051 (such as the P{GawB}CG6051^NP4478 Gal4-driver line) are viable and available ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBti0035974.html#:~:text=Viability%20%2F%20fertility)), suggesting that complete loss of CG6051 may not cause lethality under laboratory conditions – although detailed phenotypic analysis of such mutants has not been published.

Despite the absence of fly phenotypes, the **human ortholog’s context hints at disease relevance**. ZFYVE28/LST2 operates in the mTORC1-EGFR signaling axis, a pathway frequently dysregulated in cancers and metabolic diseases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=Dysregulation%20of%20mTORC1%20signaling%20has,and%20may%20impact%20therapeutic%20strategies)). In fact, dysregulation of mTORC1 signaling (with which LST2 interacts) is linked to major diseases including cancer and diabetes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=Dysregulation%20of%20mTORC1%20signaling%20has,and%20may%20impact%20therapeutic%20strategies)). LST2 helps restrain EGFR activity, so its loss or malfunction could contribute to oncogenic EGFR hyper-activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=Dysregulation%20of%20mTORC1%20signaling%20has,and%20may%20impact%20therapeutic%20strategies)). While CG6051 hasn’t been tied to any *Drosophila* disease models, its **conserved role in growth signaling** implies that any perturbation might affect cell proliferation or differentiation pathways. Should future studies find CG6051 mutations in flies, one might expect **phenotypes in developmental patterning or tissue overgrowth**, mirroring the pathway effects seen in mammals. As of now, CG6051 serves as a candidate gene of interest rather than a confirmed factor in specific diseases or traits in flies.

## 5. Protein Domains and Structural Features

The CG6051 protein is a relatively large polypeptide (roughly 960 amino acids in length, depending on splice isoform) characterized by a **C-terminal FYVE-type zinc finger domain**. This FYVE domain (located approximately at residues 900–965 in isoform B) is a cysteine-rich module that chelates two zinc ions and specifically binds PI3P lipids ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=cd15731%20%20Location%3A901%20%E2%86%92%20965,Drosophila%20melanogaster)). Bioinformatics classification groups CG6051 in the **FYVE/PHD zinc-finger family** of proteins ([ftp.flybase.org](https://ftp.flybase.org/flybase/genes/function/structure-f.html#:~:text=%2A%20FYVE%2FPHD%20zinc%20finger%3B%20CG6051%7CFBgn0039492%7Cpp,CT21771%7CFBan0007036)). The FYVE motif (named after **Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1** proteins) typically contains the consensus sequence `WxxD…HHCC…R(R/K)HHCR` and is responsible for targeting proteins to early endosomal membranes. Consistent with this, CG6051’s FYVE_LST2 domain is shared with lateral signaling target 2 (LST2) homologs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=cd15731%20%20Location%3A901%20%E2%86%92%20965,Drosophila%20melanogaster)), underscoring its structural and functional conservation.

Outside of the FYVE domain, **no other well-characterized domains** have been noted in CG6051. The N-terminal ~900 amino acids do not match known domains, suggesting they may form disordered regions or novel structural motifs. In the human ZFYVE28 protein, a short **TOR signaling (TOS) motif** is present (which enables binding to mTORC1) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=substrates%20via%20a%20five%20amino,We%20propose%20that)); it is possible that a similar sequence exists in the Drosophila protein, though this has yet to be confirmed. CG6051 is known to produce multiple isoforms via alternative splicing – at least **isoforms B, C, and D** are documented, which differ in their N-terminal sequences but all include the common FYVE domain ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=2,Drosophila%20melanogaster)). All isoforms are predicted to be cytosolic and share the critical cysteine/histidine residues for zinc binding. **Structural modeling (e.g. AlphaFold)** would predict a globular FYVE zinc-finger fold at the C-terminus, while the remaining regions may adopt coiled-coils or low-complexity structure, pending experimental determination. In summary, **CG6051’s key structural feature is its FYVE zinc-finger**, which defines the protein’s molecular interactions and subcellular targeting.

## 6. Expression Patterns and Regulation

**Expression data** indicate that CG6051 is active during development, particularly in posterior embryonic regions. In situ hybridization and high-throughput expression atlases have detected CG6051 mRNA in structures such as the **embryonic/larval posterior spiracle, posterior ectoderm, hindgut (posterior endoderm), and the proventriculus primordium** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). This spatial expression suggests a role in forming or function of the posterior digestive system and associated structures in the embryo. CG6051 expression in these tissues implies it could be regulated by the developmental patterning cues that define the posterior end of the fly (potentially downstream of Hox or EGFR signaling in that region). 

Beyond embryogenesis, CG6051 is expressed in multiple stages. RNA-seq data from modENCODE and FlyAtlas (as summarized in FlyBase/Alliance) show that CG6051 transcripts are present in a variety of tissues with **no extreme tissue-specific enrichment**, which is common for many broadly expressed factors. For instance, CG6051 is detected in the adult organism and was sufficiently expressed in ovaries/testes to be included in a meiosis gene screen ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864285/#:~:text=upregulated%20within%20meiotically%20active%20tissues,towards%20the%20understanding%20of%20their)). The gene’s promoter/enhancer regulatory elements are not yet characterized, but an enhancer-trap Gal4 insertion (NP4478) in the CG6051 locus provides a tool to observe its expression. This GAL4 driver could reflect the native expression pattern of CG6051, and such lines could be used to report where CG6051 is normally active (e.g. via UAS-GFP). In summary, **CG6051 is developmentally expressed**, notably in the posterior embryo, and is likely under the control of general cellular regulators and developmental signals, rather than being a highly tissue-restricted gene.

## 7. Evolutionary Conservation

CG6051 is an evolutionarily **conserved gene**, found across diverse species. Orthologs of CG6051 appear in other insects and in vertebrates, underscoring that its function is ancient and maintained. In the *Drosophila* genus, there are several paralogous genes encoding FYVE/PHD-type zinc finger proteins (for example, *Dmel* CG5168, CG5591, CG7036, etc. have similar domain architecture) ([ftp.flybase.org](https://ftp.flybase.org/flybase/genes/function/structure-f.html#:~:text=%2A%20FYVE%2FPHD%20zinc%20finger%3B%20CG6051%7CFBgn0039492%7Cpp,CT21771%7CFBan0007036)). CG6051 itself is unique in the fly genome (no close paralog with the same combination of domains), but it clearly aligns with FYVE-domain proteins in other organisms. The **human ortholog is ZFYVE28 (LST2)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)), and orthologs can be identified in other model organisms like mouse (*Zfyve28*) and perhaps in worms (though the nematode genome often simplifies or loses some FYVE family members). Cross-species analysis (Alliance of Genome Resources) lists CG6051 as orthologous to at least a dozen species’ genes, including mammals, indicating a strong selective pressure to retain this gene ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). 

Functionally, the conservation of the FYVE domain means the protein likely serves a similar role in endosomal signaling pathways across taxa. In mammals, ZFYVE28/LST2 modulates mTOR and EGFR signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)), a fundamental process in growth control, which likely points to a comparable role for CG6051 in flies. Interestingly, many of the newly studied fly genes with roles in meiosis or development have homologs in humans that are **poorly characterized as well** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864285/#:~:text=effects%20on%20meiosis%20and%20fertility,their%20biological%20significance%20during%20reproduction)) – CG6051 fits this pattern of *conserved but understudied* genes. This evolutionary conservation makes CG6051 of interest: discoveries in flies could shed light on the gene’s function in higher organisms, and vice versa. Thus, CG6051 is part of a **conserved protein family** with Zn-finger membrane associate domains, reflecting an important biological function preserved from insects to humans.

## 8. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature

To date, **experimental evidence on CG6051 is limited**. The gene does not yet have dedicated research publications in *Drosophila*; for instance, no Gene Ontology annotations based on direct experiments (IMP, IDA, etc.) are recorded beyond computational predictions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=GeneRIFs%3A%20Gene%20References%20Into%20Functions)). Key insights must therefore be inferred from high-throughput studies and orthologous systems:

- **Computational Annotation:** CG6051’s GO annotations so far are ISS/IEA-type, derived from domain analysis and orthology. For example, it is annotated with **“metal ion binding” (molecular function)** and **“early endosome membrane” (cellular component)** based on its zinc-finger structure and known targeting of FYVE domains ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). These annotations provide a starting point for curators despite the lack of direct assays in flies.

- **Insertional Mutagenesis:** CG6051 has been hit by transposon insertions used as tools. The P{EP} element insertion CG6051^G8644 and the GAL4 enhancer-trap P{GawB}CG6051^NP4478 are available alleles ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBti0218199.html#:~:text=Affected%20gene)) ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBti0035974.html#:~:text=Viability%20%2F%20fertility)). No abnormal phenotype was noted in FlyBase for these alleles, but they facilitate research: G8644 can be used for UAS-driven overexpression/activation of CG6051, and NP4478 drives GAL4 in the pattern of CG6051 expression (useful for reporter studies or targeted knockdown).

- **RNAi Screens:** CG6051 has been subject to **RNA interference screens**. In a genome-wide RNAi screen for female fertility genes, CG6051 was among hundreds tested ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10864285/#:~:text=upregulated%20within%20meiotically%20active%20tissues,towards%20the%20understanding%20of%20their)). While it was not singled out in the final list of 94 genes affecting fertility (implying any phenotype was subtle or the knockdown was inconclusive), the inclusion confirms that reagents (UAS-RNAi lines) exist and that CG6051 can be knocked down for functional tests. Similarly, CG6051 was present in a wing-growth RNAi screen library, but no strong growth defect was observed when it was silenced in the developing wing (it was not among the 18 hits that impaired wing growth) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778782/#:~:text=Cell%20division%20and%20tissue%20growth,new%20Alliance%20of%20Genome%20Resources)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778782/#:~:text=No%20,cg6051)). These negative results still inform us that CG6051 is not absolutely required for wing tissue growth under normal conditions, or that redundant pathways may compensate.

- **Ortholog Studies:** Perhaps the most significant experimental evidence illuminating CG6051’s function comes from **studies of its orthologs**. The recent work by Battaglioni *et al.* (2024) on human LST2 (ZFYVE28) demonstrated biochemically that LST2 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and mediates feedback inhibition of EGFR signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11348030/#:~:text=distal%20site,upstream%20receptor%20EGFR%20via%20LST2)). Another study showed that an isolated FYVE domain of human LST2 localizes to endosomes and that LST2’s endosomal localization is modulated by monoubiquitination ([europepmc.org](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19460345#:~:text=regulator%20of%20EGF%20receptor%20signaling,be%20dissipated%20upon%20inhibition%20of)). These findings provide impetus and hypotheses for Drosophila researchers: if CG6051 is knocked out or overexpressed in flies, one might look for perturbations in EGFR/MAPK signaling or developmental defects reminiscent of EGFR pathway misregulation. 

- **Literature References:** As of this writing, no FlyBase curators’ gene summary is available for CG6051 (it remains a “gene with unknown function”). The primary literature mentioning CG6051 is limited to large dataset papers or supplemental tables. For example, it might appear in omics datasets like Dorus *et al.* (2006) sperm proteome or modENCODE expression compendia, but without specific commentary. Researchers interested in CG6051 often rely on the **Alliance of Genome Resources** automated description and cross-species comparisons for guidance ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/43271#:~:text=Predicted%20to%20enable%20metal%20ion,Orthologs%20all%20NEW)). This highlights the need for future targeted studies. 

In conclusion, **CG6051 is a compelling but understudied gene**: its known molecular signature (FYVE zinc finger) and conserved involvement in growth factor signaling make it a candidate for important cellular roles. The research community has the genetic tools (RNAi, GAL4-lines, potential CRISPR mutants) to investigate CG6051. Filling the knowledge gaps for CG6051 will enhance Gene Ontology curation, enabling more confident annotations of its molecular function, cellular component, and biological processes based on direct experimental evidence.
