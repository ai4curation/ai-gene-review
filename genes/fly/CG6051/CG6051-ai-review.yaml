description: CG6051 encodes the Drosophila ortholog of human ZFYVE28/LST2 (Lateral
  Signaling Target protein 2), a FYVE zinc finger domain-containing protein that localizes
  to early endosomes via PI3P binding. Functions as a molecular adaptor in growth
  factor signaling, specifically in the negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathway.
  The protein is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and mediates feedback inhibition of receptor
  tyrosine kinase signaling. Contains a C-terminal FYVE domain (residues 909-969)
  that coordinates two zinc ions and targets the protein to endosomal membranes.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation supported by human ortholog ZFYVE28/LST2, which acts as
      a negative regulator of EGFR signaling downstream of mTORC1. Strong evidence
      from biochemical and functional studies in mammalian systems.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-supported annotation based on robust phylogenetic analysis
      and experimental evidence from human ZFYVE28/LST2. The human ortholog has been
      demonstrated to negatively regulate EGFR signaling as a substrate of mTORC1,
      providing a feedback mechanism. The conservation of the FYVE domain and overall
      protein architecture between fly CG6051 and human ZFYVE28 strongly supports
      this functional conservation.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on FYVE domain that specifically binds PI3P on early
      endosomes. FYVE domains are well-characterized endosomal targeting modules.
      Human ortholog LST2 localizes to endosomes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The FYVE zinc finger domain present in CG6051 (residues 909-969) is a
      well-established PI3P-binding module that specifically targets proteins to early
      endosomal membranes. This is a defining characteristic of all FYVE domain-containing
      proteins. The human ortholog ZFYVE28/LST2 has been experimentally shown to localize
      to endosomes via its FYVE domain. The domain architecture and conservation strongly
      support this cellular component annotation.

      that BINDS phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) but does not possess phosphatase
      activity. The protein lacks any phosphatase catalytic domains. The human ortholog
      ZFYVE28/LST2 is well-characterized as an adaptor/scaffold protein that is phosphorylated

    reason: This annotation is incorrect. CG6051/LST2 does not have phosphatase activity.
      Instead, it is a SUBSTRATE of phosphorylation - the protein is phosphorylated
      by mTORC1 kinase at multiple serine residues (S549, S550, S810 in Drosophila).

      localizes to early endosomes via its FYVE domain. Cytosol alone is too broad.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is not incorrect but incomplete. CG6051 is indeed a cytosolic
      protein (not transmembrane or secreted), but it specifically associates with
      early endosomal membranes through its FYVE domain binding to PI3P. The cytosol
      annotation captures the general localization but misses the functionally important
      endosomal membrane association. The early endosome membrane annotation (GO:0031901)
      is more informative for understanding protein function.

    summary: Correct annotation. The FYVE domain coordinates two zinc ions through
      conserved cysteine and histidine residues. This is a defining structural feature
      required for domain folding and PI3P binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported. The FYVE zinc finger domain in CG6051
      (residues 909-969) contains eight conserved cysteine/histidine residues that
      coordinate two zinc ions in a cross-braced topology. UniProt identifies specific
      zinc-binding residues at positions 915, 918, 931, 934, 939, 942, 961, and 964.
      Zinc coordination is essential for FYVE domain folding and function. This is
      a core molecular function of the protein.

    summary: Too vague. While CG6051/LST2 likely binds kinases like mTORC1 and may
      interact with EGFR, "enzyme binding" is uninformative. More specific terms like
      "protein kinase binding" would be better.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This annotation is likely correct but too general to be useful. The human
      ortholog LST2 is known to be phosphorylated by mTORC1 kinase, suggesting it
      binds this enzyme. It may also interact with EGFR or other signaling proteins.
      However, "enzyme binding" is so broad it provides minimal functional insight.
      Without specific experimental evidence in Drosophila for which enzymes are bound,
      this annotation adds little value. More specific terms like "protein kinase
      binding" (GO:0019901) would be more appropriate if supported by evidence.

      activity whatsoever. The protein contains only a FYVE zinc finger domain for
      PI3P binding and lacks any phosphatase catalytic domains. This specific phosphatase
      activity annotation is particularly problematic as it suggests a very specific

    reason: This annotation is well-supported. The human ortholog ZFYVE28/LST2 is
      characterized as an adaptor/scaffold protein that links mTORC1 signaling to
      EGFR regulation. It serves as a molecular bridge, being phosphorylated by mTORC1

      but functions to organize signaling complexes on endosomes. This molecular adaptor
      activity is a core function of the protein and consistent with its domain architecture
      (FYVE domain for membrane localization, extensive unstructured regions for protein

      The protein was tested in fertility screens but showed no significant phenotype.
      The human ortholog is characterized for its role in growth factor signaling,
