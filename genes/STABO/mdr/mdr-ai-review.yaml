  Mdr (SbSLMdr.1) is an MDR-subfamily ABC transporter in the sophorolipid (SL) biosynthetic
  cluster that is largely responsible for SL export; transporter knockout reduces secretion to
  ~10% of wild type, indicating alternative routes but a major role for Mdr. The transportome
  analysis lists SbSLMdr.1 as a plasma membrane SL transporter. [PMID:34998388, PMID:23516968]

      The literature describes SbSLMdr.1 as a sophorolipid exporter in the SL biosynthetic
      cluster, with no evidence for mitochondrial inner membrane localization.

      SbSLMdr.1 is reported as the transporter responsible for sophorolipid export and transporter
      knockout reduces secretion to ~10% of wild type; this is inconsistent with a mitochondrial
