### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** H6TB12
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Sophorolipid transporter {ECO:0000303|PubMed:23516968}; EC=7.6.2.-;
- **Gene Information:** Name=mdr;
- **Organism (full):** Starmerella bombicola (Yeast) (Candida bombicola).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. ABCB family.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ABC1_TM_dom. (IPR011527); ABC1_TM_sf. (IPR036640); ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "mdr" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Starmerella bombicola (Yeast) (Candida bombicola).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'mdr' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **mdr** (gene ID: mdr, UniProt: H6TB12) in STABO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
We verified the gene/protein identity (mdr; UniProt H6TB12) in Starmerella bombicola (Candida bombicola), gathered experimental and review evidence on sophorolipid export by ABC transporters in this organism, extracted key functional, localization, and pathway data, and synthesized applications, recent developments, and statistics. No conflicting gene symbol usage in other organisms was found in the cited sources, and the transporter is consistently referred to as an MDR-subfamily ABC exporter in S. bombicola (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and family. The mdr gene (also referred to as SbSLMdr.1 in Starmerella bombicola) encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter of the MDR subfamily that functions as the principal sophorolipid (SL) exporter. It is a full-size ABC exporter with two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and transmembrane domains (TMDs) consistent with ATP-driven efflux (BMC Genomics, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-08177-x) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).
- Substrate and biochemical role. Mdr/SbSLMdr.1 actively exports sophorolipids—both acetylated and non-acetylated forms—from the cell to the extracellular milieu, enabling accumulation of high titers in culture (FEBS Letters, Apr 2018; https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.12888) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4).
- Cellular localization. The SL exporter is a plasma membrane ABC transporter; plasma-membrane localization is predicted for SbSLMdr.1 based on ABC exporter topology and transportome annotations (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6).
- Pathway context. SL biosynthesis uses a fatty acid and two glucose units, with key enzymes including a cytochrome P450 fatty-acid hydroxylase (Cyp52m1), two glucosyltransferases (UgtA1, UgtB1), and an acetyltransferase (At). Genes for SL biosynthesis are clustered near a telomere, with the transporter located within the cluster; a lactone esterase (Sble) is positioned elsewhere and influences product form (FEBS Letters, 2018) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4). Transcriptomics shows SL biosynthetic and transporter genes are strongly induced in stationary phase and respond to C/N ratio (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 11-12, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2022 and later)
- Transportome mapping and discovery of a second SL exporter. A genome-scale transporter inventory identified 254 transporters in S. bombicola, of which 18 are ABCs. Within this, the known SL transporter SbSLMdr.1 is highlighted, and an additional MDR-like transporter, SbSLMdr.2 (~59% identity to SbSLMdr.1, located outside the SL gene cluster), was discovered. Targeted gene deletions demonstrated that both contribute to SL export, with additive reductions in extracellular SLs in the double mutant, indicating partial redundancy (BMC Genomics, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-08177-x) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 9-11, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).
- Functional genomics and expression dynamics. RNA-seq across growth stages showed transporter genes, including SbSLMdr.1, are highly expressed during stationary phase when SLs are produced, situating the transporter within the physiological program of SL biosynthesis and secretion (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5).
- Broader transporter functions with industrial potential. The same study identified ABC transporters mediating efflux of hydrophobic molecules such as medium-chain fatty alcohols (decanol, undecanol), underscoring the broader utility of S. bombicola transporters for exporting lipidic products in biotechnology (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 11-12).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Industrial SL titers and the role of export. S. bombicola is an established industrial producer of sophorolipids, with reports of titers up to ~300 g/L. Efficient, active export via the Mdr ABC transporter is cited as a major reason for these high, commercially relevant titers. Process variables (e.g., citrate supplementation) and enzyme engineering (e.g., the lactone esterase Sble) can steer product profiles, while fatty-acid transport contributes to substrate uptake for SL biosynthesis (FEBS Letters, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.12888) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4).
- Transporter-informed strain engineering. The identification of a second SL exporter (SbSLMdr.2) and demonstration of transporter roles in hydrophobic product efflux suggest strategies for improving bioprocesses: transporter overexpression or engineering, tuning SL export to match biosynthetic capacity, and leveraging ABC transporters to secrete other lipidic products (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 9-11, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Reviews emphasize transporter centrality. Expert reviews on yeast glycolipid biosurfactants highlight that a specific plasma membrane ABC transporter (Mdr) is central to SL export and high titers, placing transporter biology at the core of S. bombicola’s industrial performance (FEBS Letters, 2018) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4).
- Regulatory and genomic context. The transporter’s location within a subtelomeric SL biosynthetic cluster and its coordinated induction during stationary phase suggest regulatory integration with carbon storage and stress physiology. This supports transporter-centric strategies for enhancing flux and secretion in production settings (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 11-12, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and experimental data
- Knockout phenotypes. Deletion of SbSLMdr.1 results in a pronounced reduction of SL production that “never reached more than 10% of wild-type,” directly implicating it as the major SL exporter in S. bombicola. Single ΔSbSLMdr.2 mutants also show reduced extracellular SLs; the ΔSbSLMdr.1 ΔSbSLMdr.2 double mutant exhibits the lowest levels, indicating partial redundancy (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 9-11).
- Expression dynamics. Transporters are, on average, expressed at higher levels than the genome-wide average during SL-producing stages, with SbSLMdr.1 among the most strongly upregulated in stationary phase (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5).
- Industrial titers. Reported SL titers from S. bombicola reach ~300 g/L under optimized conditions, attributed in part to efficient transporter-mediated export (FEBS Letters, 2018) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4).

Mechanistic and localization summary
- Mechanism: Full-size MDR-subfamily ABC exporter, using ATP hydrolysis to drive sophorolipid efflux across the plasma membrane (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6).
- Localization: Plasma membrane by functional assignment and predicted topology (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6).
- Substrate specificity: Sophorolipids (both acetylated and non-acetylated); broader ABC cohort in S. bombicola can efflux hydrophobic molecules, including medium-chain fatty alcohols (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2).

Redundancy and additional transporters
- In addition to SbSLMdr.1, SbSLMdr.2 contributes to SL export; it lies outside the core SL gene cluster and shares ~59% identity with SbSLMdr.1. Double deletion exacerbates export defects relative to single deletions, demonstrating functional redundancy (BMC Genomics, 2022) (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 9-11, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7).

Pathway placement and regulation
- The transporter operates downstream of SL biosynthetic enzymes (Cyp52m1; UgtA1/UgtB1; At), exporting the final glycolipid products. Gene cluster proximity and stationary-phase induction tie its activity to carbon storage physiology and environmental cues such as C/N ratio (FEBS Letters, 2018; BMC Genomics, 2022) (jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 11-12, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5).

Conclusions
- The mdr gene product in Starmerella bombicola is a plasma-membrane, MDR-subfamily ABC transporter that catalyzes ATP-dependent export of sophorolipids, essential for high extracellular titers. A paralog, SbSLMdr.2, provides partial redundancy. Integration with the SL biosynthetic cluster and stationary-phase induction situates mdr as a key node in SL production physiology and bioprocess performance. These findings provide concrete levers for strain and process engineering aimed at maximizing SL yields and tailoring product profiles (claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 9-11, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 11-12, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 5-7, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 4-6, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 2-5, claus2022exploringthetransportome pages 1-2, jezierska2018yeastglycolipidbiosurfactants pages 3-4).
