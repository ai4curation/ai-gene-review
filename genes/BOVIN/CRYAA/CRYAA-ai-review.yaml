description: >-
  Bovine alpha-crystallin A chain (CRYAA/CRYA1) is a member of the small heat shock protein
  (sHSP/HSP20) family that serves dual roles as a major structural component of the ocular
  lens and as a molecular chaperone with holdase activity. CRYAA forms large oligomeric
  complexes and prevents aggregation of denatured proteins under stress conditions. Critically,
  bovine alpha-crystallin was shown to have substrate specificity different from other
  chaperones: it recognizes non-native intermediates formed on the denaturation pathway only,
  with no affinity for intermediates formed on the refolding pathway (PMID:7487869). This
  establishes bovine CRYAA as a holdase that prevents aggregation but does NOT actively refold
  proteins. The protein hetero-oligomerizes with CRYAB (P02510) and contributes to lens
  transparency and refractive index (UniProt). Crystal structures of truncated bovine CRYAA
  (PDB: 3L1E, 3L1F) revealed zinc-mediated inter-subunit bridging that enhances oligomer
  stability (PMID:20440841). Per UPB project rules, holdase proteins should retain GO:0051082
  until a dedicated holdase NTR is created.

        alpha-Crystallin, the major protein of the ocular lens, acts as a molecular chaperone
        by preventing the thermal aggregation of proteins

        alpha-crystallin has substrate specificity different from other chaperones and
        recognizes specific non-native intermediates formed on the denaturation pathway only,
        with no affinity for intermediates formed on the refolding pathway

    label: structural constituent of eye lens
  description: >-
    Bovine CRYAA is the most abundant soluble protein in the eye lens, contributing to
    transparency and refractive index. It forms heteromeric complexes with CRYAB (3:1 ratio),
    with zinc-mediated inter-subunit bridging enhancing stability (PMID:20440841). The
    structural role is essential as there is no protein turnover in the lens.
