  label: Bacillus phage phi3T
description: AimP encodes a small peptide that functions as the communication signal in the phage arbitrium
  system, the first discovered quorum-sensing system in bacteriophages. The gene produces a 43-amino acid
  precursor that is secreted and processed into a mature 6-amino acid peptide (SAIRGA in phi3T). This
  peptide accumulates extracellularly during phage infection cycles and, when reimported into bacterial
  cells via the OPP transporter, binds to the viral AimR transcriptional regulator. High concentrations
  of AimP peptide promote lysogeny by preventing AimR from activating the aimX locus, while low concentrations
  favor lytic replication. This represents a population-level decision-making system where phages communicate
  to coordinate their infection strategy based on the density of previous infections.

  review:
    summary: Accurate localization. The mature AimP peptide is secreted to the extracellular space where
      it accumulates as part of the quorum sensing mechanism. The precursor has a signal peptide for Sec-dependent
      secretion.
