  label: Bacillus phage phi3T
description: 'AimP encodes a small peptide that functions as the communication signal in the phage arbitrium system, the first discovered quorum-sensing system in bacteriophages. The gene produces a 43-amino acid precursor that is secreted and processed into a mature 6-amino acid peptide (SAIRGA in phi3T). This peptide accumulates extracellularly during phage infection cycles and, when reimported into bacterial cells via the OPP transporter, binds to the viral AimR transcriptional regulator. High concentrations of AimP peptide promote lysogeny by preventing AimR from activating the aimX locus, while low concentrations favor lytic replication. This represents a population-level decision-making system where phages communicate to coordinate their infection strategy based on the density of previous infections.'
