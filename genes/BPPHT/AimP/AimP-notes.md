# AimP Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: sroux@lbl.gov
**Key Interest**: Phage cell-to-cell communication, lysogeny decision

## Key Findings

### Discovery of Viral Quorum Sensing
- **FIRST viral quorum sensing system discovered** (arbitrium system)
- Published in Nature 2017 - paradigm shift in phage biology
- Challenges view of phages as purely selfish genetic elements

### Molecular Mechanism
1. **Peptide structure**: 6 amino acids - SAIRGA
2. **Processing**: AimX processes pre-AimP to mature peptide
3. **Receptor**: AimR binds peptide, acts as transcriptional regulator
4. **Decision circuit**: High peptide = lysogeny, Low peptide = lysis

### Communication System
- **Intercellular signaling**: Phages communicate infection density
- **Population-level coordination**: Collective decision making
- **Host manipulation**: Uses host machinery for peptide processing
- **Specificity**: Different phages have distinct peptide sequences

### Evolutionary Implications
- Arbitrium systems found in hundreds of Bacillus phages
- Suggests social evolution in viruses
- May coordinate with host stress responses
- Potential for cross-kingdom communication

## GO Annotation Review
- Accepted peptide pheromone activity
- Added regulation of viral latency
- Emphasized intercellular signal transduction

## Therapeutic Potential
- Target for controlling phage therapy outcomes
- Engineering controllable phage switches
- Understanding phage-bacteria population dynamics
- Potential anti-phage strategies

## Remaining Questions
- Do different phage "languages" cross-talk?
- Can we predict lysis/lysogeny thresholds?
- How does this integrate with host quorum sensing?
- Are there anti-arbitrium systems in bacteria?
