  label: Arabidopsis thaliana
description: FT encodes a 20-kDa protein belonging to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP)
  family that functions as the mobile floral stimulus (florigen) in Arabidopsis thaliana. FT integrates
  environmental cues—particularly long-day photoperiods and temperature signals—with endogenous timing
  mechanisms to orchestrate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. The protein is synthesized
  in the leaf cytoplasm, specifically in phloem companion cells, following transcriptional activation
  by CONSTANS (CO) under long-day conditions. After synthesis, FT is actively loaded into sieve tube elements
  and transported via the phloem vascular system to the shoot apical meristem (SAM). At the SAM, FT is
  imported into the nucleus where it interacts with bZIP transcription factors FD/BZIP14 and FDP/BZIP27
  to form the florigen activation complex (FAC). The FAC binds to promoters of floral meristem identity
  genes including APETALA1 (AP1), FRUITFULL (FUL), and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), ultimately committing the meristem
  to flower formation. FT also interacts with regulatory proteins including FTIP1/MCTP1 (which facilitates
  phloem transport), 14-3-3 adaptor proteins (which mediate nuclear import), and NAKR1 (which modulates
  subcellular trafficking). The protein undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation for tight regulation
  and is subject to chromatin-level control through histone modifications at its locus. This non-cell-autonomous
  signaling mechanism ensures synchrony between environmental response and developmental decision-making,
  making FT a critical molecular integrator in flowering time control.
