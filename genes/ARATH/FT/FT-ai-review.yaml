description: 'FT encodes a 20-kDa protein belonging to the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family that functions as the mobile floral stimulus (florigen) in Arabidopsis thaliana. FT integrates environmental cues—particularly long-day photoperiods and temperature signals—with endogenous timing mechanisms to orchestrate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. The protein is synthesized in the leaf cytoplasm, specifically in phloem companion cells, following transcriptional activation by CONSTANS (CO) under long-day conditions. After synthesis, FT is actively loaded into sieve tube elements and transported via the phloem vascular system to the shoot apical meristem (SAM). At the SAM, FT is imported into the nucleus where it interacts with bZIP transcription factors FD/BZIP14 and FDP/BZIP27 to form the florigen activation complex (FAC). The FAC binds to promoters of floral meristem identity genes including APETALA1 (AP1), FRUITFULL (FUL), and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), ultimately committing the meristem to flower formation. FT also interacts with regulatory proteins including FTIP1/MCTP1 (which facilitates phloem transport), 14-3-3 adaptor proteins (which mediate nuclear import), and NAKR1 (which modulates subcellular trafficking). The protein undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation for tight regulation and is subject to chromatin-level control through histone modifications at its locus. This non-cell-autonomous signaling mechanism ensures synchrony between environmental response and developmental decision-making, making FT a critical molecular integrator in flowering time control.'
