## Question

Research the FT gene in ARATH, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **FT gene (FLOWERING LOCUS T, AT1G65480) in Arabidopsis thaliana** encodes a small, highly conserved protein that acts as a central regulator of flowering time, functioning as the mobile florigenic signal that promotes the transition from vegetative growth to flowering in response to photoperiod cues[1][3][5][8].

---

**Key Concepts and Definitions**

- **Molecular Function:**  
  FT encodes a **phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family member**[1][5]. Its primary molecular function is as a component of the mobile floral stimulus ("florigen"), which is synthesized in the phloem companion cells of leaves and transported to the shoot apical meristem[1][3][5][8]. There, FT interacts with transcription factors to activate floral meristem identity genes.

- **Biological Processes:**  
  FT is a master regulator of the **photoperiodic flowering pathway**. It integrates environmental signals (mainly day length) and triggers the **transition from vegetative to reproductive development**[1][3][5][8]. FT is induced by long days and acts downstream of the CONSTANS (CO) gene, which is regulated by the circadian clock and light[1][3][7]. The FT-FD complex at the shoot apex activates MADS-box genes such as SOC1, FUL, AP1, and LFY, which are essential for floral induction[1].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  - **FT mRNA** is expressed specifically in the **companion cells of the phloem**[1][3].
  - **FT protein** is a **mobile signal**: it moves through the phloem sieve elements to the shoot apical meristem, where it exerts its function[1][3][5][8].
  - At the shoot apex, FT is unloaded from the phloem and acts in the surrounding meristematic tissue[1][3].

---

**Protein Domains**

- FT contains a **PEBP domain**, characteristic of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein family[1][5]. This domain is responsible for its structural stability and interaction with partner proteins.

---

**Known Interactions**

- **FD and FDP:**  
  FT physically interacts with the bZIP transcription factors **FD** and **FD PARALOG (FDP)** at the shoot apex to form a transcriptional activation complex[1][6][8]. This complex directly binds to promoters of floral meristem identity genes.
- **14-3-3 Proteins:**  
  In some species (e.g., rice), the FT-FD interaction is mediated by **14-3-3 proteins**, though in Arabidopsis, direct interaction is predominant[1].
- **Upstream Regulators:**  
  FT expression is regulated by **CONSTANS (CO)** and **GIGANTEA (GI)**, which integrate photoperiod and circadian signals[1][3][7].

---

**Disease Associations**

- There are **no known disease associations** for FT in Arabidopsis or other plants, as it is not a disease gene but a developmental regulator. In animals, PEBP family proteins have been implicated in disease, but this is not the case for FT in plants[1][5].

---

**Recent Developments and Applications (2023–2024)**

- Recent reviews and expression studies confirm the **conserved role of FT orthologs** in flowering regulation across plant species, with ongoing research into its expression dynamics and potential for crop improvement[9].
- Manipulation of FT expression is a major strategy in **agricultural biotechnology** to control flowering time and improve yield in various crops[9].

---

**Relevant Statistics and Data**

- FT is **highly conserved** among angiosperms, with orthologs present in most flowering plants[9].
- Its expression is tightly regulated by photoperiod, with **peak expression at dusk** under long-day conditions, acting as a booster for flowering[7].

---

**Expert Opinions and Analysis**

- FT is considered the **long-sought florigen**, a mobile signal that coordinates environmental sensing in leaves with developmental changes at the shoot apex[1][3][8].
- The FT-FD complex is a paradigm for mobile protein signaling in plants, and its study has broad implications for understanding plant development and adaptation[1][3][8][9].
