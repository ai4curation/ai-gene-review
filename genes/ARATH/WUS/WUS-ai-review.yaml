description: WUSCHEL (WUS) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a central role
  in maintaining stem cell identity and meristem function throughout Arabidopsis development. The protein
  contains a well-characterized homeodomain (residues 34-99) that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding
  to TTAAT[GC][GC] motifs in target gene regulatory sequences. WUS functions as a master regulator of
  stem cell homeostasis in multiple developmental contexts including shoot apical meristem (SAM), root
  apical meristem, floral meristems, early embryogenesis, and ovule development. The protein operates
  through a sophisticated negative feedback loop with the CLAVATA signaling pathway, where WUS promotes
  CLV3 expression while being repressed by CLV signaling, creating a self-regulating circuit that maintains
  optimal stem cell numbers. WUS acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor in a context-dependent
  manner, directly binding to and activating key regulatory genes including CLV3 and AGAMOUS (AG) while
  repressing genes like LEC1. The protein is essential for meristem integrity, prevents premature stem
  cell differentiation, and coordinates multiple developmental programs including organogenesis, floral
  development, and the vegetative-to-embryonic transition. WUS expression is tightly regulated spatially
  and temporally, being restricted to a small population of organizing center cells that provide signals
  to maintain adjacent stem cells in an undifferentiated state.

  review:
    summary: WUS contains a well-characterized homeodomain (residues 34-99) that mediates sequence-specific
      DNA binding to TTAAT[GC][GC] motifs. This is a core molecular function that is experimentally well-supported
      and directly enables its transcriptional regulatory activities.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DNA binding is a fundamental molecular function of WUS that is extensively documented. The
      homeodomain structure is confirmed by crystal structures (PDB entries 6RY3, 6RYD, 6RYI, 6RYL) and
      functional studies demonstrate direct DNA binding to target gene promoters including AG and CLV3.
      This represents a core molecular function essential for WUS's role as a transcription factor.

  review:
    summary: WUS is a well-characterized transcription factor that binds DNA through its homeodomain and
      regulates gene expression. It acts as both an activator (e.g., for CLV3, AG) and repressor (via
      interaction with co-repressors TPL/TPR4) depending on context. This is the core molecular function
      of WUS.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures WUS's primary molecular function as a transcription factor.
      The protein contains a homeodomain for DNA binding and has been experimentally shown to regulate
      numerous target genes including CLV3, AG, and LEC1. Both activating and repressing activities are
      well-documented, making this a core function annotation.

  review:
    summary: WUS is localized to the nucleus as expected for a transcription factor. Nuclear localization
      is mediated by inherent protein domains and is essential for its DNA-binding and transcriptional
      regulatory functions. WUS also exhibits dynamic intercellular mobility through plasmodesmata while
      maintaining nuclear localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is experimentally confirmed and essential for WUS function as a transcription
      factor. The protein is found in the nucleus where it accesses target gene promoters. This is a core
      cellular component annotation that accurately reflects WUS subcellular localization.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: WUS plays important roles in flower development by maintaining floral meristem integrity
      and regulating floral organ formation. However, this is secondary to its core function in stem cell
      maintenance. WUS is required for proper floral meristem determinacy and activates AG expression
      during flower development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While WUS is involved in flower development through its role in floral meristem maintenance
      and regulation of AG, this represents a developmental consequence of its core stem cell regulatory
      function rather than a primary function. WUS mutants show defective flower development, but this
      stems from its fundamental role in meristem maintenance rather than flower-specific processes.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is problematic because WUS primarily functions to PREVENT cell differentiation
      and maintain stem cell identity. WUS acts as a negative regulator of differentiation by maintaining
      the undifferentiated state of stem cells in meristems. Loss of WUS leads to premature differentiation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation is misleading because WUS's primary role is to prevent rather than promote
      cell differentiation. WUS maintains stem cell identity and prevents premature differentiation in
      meristems. A more accurate term would be "negative regulation of cell differentiation" (GO:0045596)
      or "stem cell population maintenance" which better captures its actual function.

    summary: WUS is involved in organ development, but indirectly through its role in maintaining meristems
      that give rise to organs. WUS does not directly control organ identity or specification, but rather
      maintains the stem cell populations from which organs develop. This is a very broad developmental
      term.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While WUS affects organ development through its role in maintaining meristematic activity,
      this is a secondary consequence of its core stem cell maintenance function. WUS does not directly
      specify organ identity but provides the cellular foundation for organogenesis by maintaining meristem
      integrity. This broad term captures a developmental outcome rather than the primary mechanism.

      activity. This specific interaction should be annotated with more informative molecular function
      terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Protein binding is too generic and doesn't provide meaningful functional information. WUS's
      interaction with TPL/TPR4 co-repressors is functionally significant for transcriptional regulation.

    action: ACCEPT
