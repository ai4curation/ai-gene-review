description: 'WUSCHEL (WUS) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a central role in maintaining stem cell identity and meristem function throughout Arabidopsis development. The protein contains a well-characterized homeodomain (residues 34-99) that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding to TTAAT[GC][GC] motifs in target gene regulatory sequences. WUS functions as a master regulator of stem cell homeostasis in multiple developmental contexts including shoot apical meristem (SAM), root apical meristem, floral meristems, early embryogenesis, and ovule development. The protein operates through a sophisticated negative feedback loop with the CLAVATA signaling pathway, where WUS promotes CLV3 expression while being repressed by CLV signaling, creating a self-regulating circuit that maintains optimal stem cell numbers. WUS acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor in a context-dependent manner, directly binding to and activating key regulatory genes including CLV3 and AGAMOUS (AG) while repressing genes like LEC1. The protein is essential for meristem integrity, prevents premature stem cell differentiation, and coordinates multiple developmental programs including organogenesis, floral development, and the vegetative-to-embryonic transition. WUS expression is tightly regulated spatially and temporally, being restricted to a small population of organizing center cells that provide signals to maintain adjacent stem cells in an undifferentiated state.'

  review:
    summary: WUS contains a well-characterized homeodomain (residues 34-99) that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding to TTAAT[GC][GC] motifs. This is a core molecular function that is experimentally well-supported and directly enables its transcriptional regulatory activities.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DNA binding is a fundamental molecular function of WUS that is extensively documented. The homeodomain structure is confirmed by crystal structures (PDB entries 6RY3, 6RYD, 6RYI, 6RYL) and functional studies demonstrate direct DNA binding to target gene promoters including AG and CLV3. This represents a core molecular function essential for WUS's role as a transcription factor.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: WUS is a well-characterized transcription factor that binds DNA through its homeodomain and regulates gene expression. It acts as both an activator (e.g., for CLV3, AG) and repressor (via interaction with co-repressors TPL/TPR4) depending on context. This is the core molecular function of WUS.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures WUS's primary molecular function as a transcription factor. The protein contains a homeodomain for DNA binding and has been experimentally shown to regulate numerous target genes including CLV3, AG, and LEC1. Both activating and repressing activities are well-documented, making this a core function annotation.

  review:
    summary: WUS is localized to the nucleus as expected for a transcription factor. Nuclear localization is mediated by inherent protein domains and is essential for its DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory functions. WUS also exhibits dynamic intercellular mobility through plasmodesmata while maintaining nuclear localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is experimentally confirmed and essential for WUS function as a transcription factor. The protein is found in the nucleus where it accesses target gene promoters. This is a core cellular component annotation that accurately reflects WUS subcellular localization.

  review:
    summary: WUS plays important roles in flower development by maintaining floral meristem integrity and regulating floral organ formation. However, this is secondary to its core function in stem cell maintenance. WUS is required for proper floral meristem determinacy and activates AG expression during flower development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While WUS is involved in flower development through its role in floral meristem maintenance and regulation of AG, this represents a developmental consequence of its core stem cell regulatory function rather than a primary function. WUS mutants show defective flower development, but this stems from its fundamental role in meristem maintenance rather than flower-specific processes.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is problematic because WUS primarily functions to PREVENT cell differentiation and maintain stem cell identity. WUS acts as a negative regulator of differentiation by maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells in meristems. Loss of WUS leads to premature differentiation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation is misleading because WUS's primary role is to prevent rather than promote cell differentiation. WUS maintains stem cell identity and prevents premature differentiation in meristems. A more accurate term would be "negative regulation of cell differentiation" (GO:0045596) or "stem cell population maintenance" which better captures its actual function.

  review:
    summary: WUS is involved in organ development, but indirectly through its role in maintaining meristems that give rise to organs. WUS does not directly control organ identity or specification, but rather maintains the stem cell populations from which organs develop. This is a very broad developmental term.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While WUS affects organ development through its role in maintaining meristematic activity, this is a secondary consequence of its core stem cell maintenance function. WUS does not directly specify organ identity but provides the cellular foundation for organogenesis by maintaining meristem integrity. This broad term captures a developmental outcome rather than the primary mechanism.

  review:
    summary: Generic protein binding annotation is too vague and uninformative. WUS specifically interacts with TPL and TPR4 co-repressors which is functionally important for its transcriptional repression activity. This specific interaction should be annotated with more informative molecular function terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Protein binding is too generic and doesn't provide meaningful functional information. WUS's interaction with TPL/TPR4 co-repressors is functionally significant for transcriptional regulation. More specific molecular function terms like transcription corepressor binding (GO:0001222) would be more informative than generic protein binding.

    summary: This is another generic protein binding annotation that lacks specificity. The reference is to a high-throughput interactome study which may identify interactions but doesn't necessarily validate functional significance. Generic protein binding annotations should be avoided in favor of more specific functional terms.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is based on high-throughput interaction data (CrY2H-seq) which often includes non-specific or non-physiological interactions. Without functional validation or specific mechanistic insight, generic "protein binding" annotations from high-throughput studies provide little meaningful functional information and can clutter the annotation set.

These broad screens often identify spurious or non-physiological interactions. The focus should be on functionally validated interactions with specific molecular function annotations rather than generic binding terms.

    summary: This represents WUS's core biological function. WUS is the master regulator of stem cell identity in shoot and floral meristems, maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem cells and preventing their premature differentiation. This is extensively validated by experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Stem cell population maintenance is the primary and best-characterized function of WUS. The protein is required for maintaining stem cell identity in meristems through the CLV-WUS regulatory loop. Loss of WUS leads to stem cell differentiation and meristem termination, while ectopic WUS can induce stem cell-like activity. This represents the core biological process that WUS regulates.

    reason: While the WUS-BZIP30 interaction is experimentally validated, the generic "protein binding" annotation doesn't convey meaningful functional information. Since both proteins are transcription factors, a more specific term like "protein heterodimerization activity" (GO:0046982) or "transcription factor complex assembly" would better describe the molecular function.

    summary: This annotation accurately captures WUS's molecular function of binding to cis-regulatory sequences in target gene promoters. WUS binds to specific DNA sequences like TTAAT[GC][GC] motifs to regulate gene expression. This is a more specific and informative molecular function annotation than generic DNA binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Transcription cis-regulatory region binding accurately describes WUS's molecular function. The protein binds to specific regulatory sequences in target gene promoters to control transcription. This is well-validated for targets like AG and CLV3, and represents a core molecular function that is more specific than generic DNA binding.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Axillary shoot meristem initiation represents a specific developmental context where WUS's stem cell regulatory function is employed, but this is not its primary role. WUS's core function is maintaining existing meristems rather than initiating new ones, though its ectopic expression can induce meristem-like structures.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Regulation of DNA-templated transcription is a fundamental biological process that WUS performs. As a transcription factor, WUS directly binds to target gene promoters and regulates their expression, both positively (CLV3, AG) and negatively (LEC1). This broad but accurate term captures WUS's primary mechanism of action in controlling gene expression programs that maintain stem cell identity.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Stomium development is a highly specialized aspect of anther development where WUS plays a role, but this is far from its core function.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While WUS affects anther development through its regulatory activities, this is not its primary function. WUS's role in anther development likely stems from its general transcriptional regulatory capabilities and its involvement in reproductive meristem function, rather than representing a core anther-specific function.
