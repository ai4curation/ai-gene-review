description: >
  BUB3.1 is a WD40-repeat containing spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein in Arabidopsis thaliana.
  It functions as part of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) with MAD2 and BUBR1/MAD3 to ensure
  proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Uniquely in plants, BUB3.1 (along with BUB3.2)
  has acquired an additional function in phragmoplast-mediated cytokinesis through interaction with
  the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-3. Recent studies (2024) have clarified that Arabidopsis has
  three BUB3 paralogs with distinct functions: BUB3.1/BUB3.2 primarily function in cytokinesis at the
  phragmoplast midline, while BUB3.3 mediates the kinetochore-localized SAC function. BUB3.1 is
  essential for gametophyte development and displays cell cycle-regulated expression peaking at G2/M.

      proteins interact with the APC/C complex which is involved in ubiquitination, direct

      While BUB3 proteins are involved in SAC signaling that ultimately regulates APC/C-mediated
      ubiquitination, ubiquitin binding per se is not a core molecular function of BUB3.1.
      The primary functions are protein scaffolding and checkpoint signaling. This annotation
      may reflect the broader complex context rather than intrinsic BUB3.1 activity.

  review:
    summary: >
      IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping. UniProt lists "Meiosis" as a keyword,
      likely derived from the observation that BUB3.1 disruption affects gametophyte
      development. However, the experimental evidence primarily demonstrates MITOTIC
      functions. There is no direct experimental evidence showing BUB3.1 functions
      specifically in meiosis as opposed to the mitotic divisions during gametophyte
      development.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      This appears to be an over-annotation. While BUB3.1 is essential for gametophyte
      development (PMID:18508582), the gametophyte defects could result from mitotic
      errors during the post-meiotic mitoses, not meiosis itself. The primary experimental
      evidence (PMID:19710914) focuses on mitotic cells. BUB3 proteins are general cell
      cycle checkpoint proteins - they function in any dividing cell. The annotation
      to "meiotic cell cycle" implies a meiosis-specific function that is not
      experimentally supported for BUB3.1. In Arabidopsis, BUB3.3 appears to be the
      paralog with specialized kinetochore checkpoint functions, while BUB3.1/BUB3.2
      are specialized for cytokinesis. A more appropriate annotation would be the
      parent term "cell cycle" (GO:0007049) or "mitotic cell cycle" (GO:0000278).

core_functions:
  - description: >
      BUB3.1 functions as a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), interacting
      with MAD2 and BUBR1/MAD3 to ensure proper chromosome segregation. It localizes to
      unattached kinetochores and spindle microtubules during SAC activation. This is a
      conserved function from yeast to plants.

        supporting_text: "the plant BUBR1, BUB3.1 and MAD2 partners identified in this study are all in place at the unattached kinetochores and may therefore fulfil the evolutionarily conserved functions of SAC proteins, delaying anaphase until all the chromosomes are attached to both poles of the spindle"

      BUB3.1 has a plant-specific function in phragmoplast-mediated cytokinesis. It localizes
      to the phragmoplast midline during cell plate formation and interacts with MAP65-3
      to promote microtubule reorganization. This dual function distinguishes plant BUB3
      proteins from their animal/yeast counterparts.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does BUB3.1 have any meiosis-specific function, or do gametophyte defects result from post-meiotic mitotic errors?
  - question: What is the functional relationship between BUB3.1/BUB3.2 (cytokinesis-specialized) and BUB3.3 (kinetochore-specialized)?
  - question: Is the CUL4-RING E3 ligase complex annotation biologically meaningful or just domain-based inference?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: Compare BUB3.1 localization and function during meiosis I/II vs mitosis to determine if there is meiosis-specific activity
    hypothesis: BUB3.1 gametophyte defects result from post-meiotic mitotic errors rather than meiotic dysfunction
  - description: Generate bub3.1 bub3.3 double mutants to understand functional overlap between paralogs
    hypothesis: BUB3.1 and BUB3.3 have distinct but complementary functions in cell division
  - description: Test whether BUB3.1 directly binds DDB1 to validate CUL4 complex membership
    hypothesis: BUB3.1 is not a bona fide CUL4 substrate receptor despite containing WD40 repeats
