# HSC70-1 (AT5G02500) Curation Notes

## Gene Summary
**HSC70-1** = **Constitutive** Heat Shock Cognate protein 70-1 (NOT stress-inducible)
**DUAL REGULATORY ROLE**: Housekeeping chaperone AND negative regulator of HSF transcription factors

## PARADOXICAL PHENOTYPE - Critical Distinction

**hsc70-1 knockout mutants have ENHANCED basal thermotolerance** (opposite of HSP101!) [deep-research]

### Mechanism:
- Wild-type: HSC70-1 NEGATIVELY regulates HSF-A1d, HSF-A1e, HSF-A2 [deep-research]
- hsc70-1 mutants: Loss of negative regulation → constitutively elevated Hsp101 expression [deep-research]
- Result: Enhanced survival at 44.5°C without conditioning [deep-research]
- **Metabolic trade-off**: Constrain thermotolerance vs energy cost of constitutive Hsp101 [deep-research]

## Primary Functions

### 1. ATP-Dependent Molecular Chaperone (CORE HOUSEKEEPING)
- **Canonical Hsp70 mechanism**: ATP-driven cycle of substrate binding/release [deep-research]
- **ATP-bound**: Low affinity ("open" state), dynamic binding [deep-research]
- **ADP-bound**: High affinity ("closed" state), Kd ~0.5-1 μM [deep-research]
- **J-domain proteins (JDPs)**: Stimulate ATPase 20-100 fold [deep-research]
- **Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs)**: Reset cycle, release ADP [deep-research]

#### Substrates:
- **Newly synthesized proteins**: Co-translational folding, ribosome-associated [deep-research]
- **Multidomain proteins**: Slow-folding, aggregation-prone [deep-research]
- **Misfolded/aggregated proteins**: Disaggregation through "entropic pulling" [deep-research]
- Hydrophobic sequence recognition (4-7 residue motifs) [deep-research]

### 2. Negative Regulation of Heat Shock Response (CRITICAL REGULATORY)

#### Under Non-Stress Conditions:
- **Sequesters HSF1 (HSF-A1d, HSF-A1e, HSF-A2) in cytoplasm** [deep-research]
- Maintains HSFs in inactive monomeric state [deep-research]
- Binds HSF transactivation domain (TAD), Kd ~5 μM [deep-research]
- Prevents nuclear translocation and DNA binding [deep-research]

#### During Heat Stress:
- Misfolded proteins sequester JDPs (e.g., Sis1) away from HSC70-1:HSF complex [deep-research]
- **"Titration model"**: Accumulated clients compete for JDP binding [deep-research]
- HSC70-1 dissociates from HSF → HSF trimerization and activation [deep-research]
- Elegant sensor: HSF activated ONLY when proteostasis burden exceeds capacity [deep-research]

#### During Recovery:
- Free HSC70-1 rebinds HSF trimers [deep-research]
- **"Entropic pulling"** monomerizes HSF1 through successive binding events [deep-research]
- Removes HSF1 from DNA → attenuates heat shock response [deep-research]
- Dynamic co-translocation to nucleus with HSF1 during stress [deep-research]

### 3. Stomatal Regulation (SECONDARY)

- **NEGATIVE regulator of ABA-induced stomatal closure** [deep-research]
- **HSC70-1 overexpression**: Insensitive to ABA, darkness, CO2, flg22-induced closure [deep-research]
- **hsc70-1 mutants**: Hypersensitive to ABA, enhanced closure [deep-research]
- Works with HSP90 (epistatic to ABA signaling) [deep-research]
- Compromised closure → water loss and disease susceptibility [deep-research]

### 4. Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis (CELLULAR FUNCTION)

- **Primary ATPase for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) uncoating** [deep-research]
- Works with J-domain protein **auxilin** (15-50 fold ATPase stimulation) [deep-research]
- Dissociates clathrin triskelions from lattice → recycles clathrin [deep-research]
- **Quality control during assembly**: Proofreading mechanism for cargo loading [deep-research]

### 5. Protein Import and Translocation

- **Co-translational folding**: Ribosome-associated, nascent chain stabilization [deep-research]
- **Mitochondrial import**: Presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) [deep-research]
- "Entropic pulling" drives polypeptide translocation [deep-research]

### 6. Plant Immunity

- **Effector-triggered immunity (ETI)**: Required for NB-LRR protein function [deep-research]
- Works with SGT1 and HSP90 to maintain NB-LRR stability [deep-research]
- **Overexpression REDUCES immunity** (sequesters limiting chaperones) [deep-research]
- **Immune suppression**: Promotes Tregs, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome [deep-research]

## Protein Structure

### Domain Architecture:
- **NBD (N-terminal)**: Nucleotide-binding domain (~44 kDa, 4 subdomains: IA, IB, IIA, IIB) [deep-research]
- **SBD (C-terminal)**: Substrate-binding domain (~18 kDa)
  - β-sandwich subdomain: Peptide-binding pocket
  - α-helical lid: Controls substrate accessibility
- **Interdomain linker**: 4 hydrophobic residues (Val-Leu-Leu-Ile), allosteric coupling [deep-research]
- **C-terminal motif**: GPKIEEVD (TPR cochaperone recognition) [deep-research]

### Nuclear Localization:
- Contains **nuclear localization signals (NLS)** [deep-research]
- Dynamic nuclear translocation during heat stress [deep-research]
- Co-localizes with HSF1 in nuclear granules during stress [deep-research]

## Subcellular Localization

- **Cytoplasmic** (primary, constitutive) [deep-research]
- **Nuclear** (heat stress-induced, HSF1-dependent) [deep-research]
- **Ribosome-associated** (co-translational folding) [deep-research]
- NO organellar targeting peptides (vs chloroplast/mitochondrial Hsp70s) [deep-research]

## Gene Expression

- **Constitutively expressed** (NOT stress-inducible, unlike HSP70 genes) [deep-research]
- Slightly higher levels than HSC70-2 across most tissues [deep-research]
- Basal steady-state maintains protein folding capacity [deep-research]
- Specialized translation regulation during heat stress [deep-research]

## Protein Interactions

- **HSF-A1d, HSF-A1e, HSF-A2**: Negative regulation, cytoplasmic sequestration [deep-research]
- **J-domain proteins (JDPs, e.g., Sis1)**: ATPase stimulation [deep-research]
- **NEFs** (Hsp110, HspBP1, BAG-domain): Nucleotide exchange [deep-research]
- **Auxilin**: Clathrin uncoating [deep-research]
- **SGT1 + HSP90**: NB-LRR immune receptor complexes [deep-research]
- **HOP** (HSP70-HSP90 organizing protein): Auxin/ABA signaling [deep-research]
- **TPR-domain proteins (via GPKIEEVD)**: CHIP, HOP [deep-research]

## Cochaperone System

- HspBP1/Sil1 family
- BAG-domain proteins
- Intrinsic exchange rate extremely slow (~0.001 s⁻¹)

## Evolutionary Context

- **168 orthologues, 17 paralogues** across plant species [deep-research]
- Canonical Hsp70 family member [deep-research]
- Two splice variants: 651 aa (canonical) and 521 aa (shorter) [deep-research]
- Distinct from organellar Hsp70s (chloroplast cpHsc70-1/2, mitochondrial mtHsp70) [deep-research]

## Key Functional Distinctions

### vs HSP101:
- **hsc70-1 KO**: ENHANCED thermotolerance (constitutive Hsp101)
- **hsp101 KO**: ABOLISHED thermotolerance
- HSC70-1 is NEGATIVE regulator; HSP101 is ESSENTIAL effector

### vs Stress-Inducible HSP70s:
- HSC70-1: Constitutively expressed (housekeeping)
- HSP70s: Stress-inducible (emergency response)

### Regulatory Role:
- NOT just a chaperone - ACTIVE REGULATOR of stress transcription
- Gates HSF activation through JDP titration mechanism
- Fine-tunes response during recovery
