description: HSC70-1 is a constitutively expressed cytosolic/nuclear heat shock cognate protein with dual chaperone and regulatory
  functions. As a molecular chaperone, it facilitates ATP-dependent protein folding, prevents aggregation, and participates
  in clathrin uncoating and protein import. Critically, HSC70-1 functions as a NEGATIVE regulator of heat shock response by
  sequestering heat shock transcription factors (HsfA1d, HsfA1e, HsfA2) in the cytoplasm under non-stress conditions. Paradoxically,
  hsc70-1 knockout mutants exhibit ENHANCED basal thermotolerance due to constitutive activation of Hsp101. HSC70-1 also negatively
  regulates stomatal closure and ABA responses, interacts with SGT1 in plant immunity, and binds mRNA.
