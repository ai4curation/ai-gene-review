description: DREB2A is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that functions as a critical integrator of drought and heat stress responses through distinct transcriptional programs. The protein binds to DRE/CRT cis-regulatory elements (preferentially ACCGAC sequences) and activates stress-inducible genes including LEA proteins for drought tolerance and heat shock factors (HSFA3) for heat tolerance. DREB2A is post-translationally regulated through DRIP1/DRIP2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation under normal conditions, but stabilizes during stress via CK1-mediated dephosphorylation of its negative regulatory domain.

    summary: Nuclear localization is well-established for DREB2A through multiple experimental studies showing GFP-DREB2A fusion proteins accumulate in nucleus, particularly strongly during heat stress when protein is stabilized.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DREB2A contains two nuclear localization signals (NLS1, NLS2) and functions as a transcription factor in the nucleus where it accesses target gene promoters. Nuclear localization confirmed by IDA evidence in multiple publications.

    summary: This is an overly general term. DREB2A specifically responds to drought, heat, and osmotic stress, not all forms of stress. Should be replaced with more specific stress response terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct, this term is too broad and uninformative. DREB2A's core function is specifically in drought stress (response to water deprivation) and heat stress (response to heat), not general stress response.
