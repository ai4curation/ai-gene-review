description: HY5 (ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of photomorphogenesis and light signaling in Arabidopsis. It directly binds to G-box and other light-responsive cis-regulatory elements to activate transcription of genes involved in photosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and chloroplast development. HY5 integrates multiple light signaling pathways (red, far-red, blue, UV-B) and coordinates photomorphogenic development with hormone signaling pathways including ABA and auxin. The protein is regulated by light-dependent stabilization and COP1-mediated degradation in darkness.

    summary: 'Red and far-red light signaling pathway is a core function of HY5 as a central integrator of phytochrome-mediated light responses. HY5 directly regulates target genes in response to phytochrome activation and acts downstream of both phyA and phyB signaling.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is a well-established core function of HY5. Extensive experimental evidence shows HY5 is required for normal responses to red and far-red light, and it acts as a key downstream transcriptional regulator in phytochrome signaling pathways.
