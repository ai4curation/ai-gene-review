description: HY5 (ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5) is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) 
  transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of photomorphogenesis and
  light signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein contains a highly 
  conserved basic region for DNA binding and a leucine zipper domain for 
  dimerization, enabling it to function as a homodimer or form heterodimers with
  other bZIP factors. HY5 directly binds to G-box (CACGTG), Z-box (ATACGTGT), 
  and other light-responsive cis-regulatory elements to activate transcription 
  of hundreds of target genes involved in photosynthesis, chloroplast 
  biogenesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and metabolic reprogramming. As a 
  central hub in light signaling networks, HY5 integrates signals from multiple 
  photoreceptor pathways including phytochromes (red/far-red light), 
  cryptochromes (blue light), phototropins, and UVR8 (UV-B), coordinating 
  photomorphogenic development with circadian rhythms and hormone signaling 
  pathways (ABA, auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin). The protein undergoes 
  light-dependent post-translational regulation through phosphorylation by 
  multiple kinases and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal 
  degradation by the COP1/SPA E3 ligase complex in darkness, with light exposure
  leading to COP1 inactivation and HY5 accumulation. HY5 also interacts with 
  chromatin remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes to regulate 
  target gene expression at the chromatin level, establishing it as a key 
  coordinator between light perception and genome-wide transcriptional 
  reprogramming during photomorphogenesis.

    review:
      summary: Red and far-red light signaling pathway is a core function of HY5
        as a central integrator of phytochrome-mediated light responses. HY5 
        directly regulates target genes in response to phytochrome activation 
        and acts downstream of both phyA and phyB signaling.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a well-established core function of HY5. Extensive 
        experimental evidence shows HY5 is required for normal responses to red 
        and far-red light, and it acts as a key downstream transcriptional 
        regulator in phytochrome signaling pathways. The IBA evidence code 
        indicates this annotation is based on phylogenetic analysis, which is 
        appropriate for this conserved function.

    review:
      summary: Regulation of photomorphogenesis is the primary and most central 
        function of HY5. It acts as a master transcriptional regulator that 
        promotes the switch from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis in 
        response to light.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is the quintessential function of HY5 and represents its core
        biological role. HY5 is one of the most well-characterized positive 
        regulators of photomorphogenesis in plants. The hy5 mutant exhibits a 
        classic elongated hypocotyl phenotype due to failure to properly 
        regulate photomorphogenic development. This annotation captures HY5s 
        primary biological function and is strongly supported by decades of

      summary: Red, far-red light phototransduction describes the process of

        signal transduction steps.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While HY5 is involved in red/far-red light responses, 
        "phototransduction" typically refers to the initial conversion of light 
        signals to cellular signals by photoreceptors (like phytochromes). HY5 
        acts downstream as a transcriptional regulator. The more accurate terms 
        would be "red or far-red light signaling pathway" (already present) or
