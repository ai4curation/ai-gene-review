Function: Regulatory photoreceptor which exists in two forms that are reversibly interconvertible by light: the Pr form that absorbs maximally in the red region of the spectrum and the Pfr form that absorbs maximally in the far-red region. Photoconversion of Pr to Pfr induces an array of morphogenetic responses, whereas reconversion of Pfr to Pr cancels the induction of those responses. Pfr controls the expression of a number of nuclear genes including those encoding the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, chlorophyll A/B binding protein, protochlorophyllide reductase, rRNA, etc. It also controls the expression of its own gene(s) in a negative feedback fashion. Involved in the flowering time regulation. Involved in light- regulated circadian phase control that triggers stomatal aperture, stomatal conductance, and CO(2) assimilation. Implicated in red light perception, and, to a lower extent, in blue light signaling (PubMed:12177480). Controls thermomorphogenesis in the daytime and regulates temperature responses by associating with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature-dependent manner and subsequently repressing their expression in a PIF4-dependent manner (temperature- responsive transcriptional regulator); this process requires PTAC12/HMR/PAP5 (transcriptional activator) (PubMed:27789797, PubMed:30635559). Thermal timer that integrates temperature information over the course of the night (PubMed:27789797). Detabilizes UNE10/PIF8 in red light (PubMed:31732705).

Interacts directly with PHL (PubMed:24127609). Binds to UNE10/PIF8 when red light-activated (Pfr) (PubMed:31732705). When light-activated, interacts with PCH1 and PCHL (PubMed:29263319). Associated with DRT111/RSN2/SFPS, SMP2 and SWAP1 in nuclear photobodies upon response to red light (Pfr form) (PubMed:28760995, PubMed:35222493, PubMed:36282917).

Phytochrome B (PHYB) in Arabidopsis thaliana, encoded by the gene with locus tag At2g18790 (UniProt ID: P14713, Entry Name: PHYB_ARATH), represents one of the most extensively studied photoreceptors in plants. As a regulatory protein that mediates the perception of red and far‐red light, PHYB plays an integral role in synchronizing developmental processes with environmental cues. In this report, we provide an in‐depth analysis of PHYB focusing on its gene function and molecular mechanisms, cellular localization and subcellular components, involvement in biological processes, phenotypic outcomes resulting from aberrations, the structural and domain organization of the protein, expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms, evolutionary conservation, and the key experimental evidence supporting its functional annotation for Gene Ontology (GO) curation.

1. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
PHYB functions primarily as a light‐sensing molecule that exists in two interconvertible conformations: the red light–absorbing inactive Pr form and the far‐red light–absorbing active Pfr form. The absorption of red light converts PHYB from Pr to Pfr, which then triggers a cascade of signal transduction processes ultimately modulating the expression of a multitude of nuclear genes (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10). The photoconversion mechanism constitutes the molecular basis for PHYB’s function as an environmental sensor; the active Pfr conformation not only enables PHYB to initiate transcriptional changes but also confers its ability to interact with a broad spectrum of downstream effectors. Among these effectors are the Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs)—a family of basic helix‐loop‐helix transcription factors that bind specifically to the Pfr form of PHYB. For example, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5, and PIF8 have been demonstrated to interact with PHYB to regulate gene expression programs central to photomorphogenesis and thermomorphogenesis (khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 9-10, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 8-9). Once activated by red light, PHYB initiates a signaling cascade by translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it assembles into discrete nuclear speckles referred to as photobodies. Within these subnuclear compartments, PHYB organizes and coordinates the interactions between various transcription factors and chromatin‐remodeling complexes, thereby ensuring rapid and precise transcriptional responses (golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4).

In addition to classical light‐induced signaling, PHYB has emerged as a central player in integrating thermal cues with light perception. Recent investigations have revealed that PHYB is involved in the regulation of temperature responses by interacting with transcriptional regulators such as PIF4 in a temperature‐dependent manner. This interaction facilitates the repression of key target genes involved in growth regulation, permitting plants to adjust thermomorphogenic responses such as internode elongation and flowering time to environmental temperatures (palagyi2010functionalanalysisof pages 2-3, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8). PHYB also exerts a negative autoregulatory effect on its own gene transcription, ensuring that its protein levels are tightly controlled and balanced according to ambient light conditions (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, nagano2020structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3). Overall, the molecular mechanism of PHYB represents a sophisticated integration of photoreception, transcriptional regulation, and environmental signal interpretation, positioning it as an indispensable hub in the regulation of plant developmental processes (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13).

2. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
The dynamic nature of PHYB is underscored by its tightly regulated subcellular localization, which is central to its function as a photoreceptor. Under dark conditions, PHYB predominantly accumulates in the cytoplasm; however, exposure to red light rapidly induces its conversion to the active Pfr form, which subsequently translocates into the nucleus. Within the nucleus, PHYB aggregates into photobodies—specialized subnuclear foci that are thought to serve as platforms for the assembly of signaling complexes, including those containing transcription factors and chromatin remodelers (golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4). The nucleocytoplasmic partitioning is not random; rather it results from specific interactions between PHYB and nuclear-localization signals (NLS) present within its N-terminal region. This translocation is essential for the initiation of gene expression changes, as PHYB must be in proximity to its genomic target sites and interacting partners to regulate light-responsive transcriptional programs (khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10).

In the nucleus, PHYB interacts with various proteins such as PIF3, VOZ1, and VOZ2, which further fine-tune gene expression responses under red light. Moreover, PHYB associates with factors of the chromatin remodeling machinery, including phosphatases like PAPP5 and FYPP3, whose interactions are enhanced in the phosphorylated Pfr state (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, zhu2000phytochromebbinds pages 4-5). These interactions underscore the role of PHYB in modulating chromatin state and gene accessibility. Furthermore, the association of PHYB with PTAC12/HMR/PAP5, a protein implicated in chloroplast biogenesis, correlates with its localization to nuclear photobodies and suggests a direct role in the regulation of photosynthetic gene expression (golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4). Collectively, these studies illustrate that the subcellular localization of PHYB is both dynamic and context-dependent, allowing for rapid integration of external light signals with internal transcriptional and chromatin-regulatory networks (kim2016epidermalphytochromeb pages 18-22, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4).

3. Biological Processes Involvement  
PHYB is central to a broad range of biological processes that underpin plant development and adaptation. Foremost among these is the regulation of photomorphogenesis—a process that governs the transition of a seedling from etiolated growth in darkness to the photomorphogenic growth form upon light exposure. In dark-grown seedlings, the accumulation of PHYB sets the stage for a rapid response upon light exposure, leading to the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and the stimulation of chloroplast development (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, palagyi2010functionalanalysisof pages 2-3). Besides modulating early developmental transitions, PHYB is instrumental in the regulation of circadian rhythms. By synchronizing the internal clock with external light-dark cycles through the control of clock gene expression, PHYB ensures that physiological processes such as stomatal aperture and CO₂ assimilation are optimally timed with diurnal changes (palagyi2010functionalanalysisof pages 2-3, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13).

Another critical role of PHYB is in the integration of thermal signals with light input—a function that has been termed thermomorphogenesis. Under warm conditions, PHYB interacts with PIF4 and modulates the expression of temperature-responsive genes, thereby regulating growth responses such as stem elongation and flowering time (sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8, kim2016epidermalphytochromeb pages 18-22). Furthermore, alterations in PHYB function, whether through naturally occurring mutations or through ectopic expression of homologous genes (e.g., BrPHYB from Chinese cabbage), have been shown to lead to phenotypes that include dwarfism, delayed flowering, and altered de-etiolation responses (song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 1-2, song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 2-4). These mutant phenotypes provide valuable insights into the diverse roles of PHYB in plant development, reinforcing its importance in processes such as internode elongation, leaf expansion, and reproductive timing (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9). Thus, PHYB acts as a master regulator of environmental responsiveness, ensuring that developmental processes are optimally tuned to both light and temperature conditions (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13).

4. Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
While “disease” in the context of plant biology is generally interpreted as developmental abnormalities or stress sensitivities rather than pathogenic states as in animals, mutations in PHYB have been associated with distinct phenotypic alterations that can compromise overall plant fitness. Loss-of-function mutants of PHYB display pronounced defects in photomorphogenesis, including elongated hypocotyls, reduced de-etiolation, and abnormal chloroplast development under red light conditions (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9). Such phenotypic aberrations have significant agronomic implications, as they can affect plant stature, biomass accumulation, and ultimately reproductive success. In transgenic studies, ectopic expression of PHYB homologs has been shown to result in phenotypes such as dwarfism and delayed flowering, underscoring the precision required in PHYB-mediated regulation of developmental timing (song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 1-2, song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 2-4). In addition, interactions between PHYB and its downstream targets, such as the destabilization of UNE10/PIF8 under red light conditions, further contribute to phenotypes observed in mutant backgrounds (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9). These studies serve not only as a validation of PHYB’s role but also as a reminder that deviations from normal PHYB function can lead to a suite of developmental defects that, in agricultural settings, may be considered analogous to disease states in terms of reduced yield and vigor (sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9).

5. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
PHYB is characterized by a modular architecture that reflects its multifaceted roles in light perception and signal transduction. The protein exists as a homodimer, with each monomer comprising an N-terminal photosensory module (PSM) and a C-terminal output module (OPM) (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4). The photosensory module is particularly critical for the function of PHYB and includes several conserved domains organized sequentially as a PAS subdomain, a GAF subdomain, and a PHY subdomain. Together, these regions form the core machinery responsible for chromophore binding and photoconversion. A covalently attached linear tetrapyrrole chromophore noncovalently embedded within the GAF domain is essential for capturing light energy and inducing structural changes that convert the protein from its Pr to its active Pfr conformation (horsten2016mappinglightdrivenconformational pages 2-4, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 2-4).

Within the N-terminal region, a distinct N-terminal extension (NTE) has been identified that not only contributes to efficient chromophore binding but also enhances nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, a specialized structural element known as the light-sensing knot has been mapped within this region; this motif is indispensable for the conformer-specific binding of PIF transcription factors and is highly sensitive to missense mutations that can disrupt PHYB’s ability to propagate its light signal (kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 16-16, kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 1-2). Advanced structural analyses, including X-ray crystallographic studies and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, have revealed that the PAS and GAF domains exhibit minimal root mean square (RMS) shifts upon transition between the Pr and Pfr states, thereby underscoring the structural stability required for precise light sensing (nagano2020structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, horsten2016mappinglightdrivenconformational pages 2-4).

The C-terminal output module of PHYB, although not the primary site of photoreception, plays a significant role in dimerization and in modulating interactions with downstream signaling partners. This region contains a His kinase-like domain that, while not essential for the catalysis of phosphorylation reactions, contributes to protein–protein interactions and may serve as a platform for the assembly of larger signaling complexes (kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 2-3, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9). Collectively, the modular organization of PHYB—with its well-defined photosensory and output modules—provides the structural basis for its function as a reversible light sensor and an integrator of multiple environmental signals (golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 1-2).

6. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
The proper function of PHYB depends not only on its structural integrity but also on its precisely controlled expression. Under conditions of darkness, PHYB transcript levels are elevated, priming the plant for an immediate photomorphogenic response upon exposure to light. Once activated by red light, PHYB exerts a self-regulatory feedback mechanism in which its own expression is downregulated, thereby maintaining homeostatic control over protein levels (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, sharrock2002patternsofexpression pages 1-2). This autoregulatory loop is critical for balancing the sensitivity of the light perception machinery, ensuring that transient light signals are appropriately integrated without overshooting the response.

Spatial analyses have indicated that PHYB is broadly expressed throughout the plant, with substantial mRNA and protein accumulation detected in both the epidermal and mesophyll tissues. The broad tissue distribution of PHYB allows for the integration of light signals across different cellular contexts, facilitating coordinated developmental responses that span from seedling de-etiolation to the regulation of flowering time (kim2016epidermalphytochromeb pages 18-22, palagyi2010functionalanalysisof pages 2-3). In addition to transcriptional regulation, PHYB activity is finely tuned at the post-translational level. For instance, phosphorylation events have been shown to modulate the activity and stability of PHYB; proteins such as PAPP5 and FYPP3 interact preferentially with the phosphorylated Pfr form, thereby influencing its turnover and functional lifespan (nagano2020structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 1-2). These multiple layers of regulation—from transcriptional control and tissue-specific expression to post-translational modifications—ensure that PHYB function remains responsive to the ever-changing external environment (sharrock2002patternsofexpression pages 1-2, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 1-2).

7. Evolutionary Conservation  
The fundamental importance of light as an environmental cue in plant evolution is reflected in the conservation of phytochrome proteins across diverse species. PHYB is evolutionarily conserved among higher plants, and comparative sequence analyses reveal that key domains—such as the PAS, GAF, and PHY modules—are highly conserved across species ranging from bryophytes to angiosperms (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8). This conservation suggests that the core mechanisms of photoperception and signal transduction mediated by PHYB are shared among plants, allowing for similar developmental strategies in response to ambient light conditions. Structural motifs, especially those required for chromophore binding and intermolecular interactions with PIFs, exhibit strong evolutionary pressure, as their disruption leads to significant defects in light signal transduction (kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 1-2, kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 16-16).

Moreover, the gene family that includes PHYB has undergone relatively recent divergence events, giving rise to functionally distinct yet structurally similar photoreceptors such as phyD and phyE. In Arabidopsis, PHYB shares high sequence identity with phyD (exceeding 80% in certain domains) while exhibiting more distant relationships with phyE (approximately 65% sequence identity), reflecting both conserved functional roles and divergent regulatory adaptations (sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 1-2, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8). This conservation across species underscores the critical role of PHYB as a sensor capable of integrating light and thermal signals in a manner that is essential for plant fitness and adaptation to variable environments (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, sharrock2003differentialactivitiesof pages 7-8).

8. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
The current understanding of PHYB function and structure is underpinned by a wealth of experimental evidence derived from diverse methodological approaches. Genetic screens in Arabidopsis have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual PHYB domains. For example, mutant analyses have identified specific missense mutations within the N-terminal extension and the light-sensing knot that result in impaired binding to PIF transcription factors, thus establishing a causal link between structural integrity and signal transduction efficacy (golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4, palagyi2010functionalanalysisof pages 2-3). Complementary studies using site-directed mutagenesis have further confirmed the importance of conserved residues within the photosensory module, thereby providing mechanistic insights into chromophore attachment and the subsequent structural rearrangements induced by red light (kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 16-16, kikis2009residuesclusteredin pages 1-2).

Biochemical approaches have also played a central role in delineating the PHYB interaction network. Techniques such as in vitro pull-down assays, yeast two-hybrid screens, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) have demonstrated that PHYB interacts with a myriad of proteins including PIF3, PIF4, VOZ1, and VOZ2, as well as with regulatory proteins like PAPP5 and FYPP3. These interactions, which are often dependent on the photoconversion state of PHYB, have been confirmed under both red and far-red light conditions, underscoring the dynamic nature of PHYB-mediated signaling (khanna2004anovelmolecular pages 1-2, zhu2000phytochromebbinds pages 4-5, horsten2016mappinglightdrivenconformational pages 2-4).

Structural biology has provided further illumination on PHYB’s function. High-resolution X-ray crystallography, complemented by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), has been employed to investigate the conformational dynamics of PHYB. These studies have identified that the PAS and GAF domains undergo minimal structural fluctuations upon light-induced photoconversion, which is indicative of a robust and stable framework for photoperception (nagano2020structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, horsten2016mappinglightdrivenconformational pages 2-4). In addition, detailed mapping of the protein’s RMS shifts and tilt angles between chromophore rings have provided a molecular explanation for how light energy is translated into conformational changes that underpin signal transduction (nagano2020structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3).

Phenotypic analyses have also contributed significantly to our understanding of PHYB. Mutants of PHYB exhibit prominent abnormalities in light-regulated processes such as de-etiolation, hypocotyl elongation, and flowering time. The correspondence between altered PHYB function and distinctive developmental phenotypes has been thoroughly documented; for example, plants expressing mutant versions of PHYB show elongated hypocotyls under red light, reduced chlorophyll accumulation, and disruptions in circadian-regulated processes (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, oka2008mutantscreendistinguishes pages 9-9). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of homologous genes, such as the BrPHYB gene from Chinese cabbage when introduced into Arabidopsis, produces phenotypes including dwarfing and delayed flowering, thereby reinforcing the critical regulatory role played by PHYB in modulating plant architecture and developmental timing (song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 1-2, song2015ectopicexpressionof pages 2-4).

Collectively, these experimental approaches—from genetic and biochemical assays to structural and phenotypic analyses—have converged to establish a detailed and coherent picture of PHYB as a sophisticated photoreceptor. The depth and breadth of this evidence provide a solid foundation for its GO annotation, as PHYB clearly functions as a key regulator of light and temperature signaling, integrates multiple environmental inputs, and orchestrates complex developmental programs (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, mazzella2005phytochromecontrolof pages 1-2).

Conclusion  
In summary, Arabidopsis thaliana PHYB stands as a paradigm of environmental signal integration in plants. Its ability to undergo reversible photoconversion between Pr and Pfr forms enables it to serve as a master regulator, orchestrating a wide array of processes including photomorphogenesis, circadian rhythm entrainment, and thermomorphogenesis. The dynamic subcellular localization of PHYB—from cytoplasmic accumulation in the dark to the assembly into nuclear photobodies under red light—is intimately linked to its interactions with transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, which in turn finely modulate gene expression.

The modular structure of PHYB, with its conserved photosensory module (comprising PAS, GAF, and PHY domains) and its C-terminal output module, exemplifies how structure underpins function. Key features, such as the light-sensing knot and the N-terminal extension, are critical for effective PIF binding and proper transduction of the light signal. These domains have been evolutionarily conserved among higher plants, reflecting their indispensable role in adapting to fluctuating light and temperature conditions.

Expression analyses reveal that PHYB is finely regulated both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels, ensuring rapid and context-appropriate responses to environmental stimuli. Its broad tissue distribution, coupled with the autoregulatory feedback loops that modulate its own expression, further attest to its role as an environmental integrator.

The extensive and multifaceted experimental evidence—from mutational analyses and protein interaction studies to high-resolution structural investigations—provides compelling support for the diverse functions of PHYB in plant development. The use of diverse techniques and model systems has not only elucidated PHYB’s role in mediating light-induced responses but has also underscored its importance in integrating thermal cues and coordinating complex developmental programs. As such, PHYB serves as an exemplary model for GO annotation, representing a critical node in the signaling networks that enable plants to thrive under ever-changing environmental conditions.

Future research will undoubtedly continue to unravel the finer details of PHYB’s regulatory networks, its interactions with other photoreceptors and signaling proteins, and its integration into broader hormonal and stress-response pathways. These insights promise to deepen our overall understanding of plant adaptability and may hold significant implications for agricultural practices aimed at optimizing plant growth under variable climatic conditions (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4).

This comprehensive review of PHYB’s function, localization, biological process involvement, phenotypic impacts, structural organization, expression dynamics, and evolutionary conservation provides a detailed framework that is critical for its accurate annotation in the Gene Ontology database. The robustness of the experimental evidence supporting each aspect of PHYB’s role ensures that its GO entries will faithfully reflect its multifaceted contributions to plant growth and development (fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 7-10, fankhauser1997lightcontrolof pages 10-13, golonka2020theassociationkinetics pages 1-4).
