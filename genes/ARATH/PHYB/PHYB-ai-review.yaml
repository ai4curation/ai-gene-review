description: 'PHYB (PHYTOCHROME B) is the predominant red/far-red light photoreceptor in Arabidopsis, functioning as a critical photomorphogenesis regulator that controls plant development in response to light quality and quantity. PHYB exists as a homodimer that photoconverts between inactive Pr (red-absorbing) and active Pfr (far-red-absorbing) forms, with the Pfr form translocating to the nucleus where it interacts with PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) transcription factors to regulate gene expression. The protein contains a covalently-linked phytochromobilin chromophore and exhibits phosphorelay kinase activity as part of its signal transduction mechanism.'
