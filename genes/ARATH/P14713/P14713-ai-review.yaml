description: 'Phytochrome B (PHYB) is a red/far-red light photoreceptor that functions
  as a homodimer with a covalently-linked phytochromobilin chromophore. It exists
  in two photoconvertible forms: the red light-absorbing Pr form (inactive, cytoplasmic)
  and the far-red light-absorbing Pfr form (active, nuclear). PHYB is a master regulator
  of photomorphogenesis, controlling seedling de-etiolation, hypocotyl elongation,
  flowering time, and circadian rhythms. It also functions as a thermosensor, with
  temperature-dependent changes in Pfr stability regulating developmental responses.
  Upon photoactivation, PHYB translocates to the nucleus, binds to chromatin, and
  regulates gene expression by interacting with and destabilizing PIF transcription
  factors.'

      summary: PHYB translocates to the nucleus upon red light activation (Pfr 
        form). This is a core feature of PHYB function, well-supported by 
        experimental evidence showing light-dependent nuclear import.

  - description: PHYB functions as a homodimeric red/far-red light photoreceptor
      with a covalently-linked phytochromobilin chromophore. It undergoes 
      photoconversion between the red light-absorbing Pr form (inactive, 
      cytoplasmic) and the far-red light-absorbing Pfr form (active, nuclear). 
      Upon photoactivation, PHYB translocates to the nucleus where it forms 
      photobodies and regulates gene expression by binding to and destabilizing 
      PIF transcription factors.

  - description: PHYB functions as a thermosensor by sensing temperature through
      the thermal stability of its Pfr form. Warm temperatures promote Pfr 
      reversion to Pr, while cool temperatures stabilize Pfr. PHYB integrates 
      temperature information over the course of the night and regulates 
      temperature-responsive gene expression by associating with target gene 
      promoters in a temperature-dependent manner to repress PIF4-mediated 
      transcription.
