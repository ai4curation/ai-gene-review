description: Heat-inducible transcription factor that functions downstream of HSFA1 to establish transcriptional memory and extend acquired thermotolerance during recovery from heat stress. HSFA2 operates through a hit-and-run mechanism, transiently binding to heat shock elements in target gene promoters to orchestrate sustained H3K4 methylation that maintains stress-protective gene expression for days after the transcription factor dissociates. Distinct from constitutive master regulator HSFA1, HSFA2 is the most strongly induced HSF during heat stress and is specifically required for acquired (not basal) thermotolerance through formation of heteromeric complexes with HSFA1 and HSFA3.

  review:
    summary: HSFA2 is a bona fide transcription factor with DNA-binding activity specific
      for heat shock elements (HSE) with consensus sequence AGAAnnTTCT. This is a core
      molecular function supported by phylogenetic inference and extensive experimental
      evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly captures HSFA2's core molecular function as a
      DNA-binding transcription factor. The IBA evidence is supported by multiple experimental
      studies showing direct DNA binding to HSE sequences [PMID:19352026]. HSFA2 contains
      a conserved DNA-binding domain with helix-turn-helix motif characteristic of HSF
      family members [deep-research]. This is a CORE function.

    summary: HSFA2 binds to HSE sequences in promoter regions to regulate RNA polymerase

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IBA annotation correctly represents HSFA2's function in binding cis-regulatory
      regions (HSEs) to control Pol II transcription. HSFA2 directly binds promoters
      of target genes like SGIP1, HSPs, and APX2 [PMID:30778176, deep-research]. This
      is a CORE molecular function.

      function. Nuclear localization is essential for HSFA2's core function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HSFA2 accumulates in the nucleus during heat stress and this is where it
      binds chromatin and activates transcription [PMID:20521085, deep-research]. The
      protein contains an NLS and shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus with nuclear
      function being critical. This is CORE cellular component.

  review:
    summary: HSFA2 participates in cellular response to heat, but this term is too general.
      HSFA2's SPECIFIC role is in transcriptional MEMORY and ACQUIRED thermotolerance
      during RECOVERY, not the immediate heat response which is primarily HSFA1-mediated.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While HSFA2 does respond to heat, calling this annotation "cellular response
      to heat" conflates HSFA2 with HSFA1 and misses the critical functional distinction.
      HSFA2 is induced BY heat but functions DOWNSTREAM to establish memory [deep-research].
      A more accurate term would capture the acquired/extended thermotolerance aspect.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While HSFA2 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus [deep-research], its functional
      activity occurs in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic localization represents a regulatory
      state (sequestration) rather than the site of core function. The NES dominates
      over NLS under non-stress conditions causing cytoplasmic accumulation, but this
      is NON-CORE.

      does not capture HSFA2's specific role in MEMORY/RECOVERY versus immediate response.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While HSFA2 is induced by heat (IEP - inferred from expression pattern), this
      annotation misses the critical distinction that HSFA2 functions in ACQUIRED thermotolerance
      and transgenerational memory, not immediate heat response. The more specific GO:0010286
