description: APO1 (ACCUMULATION OF PHOTOSYSTEM ONE 1) is a chloroplast-localized RNA-binding protein that promotes the splicing of specific chloroplast group II introns through its unique DUF794 zinc-binding domain. The mature protein (~42 kDa after cleavage of the N-terminal transit peptide) contains two tandem zinc-finger motifs with conserved Cys/His-rich consensus sequences (C–x₂–C–x₃–(H/Q)–x₄–GH–x₄–C–x₁₁–H–x–W–x₆–D–x₈–H–x₂₀₋₂₆–PA–x₂–E(L/I)C–x₃–G) that coordinate zinc ions essential for high-affinity RNA binding. APO1 is specifically required for splicing of ycf3 intron 2 (essential for PSI assembly factor Ycf3), petD intron, clpP intron, and ndhA/ndhB introns. The protein localizes to plastid nucleoids in the chloroplast stroma where it associates with RNA/protein complexes involved in group II intron splicing. Loss of APO1 function leads to complete failure of ycf3 intron 2 splicing and inefficient splicing of other target introns, resulting in loss of photosystem I, NADH dehydrogenase complexes, and other 4Fe-4S cluster-containing complexes. APO1 represents a plant-specific evolutionary innovation for nuclear control of organellar gene expression, found only in vascular plants and absent from algae or non-plant lineages. The protein exemplifies how nucleus-encoded factors integrate post-transcriptional gene regulation with photosynthetic machinery assembly.

      id: GO:0003723
      label: RNA binding
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: This IBA annotation is well-supported. APO1 contains the DUF794 domain which has been experimentally demonstrated to be an RNA-binding domain with high affinity for RNA in vitro (PMID:21421812). The phylogenetic inference is consistent with the experimental evidence from both Arabidopsis and maize homologs.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Core molecular function confirmed by direct experimental evidence showing high-affinity RNA binding through the DUF794 domain. This is the primary molecular function enabling its role in chloroplast intron splicing.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: This annotation to the general term 'plastid' is less specific than the experimentally validated 'chloroplast' localization. Chloroplast is a type of plastid, making this annotation both redundant and less informative.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: Redundant and less specific than the chloroplast annotation. APO1 specifically localizes to chloroplasts, not other plastid types. The more specific chloroplast annotation with experimental evidence should be retained.

    review:
      summary: Excellent annotation strongly supported by mutant phenotype analysis. In apo1 mutants, ycf3-intron 2 remains completely unspliced and petD intron splicing is strongly reduced, with several other introns also compromised. This is the core biological process function of APO1.

      label: chloroplast organization
    evidence_type: IMP
    original_reference_id: PMID:15494558
    review:
      summary: While apo1 mutants do show defective chloroplast organization (failure to form grana stacks), this is an indirect consequence of the splicing defects rather than a direct function of APO1. The primary defect is in RNA splicing, which then leads to loss of photosynthetic complexes and consequently abnormal chloroplast structure.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The chloroplast organization defects are a downstream consequence of impaired group II intron splicing. While the phenotype is real, it represents an indirect effect rather than a core function of APO1.

      label: regulation of gene expression
    evidence_type: IMP
    original_reference_id: PMID:21421812
    review:
      summary: This term is too broad and vague. APO1 specifically promotes chloroplast group II intron splicing, which is already captured by GO:0000373. While RNA splicing is technically a form of gene expression regulation, the more specific term 'Group II intron splicing' better describes the actual function.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: Overly broad term that adds no value beyond the specific 'Group II intron splicing' annotation. The specific splicing function is already well-annotated and this general term obscures the precise molecular mechanism.

      label: photosynthesis
    evidence_type: IMP
    original_reference_id: PMID:15494558
    review:
      summary: While apo1 mutants cannot perform photosynthesis, this is an indirect effect of the RNA splicing defects. The loss of photosynthesis results from failure to properly splice chloroplast transcripts encoding photosystem components. APO1 does not directly participate in photosynthesis.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: Photosynthesis defects are a tertiary consequence - RNA splicing defects lead to loss of photosystem proteins which then impairs photosynthesis. This represents an over-annotation as APO1's direct function is RNA splicing, not photosynthesis itself.
