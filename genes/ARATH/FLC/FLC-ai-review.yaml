description: 'FLC encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that functions as a potent transcriptional repressor and master regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein contains a highly conserved MADS-box DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds CArG box motifs in target gene promoters, enabling it to form homo- and heterodimeric complexes with other MADS-box proteins (FLM, MAF2, MAF3). FLC operates at the crossroads of multiple flowering regulatory pathways, integrating signals from vernalization, the autonomous pathway, and temperature to control the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. In its active state, FLC directly represses key floral integrator genes including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) by binding to their promoters and establishing a repressive chromatin state. FLC expression is subject to sophisticated epigenetic regulation, particularly during vernalization when prolonged cold exposure triggers stable silencing through deposition of repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) and recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes. The protein functions within high-molecular-weight assemblies (~800 kDa) that maintain transcriptionally inactive chromatin states and participates in nuclear foci associated with repressive chromatin compartments. FLC activity is also modulated by factors in the autonomous pathway (FCA, FY, FLK) and by transcriptional elongation regulators (TAF15b), creating a finely tuned regulatory network that ensures appropriate developmental timing in response to environmental cues. Natural variation in FLC expression underlies adaptive differences in flowering time across Arabidopsis populations and contributes to latitudinal adaptation in temperate climates.'
