description: FLC encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that functions as a 
  potent transcriptional repressor and master regulator of flowering time in 
  Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein contains a highly conserved MADS-box 
  DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds CArG box motifs in target gene 
  promoters, enabling it to form homo- and heterodimeric complexes with other 
  MADS-box proteins (FLM, MAF2, MAF3). FLC operates at the crossroads of 
  multiple flowering regulatory pathways, integrating signals from 
  vernalization, the autonomous pathway, and temperature to control the 
  transition from vegetative to reproductive development. In its active state, 
  FLC directly represses key floral integrator genes including FLOWERING LOCUS T
  (FT) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) by binding to their
  promoters and establishing a repressive chromatin state. FLC expression is 
  subject to sophisticated epigenetic regulation, particularly during 
  vernalization when prolonged cold exposure triggers stable silencing through 
  deposition of repressive histone marks (H3K27me3) and recruitment of chromatin
  remodeling complexes. The protein functions within high-molecular-weight 
  assemblies (~800 kDa) that maintain transcriptionally inactive chromatin 
  states and participates in nuclear foci associated with repressive chromatin 
  compartments. FLC activity is also modulated by factors in the autonomous 
  pathway (FCA, FY, FLK) and by transcriptional elongation regulators (TAF15b), 
  creating a finely tuned regulatory network that ensures appropriate 
  developmental timing in response to environmental cues. Natural variation in 
  FLC expression underlies adaptive differences in flowering time across 
  Arabidopsis populations and contributes to latitudinal adaptation in temperate
  climates.

  - description: Transcriptional repressor of flowering time that binds CArG box
      motifs in target gene promoters through its MADS-box domain and prevents 
      premature flowering until appropriate environmental signals are received

      - reference_id: file:ARATH/FLC/FLC-falcon-research.md
        supporting_text: FLC operates as a transcriptional repressor by virtue 
          of its MADS-box domain, which enables it to bind CArG box DNA motifs 
          present in the promoters of key floral integrator genes

      precisely controls flowering time in response to seasonal conditions 
      through epigenetic silencing and chromatin-mediated transcriptional 
      repression

        supporting_text: Vernalization induces epigenetic silencing of FLC 
          through changes in chromatin modifications—including the deposition of
          repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3—and the upregulation of long
          noncoding RNAs

      establish repressive chromatin states at target loci
    supported_by:

        supporting_text: These complexes have been shown to participate in 
          high-molecular-weight assemblies that maintain an inactive chromatin 
          state by promoting histone modifications associated with gene 
          silencing

suggested_experiments:
  - hypothesis: FLC vernalization silencing involves sequential recruitment of 
      chromatin modifying complexes with distinct kinetics and functional roles
    description: Use ChIP-seq time course experiments during vernalization to 
      map the temporal recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin 
      remodelers to FLC chromatin. Combine with single-cell RNA-seq to track 
      heterogeneity in silencing kinetics. Use chromatin conformation capture to
      analyze changes in nuclear organization during silencing establishment.
  - hypothesis: Different MADS-box heterodimer combinations have distinct DNA 
      binding specificities and create regulatory modules with different target 
      gene sets
    description: Generate comprehensive protein-DNA interaction maps using 
      ChIP-exo for FLC, FLM, and MAF proteins in different genetic backgrounds. 
      Use DNA-binding domain swapping experiments to test the contribution of 
      each component to target specificity. Perform SELEX-seq to define in vitro
      binding preferences for different heterodimer combinations.
  - hypothesis: FLC silencing stability is maintained by self-reinforcing 
      chromatin loops and three-dimensional nuclear organization
    description: Use Hi-C and 4C-seq to map changes in chromatin topology at the
      FLC locus during vernalization and subsequent development. Test the role 
      of nuclear positioning using live-cell imaging with fluorescently-tagged 
      FLC. Generate mutations in predicted loop anchor sites and test their 
      effects on silencing stability using single-cell tracking.
  - hypothesis: Natural FLC alleles differ in their sensitivity to vernalization
      and temperature due to cis-regulatory variation affecting chromatin 
      accessibility
    description: Compare chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq across natural 
      FLC alleles under different temperature and vernalization conditions. Use 
      CRISPR-mediated allele swapping to test causative variants. Perform 
      association mapping in natural populations to identify variants affecting 
      flowering time and correlate with chromatin features.
