This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C, UniProt ID Q9S7Q7, locus tag At5g10140), a central regulatory element in flowering‐time control. The report discusses the gene’s biochemical function and molecular mechanisms, its subcellular localization, its participation in key biological processes and phenotypes, details about the encoded protein domains and structural features, the expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms that govern its activity, evolutionary conservation among plant species, and the experimental evidence supporting these findings. The information presented here is drawn from multiple peer‐reviewed studies (eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 9-12, gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 1-2, michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 3-5, michaels2003attenuationofflowering pages 1-2) and is intended to support Gene Ontology (GO) annotation curation.

1. Introduction  
FLC encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that functions as a potent repressor of floral transition in A. thaliana by integrating multiple environmental and endogenous cues. The gene was originally characterized as a key regulator within flowering‐time networks, and its activity is essential for maintaining the late‐flowering phenotype observed in certain genetic backgrounds. FLC is annotated under the UniProt entry FLC_ARATH (Q9S7Q7) and is recognized by its locus tag At5g10140; it is also known by the synonym FLF. Its functional role in inhibiting the expression of flowering‐promoting genes, such as SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), situates it at the crossroads of several flowering‐regulatory pathways including those mediated by FRIGIDA (FRI), vernalization, and the autonomous pathway (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 1-2).

2. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
FLC operates as a transcriptional repressor by virtue of its MADS-box domain, which enables it to bind CArG box DNA motifs present in the promoters of key floral integrator genes. Its function is dose-dependent; elevated FLC transcript and protein levels correlate closely with a pronounced repression of flowering, while null mutations or reduced expression lead to early flowering phenotypes (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3). FLC’s repressive effect on flowering is executed primarily through direct interaction with promoters of FT and SOC1, thereby attenuating the expression of these integrators until plants have received appropriate environmental signals, such as prolonged cold exposure in the vernalization process (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 5-6).  

At the molecular level, FLC acts within a complex network of chromatin‐based regulatory mechanisms. It cooperates with other MADS-box proteins—including members of the FLC clade such as FLM, MAF2, and MAF3—to form multimeric complexes that bind chromatin and establish a repressive state over target gene loci. These complexes have been shown to participate in high-molecular-weight assemblies that maintain an inactive chromatin state by promoting histone modifications associated with gene silencing (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 6-7, helliwell2006thearabidopsisflc pages 6-7). Furthermore, FLC activity is modulated by interactions with transcriptional co-regulators such as TAF15b. In taf15b mutants, increased FLC transcript levels are observed, and TAF15b has been implicated in modulating the transcriptional elongation state at FLC, suggesting that transcriptional repression by FLC is finely tuned by a wider transcriptional apparatus (eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 9-12, eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 7-9).  

FLC’s integration of multiple signaling pathways is underscored by its responsiveness to vernalization and autonomous signals. Vernalization induces epigenetic silencing of FLC through changes in chromatin modifications—including the deposition of repressive histone marks such as H3K27me3—and the upregulation of long noncoding RNAs (e.g., COOLAIR), which contribute to a stable transition from the repressive to the active flowering state (whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7, zhu2015nuclearorganizationchanges pages 3-4). In addition, factors within the autonomous flowering pathway, such as FCA and FY, contribute to the modulation of FLC expression, aligning its activity with developmental cues (hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 1-2, fujiwara2010photoperiodpathwayregulates pages 3-6). In summary, FLC functions as a regulatory rheostat that integrates genetic, epigenetic, and environmental signals to control the timing of the floral transition (mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 1-2, simpson2004theautonomouspathway pages 1-2).

3. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
FLC is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it exerts its function as a transcriptional regulator. Detailed cellular localization studies have highlighted its presence in nuclear compartments that are associated with chromatin-modifying activity, consistent with its role in interacting with high-molecular-weight protein complexes involved in transcriptional repression (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 1-2). Within the nucleus, FLC is often found in foci that coincide with regions of repressive chromatin, suggesting that its subnuclear distribution is an integral aspect of its function in maintaining a transcriptionally inert state at target gene loci (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 5-6, rouse2002flcarepressor pages 1-2). Moreover, the spatial dynamics of FLC within the nucleus are thought to facilitate its interactions with both the general transcription machinery and specific chromatin remodelers, thereby underpinning the complex regulation of flowering time (shafiq2016functionsofplants pages 2-3, rouse2002flcarepressor pages 5-7).

4. Biological Processes, Phenotypic Implications, and Disease Associations  
As a central component of flowering time regulation, FLC plays a critical role in several biological processes related to plant development and adaptation. Its primary biological function is to repress the onset of flowering by directly inhibiting the expression of floral integrators such as FT and SOC1, thereby ensuring that the transition from vegetative to reproductive development is tightly coordinated with both internal developmental signals and external environmental cues (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, simpson2004theautonomouspathway pages 1-2). FLC’s repression is essential for the establishment of a vernalization requirement in many Arabidopsis ecotypes, which in turn ensures that flowering occurs only after a prolonged period of cold exposure, a feature fundamental to plant adaptation to temperate climates (michaels2003attenuationofflowering pages 1-2, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7).  

Phenotypically, natural and induced alterations in FLC expression result in dramatic changes in flowering time. Elevated levels of FLC are associated with a late-flowering phenotype, whereas mutants or allelic variants that reduce FLC expression lead to early flowering. Such phenotypic variations are not only evident in controlled laboratory experiments but also correspond to adaptations observed in natural populations, where differential FLC expression contributes to latitudinal clines in flowering time and assists in optimizing seed production and overall fitness under varying seasonal conditions (caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 2-4, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 2-3, li2014multipleflchaplotypes pages 4-5). Although “disease” in the conventional sense is not typically ascribed to plant flowering time genes, dysregulation of FLC can result in developmental abnormalities that compromise reproductive success and plant vigor, functioning as a molecular basis for reduced fitness under inappropriate environmental conditions (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27).  

Furthermore, epistatic interactions between FLC and upstream activators such as FRIGIDA (FRI) have been shown to dramatically modulate flowering time. Functional FRIGIDA alleles upregulate FLC, and the subsequent high levels of FLC lead to a robust repression of floral initiation. These interactions underscore the importance of FLC in shaping complex developmental phenotypes that have direct implications for adaptation, agricultural performance, and potential stress responses associated with variable climatic conditions (andersson2008theflxgene pages 5-6, andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2). In a broader context, FLC serves as a critical hub in the gene regulatory network that governs not only the timing of flowering but also subsequent processes that define overall plant architecture and reproductive fitness (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 6-7, hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 8-9).

5. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The FLC protein is characterized by a highly conserved MADS-box DNA-binding domain, which is responsible for its ability to recognize and bind specific cis-regulatory elements, such as CArG boxes, in the promoter regions of target genes. Structurally, FLC comprises seven exons, with the first exon encoding the MADS-box motif—a signature feature that is critical for dimerization and interaction with other MADS-domain proteins (michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3). This modular architecture not only facilitates specific DNA binding but also allows FLC to form homo- or heterodimeric complexes with other floral repressors such as FLM, MAF2, and MAF3. The formation of such complexes is crucial for the establishment of a transcriptionally repressive environment on target loci, thereby ensuring that the timing of flowering is properly controlled (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 6-7).

In addition to the MADS-box, FLC contains domains that are implicated in transcriptional repression beyond DNA binding. Although the precise structural details of these additional regions remain an active area of research, mutations in these domains have been linked to altered protein function and subsequent modifications in flowering time (michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 1-2, michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3). For instance, loss-of-function mutations or small deletions within the MADS-box domain or adjacent regions can lead to an early-flowering phenotype by abrogating the protein’s ability to form functional repressive complexes (michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3, andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2). Structural analyses further suggest that FLC may exist as part of large protein complexes (approximately 800 kDa) that contain chromatin-remodeling factors, highlighting the intricate interplay between its structural features and its role in epigenetic regulation (helliwell2006thearabidopsisflc pages 6-7, rouse2002flcarepressor pages 7-8).

Recent advances in protein structural biology and biochemical assays have begun to elucidate the conformational dynamics of FLC, revealing that its interaction surfaces are critical for both protein–protein and protein–DNA contacts. The conservation of these domains among diverse plant species underpins their functional significance in the regulation of flowering time and suggests that similar structural features are preserved in FLC orthologues across the Brassicaceae family and potentially in other flowering plants (perilleux2013arootchicory pages 1-2, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27).

6. Expression Patterns and Regulatory Mechanisms  
FLC expression is subject to a sophisticated level of regulation that reflects a combination of developmental, environmental, and epigenetic inputs. At the transcriptional level, FLC mRNA levels respond dynamically to changes in environmental signals such as prolonged cold (vernalization) and photoperiod length. In the absence of cold treatment, FLC is expressed at high levels, thereby establishing a repressive state that prevents premature flowering. Vernalization triggers a dramatic switch in the chromatin state at the FLC locus, leading to the stable deposition of repressive histone marks (for instance, H3K27me3) and subsequent transcriptional silencing of FLC, which in turn permits the activation of flowering integrators such as FT and SOC1 (whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7, zhu2015nuclearorganizationchanges pages 3-4).  

In addition to transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing and the production of antisense long noncoding RNAs (e.g., COOLAIR) contribute to the fine-tuning of FLC expression. These noncoding transcripts have been implicated in modulating the chromatin environment of the FLC locus, providing an additional layer of control that helps to lock in the repressed state following vernalization (whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7, shafiq2016functionsofplants pages 2-3). Structural changes within specific intronic regions—most notably the 5′ end of intron 1—are critical for the recruitment of transcriptional repressors (such as VAL1), and subtle sequence variations in these regions have been linked to differences in FLC repression between annual and perennial species (kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27).

Furthermore, FLC expression is modulated by factors that act within the autonomous flowering pathway. Mutations in key regulators, including FCA, FY, and FLK, result in a significant upregulation of FLC and consequently delay flowering, underscoring a pivotal role for these factors in repressing FLC expression during critical developmental windows (hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 1-2, mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 2-3, mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 3-4). Temperature also plays a role: recent data indicate that under elevated temperature conditions, FLC levels can be maintained in a JMJ30/JMJ32-dependent manner in order to prevent extreme precocious flowering, thereby contributing to the thermal regulation of flowering time (mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 1-2, rouse2002flcarepressor pages 5-7). Complementary genetic approaches, including QTL mapping and allelic variation studies, have further demonstrated that natural polymorphisms in the FLC locus—resulting in distinct haplotypes—are strongly correlated with variation in its expression levels and hence with phenotypic traits such as rosette leaf number and time to bolting (caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 2-4, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 2-3, li2014multipleflchaplotypes pages 4-5).

Together, these regulatory mechanisms underscore the central importance of FLC in controlling the timing of flowering through a highly integrated network of transcriptional and epigenetic controls that respond to both intrinsic developmental signals and external environmental conditions (hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 8-9, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 21-24).

7. Evolutionary Conservation  
The conservation of FLC and its regulatory network across plant species reveals its fundamental role in the control of flowering time. Comparative genomic analyses have demonstrated that the MADS-box domain of FLC is highly conserved among Arabidopsis accessions as well as in orthologous genes in the Brassicaceae family and beyond (perilleux2013arootchicory pages 1-2, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27). This evolutionary conservation extends not only to the primary amino acid sequence but also to the structural organization of the gene, including the arrangement of exons and introns, and the regulatory elements responsible for its epigenetic modulation (michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3).

Natural variation in FLC, as evidenced by polymorphism studies and haplotype analyses (e.g., the identification of FLCA and FLCB haplogroups), underpins adaptive evolutionary changes that enable Arabidopsis to fine-tune its flowering time to local climatic conditions (caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 2-4, li2014multipleflchaplotypes pages 4-5). Such variation is critical for latitudinal clines in flowering time, with different allelic variants of FLC contributing to differential fitness and reproductive success in variable environments (caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 1-2, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 2-3). Moreover, the interaction between FLC and upstream regulators such as FRIGIDA further highlights an evolutionary mechanism whereby natural selection can act on both genes to modulate flowering time and adapt to diverse ecological niches (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2).

The evolutionary conservation of FLC function is also reflected in studies that compare the Arabidopsis FLC with homologous genes in distantly related species. For instance, research involving a MADS-box gene from root chicory (CiFL1) has revealed common features with AtFLC, particularly in terms of responses to vernalization and the establishment of a repressive chromatin state, suggesting that the core mechanisms controlling flowering time have been maintained throughout plant evolution (perilleux2013arootchicory pages 1-2, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 2-3). This conservation underscores the fundamental role of FLC as a master regulator of the developmental timing of flowering in response to environmental cues.

8. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
A robust body of experimental evidence supports the role of FLC in flowering time regulation and the molecular mechanisms that underlie its function. Genetic studies using loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants have played a critical role in elucidating the biological role of FLC. Null mutations in FLC consistently produce early-flowering phenotypes, while ectopic overexpression of FLC results in delayed flowering. Such phenotypic outcomes have been confirmed through both classical forward genetics and more recent reverse-genetics approaches (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3).  

Mutant analyses involving the autonomous pathway have provided further insight into the transcriptional regulation of FLC. For instance, mutations in FLK, a gene encoding a KH-domain protein, lead to a 6- to 10-fold increase in FLC mRNA levels, resulting in profound delays in flowering. These studies underscore the importance of post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in controlling FLC expression (mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 2-3, mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 3-4). Likewise, taf15b mutants have been used to demonstrate that transcription elongation and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the FLC locus are critical determinants of its expression, further linking the action of general transcription factors to the temporal control of flowering (eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 9-12, eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 7-9).  

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have been extensively employed to investigate the binding of FLC to the promoters of its target genes, revealing that FLC directly occupies CArG box motifs in the regulatory regions of FT and SOC1 to enforce transcriptional repression (helliwell2006thearabidopsisflc pages 6-7, rouse2002flcarepressor pages 7-8). In parallel, studies monitoring histone modifications have demonstrated that the transition from active to repressed FLC expression is accompanied by a switch in histone marks—from active marks such as H3K4me3 to repressive marks like H3K27me3—thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epigenetic silencing that occurs during vernalization (whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7, zhu2015nuclearorganizationchanges pages 3-4).  

Additional experimental evidence comes from studies of natural allelic variation and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, which have revealed that polymorphisms in the FLC region are strongly associated with natural variation in flowering time. These investigations have not only confirmed the gene’s central role in regulating developmental timing but have also provided a framework for understanding how genetic diversity at the FLC locus contributes to adaptation in wild populations (caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 2-4, li2014multipleflchaplotypes pages 4-5).  

Moreover, protein–protein interaction studies, including co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screens, have established that FLC functions within multiprotein complexes and physically interacts with other MADS-box factors as well as with chromatin-remodeling proteins. Such interactions are essential for the assembly of repressive complexes that stabilize the silenced state of flowering-promoting genes (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 6-7, helliwell2006thearabidopsisflc pages 6-7). Finally, advanced imaging techniques and subcellular fractionation studies have corroborated the nuclear localization of FLC, linking its spatial distribution within the nucleus to its functional roles in transcriptional repression and chromatin modulation (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 1-2).

9. Conclusion  
In summary, FLC in Arabidopsis thaliana is a master regulator of flowering time that exerts its effects through the repression of key floral integrators such as SOC1 and FT. The gene encodes a MADS-box transcription factor that is localized to the nucleus, where it participates in complex protein assemblies and epigenetic networks. FLC’s function is intricately controlled by input from vernalization, the autonomous pathway, and photoperiod signals, and its activity is modulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms including chromatin remodeling and long noncoding RNA transcription. Naturally occurring allelic variation in FLC contributes to significant phenotypic diversity in flowering time, underpinning adaptive strategies across different geographic regions and environmental conditions. A substantial body of experimental evidence—from mutant analyses and ChIP assays to QTL mapping and protein interaction studies—supports the critical role of FLC in integrating environmental signals with developmental timing. These detailed molecular insights have broad implications for understanding plant developmental biology, adaptation, and breeding strategies, and they provide a solid foundation for Gene Ontology annotation of FLC (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, eom2018taf15binvolvedin pages 9-12, mockler2004regulationofflowering pages 1-2, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 6-7, zhu2015nuclearorganizationchanges pages 3-4, gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 6-7).

Taken together, the functional, structural, and regulatory characteristics of FLC reveal that it is not simply a single-gene regulator but rather a central hub within a highly networked system that governs flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its conservation across plant species underscores its evolutionary significance, and its sensitivity to multiple regulatory inputs makes it a particularly attractive target for studies aimed at modifying flowering time for both fundamental research and agricultural application. The multifaceted role of FLC—as evidenced by its interactions with transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and noncoding RNAs—further demonstrates the complexity of plant developmental regulation and provides rich opportunities for future investigations into epigenetic control mechanisms and their applications in crop improvement (andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27, gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, perilleux2013arootchicory pages 1-2).

In conclusion, the Arabidopsis thaliana FLC gene is a paradigmatic example of how plants integrate internal genetic circuits with external environmental cues to control key developmental transitions. The extensive experimental data regarding its molecular function, subcellular localization, regulatory mechanisms, and evolutionary conservation collectively underscore its central role in the timing of flowering. This detailed understanding of FLC’s operation is instrumental for the accurate and comprehensive Gene Ontology annotation of this critical regulatory gene, thereby facilitating further research in plant biology and translational applications in agriculture (gu2013arabidopsisflcclade pages 1-2, andersson2008theflxgene pages 1-2, michaels1999floweringlocusc pages 2-3, shafiq2016functionsofplants pages 2-3).

By elucidating the molecular underpinnings of FLC function, from its MADS-box-driven DNA binding to the context-dependent chromatin modifications that regulate its transcriptional output, researchers have laid the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of how flowering time is controlled. As global climate change continues to impose new challenges on plant reproductive strategies, insights into genes such as FLC will be increasingly valuable for engineering crops that are better adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions (li2014multipleflchaplotypes pages 4-5, whittaker2017theflclocus pages 2-3, caicedo2004epistaticinteractionbetween pages 2-4). This comprehensive report hence serves as both a synthesis of current knowledge and a roadmap for future investigations into the complex yet elegant regulatory circuits that determine the precise timing of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana (hepworth2015floweringlocusc’s pages 8-9, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 21-24, kiefer2017divergenceofannual pages 24-27).
