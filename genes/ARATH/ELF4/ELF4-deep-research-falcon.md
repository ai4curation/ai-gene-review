## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O04211
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein EARLY FLOWERING 4; AltName: Full=Protein ARRHYTHMIC 44;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ELF4; Synonyms=ARR08, ARR16, ARR19, ARR44, ARR80; OrderedLocusNames=At2g40080; ORFNames=T28M21.24;
- **Organism (full):** Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the EARLY FLOWERING 4 family. .
- **Key Domains:** EARLY_FLOWERING_4. (IPR040462); EARLY_FLOWERING_4_dom. (IPR009741); Elf4 (PF07011)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ELF4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ELF4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ELF4** (gene ID: ELF4, UniProt: O04211) in ARATH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive Research Report: Arabidopsis ELF4 (At2g40080) – Functional Annotation and Recent Advances

Identity and verification
- Target studied: Arabidopsis thaliana EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), a core component of the plant Evening Complex (EC) with ELF3 and LUX; the analysis below strictly concerns the Arabidopsis EC context and excludes non-plant genes with the same symbol. The EC composition and roles cited here are confirmed in Arabidopsis-focused studies and reviews (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 15-15, wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).
- Family/domains: Literature characterizes ELF4 as a small, largely alpha-helical/coiled‑coil protein that serves as a structural subunit of the EC; EC functions as a three‑protein transcriptional repressor complex assembled with LUX (DNA-binding) and ELF3 (scaffold/thermosensor) (publication year 2024) (mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Evening Complex (EC) definition: The EC (ELF3–ELF4–LUX) is a dusk‑phased nuclear repressor complex central to the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator; it integrates environmental cues to tune daily rhythms and growth (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).
- Molecular function: Within the EC, LUX provides sequence‑specific DNA binding, ELF3 acts as a scaffold and thermosensor, and ELF4 stabilizes/bridges complex assembly; collectively, the EC represses transcription of evening/midday clock and output genes, maintaining ~24‑hour rhythms (2024; URL: —) (mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106).
- Primary clock targets: In Arabidopsis, EC repression encompasses TOC1, LUX, GI, PRR7 and PRR9, consistent with EC’s role in sustaining morning gene activity (CCA1/LHY) through repression of evening/day genes (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).

Biological processes and pathways
- Circadian clock: EC activity establishes evening‑phased repression necessary for robust circadian oscillations; EC mutants (including elf4) show short‑period or arrhythmic phenotypes with broad transcriptomic impacts (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 15-15, wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).
- Photoperiodic flowering: The EC is a negative regulator of flowering; genetic analyses under LD (16L/8D) and SD (8L/16D) using elf4-209 and other EC mutants, and double mutants with PHYB, CO, GI, SOC1 and FT, position EC upstream of the GI–CO–FT pathway and photoreceptor inputs (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 3-3).
- Temperature responses and growth: Through ELF3’s thermosensory properties and EC integrity, the complex represses thermo-responsive growth regulators such as PIF4; temperature-dependent EC DNA binding and complex assembly modulate thermomorphogenesis outputs (publication year 2024) (mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104).

Subcellular localization
- The EC localizes to the nucleus where it binds target promoters and represses transcription; this nuclear localization is reported in Arabidopsis mechanistic studies (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).

Key targets and regulatory connections
- Direct/primary targets: Arabidopsis EC directly represses TOC1, LUX, GI, PRR7, and PRR9, among others, coordinating core clock dynamics and outputs (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).
- Growth and thermomorphogenesis: EC control of PIF4 connects clock phase to elongation growth and temperature-regulated development (publication year 2024) (mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106).
- Photoperiod pathway: Genetic epistasis places EC upstream of GI/CO/FT outputs and interacting with PHYB; functional data also implicate EC connections with COP1/ELF3 axes and GI stability/distribution (Arabidopsis-focused summaries; URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025; and functional evidence from ELF4-like studies in pear with assays in Arabidopsis, URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-024-05850-7; Nov 2024) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 15-15, liu2024dualrolesof pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Genome-wide targeting and conservation (2023): In Brachypodium distachyon, EC components (ELF3–LUX) directly repress a large regulon (~671 genes) including GI, multiple PRRs, PIF4, VRN1 and PPD1; this illustrates conserved EC logic linking photoperiod sensing to flowering and growth across monocots and informs Arabidopsis EC function (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03082-w; Nov 2023) (gao2023phytochromestransmitphotoperiod pages 4-7).
- Chromatin remodeling link (mechanistic advance): In Arabidopsis, a LUX–SWI3C module modulates GI chromatin compaction and H3K4me3 in a photoperiod-dependent manner, impacting day-length discrimination; EC components do not preclude LUX–SWI3C interaction, highlighting a direct bridge from EC to epigenetic regulation (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 16-16, wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).
- Temperature-responsive EC dynamics (2024): EC DNA binding and assembly are temperature sensitive via ELF3’s prion-like domain and phase separation; EC repression of PIF4 is relaxed at elevated temperature, linking the clock to thermomorphogenesis (publication year 2024) (mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104).
- Systems-level circadian communication (2024): Plant clocks exhibit inter-organ communication; reviews summarize shoot-root signaling and note movement of clock factors such as ELF4 in interorgan coupling, supporting broader roles for EC components in systemic timing (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-024-00003-3; Jun 2024) ().

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Crop photoperiod adaptation: EC genes (ELF3/ELF4/LUX) are central targets for tuning photoperiod sensitivity and flowering time; leveraging allelic diversity in clock genes is proposed to develop climate-resilient, productive crops (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-023-04324-8; Feb 2024) ().
- Translational insight from monocots (2023): In Brachypodium, phytochrome-ELF3 interactions convey photoperiod information to EC, regulating PPD1 and VRN1; analogous strategies in crops can modulate flowering under changing day lengths (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03082-w; Nov 2023) (gao2023phytochromestransmitphotoperiod pages 4-7).
- Horticultural and perennials: ELF4-like genes in pear delayed flowering and influenced senescence when expressed in Arabidopsis, supporting the feasibility of manipulating ELF4-family function to adjust flowering and longevity traits (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-024-05850-7; Nov 2024) (liu2024dualrolesof pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Reviews and perspectives in 2023–2024 emphasize the EC (ELF3–ELF4–LUX) as a key node integrating light, temperature, and metabolic signals to coordinate development; they also highlight emerging epigenetic links and organelle-to-clock signaling (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2023.2231202; Jul 2023; and https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (gao2023phytochromestransmitphotoperiod pages 4-7, wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).

Relevant statistics and data
- Genome-wide targets: 671 genes in Brachypodium were both bound by ELF3 and upregulated in elf3 mutants, indicating direct repression by the EC; targets included GI, PRR genes, PIF4, and key flowering regulators (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03082-w; Nov 2023) (gao2023phytochromestransmitphotoperiod pages 4-7).
- Photoperiod phenotyping: Arabidopsis EC mutant flowering was quantified by rosette leaf number at bolting under LD 16L/8D and SD 8L/16D, demonstrating EC’s role in distinguishing day length (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 3-3).
- Epigenetic regulation: Photoperiod-sensitive changes in GI chromatin compaction and H3K4me3 linked to LUX–SWI3C provide mechanistic, quantitative epigenetic evidence for EC-mediated photoperiod sensing (URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 16-16, wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2).

Mechanistic model summary
- ELF4 contributes structurally to the EC that binds LUX binding sites at dusk to repress evening/day genes (TOC1, PRR7/PRR9, GI), thereby sustaining morning gene expression and circadian phase. Under inductive long days or elevated temperatures, EC repression relaxes through phytochrome signaling and temperature-sensitive EC dynamics, enabling activation of GI–CO–FT and PIF4-mediated pathways to promote flowering and thermomorphogenesis (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1111/jipb.13889; Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03082-w; Nov 2023) (wang2025theluxswi3cmodule pages 2-2, gao2023phytochromestransmitphotoperiod pages 4-7, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 104-106, mironova2024phaseseparationof pages 101-104).
