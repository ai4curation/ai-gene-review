description: >
  ELF4 (EARLY FLOWERING 4) is a small nuclear protein (~111 aa) that is a core component
  of the Evening Complex (EC), a tripartite transcriptional repressor complex consisting
  of ELF4, ELF3, and LUX ARRHYTHMO. ELF4 functions as a structural subunit that forms
  homodimers and bridges interactions within the EC. The EC peaks at dusk and represses
  transcription of evening/midday clock genes (TOC1, PRR7, PRR9, GI) and growth-promoting
  transcription factors (PIF4, PIF5), thereby maintaining circadian rhythms with ~24-hour
  periodicity. ELF4 is essential for clock accuracy, entrainment to environmental cycles,
  and sustained rhythms under constant conditions. Loss of ELF4 results in arrhythmicity,
  early flowering in non-inductive photoperiods, and elongated hypocotyls. ELF4 also
  mediates phytochrome B signaling and is induced by red light.

      ELF4 nuclear localization is well-established. The Evening Complex (ELF4-ELF3-LUX)
      localizes to the nucleus where it binds target promoters and represses transcription
      [PMID:21753751, PMID:14605220, PMID:22327739]. UniProt also confirms nuclear
      localization with diffuse distribution, and targeting to nuclear bodies after

      This term is derived from UniProt keyword mapping. While ELF4 is involved in
      phytochrome signaling, particularly phyB-mediated responses, "phototransduction"
      typically refers to sensory transduction in photoreceptor cells. ELF4's role is
      more accurately described as involvement in the phytochrome signaling pathway
      downstream of light perception.
    action: MODIFY

      "Phototransduction" is not the most accurate term. ELF4 functions in the
      phytochrome B signaling pathway but is not a phototransduction component per se.

    summary: >
      This annotation is derived from the UniProt "Flowering" keyword. While ELF4
      affects flowering time (elf4 mutants flower early), ELF4 does not directly
      participate in flower development/organogenesis. Rather, ELF4 regulates the
      timing of the floral transition through its role in the circadian clock and
      photoperiodism. The appropriate terms are "regulation of flower development"
      or "photoperiodism, flowering".
    action: MODIFY

      ELF4 regulates flowering TIME, not flower development per se. The gene affects

      "Rhythmic process" (GO:0048511) is a parent of "circadian rhythm" (GO:0007623),
      which is in turn a parent of the more specific terms annotated for ELF4. While
      not incorrect, this general annotation adds no information beyond what is
      captured by the specific circadian annotations with experimental evidence.

core_functions:
  - description: >
      ELF4 is an essential structural subunit of the Evening Complex (EC), a tripartite
      nuclear transcriptional repressor consisting of ELF4, ELF3, and LUX. ELF3 bridges
      ELF4 and LUX. The EC peaks at dusk and directly represses evening/midday clock
      genes (TOC1, PRR7, PRR9, GI, LUX) and growth-promoting transcription factors
      (PIF4, PIF5) by binding their promoters via LUX's DNA-binding domain. ELF4 forms
      homodimers and is essential for EC function.

      ELF4 is a core component of the plant circadian oscillator, functioning within
      the CCA1/LHY-TOC1 feedback loop. ELF4 promotes clock accuracy and is required
      for sustained rhythms under constant conditions. Loss of ELF4 results in
      arrhythmicity. ELF4 is also necessary for entrainment of the circadian clock
      to environmental cycles.

      Through its role in the circadian clock, ELF4 is essential for photoperiod
      perception and measurement of day length. The EC negatively regulates flowering
      by repressing activators of the GI-CO-FT pathway. elf4 mutants flower early in
      non-inductive photoperiods due to elevated CO expression.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise molecular mechanism by which ELF4 homodimerization contributes to Evening Complex function? Mutations affecting ELF4 homodimer stability impair circadian function, but the structural basis for how dimerization affects EC assembly and activity is unclear.

  - question: Does ELF4 have functions independent of the Evening Complex? While most ELF4 functions are attributed to the EC, ELF4 may have EC-independent roles, particularly in interorgan communication of circadian signals.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >
      Structure-function analysis of ELF4 homodimer interface to determine which residues
      are critical for dimerization and how this affects EC assembly, DNA binding, and
      transcriptional repression.
    hypothesis: Specific residues at the ELF4 dimer interface are critical for EC assembly and function.

  - description: >
      Time-resolved ChIP-seq of ELF4 across the circadian cycle to map the complete set
      of ELF4/EC target genes and how binding changes with circadian phase to better
      understand EC function.
    hypothesis: ELF4/EC binding to target promoters varies with circadian phase and correlates with target gene repression.
