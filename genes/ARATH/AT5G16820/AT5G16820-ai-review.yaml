description: >-
  HSFA1B (Heat Stress Transcription Factor A-1b) is a co-master regulator of the heat stress
  response functioning with equal status to HSFA1A, with substantial functional redundancy
  underpinned by overlapping target genes that are essential for plant thermotolerance. The protein
  recognizes heat shock elements (HSEs) including both the canonical triplet repeat motif and a
  unique HSE1b variant (5'-AGAAnnTTCT-3'), enabling direct regulation of approximately 952 genes
  encompassing heat shock proteins, secondary transcription factors, and developmental regulators.
  HSFA1B uniquely integrates environmental stress signals with developmental programs through direct
  activation of developmental genes under both benign and stress conditions, influencing seed yield
  and plant architecture. The protein transitions between a repressed cytoplasmic state (maintained
  by HSP70/HSP90 interaction) and an active nuclear state through two distinct pathways: acute
  heat stress-induced dissociation from molecular chaperones, and light-dependent warm temperature
  signaling via COP1-BIN2 regulation, enabling coordinated responses to multifactorial environmental
  conditions.

      to heat shock elements (HSEs) in target gene promoters. IBA evidence is appropriate given

      inactive. Upon heat stress, HSFA1B translocates to the nucleus where it becomes active.

      PMID:20229063 documents heat stress-induced changes in HSFA1B expression or related
      transcriptional responses. IEP (Inferred from Expression Pattern) evidence reflects
      observation that HSFA1B expression or activity changes in response to heat stimulus,
      typically measured through RNA-seq, microarray, or qPCR analysis. The deep research
      documents: "Upon exposure to heat stress, HSFA1B undergoes rapid nuclear translocation,
      a process coordinated with dissociation from HSP70 and HSP90. Temperature sensing appears
      to occur through HSP70-mediated titration; when cell protein damage increases during heat
      stress, the accumulation of unfolded proteins competes with HSFA1B for binding to HSP70,
      effectively releasing HSFA1B from repression." The annotation captures the biological
      process dimension of HSFA1B function (heat response) in contrast to molecular function
      (DNA binding) and cellular component (nucleus) annotations. This represents a core function
      of HSFA1B as a heat-responsive regulator.

    Co-master regulation of cellular heat stress response through direct transcriptional
    activation of the heat shock protein cascade and secondary transcription factors. HSFA1B
    functions as an equal partner with HSFA1A in controlling heat-responsive gene expression,

    Upon heat stress, HSFA1B undergoes nuclear translocation via HSP70/HSP90 dissociation,

    952 target genes including HSP17, HSP70, HSP90, HSP101, and secondary regulators (HSFA2,

    Integration of environmental stress signals with plant developmental programs through

    Light-dependent regulation of developmental responses to warm temperature through

    distinct from heat stress-induced activation. This pathway involves COP1 inhibition of
    BIN2 kinase, preventing BIN2-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSFA1B's nuclear localization
    signal and enabling constitutive nuclear accumulation. In the nucleus, HSFA1B directly
    interacts with and stabilizes PIF4 (phytochrome-interacting factor 4), preventing its
    interaction with photoactivated phytochrome and thereby enhancing PIF4 activity in
    promoting hypocotyl growth and other warm-temperature morphogenic responses. This function
