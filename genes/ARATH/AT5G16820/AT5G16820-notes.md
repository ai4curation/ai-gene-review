# HSFA1B (AT5G16820) Curation Notes

## Gene Summary
**Co-master regulator** of heat stress response with HSFA1A - functionally redundant but with some distinct properties [deep-research:perplexity]

## Core Function (Molecular Activity)
- **DNA-binding transcription factor** - binds heat shock elements (HSE) [deep-research]
- Recognizes **novel HSE1b variant**: 5'-AGAAnnTTCT-3' (distinct from canonical HSE) [deep-research]
- Forms **homotrimers** for high-affinity DNA binding [deep-research]
- Contains **AHA activation domain** [deep-research]

## Relationship to HSFA1A

### Functional Redundancy:
- Both are **master regulators** of heat stress response
- **Triple KO (hsfa1a/b/d)** → dramatic thermotolerance defects [deep-research]
- **Quadruple KO (hsfa1a/b/d/e)** → complete loss of acquired thermotolerance
- Both cooperate in early heat shock gene expression [deep-research]

### Distinct Properties:
- HSFA1B recognizes **HSE1b variant** (AGAAnnTTCT) - ~55 specific target genes [deep-research]
- HSFA1A is **predominant** master regulator (stronger activity)
- HSFA1B has unique role in **reproductive fitness** and **seed yield** [deep-research]
- HSFA1B regulates **developmental genes** under benign and stress conditions [deep-research]

## Key Biological Processes

### Heat Stress Response (PRIMARY/CORE)
- Co-master regulator with HSFA1A [deep-research]
- Activates HSP genes: HSP17, HSP70, HSP90, HSP101 [deep-research]
- Essential for thermotolerance alongside HSFA1A [deep-research]
- Activates HSFA2 and other secondary HSFs [deep-research]

### Thermomorphogenesis (CORE)
- Integrates environmental stress signals with developmental programs [deep-research]
- Coordinates plant growth and reproduction [deep-research]
- Light-dependent signaling pathways [deep-research]
- Influences developmental architecture [deep-research]

### Reproductive Fitness & Development (DISTINCT from HSFA1A)
- Influences **seed yield** [deep-research]
- Regulates developmental genes under both benign and stress conditions [deep-research]
- Broader developmental role than HSFA1A [deep-research]

## Regulation of HSFA1B

### By Molecular Chaperones (Same as HSFA1A)
- **HSP70/HSP90 bind to TDR domain** → inactive state [deep-research]
- Heat stress → dissociation → trimerization → nuclear translocation [deep-research]
- **Nuclear export signal (NES)** maintains cytoplasmic localization under normal conditions [deep-research]

### Subcellular Dynamics
- Constitutively in **both cytoplasm and nucleus** under normal conditions [deep-research]
- More prominent **nuclear translocation** upon heat stress [deep-research]
- Light-dependent signaling influences localization [deep-research]

## Protein Interactions
- **HSP70** - regulatory interaction (TDR domain) [deep-research]
- **HSP90** - regulatory interaction (TDR domain) [deep-research]
- **HSFA1A, HSFA1D, HSFA1E** - functional redundancy/cooperation [deep-research]
- Forms **heteromeric complexes** with other class A1 HSFs [deep-research]

## Subcellular Localization
- **Cytoplasm** (under normal conditions, maintained by NES) [deep-research]
- **Nucleus** (constitutive low level, increased upon heat stress) [deep-research]
- Dynamic stress-dependent redistribution [deep-research]

## Target Genes (Direct)
- **HSP genes**: HSP17, HSP70, HSP90, HSP101 (overlapping with HSFA1A) [deep-research]
- **~55 genes with HSE1b motif** (HSFA1B-specific subset) [deep-research]
- **Secondary HSFs**: HSFA2, others in transcriptional cascade [deep-research]
- **Developmental genes** (unique to HSFA1B role) [deep-research]
- Hundreds of genes in regulatory network [deep-research]

## Genetic Evidence
- **Double KO (hsfa1a/b)**:
  - Impaired heat stress response [deep-research]
  - Reduced thermotolerance [deep-research]
- **Triple KO (hsfa1a/b/d)**:
  - Dramatic thermotolerance defects [deep-research]
  - Globally impaired heat-responsive gene expression [deep-research]
- **Quadruple KO (hsfa1a/b/d/e)**:
  - Complete loss of acquired thermotolerance [deep-research]
  - Essential role confirmed [deep-research]
- **Single mutants**:
  - Mild phenotypes (due to functional redundancy) [deep-research]

## Expression Pattern
- **Constitutive expression** (like HSFA1A) [deep-research]
- **Induced by heat stress** [deep-research]
- **Induced by warm temperature** [deep-research]
- Expression throughout development [deep-research]

## Structural Features
- **DNA-binding domain (DBD)** with helix-turn-helix motif [deep-research]
- **Oligomerization domain (HR-A/B)** - three-stranded coiled-coil [deep-research]
- **TDR domain** (temperature-dependent repression) - mediates HSP70/90 interaction [deep-research]
- **C-terminal activation domain (CTAD)** with AHA motifs [deep-research]
- **Nuclear export signal (NES)** in regulatory domain [deep-research]

## Functional Specialization within Class A1

### Class A1 Family Roles:
- **HSFA1A + HSFA1B**: Primary heat stress response, strongest activity
- **HSFA1D**: Intermediate activity, salt/osmotic stress contribution
- **HSFA1E**: No thermotolerance alone, strong salt/osmotic tolerance
- **Subfunctionalization** enables stress-type specific responses

### HSFA1B-Specific Features:
- HSE1b recognition (~55 specific genes)
- Reproductive fitness and seed yield influence
- Developmental gene regulation beyond stress
- Broader integration of stress + development

## Curation Strategy
1. **ACCEPT** core heat stress response annotations (same as HSFA1A)
2. **ACCEPT** DNA-binding transcription factor activity
3. **ACCEPT** nucleus and cytoplasm localization
4. **NOTE** functional redundancy with HSFA1A - annotations will overlap
5. **ADD** if missing:
   - Master regulator function (co-regulator with HSFA1A)
   - HSE1b-specific binding (if specific enough GO term exists)
   - Developmental/reproductive role
   - Thermomorphogenesis
6. **DISTINGUISH** where possible from HSFA1A's predominant role

## Key Similarities to HSFA1A
- Both master regulators
- Both constitutively expressed
- Both essential for thermotolerance (triple/quadruple KO)
- Both bind HSEs and activate HSP genes
- Both regulated by HSP70/HSP90

## Key Differences from HSFA1A
- HSFA1B recognizes HSE1b variant (HSFA1B-specific targets)
- HSFA1B has stronger developmental/reproductive role
- HSFA1A is predominant (stronger activity)
- HSFA1B has nuclear export signal
