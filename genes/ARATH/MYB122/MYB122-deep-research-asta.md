## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9C9C8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transcription factor MYB122; AltName: Full=Myb-related protein 122; Short=AtMYB122;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MYB122; OrderedLocusNames=At1g74080; ORFNames=F2P9.5;
- **Organism (full):** Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Homeodomain-like_sf. (IPR009057); Myb_dom. (IPR017930); Myb_TF_plants. (IPR015495); SANT/Myb. (IPR001005); Myb_DNA-binding (PF00249)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MYB122" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MYB122' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MYB122** (gene ID: MYB122, UniProt: Q9C9C8) in ARATH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > The UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/) can perform ID mapping on the UniProt ID of each protein to obtain corresponding annotation information, including Entry name, Protein name, Gene name, Organism, and Length.
    > Note: Considering the efficiency and readability of subsequent analysis, users need to convert the ID in the raw data. In this protocol, we choose to convert UniProt ID to Gene Symbol, and when multiple UniProt ID correspond to one Gene Symbol, we can use the make.unique() function to add a serial number to Gene Symbol to make it unique.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > The protein sequences were functionally annotated by combining information retrieved from the UniProt database ( [25], accessed on 9 June 2022) and one-to-one fast orthology assignments using the eggNOG-mapper v.2.1.7 tool ( [26], accessed on 9 June 2022), as described in [27]. Briefly, the gene name, protein name, length, Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, and chromosome associated with each protein entry were obtained from UniProt using the retrieve/ID mapping tool. Additionally, gene names, descriptions, and experimentally validated GO IDs were obtained from eggNOG, with consideration given to a taxonomic scope auto-adjusted per query, a minimum hit bit-score of 60, and thresholds of 80% for identity, minimum query coverage, and minimum subject coverage.
    > Out of the 130 detected proteins, 71 (54.6%) had information manually verified by UniProt curators (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.5). Utilizing the eggNOG-mapper v2.1.7 tool, a total of 122 entries were scanned (Supplementary Spreadsheet S1.6). By combining data from both tools, a total of 123 proteins were characterized with a gene name, and 127 had GO information. However, 2 proteins still lacked information on a descrip-tion, protein, gene, and preferred names. Figure 1 provides a summary of the functional annotation results.

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

To create this file, lists of linked proteins and gene identifiers are downloaded from UniProt and merged using gene names. Several rules need to be considered when merging the files • UniProt annotation prevails over the gene Ensembl annotation when the same gene Ensembl identifier points toward different UniProt identifiers. • UniProt and Ensembl lists are also merged by their UniProt identifier, but this information is used only when the UniProt or Ensembl identifier is missing in the original list merged by gene name. • If the same gene name points toward different HGNC symbols, only the HGNC symbol matching the gene name annotation is considered. • Only one HLA isoform is considered in our interaction analysis, and it is stored in a manually HLA-curated list of genes, named HLA_curated.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts. A subsequent blastx search against the Swiss-Prot database (downloaded from NCBI 07/02/2021) for transcripts without a sufficient hit was conducted using the parameters max_target_seqs 2, max_hsps 1, e-value 0.001 and qcov_hsp_perc 80. Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > HymenopteraMine provides a report for each entity in the database. Each report is divided into sections including 'Summary', 'Gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Protein', 'Function', 'Homology', 'Others' or a subset of those categories, depending on the identifier searched. For example, searching a protein identifier would provide sections relevant to proteins. Each section of the report provides information in the form of a table that can be customized and downloaded in various formats. The Summary section of a Gene Report provides gene identifiers, symbols, description, organism, chromosome, strand and other identifiers such as aliases (identifiers from previous OGS versions) and database cross references. The Transcripts section provides information about the gene model (transcripts, exons, coding sequences) and gives a visual representation of the gene model highlighting the structure of the gene. Users can download FASTA-formatted sequences for each type of feature provided in the gene model section. Links are provided to JBrowse and to NCBI gene pages, when applicable. Transcript identifiers are linked to Transcript Reports, which include a Gene Expression section that provides raw read counts, normalized read counts, FPKM and RPKM values for RNAseq data with SRA metadata. The Protein section of the Gene Report includes protein name, accession and length. The protein name/accession numbers are linked to Protein Reports, with more information including protein family, GO annotations, InterPro domains, related publications, protein features, and curated notes from UniProt describing tissue specificity, function and developmental stages. The Function section provides GO annotation with evidence codes from the Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component ontologies. Clicking on the symbols to the right of each GO term leads to the directed acyclic graph showing all parents and children of the term, developed using the BioJS DAG Viewer (50). Clicking on a GO term provides a report for that term, a list of genes annotated with that term and tables showing relationships to other GO terms. The Homologue sec-tion lists homologues in other hymenopteran species and Drosophila melanogaster. The 'Other' section provides publications and a list of overlapping features.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

- Summary: The results indicate that P. tricornutum continued carbon dioxide reduction when population growth was arrested and different carbon-concentrating mechanisms were used dependent upon exogenous DIC levels, and suggest that the build-up of precursors to the acetyl-CoA carboxylases may play a more significant role in TAG synthesis rather than the actual enzyme levels of acetyl

    > Cufflinks output files had transcripts identified by uniprot accessions. Using the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) [67] Gene ID conversion tool, uniprot accessions were converted to Locus Tag IDs and Protein IDs. Once all accessions were converted, the DAVID Functional Annotation tool was used to retrieve gene names as well as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) Pathway information. For genes that were identified as hypothetical proteins, searches were performed on the JGI Phaeodactylum tricornutum v2.0 genome website (http://genome.jgi-psf. org/Phatr2/Phatr2.home.html) and based on best hits, % ID, score, and consistency of the top hits, genes were either identified or remained as hypothetical. Genes were also searched on NCBI and ENSEMBL genome browsers for cross-referencing. To assign genes into pathways, we used KEGG maps for P. tricornutum as a backbone. Genes for major pathways were searched manually to find genes not directly annotated in the P. tricornutum KEGG maps. Gene lists were compiled for the major pathways and developed into network maps.
    > Organelle targeting for transcript products was done based on annotations from the databases of JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL. If no localization was found, eukaryotic organelle localizations were predicted with TargetP 1.1. server [68] in both plant and non-plant mode. Amino acid sequences were also checked for a peroxisomal targeting sequence (SKL, serine-lysine-leucine). If potential targeting was not identified, we assumed that the gene product occurred in the cytoplasm. If the gene was an integral membrane protein we again checked JGI, NCBI, and ENSEMBL, and if targeting could not be determined we located the gene in the most biologically relevant membrane (e.g., light harvesting complex in the plastid).

    > The database enables searching by gene symbols/names, GenBank accession numbers, UniGene cluster IDs, Swiss-Prot entry names and several unique clone IDs (IMAGE clone IDs, University of Iowa clone IDs, Operon oligo IDs, TAIR IDs and a subset of selected Affymetrix and Agilent IDs).
    > The names and symbols of genes/proteins may be highly ambiguous [20]. We therefore recommend using primary gene IDs, like GeneBank accession numbers or specific probe IDs when querying the database. However, if gene names or symbols are used, caution is advised because only official names/symbols associated with UniProt knowledgebase will be recognized. The underlying database is updated on a weekly basis with annotation information from several external databases including UniGene, Swiss-Prot, Entrez Gene and GO. User data are submitted to the database as text files of gene reporters and analysis of the annotation data can be performed through three user interfaces: the NMC Annotation Tool, the GO Annotator Tool and eGOn. Analysis results and annotation data can be exported in various formats.

    > In transcriptomics and proteomics studies, one important step of data analysis is the functional annotation of obtained lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or proteins (DEPs). With the increase in the number of organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes, such studies have been performed in many different species. However, the information about gene and protein functions, on which the annotation is based, is mainly derived from a limited number of model organisms or well-annotated species, such as mouse, humans and rat representing mammalian species or even from bacteria, yeast, worms or Drosophila. Based on the assumption that orthologous genes carry out identical or biologically equivalent functions in different organisms, functional annotation is transferred from wellstudied organisms to less well-annotated species (1). Whereas orthologous genes usually have maintained the same function during evolution (2) paralogous genes originated from gene duplication events and often evolved different functions (3,4). Orthologous genes usually have the same gene symbol and name for almost all corresponding species (5, 6). However, depending on the status of the gene annotation of a species, not all annotated genes have an official gene symbol (only locus number, e.g. LOC100152218 60S ribosomal protein L23a-like) and/or are assigned to functional annotation databases like their corresponding orthologs in the well-annotated model organisms. This leads to a substantial loss of information if the gene identifiers (IDs) of the respective species are used for functional annotation. To avoid this data loss and improve the results of functional annotation, one strategy is to transfer information from homologous genes (orthologs and paralogs) of well-annotated species (6).
    > In many situations with non-model species such as livestock species, experimentalists avoid the additional work to assign human ortholog genes for functional annotation analysis and are not aware of the information loss.

UniProt identifier cross-referencing allowed mapping of gene annotations to the gene sets retrieved from Ensembl and other sources. The UniProt data were also employed to comprehensively map gene names and synonyms, as well as secondary gene identifiers and cross-referenced database gene identifiers, e.g. RefSeq, Entrez GeneID, GenBank, Protein Data Bank and Mendelian Inheritance in Man, as well as assigned Gene Ontology (GO) (44) attributes. The species-specific model organism databases (MGI, FlyBase and SGD) provided mapping to additional gene synonyms and identifiers as well as selected controlled-vocabulary gene phenotypes from relevant experimental data (Supplementary Table S2). Protein domain signatures were retrieved from InterPro (45) matches to the UniProt Archive (UniParc) of non-redundant protein sequences.

    > As input GeneSet2miRNA accepts several types of gene or protein identifiers. For example, for the human genome GeneSet2miRNA supports identifiers from 'Entrez Gene' (24), 'UniProt/Swiss-Prot', 'Gene Symbol' (24,25), 'UniGene' (24), 'Ensembl' (26), 'RefSeq Protein ID', 'RefSeq Transcript ID' ( 27) and 'Affymetrix probe codes' (28). Additionally a mixture of several identifier types is possible. In the first step user supplied gene Ids are mapped to 'Entrez Gene' identifiers. For this purpose files from NCBI and Affymetrix web sites are used. Detailed information on data sources used by GeneSet2miRNA is in Table 1.
    > The user gets full information on the mapping of the supplied gene ids. We would like to point out that protein and gene identifiers can be highly ambiguous (29) with multiple synonymous variants. For this reason the quality of the retrieved annotation can be different for different types of identifiers. To escape multiple mapping issues we recommend submitting 'Entrez Gene' identifies to GeneSet2miRNA.

    > The detailed gene page provides the mapped identification numbers and locus tags from different resources such as RefSeq, UniProt, NCBI, EMBL, etc., which enables easy access to different annotation sources of the same gene for comparison. The gene can be viewed in a Genome Browser, where it can be compared with other annotation sources. The Compare Region Viewer allows users to compare genomic regions around the gene of interest across other closely related genomes. Using this viewer, one can quickly detect differences in translation start sites, potential frame shifts or missing genes. In addition to the gene product annotation, other functional properties of the gene such as Gene Ontology, Enzyme Commission, FIGfam and pathway assignments, structure and protein-protein interaction information (if any) are also provided (Meyer et al., 2009). Supplementary Figure S5 shows an example graph for protein-protein interactions. The DNA and protein sequences can be downloaded. If the virulence gene, e.g. mbtB, was also found in other VF databases such as VFDB and Victors, the information from these databases about this gene is also provided.

A total of 2362 regulating factors for the human species (Homo Sapiens) were extracted and 70 entries, that did not describe proteins, but other regulatory factors were omitted. A large fraction (about 77 percent) of the remaining 2292 transcription factor proteins were mapped to Uniprot [27], either by external database ID's, or exact matches between protein names. With these accessions the protein coding gene IDs, as well as other information was downloaded automatically via a MATLAB based data retrieval algorithm implemented for this study. The transcript and probeset annotation files for the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array were downloaded from the manufacture's website http://www. affymetrix.com and parsed into MySQL tables. Transcript IDs for 98 percent of the human transcription factor coding genes were extracted based on direct matches between gene names.
    > Genes that can potentially be up regulated when the transcription factor protein binds to a specific site in its promoter region are called transcription factor target genes. We extracted all target genes for human transcription factor proteins by joining a number of database tables. This revealed 3296 gene targets for the 2292 transcription factor proteins. We used direct matches between the target gene names, as well as additional entries, to identify corresponding transcripts on the Affymetrix GeneChip. This resulted in matches for 83 percent of the target genes.
