description: 'CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) is a MYB-like transcription factor that serves as a core component of the plant circadian clock system. CCA1 functions as a central oscillator that regulates its own expression and that of other clock genes through transcriptional feedback loops. It binds to specific DNA sequences (evening elements) in target gene promoters to regulate circadian gene expression. CCA1 works synergistically with LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) as morning-expressed clock genes and forms both homodimers and heterodimers with LHY. The protein is involved in temperature compensation of the circadian clock and contributes to photoperiodic control of flowering time. CCA1 is nuclear localized and undergoes phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (CK2) which is essential for its circadian oscillator function.'
