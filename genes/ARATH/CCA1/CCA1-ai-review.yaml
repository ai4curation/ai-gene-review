description: CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) is a MYB-related transcription factor
  with a conserved SHAQKYF motif that serves as a core component of the plant circadian
  clock system. CCA1 functions as a master regulator that controls circadian rhythms
  through both transcriptional repression and activation depending on target gene
  context. It binds to specific cis-regulatory elements including evening elements
  (EE) and CCA1-binding sites (CBS) in target gene promoters such as APRR1/TOC1, TCP21/CHE,
  CAB2A, CAB2B, JMJ14, and BHLH80/FBH1. CCA1 works synergistically with LHY (LATE
  ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL) as morning-expressed clock genes and forms both homodimers
  and heterodimers with LHY, as well as larger protein complexes with CK2 subunits
  (CKB1, CKB2, CKB3) and co-regulators LNK1 and LNK2. The protein undergoes phosphorylation
  by casein kinase 2 (CK2) which modulates its DNA-binding affinity and is essential
  for temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Beyond circadian regulation,
  CCA1 modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress responses through the unfolded protein
  response (UPR), regulates reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and influences developmental
  processes including hypocotyl elongation, flowering time, and leaf movements. CCA1
  is nuclear localized where it functions as part of multi-protein transcriptional
  complexes.

    label: circadian rhythm
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9657153
  review:
    summary: Fifth circadian rhythm annotation with TAS evidence from the foundational
      paper establishing CCA1 role in circadian clock. This is the strongest evidence
      for CCA1 core function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This TAS evidence comes from the seminal paper that established CCA1 as
      a core component of the circadian clock. This represents the strongest evidence
      for its primary biological function.

    unfolded protein response and ER stress recovery in a time-dependent manner
  proposed_parent:
    id: GO:0034976
    label: response to endoplasmic reticulum stress
  justification: Falcon research indicates CCA1 is involved in the regulation of endoplasmic
    reticulum (ER) stress responses. By modulating target genes involved in the unfolded
    protein response (UPR), CCA1 helps facilitate recovery from ER stress, thereby
    coupling the circadian clock to cellular proteostasis mechanisms
