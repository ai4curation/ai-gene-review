description: Heat stress transcription factor A-1d (HSFA1D) is a co-master regulator
  of the heat stress response, functioning with equal status alongside HSFA1A and
  HSFA1B to activate protective gene expression programs essential for thermotolerance.
  HSFA1D is uniquely distinguished among class A1 HSFs by integration with light signaling
  through CRY1 photoreceptor, circadian clock components (CCA1/LHY), and brassinosteroid
  pathways (BIN2/COP1), enabling light-induced thermotolerance, time-of-day gated
  stress responses, and thermomorphogenic development. The protein exhibits intermediate
  activity for heat stress response compared to HSFA1A/B and contributes to broader
  stress responses including chilling tolerance and salt/osmotic stress.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: HSFA1D is a DNA-binding transcription factor that specifically binds
      heat shock elements (HSE, 5'-nGAAn-3' repeats) in target gene promoters to activate
      heat stress-responsive genes. The protein contains a conserved winged helix-turn-helix
      DNA-binding domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects the core molecular function of HSFA1D.
      Extensive evidence demonstrates HSFA1D binds HSEs and activates transcription
      of heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90, small HSPs) and secondary transcription
      factors (HSFA2, DREB2A). The IBA inference is phylogenetically sound as this
      function is conserved across plant HSFA1 proteins.

- description: Brassinosteroid-integrated transcriptional activator regulated by BIN2
    kinase phosphorylation (which reduces nuclear localization and DNA-binding) and
    COP1-mediated antagonism of BIN2, enabling coordination of growth hormone signaling
    with stress responses and thermomorphogenic hypocotyl elongation through PIF4
    interaction and stabilization

    supporting_text: BIN2 kinase interacts with and phosphorylates HSFA1d, which diminishes
      both nuclear localization and DNA-binding affinity. When brassinosteroid signaling
      is activated, it inhibits BIN2 activity, leading to restoration of HSFA1d nuclear
      translocation. COP1 can counteract BIN2-directed inhibition of HSFA1d nuclear
      translocation. HSFA1d stabilizes PIF4 protein and promotes thermomorphogenesis.

    supporting_text: BIN2 phosphorylates HSFA1D, reduces nuclear localization and
      DNA-binding. COP1 inhibits BIN2, restores HSFA1D activity. BR signaling promotes
      HSFA1D function. Integrates growth (BR) with stress responses.

    supporting_text: HSFA1d acts as a positive regulator of growth under chilling
      conditions, with hsfa1d mutants showing reduced hypocotyl elongation compared
      to wild-type plants under chilling. HSFA1d promotes expression of ribosomal
      protein genes under chilling conditions, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
      demonstrated that HSFA1d binds directly to the promoter regions of ribosomal
      protein genes.

    supporting_text: Contributes to cold stress responses. Broader stress integration
      than just heat. HSFA1d does not show increased nuclear accumulation under chilling
      conditions, instead functioning through elevation of basal nuclear localization
      promoted by NPR1.
