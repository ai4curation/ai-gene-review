description: >-
  HSP17.7 (also known as At-HSP17.6A in older literature; locus At5g12030) is a 17.7 kDa
  cytosolic class II small heat shock protein (sHSP) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Like other sHSPs,
  it belongs to the HSP20/alpha-crystallin family characterized by a conserved alpha-crystallin
  domain (ACD). sHSPs function as ATP-independent holdase chaperones: they bind unfolding or
  denaturing substrate proteins to prevent irreversible aggregation, maintaining them in a
  soluble, refoldable state, but they do not actively refold substrates. Refolding requires
  subsequent transfer to ATP-dependent chaperone systems such as HSP70/DnaK. HSP17.7 forms
  oligomeric structures typical of sHSPs. Its expression is induced by heat stress and osmotic
  stress, and overexpression confers enhanced salt and drought tolerance. The chaperone
  (holdase) activity has been demonstrated in vitro (PMID:11576425).

    summary: >-
      HSP17.7 is a small heat shock protein whose expression is induced by heat stress
      (PMID:11576425). The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference across
      the HSP20 family, with extensive evidence from multiple plant sHSP orthologs. Response
      to heat is a core biological process for all sHSPs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Heat shock response is a defining characteristic of sHSPs. The annotation is supported
      by phylogenetic inference (IBA) and corroborated by direct experimental evidence from
      PMID:11576425, which demonstrated heat-inducible expression of this gene.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is proposed for obsoletion (go-ontology#30962).
      HSP17.7 is a classic sHSP holdase that binds unfolding proteins to prevent aggregation
      but does not actively refold them (PMID:11576425). Per UPB project decision rules, sHSPs
      should be reannotated to a holdase chaperone activity NTR when created. GO:0140309
      (unfolded protein carrier activity) does not fit because it was created for carrier-holdases
      (TIM chaperones) that escort substrates between compartments, whereas sHSPs are in-situ
      holdases. Retain GO:0051082 until the holdase NTR is available.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      sHSPs like HSP17.7 are ATP-independent holdases: they bind denaturing proteins to prevent
      aggregation in situ but do not actively refold them. GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone)
      is inappropriate because sHSPs do not catalyze folding. GO:0140309 does not fit because it
      is carrier-specific (created for TIM chaperones per go-ontology#30552). A general holdase
      chaperone activity NTR is needed. Retain GO:0051082 until this NTR exists.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The annotation of HSP17.7 to GO:0006457 (protein folding) via IBA is phylogenetically
      inferred. sHSPs participate in the broader protein folding pathway by preventing
      aggregation and maintaining substrates in a refoldable state, but they do not themselves
      catalyze folding (that is done by downstream ATP-dependent chaperones like HSP70). The
      involved_in relationship captures the broader pathway participation appropriately,
      though it should be understood that the sHSP contribution is specifically holdase/
      aggregation-prevention rather than active folding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While sHSPs do not actively fold proteins, they participate in the protein folding process
      by preventing irreversible aggregation and maintaining substrates in a folding-competent
      state. The BP annotation (involved_in protein folding) is acceptable at the process level
      -- the sHSP step is part of the broader protein quality control/folding pathway. The IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically sound for the HSP20 family.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The IBA annotation for response to salt stress is supported by phylogenetic inference.
      PMID:11576425 demonstrated that overproduction of At-HSP17.6A (=HSP17.7) increases
      salt tolerance in Arabidopsis, providing direct experimental support for this annotation
      in this specific gene. However, salt stress response is secondary to the core chaperone
      function and represents a stress-responsive phenotype rather than the primary molecular role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Salt stress response is a downstream phenotypic consequence of the holdase chaperone
      function rather than a core molecular activity. The gene is induced under osmotic stress
      and overexpression confers salt tolerance (PMID:11576425), but this reflects the
      protective role of the holdase rather than a salt-specific function. Kept as non-core.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The IBA annotation for response to hydrogen peroxide is phylogenetically inferred from
      other plant sHSP orthologs. Oxidative stress can induce sHSP expression and sHSP
      holdase activity can protect against oxidative damage. However, there is no direct
      experimental evidence for HSP17.7 specifically in hydrogen peroxide response. This is
      a plausible but peripheral function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Hydrogen peroxide response is likely a secondary stress-responsive role. The IBA inference
      is phylogenetically reasonable for the sHSP family, but it represents a peripheral stress
      response rather than the core holdase chaperone function. No direct experimental evidence
      for HSP17.7/O81822 specifically.

    label: protein complex oligomerization
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      sHSPs characteristically form large oligomeric complexes (typically 12-40mers) that
      dynamically dissociate and reassociate in response to stress. Oligomerization is
      fundamental to sHSP function: substrate binding occurs when the oligomer dissociates
      under stress. UniProt notes for HSP17.7 that it "may form oligomeric structures."
      The IBA annotation is well-supported across the sHSP family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Oligomerization is a core structural and functional property of sHSPs. The IBA annotation
      is phylogenetically sound and consistent with UniProt annotation. This is integral to
      chaperone mechanism, not a peripheral function.

      HSP17.7 is described as a cytosolic class II sHSP in the literature (PMID:11576425),

      also exists via TAS. This broader cytoplasm annotation is acceptable and consistent.
    action: ACCEPT

      Cytoplasmic localization is well-established for this cytosolic class II sHSP. The IEA

      This IEA annotation to the general term GO:0006950 (response to stress) is computed
      by ARBA machine learning models. It is a very broad term, and more specific stress
      response terms (response to heat GO:0009408, response to salt stress GO:0009651) are
      already annotated. While not wrong, this general term adds little information beyond
      the more specific annotations.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The broad IEA annotation is correct -- HSP17.7 is a stress-responsive protein. While
      more specific stress annotations exist, the general term from an automated pipeline is
      acceptable and not misleading. IEA annotations at broader levels than what is determined
      by IBA or literature are acceptable.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This HEP (high-throughput expression pattern) annotation is based on PMID:31519798,
      a multi-omic study of Arabidopsis seedlings under hypoxia. The paper found that hypoxia
      promoted "a progressive upregulation of heat stress transcripts, as evidenced by RNAPII
      binding and increased nuclear RNA." HSP17.7 is a heat stress transcript that was
      progressively upregulated under hypoxia. This is an expression-based annotation with
      the weaker "acts_upstream_of_or_within" qualifier, reflecting that the gene is
      transcriptionally responsive to hypoxia rather than having a demonstrated functional
      role in hypoxia response.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The HEP annotation reflects transcriptional upregulation during hypoxia rather than
      a demonstrated functional role. The paper describes progressive upregulation of heat
      stress genes during hypoxia (PMID:31519798), which is a secondary stress cross-talk
      phenomenon. This is a peripheral annotation, not a core function.

      The IDA annotation to protein folding is based on the in vitro chaperone activity
      demonstrated in PMID:11576425. The paper showed that At-HSP17.6A (=HSP17.7, O81822)
      possesses chaperone activity in vitro. However, the sHSP mechanism is holdase-type:
      it prevents aggregation of denaturing substrates but does not actively refold them.
      The "acts_upstream_of_or_within" qualifier used in the GOA is appropriate, as the sHSP
      participates in the protein folding pathway upstream of the actual folding step.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The BP annotation with "acts_upstream_of_or_within" qualifier is appropriate. sHSPs
      participate in the protein quality control and folding pathway by preventing aggregation
      and maintaining substrates for subsequent refolding by HSP70-type foldases. The in vitro
      chaperone assay in PMID:11576425 demonstrated this activity. While sHSPs do not
      themselves fold proteins, involvement in the folding process at the BP level is accurate.
