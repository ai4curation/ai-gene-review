description: >-
  LCR1 (Low-molecular-weight cysteine-rich protein 1) is a small secreted defensin-like
  peptide belonging to the DEFL family in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mature protein (~65
  amino acids after signal peptide cleavage) contains eight conserved cysteines forming
  four disulfide bonds characteristic of plant defensins. LCR1 is specifically expressed
  in flower buds and not detected in stems, roots, or rosette leaves (PMID:11437247).
  Within the LCR family, LCR1 clusters with "PCP-like" (pollen coat protein-like) members,
  suggesting a role at the pollen-stigma interface during pollination rather than in
  antimicrobial defense. While the broader DEFL family includes proteins with antimicrobial
  activity (PDF1.1/PDF1.2), no direct experimental evidence exists for antimicrobial
  activity of LCR1 specifically. The most parsimonious hypothesis is that LCR1 functions
  as a secreted cysteine-rich ligand involved in reproductive signaling at the
  pollen-stigma interface (file:ARATH/LCR1/LCR1-deep-research-falcon.md).

    summary: >-
      LCR1 is predicted to be secreted based on the presence of a cleavable signal
      peptide (residues 1-24). UniProt annotates subcellular location as "Secreted"
      with ISS evidence. The DEFL family members widely carry signal peptides and are
      predicted to be secreted. The deep research notes that LCR/SCRL/DEFL peptides are
      predicted to be secreted into the apoplast/extracellular space
      (file:ARATH/LCR1/LCR1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Strong computational prediction from signal peptide presence, supported by family

      as an extracellular signaling peptide at the pollen-stigma interface.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from the UniProtKB keyword "Plant defense" (KW-0611).
      While the DEFL family includes known antimicrobial peptides (e.g., PDF1.1/PDF1.2
      defensins), LCR1 specifically is a PCP-like member with flower bud-specific
      expression. No experimental evidence supports a defense role for LCR1.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The annotation derives from family-level keyword assignment but LCR1 falls within
      a subclade (PCP-like LCRs) that appears specialized for reproductive signaling
      rather than defense. The deep research notes that LCR1 is one of three PCP-like
      LCR genes reported as flower-bud specific, distinguishing them from defensin-like
      LCRs which show broader expression and antimicrobial function. The flower
      bud-restricted expression pattern is inconsistent with a primary defense role.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from the UniProtKB keyword "Fungicide" (KW-0295).
      While plant defensins as a class can have fungicidal activity, there is no
      experimental evidence that LCR1 specifically has antimicrobial or fungicidal
      activity. The deep research explicitly states that no direct antimicrobial
      activity for LCR1 has been reported.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is based solely on family membership inference, not any
      experimental evidence for LCR1. The protein is classified as a PCP-like
      (pollen coat protein-like) LCR with flower-specific expression, suggesting
      reproductive rather than antimicrobial function. The deep research report
      specifically notes that while plant defensins are classic antimicrobial peptides,
      "LCR1's direct antimicrobial activity is not reported". Retaining this annotation
      without experimental support would be over-annotation based on superficial
      family classification.

          Immunity/defense context: Plant defensins and defensin-like peptides are
          classic antimicrobial peptides, frequently pathogen-induced; some Arabidopsis
          LCRs are more closely related to the PDF1.1/PDF1.2 defensins and may have
          immune functions. This establishes a plausible defense-related role for some
          LCR/DEFL family members, though LCR1's direct antimicrobial activity is not
          reported

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword "Fungicide" (KW-0295). Like the
      related "killing of cells of another organism" annotation, this is based on
      family-level classification rather than experimental evidence for LCR1.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Same reasoning as for GO:0031640 - no experimental evidence supports antifungal
      activity for LCR1. The PCP-like classification and flower bud-specific expression
      pattern suggest reproductive function rather than defense. The keyword "Fungicide"
      appears to be assigned broadly to DEFL family members regardless of their
      specific subclade or expression pattern.

      This is a root term annotation indicating no molecular function data available.
      The specific molecular function of LCR1 remains unknown - it likely acts as a

      While LCR1 is predicted to be a secreted signaling peptide based on family

      appropriate until experimental data identifies the molecular mechanism.
      Annotating with a speculative MF term would be over-annotation.

      family characteristics strongly support extracellular localization.

      LCR1 expression is flower bud-specific and it clusters with PCP-like (pollen

      in pollination processes at the pollen-stigma interface.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Based on the flower bud-specific expression pattern, PCP-like classification,
      and detection of related DEFL peptides in pollen coat proteomes, involvement
      in pollination is strongly supported. This is a more accurate annotation than
      the defense-related terms that were assigned based on superficial family
      membership.
