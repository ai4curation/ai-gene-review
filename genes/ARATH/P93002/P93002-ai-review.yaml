description: NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1) is a master 
  transcriptional regulator that controls systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in 
  Arabidopsis. It functions as a salicylic acid (SA)-binding transcription 
  cofactor that activates defense gene expression through interactions with TGA 
  transcription factors. NPR1 undergoes dynamic regulation through 
  redox-dependent oligomerization, sumoylation, phosphorylation, and proteasomal
  degradation to provide tight control of plant immune responses.

    description: NPR1 functions as a transcription cofactor by bridging TGA 
      transcription factor dimers to form enhanceosomes that activate defense 
      gene expression [PMID:26269953, PMID:35545668]. This bridging function is 
      mediated through ankyrin repeats and requires nuclear localization.

        label: regulation of systemic acquired resistance
    description: NPR1 is the master regulator of systemic acquired resistance 
      (SAR), controlling the SA-mediated signaling pathway that confers 
      broad-spectrum immunity [PMID:9019406, PMID:11607555, PMID:17172357]. NPR1
      integrates SA perception with transcriptional activation of 
      pathogenesis-related genes.

        label: regulation of jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway
    description: NPR1 regulates defense responses to bacterial and fungal 
      pathogens, and mediates crosstalk between SA and jasmonic acid (JA) 
      signaling pathways [PMID:12615947, PMID:22699612]. NPR1 positively 
      regulates SA-dependent defenses while negatively regulating JA-dependent 
      responses.
