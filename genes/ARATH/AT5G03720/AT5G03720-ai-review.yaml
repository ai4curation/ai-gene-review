description: 'Heat stress transcription factor A3 (HSFA3) is a specialized transcriptional
  regulator essential for heat stress memory in Arabidopsis. Unlike other HSFs that
  mediate immediate heat responses, HSFA3 functions specifically during the recovery
  phase to maintain sustained expression of memory genes through epigenetic mechanisms.
  HSFA3 is activated by DREB2A approximately 4 hours after heat stress, translocates
  to the nucleus, and forms heteromeric complexes with HSFA2 that recruit H3K4 methyltransferases
  to establish long-lasting epigenetic marks. The forgetter3 (fgt3) mutant phenotype
  demonstrates normal acute thermotolerance but loses acquired thermotolerance 3 days
  after priming, confirming HSFA3 role as a memory specialist rather than an acute
  stress responder.'

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: HSFA3 is a class A heat shock transcription factor with conserved DNA-binding
      domain that recognizes and binds heat shock elements (HSE) in target promoters
      to activate transcription. The protein contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding
      domain and C-terminal AHA transactivation motifs characteristic of transcriptional
      activators.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects HSFA3 core molecular function as
      a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. The protein directly binds HSE
      sequences and activates memory gene transcription during heat stress recovery.
      IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference and confirmed by
      experimental evidence.

    supporting_text: 'Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid assays
      demonstrate direct protein-protein interaction between HSFA2 and HSFA3, mediated
      by their oligomerization domains. Molecular modeling and structural analysis
      suggests that HSFA2 and HSFA3 form part of a trimeric complex with an additional
      HSF protein. The heteromeric complexes containing both HSFA2 and HSFA3 are
      significantly more efficient at promoting transcriptional memory and recruiting
      H3K4 hyper-methylation than either protein alone'

    supporting_text: 'Trimeric structure: HSFA2/HSFA3/X (X = HSFA1A/B/D, HSFA7A,
      or HSFA6B). Direct interaction via oligomerization domains (co-IP, Y2H confirmed).
      Stable association: Persist for 3-day recovery period. Emergent properties:
      Heteromers >> individual proteins for memory. Both required: Double hsfa2 hsfa3
      mutant > single mutants for memory defects'
