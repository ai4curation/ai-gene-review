description: 'Salicylic acid (SA)-binding transcriptional co-activator that serves as a master regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and plant immunity. NPR1 functions as a substrate-specific adapter of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and forms enhanceosome complexes with TGA transcription factors to activate defense gene expression upon SA induction. Key player in SA/JA crosstalk, promoting SA-mediated immunity while suppressing JA-dependent defenses.'
