description: NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related Genes 1, also known as NIM1/SAI1)
  is a salicylic acid (SA)-binding transcriptional cofactor that serves as the master
  regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and SA-mediated plant immunity.
  Under basal conditions, NPR1 exists as redox-sensitive disulfide-linked oligomers
  sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon pathogen challenge and SA accumulation, a biphasic
  change in cellular reduction potential reduces these oligomers into active dimers
  and monomers that translocate to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NPR1 functions as
  both a transcriptional repressor (when unmodified and associated with WRKY70 at
  W-box elements) and activator (when sumoylated and associated with TGA transcription
  factors at as-1 elements). The protein contains critical structural domains including
  BTB/POZ and ankyrin repeats (particularly ANK2 repeat at residues 265-295) that
  mediate protein-protein interactions. NPR1 forms enhanceosome complexes with TGA
  factors in a TGA3(2)-NPR1(2)-TGA3(2) stoichiometry to activate defense genes like
  PR-1 and PR-2. As a substrate-specific adapter for CUL3-RBX1-BTB E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complexes, NPR1 mediates its own proteasomal degradation following phosphorylation
  at Ser-11 and Ser-15. The protein also functions as a key negative regulator of
  jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, creating essential SA/JA crosstalk that balances defense
  responses. Additionally, NPR1 controls programmed cell death during effector-triggered
  immunity, preventing excessive lesion expansion. This multifaceted regulation involves
  complex post-translational modifications including sumoylation, phosphorylation,
  and ubiquitination that precisely control NPR1 activity, stability, and subcellular
  localization.
