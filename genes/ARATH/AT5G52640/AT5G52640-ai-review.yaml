description: HSP90-1 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone specialized for 
  maturation and stabilization of signaling proteins. Unlike general chaperones 
  (Hsp70), HSP90-1 maintains client proteins in near-native, activation-ready 
  conformations through an ATP-driven conformational cycle. Works with extensive
  cochaperone network (SGT1, RAR1, TWD1, Hop, p23, Cdc37) to regulate diverse 
  clients including kinases, hormone receptors (TIR1), immune receptors (R 
  proteins), transcription factors (PIF4, ELF3), circadian proteins (ZTL), and 
  auxin transporters (ABCB). Essential for embryogenesis, with roles in 
  development, immunity, and stress responses. Homodimer that shuttles between 
  cytoplasm and nucleus.

    review:
      summary: HSP90.1 performs ATP-dependent protein folding but is SPECIALIZED
        for signaling proteins already in near-native conformations, distinct 
        from general protein folding by Hsp70. Term is technically correct but 
        lacks specificity for HSP90's unique function as a maturation chaperone 
        rather than de novo folding chaperone.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While HSP90.1 does assist protein folding, this term is too 
        general and does not capture its specialized function. HSP90 maintains 
        client proteins in near-native, activation-ready conformations rather 
        than performing de novo folding of unfolded polypeptides (which is 
        Hsp70's role). The more specific term GO:0140662 (ATP-dependent protein 
        folding chaperone) better captures this specialized activity. Keep as 
        non-core because it is not wrong, but the IEA annotation to GO:0140662 
        is more informative.

    review:
      summary: ATP hydrolysis is a core enzymatic activity of HSP90.1 that 
        drives its conformational cycle and is essential for chaperone function.
        The N-terminal ATPase domain contains a Bergerat fold that binds and 
        hydrolyzes ATP to power conformational transitions between open and 
        closed states.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a well-established core molecular function of HSP90.1. ATP
        binding and hydrolysis are absolutely required for the chaperone cycle, 
        with the ATPase activity being geldanamycin-sensitive and essential for 
        client protein maturation. Direct biochemical evidence supports this

        isoform.

        extended unfolded polypeptides, HSP90.1 binds client proteins in 
        near-native, largely folded conformations. HSP90 performs holdase 
        activity but not classical unfolded protein binding.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: This annotation is technically inaccurate. HSP90.1 does NOT bind 
        unfolded proteins in the same way Hsp70 does. It binds clients in 
        near-native conformations that are poised for activation. The term 
        'unfolded protein binding' is more appropriate for classical holdases 
        like Hsp70. Better terms would be 'protein folding chaperone activity'

    review:
      summary: This is the MOST SPECIFIC and ACCURATE molecular function term 
        for HSP90.1. It captures the ATP-dependent chaperone activity 
        specialized for protein maturation and stabilization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This term precisely describes HSP90.1's core molecular function. 
        It is more specific and accurate than the general 'protein folding' or 
        'unfolded protein binding' terms. This should be considered the primary 
        molecular function annotation.

      summary: HSP90.1 interacts with ROF1 (FKBP62), a TPR-containing

        annotate with specific cochaperone interaction terms.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While experimentally validated, 'protein binding' is 
        uninformative. HSP90.1's protein-protein interactions are functionally 
        significant cochaperone and client interactions that should be annotated
        with more specific terms. Consider terms for TPR protein binding or

        cytoplasmic protein with no cell wall function.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: HSP90.1 is a soluble cytoplasmic/nuclear protein that lacks signal
        peptides, cell wall targeting signals, or any known cell wall function. 
        Detection in cell wall proteomics is contamination from abundant 
        cytoplasmic proteins. Should be removed.

      action: REMOVE
      reason: HSP90.1 lacks transmembrane domains or membrane anchors. While it 
        may transiently associate with plasma membrane through client proteins 
        like ABCB transporters (with TWD1 cochaperone), it is not a bona fide

          within one hour of temperature shifts to 29C, accompanied by rapid
