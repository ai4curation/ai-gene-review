# HSP90.1 (AT5G52640) Curation Notes

## Gene Summary
**HSP90-1** = Cytoplasmic Heat Shock Protein 90 (1 of 4 cytoplasmic isoforms)
**ATP-dependent molecular chaperone** for signal transduction proteins [deep-research]

## Primary Function

### ATP-Dependent Molecular Chaperone for Signaling Proteins (CORE)
- **Specialized chaperone**: Maintains client proteins in near-native, activation-ready conformations [deep-research]
- **Distinct from Hsp70**: HSP70 folds extended polypeptides; HSP90 matures folded clients [deep-research]
- **Client classes**: Kinases, hormone receptors, transcription factors, immune receptors [deep-research]

### Protein Structure

**Domain Architecture:**
- **N-terminal domain (NTD)**: ATP-binding (Bergerat fold), geldanamycin-sensitive [deep-research]
- **Charged linker**: Eukaryotic-specific, substrate binding, regulates ATP affinity [deep-research]
- **Middle domain**: Client binding, conformational reorganization [deep-research]
- **C-terminal domain (CTD)**: Dimerization, MEEVD motif (TPR cochaperone binding) [deep-research]

**Oligomeric State:**
- **Homodimer** in active state [deep-research]
- Dynamic N-terminal and C-terminal interfaces [deep-research]
- ATP-driven conformational cycle: Open (client loading) ↔ Closed (client maturation) [deep-research]

## ATP-Dependent Conformational Cycle

### Mechanism:
1. **Open state** (ATP-free): Low ATP affinity, client binding accessible [deep-research]
2. **ATP binding**: Transition to closed state, N-terminal dimerization [deep-research]
3. **Closed state** (ATP-bound): "Molecular clamp", client maturation [deep-research]
4. **ATP hydrolysis**: Return to open, client release [deep-research]

**Key Features:**
- **Stochastic dynamics** (not deterministic like bacterial HtpG) [deep-research]
- **Conformational heterogeneity**: Ensemble of states at any moment [deep-research]
- **Cochaperones modulate**: Hop stabilizes open; p23 stabilizes closed; Aha1 accelerates cycle [deep-research]

## Extensive Cochaperone Network (Critical for Function)

### TPR-Containing Cochaperones (bind C-terminal MEEVD):
- **Hop/Sti1**: Recruits clients from Hsp70, inhibits ATPase, stabilizes open state [deep-research]
- **TWD1 (Fkbp42)**: Plant-specific, stabilizes ABCB auxin transporters at plasma membrane [deep-research]

### Other Cochaperones:
- **p23/Sba1**: Stabilizes ATP-bound closed state, extends client maturation time [deep-research]
- **Aha1**: Activates ATPase, accelerates conformational cycle [deep-research]
- **Cdc37**: Kinase-specific, unfoldase activity, delivers kinase clients [deep-research]
- **SGT1**: Plant-specific, R protein stability, auxin receptor (TIR1) regulation [deep-research]
- **RAR1**: Plant-specific, CHORD domains, R protein immunity with SGT1 [deep-research]

## Client Proteins (Diverse Signaling Proteins)

### 1. Hormone Receptors:
- **TIR1 (auxin receptor)**: HSP90-SGT1 stabilizes in nucleus, temperature-dependent [deep-research]
- Temperature shift to 29°C → HSP90 ↑ → TIR1 stabilization [deep-research]

### 2. Auxin Transporters:
- **ABCB1, ABCB4, ABCB19**: HSP90-TWD1 stabilizes at plasma membrane [deep-research]
- Regulates polar auxin transport, PIN1 distribution [deep-research]

### 3. Immune Receptors:
- **R proteins (NB-LRR)**: HSP90-RAR1-SGT1 complex required for function [deep-research]
- **RPM1**: Resistance to *Pseudomonas syringae* [deep-research]

### 4. Transcription Factors:
- **PIF4**: Promotes hypocotyl elongation (darkness, high temperature) [deep-research]
- **ELF3**: HSP90 destabilizes via COP1, modulates thermomorphogenesis [deep-research]

### 5. Circadian Clock:
- **ZEITLUPE (ZTL)**: F-box protein, HSP90 stabilizes core oscillator [deep-research]

### 6. Protein Kinases:
- Require Cdc37 cochaperone for maturation [deep-research]
- Phosphorylation of Cdc37 and HSP90 regulates kinase client specificity [deep-research]

## Developmental Functions

### Embryogenesis:
- Transcript levels ↑ before embryo maturation [deep-research]
- Expression prominent in developing cotyledons [deep-research]
- **Complete loss = embryonic lethality** [deep-research]

### Hypocotyl Elongation:
- **Skotomorphogenesis** (dark growth): Chaperones PIF4 [deep-research]
- **Thermomorphogenesis** (warm temperature growth): Via PIF4, COP1, ELF3 module [deep-research]
- Geldanamycin inhibition → reduced PIF4 → reduced elongation [deep-research]

### Root Development:
- Affects PIN1 polar distribution and auxin transport [deep-research]
- HSP90 depletion → defective gravitropism, impaired lateral root formation [deep-research]
- Works with TWD1 to stabilize ABCB transporters [deep-research]

## Expression Pattern

### Tissue-Specific (Unstressed):
- **Root-preferential** under normal conditions [deep-research]
- Low throughout early embryo, ↑ before maturation [deep-research]

### Stress-Induced:
- **Heat shock**: Abundant throughout all organs [deep-research]
- **Heavy metals**: Upregulation [deep-research]
- Vascular tissues, leaf veins, siliques, pollen sacs after heat [deep-research]

## Subcellular Localization

- **Cytoplasm** (primary) [deep-research]
- **Nucleus** (shuttles for nuclear clients like TIR1, R proteins) [deep-research]
- Dynamic nucleocytoplasmic partitioning [deep-research]

## Relationship with Other Chaperones

### With HSC70-1:
- **HSC70-HSP90 machinery** for ABA/stomatal closure [deep-research]
- **Hop cochaperone** bridges Hsp70 → Hsp90 client transfer [deep-research]
- Hsp70 delivers clients; HSP90 completes maturation [deep-research]

### With HSP101:
- Independent functions but both part of proteostasis network [deep-research]
- HSP101: Disaggregase for misfolded proteins [deep-research]
- HSP90: Chaperone for signaling proteins in near-native state [deep-research]

## Pharmacological Inhibition

- **Geldanamycin**: Binds ATP pocket, blocks HSP90 function [deep-research]
- **Radicicol**: Alternative HSP90 inhibitor [deep-research]
- Inhibition → client protein degradation via proteasome [deep-research]
- Used experimentally to dissect HSP90 functions [deep-research]

## Post-Translational Modifications

- **Phosphorylation**: Multiple sites, modulates client/cochaperone interactions [deep-research]
- **Y197 phosphorylation**: Recruits non-receptor tyrosine kinases via SH2 domains [deep-research]
- **Potential**: Acetylation, S-nitrosylation, ubiquitination (less characterized in plants) [deep-research]
- Couples chaperone activity to cell signaling events [deep-research]

## Functional Distinctions

### vs HSP101:
- **HSP101**: Disaggregase for heat-denatured aggregates, ESSENTIAL for thermotolerance
- **HSP90.1**: Chaperone for folded signaling clients, developmental/immune roles

### vs Other HSP90 Isoforms:
- **HSP90-1**: Root-preferential, stress-inducible
