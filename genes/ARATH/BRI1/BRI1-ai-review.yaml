description: 'BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase that serves as the primary receptor for brassinosteroid hormones in Arabidopsis thaliana. Located predominantly in the plasma membrane, BRI1 directly binds brassinolide (BL) with highest affinity, and less effectively castasterone (CS), through its extracellular domain containing 25 leucine-rich repeats interspersed with a unique ~70 amino acid island domain that is essential for high-affinity hormone binding. Upon hormone binding, BRI1 undergoes conformational changes that enable homodimerization and/or heterodimerization with co-receptors such as BAK1/SERK3, SERK1, and TTL in a kinase-dependent manner. This dimerization facilitates reciprocal transphosphorylation between intracellular kinase domains at critical residues including Y1052, Y1057, Y956, and Y1072. BRI1 possesses dual-specificity kinase activity, phosphorylating both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues on target proteins including BSK family kinases (BSK1, BSK2, BSK3, BSK5, BSK6, BSK8, BSK11), BAK1, SERK1, TTL, and itself through autophosphorylation. These phosphorylation events initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately activates transcription factors BZR1 and BES1, regulating gene expression programs controlling cell elongation, vascular differentiation, leaf development, flowering time, stress responses, and photomorphogenesis. BRI1 undergoes dynamic trafficking between plasma membrane and endosomal compartments where it forms heterodimeric complexes with BAK1, facilitating continued signaling or receptor turnover. The receptor may also possess guanylyl cyclase activity producing cyclic GMP as a secondary messenger. Loss-of-function mutations result in severe dwarfism, dark-green curled leaves, delayed flowering, and brassinosteroid insensitivity, while also affecting stress tolerance and light responses.'
