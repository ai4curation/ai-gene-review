description: Very-long-chain aldehyde decarbonylase that catalyzes the conversion of very-long-chain fatty aldehydes to alkanes through an oxidative decarbonylation reaction. Core component of the alkane biosynthetic pathway in cuticular wax formation, working in a multiprotein complex with CER3 and cytochrome b5 isoforms at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Specifically expressed in epidermis of aerial organs and essential for cuticle formation, drought tolerance, and pollen fertility.

    id: GO:0005506
    label: iron ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: CER1 contains tripartite histidine-rich motifs (HX3H+HX2HH+HX2HH) that coordinate a di-iron catalytic center essential for aldehyde decarbonylase activity. The di-iron center is characteristic of the sterol desaturase family to which CER1 belongs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly captures CER1's iron ion binding through its conserved histidine-rich motifs that coordinate the di-iron active site. This is a core molecular function essential for catalytic activity.

      supporting_text: Site-directed mutagenesis showed that CER1 His clusters are essential for alkane synthesis, whereas those of CER3 are not, suggesting that CYTB5s are specific CER1 cofactors

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: CER1 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where cuticular wax biosynthesis occurs. This localization is essential for CER1 function in the alkane-forming pathway.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct cellular localization. CER1 is an integral ER membrane protein and this is where it performs its aldehyde decarbonylase function as part of the wax biosynthesis machinery.
