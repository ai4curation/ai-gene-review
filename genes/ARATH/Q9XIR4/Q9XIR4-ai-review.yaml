description: 'APO1 (Accumulation of Photosystem One 1) is a chloroplast-localized,
  plant-specific RNA-binding protein that promotes splicing of specific chloroplast
  group II introns. It contains tandem DUF794 zinc-binding motifs that enable high-affinity
  RNA binding. APO1 is essential for splicing of the ycf3 intron 2 and several other
  chloroplast introns (petD, clpP, ndhA/B), thereby indirectly enabling photosystem
  I assembly and NDH complex formation.'
