# HSP101/CLPB1 (AT1G74310) Curation Notes

## Gene Summary
**AtHsp101** (Arabidopsis Heat Shock Protein 101) = **CLPB1** (Caseinolytic protease B homolog 1)
**ESSENTIAL** for acquired thermotolerance - **hot1** mutants completely lack thermotolerance [deep-research]

## Primary Function

### ATP-Dependent Protein Disaggregase (CORE FUNCTION)
- **Disaggregates heat-denatured protein aggregates** through ATP hydrolysis [deep-research]
- **Threading mechanism**: Extracts individual polypeptides through central hexameric pore [deep-research]
- **NOT passive** removal - ACTIVE extraction requiring mechanical work [deep-research]
- **Processiv e**: Continuous withdrawal of unfolded chains from aggregates [deep-research]

## Protein Structure

### Domain Architecture:
1. **N-terminal domain (NTD)** - ~150 aa, substrate-binding groove [deep-research]
2. **AAA1/NBD1** - First nucleotide-binding domain (Walker motifs, YKR pore loop) [deep-research]
3. **M-domain** - Coiled-coil middle domain (UNIQUE to ClpB/Hsp100 family) [deep-research]
4. **AAA2/NBD2** - Second nucleotide-binding domain (Ar/Φ pore loop) [deep-research]

### Oligomeric State:
- **Hexameric ring structure** [deep-research]
- ~900 aa per protomer [deep-research]
- Central pore for substrate threading [deep-research]

### Functional Features:
- **M-domain regulates activity**: Horizontal (repressed) vs Tilted (active) conformations [deep-research]
- **M-domain mediates Hsp70 interaction**: Species-specific [deep-research]
- **Pore loops contact substrate**: YKR motif (NBD1), Ar/Φ motif (NBD2) [deep-research]
- **NTD hydrophobic groove**: Recognizes exposed hydrophobic patches in unfolded proteins [deep-research]

## Critical Functional Relationship: Synergy with Hsp70

### REQUIRES Hsp70 for Physiological Function:
- **3-fold higher disaggregation rate** with Hsp70 vs ClpB1 alone [deep-research]
- **Hsp70 (Hsc70-1) recruits ClpB1 to aggregates** through M-domain interaction [deep-research]
- **Species-specific**: Plant Hsp101 works with plant Hsc70 (not bacterial or yeast) [deep-research]

### Mechanism of Cooperation:
1. Hsp70 binds protein aggregates (hydrophobic surfaces) [deep-research]
2. Hsp70-coated aggregates recruit ClpB1 (M-domain:Hsp70-NBD interaction) [deep-research]
3. ClpB1 activity stimulated, extracts polypeptides through central pore [deep-research]
4. Hsp70 captures emerging unfolded chains, facilitates refolding [deep-research]

## Essential Role in Thermotolerance

### Acquired Thermotolerance (ESSENTIAL):
- **hot1 mutants COMPLETELY LACK acquired thermotolerance** [deep-research]
- Conditioning: 37-38°C for 1-3h → enables survival at 44-45°C [deep-research]
- **hot1 mutants cannot survive 44-45°C even with conditioning** [deep-research]

### Genetic Evidence - hot1 Mutant Series:
- **hot1-1**: Missense E637K in NBD2 domain [deep-research]
- **hot1-3**: NULL (T-DNA insertion) - no acquired thermotolerance [deep-research]
- **hot1-4**: Semidominant A499T in M-domain - EVEN MORE sensitive than null [deep-research]
  - Sensitive to 38°C (permissive for WT and null)
  - Demonstrates malfunctioning Hsp101 ACTIVELY INTERFERES with proteostasis

### Basal Thermotolerance (CRITICAL):
- **Germinating seeds have high basal thermotolerance** [deep-research]
- Correlates with elevated basal Hsp101 expression in early seedlings [deep-research]
- Seeds survive 47°C for 2h during first 30-48h post-imbibition [deep-research]
- **Antisense suppression DRAMATICALLY reduces basal thermotolerance** [deep-research]

## Additional Functional Roles

### Stress Granule Disassembly (NOVEL):
- **hot1 mutants show defect in stress granule (SG) disassembly** after heat stress [deep-research]
- **Defect in translation recovery** following heat stress [deep-research]
- **Ribosomal protein mRNAs** preferentially stored in SGs, released in Hsp101-dependent manner [deep-research]
- Mechanism not fully elucidated - may involve direct SG protein interaction [deep-research]

### Long-Term Acquired Thermotolerance:
- **Requires both Hsp101 AND HSA32** (Heat Stress-Associated protein 32) [deep-research]
- Short-term (2h recovery): Hsp101 only [deep-research]
- Long-term (48h+ recovery): Hsp101 + HSA32 [deep-research]
- **Positive feedback loop**: Hsp101 promotes HSA32 accumulation; HSA32 retards Hsp101 degradation [deep-research]

## Integration with Heat Shock Response Network

### Transcriptional Regulation:
- **Activated by HSFs**: HsfA1d, HsfA1e, HsfA2 bind HSP101 promoter [deep-research]
- **Massive induction**: 50-100 fold increase within 15-30 min of heat stress [deep-research]
- **Negative feedback**: Hsc70-1 sequesters HSFs under non-stress conditions [deep-research]
- Heat stress → Hsc70 redistributes to misfolded proteins → HSFs activate → Hsp101 transcription [deep-research]

### Integration with Other Chaperones:
- **Small HSPs (sHsps)**: Initial responders, sequester unfolding proteins [deep-research]
- **Hsp101 extracts clients from sHsp complexes** during recovery [deep-research]
- **Hierarchical partnership**: sHsps (ATP-independent stabilization) → ClpB1 (ATP-dependent disaggregation) → Hsp70 (refolding) [deep-research]

## Subcellular Localization

- **Cytosolic/Nuclear** [deep-research]
- NO transit peptides (vs ClpB3 in chloroplast, ClpB4 in mitochondria) [deep-research]
- **Concentrates near stress foci** during heat stress [deep-research]
- Recruited to sites of protein aggregation [deep-research]

## Mechanism of Action

### ATP Hydrolysis Cycle:
- **Sequential cycling** of AAA1 and AAA2 rings (NOT simultaneous) [deep-research]
- **AAA2 activation offset by one subunit** relative to AAA1 [deep-research]
- Maintains ~10 AAA domains bound to substrate at any time [deep-research]
- **ATP binding → pore loop stabilization** (high substrate affinity) [deep-research]
- **ATP hydrolysis → conformational change** (substrate translocation, reduced affinity) [deep-research]

### M-Domain Regulation:
- **Repressed state**: Horizontal M-domains, reduced ATPase activity [deep-research]
- **Active state**: Tilted M-domains, enhanced activity [deep-research]
- **Hyperactive mutants** (Y503D): Reduced M-domain repression [deep-research]
- **Repressed mutants** (E432A): Enhanced M-domain interactions, loss of activity [deep-research]

### Substrate Threading:
- **Central pore**: Lined with aromatic/charged residues [deep-research]
- **Pore loops grasp substrate**: YKR motif (AAA1), Ar/Φ motif (AAA2) [deep-research]
- **Directional translocation**: Unfolded polypeptides pulled through channel [deep-research]
- **Processive**: Continuous movement rather than fragmentation [deep-research]

## Evolutionary Context

- **Ancient family**: Bacterial ClpB, yeast Hsp104, plant Hsp101 [deep-research]
- **Eukaryotic lineage**: Plant Hsp101 closer to yeast Hsp104 than bacterial ClpB [deep-research]
- **Organellar paralogs**: ClpB3 (chloroplast, cyanobacterial origin), ClpB4 (mitochondrial) [deep-research]
- **M-domain highly conserved**: >3 billion years evolution, under strong purifying selection [deep-research]

## Organismal Phenotypes

### Fitness Effects:
- **hot1 null mutants produce 33% fewer fruits** under normal conditions [deep-research]
- Demonstrates **pleiotropic effects beyond stress tolerance** [deep-research]
- Optimal Hsp101 level provides maximal fitness [deep-research]

### Trade-offs:
- **High Hsp101 → suppressed root growth** (dose-dependent) [deep-research]
- **Increased transpiration rates** and water loss [deep-research]
- **Root-to-shoot biomass allocation altered** [deep-research]
- Trade-off between thermotolerance and water-use efficiency [deep-research]

### Natural Variation:
- Low-latitude (warmer) ecotypes: LESS Hsp101 expression [deep-research]
- High-latitude ecotypes: MORE Hsp101 expression [deep-research]
- Reflects adaptive balance between heat tolerance and water efficiency [deep-research]

## Gene Expression

### Heat-Induced:
- **50-100 fold increase** within 15-30 min [deep-research]
- Peak at 30-60 min, then decline despite continued stress (negative feedback) [deep-research]
- Robust response across all tissues and developmental stages [deep-research]

### Tissue-Specific:
- **Mature dry seeds**: High basal levels (molecular reservoir) [deep-research]
- **Leaves**: Substantial basal expression (photosynthetic activity) [deep-research]
- **Roots**: Lower basal, but retains inducibility [deep-research]
