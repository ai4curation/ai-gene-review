description: "AtHsp101/CLPB1 is an ATP-dependent protein disaggregase that is absolutely
  ESSENTIAL for thermotolerance in Arabidopsis, functioning as a hexameric AAA+ ATPase
  that mechanically extracts polypeptide chains from heat-denatured protein aggregates
  through a central pore threading mechanism. The protein works in obligate synergy
  with the Hsp70/Hsc70-1 chaperone system (3-fold enhanced disaggregation rate) and
  is the single most critical determinant of acquired thermotolerance—hot1 null mutants
  completely lack the ability to survive normally lethal temperatures even after heat
  conditioning. AtHsp101 also mediates basal thermotolerance in germinating seeds,
  promotes stress granule disassembly and translation recovery, and interacts with
  HSA32 to extend thermotolerance memory. The protein is massively heat-induced (50-100
  fold within 15-30 min) and functions primarily in the cytosol and nucleus."

      summary: AtHsp101/CLPB1 is a cytosolic/nuclear protein that functions in 
        the cytoplasm as part of the heat shock response machinery. The protein 
        lacks transit peptides that would direct it to organelles,

      reason: This annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic analysis, 
        protein structure (no transit peptides), and functional studies showing 
        cytoplasmic localization and activity. The IBA evidence correctly

    review:
      summary: AtHsp101/CLPB1 is an AAA+ ATPase with two nucleotide-binding 
        domains (NBD1/AAA1 and NBD2/AAA2) that hydrolyze ATP to drive protein 
        disaggregation. ATP hydrolysis is coupled to conformational changes that
        enable mechanical extraction of polypeptides from aggregates through the
        central hexameric pore.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function. The protein contains conserved 
        Walker A, Walker B, and sensor motifs in both NBD1 and NBD2. ATP 
        hydrolysis activity is essential for chaperone function and 
        thermotolerance, as demonstrated by mutants in ATPase domains that lose

      reason: While AtHsp101 does bind proteins, this annotation is too vague to
        be informative. The protein's functional interactions are with 
        Hsp70/Hsc70-1 (essential synergy through M-domain), misfolded/aggregated
        substrate proteins (through NTD and pore loops), and HSA32 (for 
        long-term thermotolerance). A more specific term like "unfolded protein 
        binding" or "misfolded protein binding" would better capture the 
        functional significance. The 14-3-3 interaction may be regulatory but is
        not the core protein-binding function.

    review:
      summary: This annotation describes protein unfolding as a biological 
        process. However, AtHsp101's primary activity is protein disaggregation 
        and refolding, not unfolding per se.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While AtHsp101 does mechanically extract and unfold polypeptides 
        during disaggregation, the term "protein unfolding" may be misleading as
        it could imply the protein's primary role is to unfold native proteins. 
        The core function is protein disaggregation (extracting proteins from 
        aggregates) and enabling refolding. More accurate terms would be 
        GO:1990116 (ribosome-associated protein quality control pathway) or a 
        protein disaggregation term if one exists. The threading mechanism does 
        involve unfolding, but this is in service of disaggregation.

        biological process for AtHsp101. The protein disaggregates aggregates 
        and works synergistically with Hsp70 to enable refolding. The unfolded

          basal thermotolerance. Seeds survive 47°C for 2h during early germination
          (first 30-48h). Correlates with elevated basal Hsp101 expression. Antisense
          suppression dramatically reduces basal tolerance."

        supporting_text: Seeds exhibit particularly robust basal thermotolerance
          during the early stages of germination, a trait that correlates with 
          constitutively elevated levels of HSP101 protein in developing 
          seedlings.
  - description: Long-term thermotolerance maintenance through positive feedback
      with HSA32. Works synergistically with HSA32 (a small heat shock protein) 
      to extend thermotolerance memory beyond the initial heat shock response. 
      Hsp101 promotes HSA32 protein accumulation through enhanced translation, 
      while HSA32 retards Hsp101 protein degradation. This mutual stabilization 
      enables long-term thermotolerance (48+ hours recovery) compared to 
      short-term response (2 hours) mediated by Hsp101 alone.

        supporting_text: HSP101 enhances the translation of HSA32 during 
          recovery after heat treatment, and in turn, HSA32 retards the decay of
          HSP101. This mutual stabilization extends thermotolerance memory.
