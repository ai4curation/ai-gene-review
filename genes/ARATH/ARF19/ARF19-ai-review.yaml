description: >-
  ARF19 is an A-class Auxin Response Factor transcription factor that binds to
  auxin-responsive promoter elements (AuxREs; consensus TGTCTC) and activates
  transcription of downstream target genes including LBD16 and LBD29. It functions
  redundantly with ARF7 in lateral root formation, gravitropism, leaf expansion,
  and callus formation. ARF19 activity is regulated by AUX/IAA repressor proteins
  that are degraded via the SCFTIR1/AFB ubiquitin ligase complex upon auxin
  perception, releasing ARFs to activate transcription. ARF19 also integrates
  ethylene signaling in roots. The protein contains an N-terminal B3-type DNA
  binding domain, a glutamine-rich middle activation domain, and a C-terminal
  PB1 domain for homo/heterodimerization and interaction with AUX/IAA proteins.

      GO:0009734 is defined as "The series of molecular signals generated by the
      binding of the plant hormone auxin to a receptor, and ending with modulation
      of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription." ARF19 is a transcriptional
      effector downstream of auxin perception, not the receptor itself. TIR1/AFB
      proteins are the auxin receptors [PMID:15659631].
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      ARF19 does not bind auxin directly - it is released from AUX/IAA repression
      after auxin binds to TIR1/AFB receptors. ARF19 is the endpoint effector of
      the signaling pathway, executing the transcriptional response. The term
      "response to auxin" (GO:0009733) more accurately describes ARF19's role as
      the transcriptional output of auxin perception. This is a subtle but important
      distinction - ARF19 RESPONDS to the signaling pathway rather than being
      part of the signal transduction cascade itself.

      This paper is about BAT1 brassinosteroid acyltransferase. ARF19 DNA binding
