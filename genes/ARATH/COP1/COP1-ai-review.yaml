description: 'COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) is a central E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that functions as a master negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein features a modular domain architecture: an N-terminal RING-finger domain (essential for E3 ligase activity and zinc coordination), a central coiled-coil domain (mediating homodimerization and protein interactions), and C-terminal WD40 repeats (forming beta-propeller structures for substrate recognition). In darkness, COP1 is predominantly nuclear localized in discrete subnuclear compartments where it accepts ubiquitin from E2 enzymes via thioester bonds and directly transfers it to target substrates. Key targets include light-responsive transcription factors (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) and regulatory proteins (MYB21), leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent 26S proteasomal degradation to maintain etiolation. Upon light exposure, COP1 undergoes dynamic nucleocytoplasmic relocalization to the cytoplasm, reducing nuclear repressive activity and allowing stabilization of photomorphogenic regulators. COP1 functions in higher-order complexes with SPA proteins (SPA1-4), which modulate substrate repertoire and catalytic kinetics. Light exposure promotes COP1-SPA1 complex dissociation, reducing catalytic efficiency. COP1 activity is further regulated by suppressors (CSU1, CSU2) and the SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1. The protein participates in multiple light signaling pathways including red/far-red light perception, shade avoidance, and UV-B responses, with secondary functions in circadian clock entrainment, flowering time control, and secondary metabolism regulation. COP1 represents a key molecular switch with conserved function across eukaryotes, integrating environmental light cues with developmental programs through precise post-translational control.'

  review:
    summary: COP1 is a well-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets key photomorphogenesis regulators (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation in darkness. This IBA annotation accurately captures COP1's core biological function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This process annotation correctly represents COP1's primary mechanism of action - mediating proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates through ubiquitination. Well-supported by extensive literature including studies showing COP1 targets HY5, HYH, LAF1 and other transcription factors for degradation.

  review:
    summary: COP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with a characteristic RING-finger domain that is essential for catalytic activity. It accepts ubiquitin from E2 enzymes and transfers it to target substrates like HY5, HYH, and other photomorphogenesis regulators.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This molecular function annotation accurately describes COP1's core enzymatic activity. COP1 contains a RING-finger domain required for E3 ligase activity and has been experimentally demonstrated to have ubiquitin ligase activity against multiple substrates.

  review:
    summary: COP1 is primarily nuclear localized in darkness where it executes its function as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Multiple experimental studies confirm nuclear localization through IDA evidence, making this IEA annotation redundant but correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is a computational prediction, COP1 nuclear localization is strongly supported by experimental evidence from multiple IDA annotations in this dataset and extensive literature. The annotation is accurate.

  review:
    summary: COP1 does translocate to the cytoplasm upon light exposure as part of its regulation mechanism, but this is a secondary, light-induced localization rather than its primary functional location. The annotation is technically correct but represents non-core function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While COP1 can be found in the cytoplasm, particularly under light conditions, its primary and functionally important localization is nuclear. The cytoplasmic localization represents a regulatory mechanism to inactivate COP1 rather than a site of its primary function.

    reason: This term is overly broad and doesn't provide meaningful functional information. The more specific ubiquitin-protein transferase activity (GO:0004842) and ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) terms better capture COP1's specific molecular function.

  review:
    summary: COP1 regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis through its control of light-responsive transcription factors involved in secondary metabolism. This represents a secondary function linking light signaling to pigment production.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While COP1 does influence anthocyanin metabolism through its regulation of transcription factors, this is a downstream consequence of its primary light signaling function rather than a core activity.
