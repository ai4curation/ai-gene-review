description: 'COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) is a central E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that functions as a master negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. COP1 contains a characteristic RING-finger domain for E3 ligase activity, a coiled-coil domain for protein interactions and homodimerization, and WD40 repeats for substrate recognition. In darkness, COP1 is predominantly nuclear localized where it targets key light-responsive transcription factors (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining the etiolated state. Upon light exposure, COP1 translocates to the cytoplasm, allowing stabilization of photomorphogenic regulators and triggering de-etiolation. COP1 functions in complex with SPA proteins and is involved in multiple light signaling pathways including red/far-red light perception, shade avoidance, and UV-B responses. Secondary functions include regulation of circadian clock entrainment, flowering time control, and secondary metabolism (anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthesis). COP1 represents a key molecular switch integrating light environmental cues with developmental programs.'

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: COP1 is a well-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets key photomorphogenesis regulators (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation in darkness. This IBA annotation accurately captures COP1's core biological function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This process annotation correctly represents COP1's primary mechanism of action - mediating proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates through ubiquitination. Well-supported by extensive literature including studies showing COP1 targets HY5, HYH, LAF1 and other transcription factors for degradation.

  review:
    summary: COP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with a characteristic RING-finger domain that is essential for catalytic activity. It accepts ubiquitin from E2 enzymes and transfers it to target substrates like HY5, HYH, and other photomorphogenesis regulators.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This molecular function annotation accurately describes COP1's core enzymatic activity. COP1 contains a RING-finger domain required for E3 ligase activity and has been experimentally demonstrated to have ubiquitin ligase activity against multiple substrates.

  review:
    summary: COP1 is primarily nuclear localized in darkness where it executes its function as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Multiple experimental studies confirm nuclear localization through IDA evidence, making this IEA annotation redundant but correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is a computational prediction, COP1 nuclear localization is strongly supported by experimental evidence from multiple IDA annotations in this dataset and extensive literature. The annotation is accurate.

  review:
    summary: COP1 does translocate to the cytoplasm upon light exposure as part of its regulation mechanism, but this is a secondary, light-induced localization rather than its primary functional location. The annotation is technically correct but represents non-core function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While COP1 can be found in the cytoplasm, particularly under light conditions, its primary and functionally important localization is nuclear. The cytoplasmic localization represents a regulatory mechanism to inactivate COP1 rather than a site of its primary function.

    summary: COP1 contains a RING-finger domain at its N-terminus that coordinates zinc ions, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This computational prediction is biochemically accurate.

    summary: COP1 acts as a negative regulator in light signaling pathways including red and far-red light responses through its interaction with phytochromes and downstream signaling components. This annotation captures its role in light signal transduction.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is very similar to GO:0009585 and captures COP1's role in red/far-red light signaling pathways. COP1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis by targeting light-responsive factors for degradation in these pathways.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While similar to the previous annotation, this term specifically refers to the signaling pathway rather than transduction. COP1 is a key negative regulator in red/far-red light signaling pathways through its interaction with phytochrome signaling components.

  review:
    summary: While technically correct since E3 ligases transfer ubiquitin, this annotation is too general and uninformative. COP1's transferase activity is specifically ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, which is better captured by more specific terms already annotated.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This term is overly broad and doesn't provide meaningful functional information. The more specific ubiquitin-protein transferase activity (GO:0004842) and ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) terms better capture COP1's specific molecular function.

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:16829591
  review:
    summary: COP1 participates in UV-B light responses as part of its broader role in light quality perception and signaling. UV-B responses are an extension of COP1's light signaling functions.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UV-B response is directly related to COP1's core function in light perception and signaling. This annotation captures an important aspect of COP1's role in responding to different light qualities.

  original_reference_id: PMID:10839542
  review:
    summary: COP1 functions as part of nuclear ubiquitin ligase complexes, often in association with SPA proteins, to target substrates for degradation in the nucleus. This accurately describes COP1's functional complex organization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly captures COP1's cellular organization as a nuclear ubiquitin ligase complex. COP1 functions with partner proteins like SPA1-4 to form active ubiquitin ligase complexes in the nucleus.
