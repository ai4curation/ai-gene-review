description: 'COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1) is a central E3 ubiquitin-protein
  ligase that functions as a master negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis
  thaliana. The protein features a modular domain architecture: an N-terminal RING-finger
  domain (essential for E3 ligase activity and zinc coordination), a central coiled-coil
  domain (mediating homodimerization and protein interactions), and C-terminal WD40
  repeats (forming beta-propeller structures for substrate recognition). In darkness,
  COP1 is predominantly nuclear localized in discrete subnuclear compartments where
  it accepts ubiquitin from E2 enzymes via thioester bonds and directly transfers
  it to target substrates. Key targets include light-responsive transcription factors
  (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) and regulatory proteins (MYB21),
  leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent 26S proteasomal degradation to maintain
  etiolation. Upon light exposure, COP1 undergoes dynamic nucleocytoplasmic relocalization
  to the cytoplasm, reducing nuclear repressive activity and allowing stabilization
  of photomorphogenic regulators. COP1 functions in higher-order complexes with SPA
  proteins (SPA1-4), which modulate substrate repertoire and catalytic kinetics. Light
  exposure promotes COP1-SPA1 complex dissociation, reducing catalytic efficiency.
  COP1 activity is further regulated by suppressors (CSU1, CSU2) and the SUMO E3 ligase
  SIZ1. The protein participates in multiple light signaling pathways including red/far-red
  light perception, shade avoidance, and UV-B responses, with secondary functions
  in circadian clock entrainment, flowering time control, and secondary metabolism
  regulation. COP1 represents a key molecular switch with conserved function across
  eukaryotes, integrating environmental light cues with developmental programs through
  precise post-translational control.'

  review:
    summary: COP1 is a well-characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets key photomorphogenesis
      regulators (HY5, HYH, LAF1, CIP7, UNE10/PIF8, PCH1, PCHL) for ubiquitination
      and subsequent proteasomal degradation in darkness. This IBA annotation accurately
      captures COP1's core biological function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This process annotation correctly represents COP1's primary mechanism
      of action - mediating proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates through
      ubiquitination. Well-supported by extensive literature including studies showing
      COP1 targets HY5, HYH, LAF1 and other transcription factors for degradation.

  review:
    summary: COP1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with a characteristic
      RING-finger domain that is essential for catalytic activity. It accepts ubiquitin
      from E2 enzymes and transfers it to target substrates like HY5, HYH, and other
      photomorphogenesis regulators.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This molecular function annotation accurately describes COP1's core enzymatic
      activity. COP1 contains a RING-finger domain required for E3 ligase activity
      and has been experimentally demonstrated to have ubiquitin ligase activity against
      multiple substrates.

  review:
    summary: COP1 is primarily nuclear localized in darkness where it executes its
      function as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Multiple experimental studies
      confirm nuclear localization through IDA evidence, making this IEA annotation
      redundant but correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is a computational prediction, COP1 nuclear localization is
      strongly supported by experimental evidence from multiple IDA annotations in
      this dataset and extensive literature. The annotation is accurate.

  review:
    summary: COP1 does translocate to the cytoplasm upon light exposure as part of
      its regulation mechanism, but this is a secondary, light-induced localization
      rather than its primary functional location. The annotation is technically correct
      but represents non-core function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While COP1 can be found in the cytoplasm, particularly under light conditions,
      its primary and functionally important localization is nuclear. The cytoplasmic
      localization represents a regulatory mechanism to inactivate COP1 rather than
      a site of its primary function.

      by targeting light-responsive factors for degradation in these pathways.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While similar to the previous annotation, this term specifically refers
      to the signaling pathway rather than transduction. COP1 is a key negative regulator
      in red/far-red light signaling pathways through its interaction with phytochrome
      signaling components.

  review:
    summary: While technically correct since E3 ligases transfer ubiquitin, this annotation
      is too general and uninformative. COP1's transferase activity is specifically
      ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, which is better captured by more specific
      terms already annotated.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This term is overly broad and doesn't provide meaningful functional information.
      The more specific ubiquitin-protein transferase activity (GO:0004842) and ubiquitin

  review:
    summary: COP1's role in stomatal movement regulation is likely indirect through
      its effects on light signaling pathways that influence stomatal responses. This
      represents a downstream consequence of COP1's primary light signaling function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While the IGI evidence supports some connection between COP1 and stomatal
      regulation, this is a peripheral function that likely results from COP1's broader

  review:
    summary: While COP1 does interact with proteins as part of its regulatory function,
      the generic "protein binding" term provides little functional insight. More
      specific molecular function terms would be more informative.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: According to curation guidelines, "protein binding" doesn't provide meaningful

  review:
    summary: This annotation suggests COP1 is part of a CUL4-based E3 ligase complex,
      but COP1 is actually a single-subunit RING E3 ligase that works with SPA proteins,
      not CUL4. This may represent confusion with other E3 ligases.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: COP1 is not a component of CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. COP1
      functions as a single-subunit RING E3 ligase that associates with SPA proteins
      to form its own type of complex. This annotation appears to be incorrect.
