  label: Populus trichocarpa
description: Acidic endochitinase WIN6.2C, a glycoside hydrolase family 19 enzyme that catalyzes the random endo-hydrolysis of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (1->4)-beta-linkages in chitin and chitodextrins. Functions as a plant defense protein against chitin-containing fungal pathogens and is induced by wounding. Contains a chitin-binding domain and a catalytic domain. The protein is synthesized as a precursor with a signal peptide and belongs to the chitinase class I subfamily.
