description: 'DNA polymerase I from Yersinia phage phiR8-01 (g022). This is a phage-encoded DNA-directed DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) that catalyzes the synthesis of DNA during viral genome replication. The protein belongs to DNA polymerase family A and contains a characteristic palm domain for nucleotidyltransferase activity.'

    label: DNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'While DNA polymerases do bind DNA, this term is too general and does not capture the specific catalytic function. The more specific term DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003887) already implies DNA binding and better represents the molecular function.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'Correctly identified as overly general. DNA binding is inherent in DNA polymerase activity and adds no additional functional information. The specific molecular function GO:0003887 is more informative.'

    summary: 'This is the core molecular function of the protein, directly supported by the EC number 2.7.7.7 and UniProt annotation as "DNA polymerase I, phage-associated". The InterPro domains confirm DNA polymerase family A membership.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Correctly identified as the core function. EC 2.7.7.7 directly corresponds to DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity. UniProt domain annotation (residues 483-738) and InterPro family classification strongly support this annotation.'

  review:
    summary: 'Accurate but somewhat general. The more specific term "viral DNA genome replication" (GO:0039693) is more appropriate for a phage polymerase, making this term redundant.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: 'Upon further consideration, this annotation should be kept as non-core rather than removed. While viral DNA genome replication is more specific, DNA replication is still accurate and represents the broader biological process. This follows GO annotation principles where both general and specific terms can coexist.'

  review:
    summary: 'TreeGrafter prediction likely based on homology to bacterial DNA polymerase I which has repair functions. However, phage DNA polymerases are primarily dedicated to viral genome replication, not host DNA repair. No evidence supports this specific repair function in the phage context.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'This annotation should be removed rather than marked as over-annotated. There is no evidence that this phage polymerase functions in double-strand break repair. The TreeGrafter prediction appears to be based on superficial homology to bacterial Pol I without considering the specialized viral context. Phage polymerases are optimized for rapid viral genome replication, not DNA repair processes.'
