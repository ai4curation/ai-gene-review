description: >-
  Phage-encoded dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction
  of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). DfrP is an auxiliary metabolic gene (AMG)
  encoded by Bacillus phage phiNIT1, a Bastilleviridae phage. The phage carries both dfrP and
  thyA (thymidylate synthase) genes to form a self-sufficient thymidine synthesis cycle during
  infection. This ensures robust nucleotide production for viral DNA replication. DfrP belongs
  to the trimethoprim-resistant DfrA family of DHFRs, which can confer antibiotic resistance
  to the infected host cell.

      True but too general. The more specific term GO:0004146 (dihydrofolate reductase activity)
      is already annotated and should be preferred.

      Redundant with GO:0004146 which provides the specific oxidoreductase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Core biological process. DfrP directly catalyzes the final step in THF biosynthesis -
      the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. This is not merely
      modulation of a host process; the phage-encoded enzyme directly performs the
      biosynthetic reaction. THF is essential for thymidylate synthesis (DNA precursor),
      purine synthesis, and amino acid biosynthesis. The phage carries this gene as an
      auxiliary metabolic gene to ensure robust THF production during viral DNA replication,
      forming a complete folate cycle together with its thymidylate synthase (thyA) gene.

        supporting_text: >-
          the reaction catalyzed by DfrP is needed to produce THF for the de novo synthesis
          of glycine and purines, and for the continuous production of DNA precursors like
          thymidine (via the thymidylate synthase pathway)

          By providing its own DHFR and TS, phiNIT1 ensures that the infected host cell can
          efficiently produce dTMP and other nucleotides, even if host pathways are

      - reference_id: file:9CAUD/dfrP/dfrP-deep-research-openai.md
        supporting_text: >-
          The combined presence of TS and DHFR in phiNIT1 means the phage can form a
          complete folate cycle independent of host regulation, securing a robust supply
          of DNA building blocks for phage genome synthesis

  review:
    summary: >-
      Appropriate broader process annotation. DHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism,
      converting oxidized folate (DHF) back to the reduced active form (THF).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While correct, this is a broader parental process. The more specific GO:0046452
      (dihydrofolate metabolic process) and GO:0046654 (tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic process)
      better capture the direct function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      DfrP is predicted to localize to the host cell cytoplasm where folate metabolism occurs.
      As a viral enzyme expressed during phage infection, GO guidelines specify using
      'host cell cytoplasm' (GO:0030430) rather than generic 'cytoplasm' for viral proteins.
      Cytoplasmic localization is expected by analogy to other DHFR enzymes (no signal
      peptide or transmembrane domains).
