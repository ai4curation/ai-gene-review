# darB Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: phage@mit.edu
**Key Interest**: Novel phage DNA modification system

## Key Findings

### DNA Hypermodification System
- **7-deazaguanine modifications**: Replaces guanine in phage DNA
- Creates hypermodified DNA resistant to restriction enzymes
- Essential for evading bacterial defense systems
- Part of queuosine-like modification pathway

### Molecular Function
1. **Amidotransferase activity**:
   - Transfers ammonia to deazaguanine precursor
   - Uses glutamine as nitrogen donor
   - Coupled to GTP hydrolysis

2. **Biosynthetic pathway**:
   - Works with DarA (7-cyano-7-deazaguanine synthase)
   - Produces preQ0-like intermediate
   - Modified base incorporated during replication

3. **Host evasion strategy**:
   - Modified DNA invisible to restriction enzymes
   - Escapes CRISPR targeting
   - Resistant to host nucleases

### Evolutionary Significance
- Found in diverse bacteriophages
- Convergent evolution with archaeal modifications
- Related to queuosine tRNA modification
- Arms race with bacterial immunity

## GO Annotation Review
- Added amidotransferase activity
- Added viral DNA modification process
- Emphasized defense evasion function
- Created new terms for hypermodification

## Structural Biology
- Similar to tunneling-fold enzymes
- Glutaminase and synthase domains
- Ammonia channeling mechanism
- Conserved active site architecture
