description: DarB is a phage-encoded DNA methyltransferase homolog from bacteriophage P1 that must be injected into host cells to be functional. This 512-residue protein contains a Type II methyltransferase TaqI-like domain and SAM-dependent methyltransferase fold. As noted by the colleague who suggested this gene, DarB exemplifies phage proteins that require delivery into the host cell for activity, likely functioning in DNA modification to protect phage DNA from host restriction systems or to regulate gene expression during the phage life cycle. The protein is encoded as part of the phage genome but must be transferred to the host cytoplasm during infection to carry out its methylation function.

  review:
    summary: DarB functions in the host cell cytoplasm where it must be delivered during phage P1 infection to carry out its DNA methyltransferase activity. The protein is encoded by the phage but requires injection into the host cytoplasm to modify host DNA and protect phage DNA from restriction systems
    action: NEW
    reason: Cytoplasmic localization is essential for DarB function as a phage-encoded methyltransferase that must be delivered to the host cell interior. Unlike typical phage structural proteins, DarB requires access to the host cytoplasm to modify DNA substrates and protect phage DNA from host restriction-modification systems
