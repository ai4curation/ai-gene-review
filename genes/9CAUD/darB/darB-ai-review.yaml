  label: Tequatrovirus
description: DarB is a 251 kDa antirestriction protein from bacteriophage P1 
  that protects phage DNA from host Type I restriction-modification systems, 
  specifically EcoB and EcoK. The protein contains an N-terminal Type II 
  methyltransferase M.TaqI-like domain and a central DExD-like helicase domain. 
  DarB is incorporated into the phage virion during assembly and is ejected into
  the host cell cytoplasm along with phage DNA at infection initiation, where it
  provides protection against host restriction systems. The protein is part of a
  multicomponent antirestriction system that also includes DarA, DdrA, DdrB, 
  Hdf, and Ulx proteins.

    review:
      summary: Too general and not the core biological process - methylation may
        occur but the key function is antirestriction defense
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While DarB has a methyltransferase domain suggesting methylation 
        activity, the primary biological function is antirestriction. 
        Methylation is a molecular mechanism, not the biological role
