description: 'The small subunit of the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP), which acts as a methyl group carrier in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for CO2 fixation. AcsD binds a corrinoid (B12 derivative) cofactor and receives methyl groups from methyltetrahydrofolate methyltransferase (AcsE), subsequently transferring them to acetyl-CoA synthase (AcsB) for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis. Forms a heterohexamer complex with AcsC (large subunit) and AcsE.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'AcsD is directly involved in one-carbon metabolism through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, serving as a methyl group carrier that transfers C1 units from methyltetrahydrofolate to acetyl-CoA synthase. The crystal structure [PMID:22419154] and biochemical studies demonstrate its essential role in methyl transfer reactions using a corrinoid cofactor.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation accurately captures a core function of AcsD. The protein specifically handles one-carbon units (methyl groups) as part of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, transferring them from 5-methyl-H4folate to acetyl-CoA synthase via its corrinoid cofactor. This is well-supported by structural and biochemical evidence from PMID:22419154.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'AcsD is essential for carbon fixation via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which fixes CO2 into acetyl-CoA. However, the more specific term GO:0030634 (carbon fixation by acetyl-CoA pathway) would better represent its precise function.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While AcsD is indeed involved in carbon fixation, the generic term GO:0015977 is too broad. The protein specifically functions in the Wood-Ljungdahl (reductive acetyl-CoA) pathway, a specific type of carbon fixation. The more precise term GO:0030634 (carbon fixation by acetyl-CoA pathway) better captures this specificity.'

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation is accurate and represents a core molecular function of AcsD. The protein contains a corrinoid-binding domain that specifically binds a B12 derivative (5′-methoxybenzimidazolyl cobamide in M. thermoacetica). This binding is essential for the methyl transfer activity and is directly observed in crystal structures.'

  review:
    summary: 'While AcsD does interact with AcsC (forming heterohexamer) and AcsE (methyltransferase), the generic "protein binding" term is uninformative. More specific terms describing the functional complex formation would be more appropriate.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'The term "protein binding" is too vague and uninformative. AcsD forms specific functional complexes: it heterodimerizes with AcsC to form the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein, and this complex then associates with AcsE (methyltransferase) to form a ~220 kDa complex. A more specific term like "protein heterodimerization activity" (GO:0046982) or noting its participation in the "acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex" (GO:0044672) would be more informative.'
