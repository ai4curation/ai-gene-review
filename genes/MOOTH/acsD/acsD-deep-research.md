# Introduction  
The **acsD gene** of *Moorella thermoacetica* (formerly *Clostridium thermoaceticum*) encodes the small subunit of the **corrinoid iron–sulfur protein (CFeSP)**, a key enzyme component in this bacterium’s Wood–Ljungdahl pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=Abbreviations%20are%20as%20follows%3A%20cooC%3A,COG1908%29%3B%20clp)). *M. thermoacetica* is a model homoacetogenic bacterium widely studied for its ability to **fix CO₂ (and CO) into acetate** via the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood–Ljungdahl pathway) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=This%20paper%20describes%20the%20genome,Methanogenic)). This pathway enables growth on one-carbon substrates (H₂/CO₂ or CO) and produces acetate as the primary product ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=thermoaceticum,a%20wide%20variety%20of%20carbon)). Below, we provide a comprehensive overview of AcsD, including its molecular function, cellular role, biological processes, structural features, regulation, evolutionary conservation, and supporting experimental evidence, with an emphasis on information relevant to Gene Ontology (GO) curation.

## Function and Molecular Mechanism  
**AcsD** is the small (≈33 kDa) subunit of the heterodimeric corrinoid/iron–sulfur protein (CFeSP) and functions as a **methyl group carrier** in the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=The%20corrinoid%2Firon,The%20protein%20was%20first%20purified)). It binds a corrinoid (cobalamin derivative) cofactor containing cobalt, which can cycle between oxidation states to accept and donate methyl groups. In the **acetyl-CoA synthesis reaction**, AcsD (as part of CFeSP) receives a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (via the methyltransferase AcsE) and carries a methyl–Co(III)–corrinoid moiety ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)). This methyl group is then transferred to the nickel–iron–sulfur center of acetyl-CoA synthase (the AcsB subunit of the CODH/ACS complex), where it combines with a carbonyl group (from CO) and CoA to form acetyl-CoA ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)). This methyl transfer is an **essential step in the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway** of anaerobic CO/CO₂ fixation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)). Mechanistically, the transfer follows an S<sub>N</sub>2-like pathway, meaning the methyl group is directly attacked by the Ni-based active site of AcsB ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)). Importantly, the cobalt center of the corrinoid must be in the reduced Co(I) state to accept a methyl group; after each catalytic cycle, the cobalt can become oxidized to Co(II), which is catalytically inactive ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=convincing%20evidence%20that%20oxidative%20inactivation,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). An ATP-dependent “reductive activation” system (an auxiliary enzyme in the cell) regenerates Co(I) by transferring electrons, and **AcsD’s partner subunit (AcsC)** houses a [4Fe–4S] cluster that serves as an electron conduit to reduce the cobalt center ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=catalytic%20cycle%20one%20in%20every,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). The [4Fe–4S] cluster itself is not directly involved in methyl transfer chemistry but is crucial for delivering electrons from physiological reductants to the corrinoid, reactivating the Co(I) state ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=catalytic%20cycle%20one%20in%20every,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). Thus, AcsD works in concert with its large subunit and other enzyme components to **shuttle one-carbon units and electrons** needed for acetyl-CoA synthesis. In summary, **AcsD’s molecular function** is to bind a cobamide cofactor and transiently carry a methyl group for transfer to acetyl-CoA synthase, **acting as a methyl-cobalamin carrier** in this pathway (GO:0031418: cobalamin binding; GO:0016740: one-carbon group transferase activity, *associated*). 

## Cellular Localization and Complex Association  
Within the cell, AcsD is located in the **cytoplasm**, as part of a multi-enzyme complex responsible for acetyl-CoA synthesis. *M. thermoacetica* is a Gram-positive anaerobe, so all Wood–Ljungdahl pathway reactions occur in the cytosol. AcsD (CFeSP small subunit) and AcsC (CFeSP large subunit) form a tight **αβ heterodimer** (the CFeSP itself) ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=The%20corrinoid%2Firon,The%20protein%20was%20first%20purified)). This CFeSP interacts functionally with the **carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex**, which in acetogens consists of multiple subunits (analogous to the five-polypeptide acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex of methanogens) ([www.yeastgenome.org](https://www.yeastgenome.org/go/GO%3A0044672#:~:text=acetyl,S%20bonds)). In *M. thermoacetica*, the CFeSP is not covalently bound to CODH/ACS, but it transiently docks with the CODH/ACS enzyme to deliver the methyl group and receive electrons for cobalt reactivation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=catalytic%20cycle%20one%20in%20every,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). Crystallographic evidence shows that the **corrinoid protein and its partner methyltransferase form a large complex** (~220 kDa) during methyl transfer reactions ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=X,movement%20within%20the%20large%20enzyme)). Specifically, the CFeSP (AcsC–AcsD) and the methyltetrahydrofolate methyltransferase (AcsE) can associate into a functional complex that positions the corrinoid cofactor in proximity to the methyl donor (5-methyl-THF) and then to the CODH/ACS enzyme ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=X,movement%20within%20the%20large%20enzyme)) ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,movements%20of%20proteins%20in%20a)). This indicates that AcsD operates as part of a **modular enzyme assembly** in the cytosol (GO:0044672: acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex; GO:0005737: cytoplasm).

## Biological Processes Involvement  
AcsD is indispensable for the **Wood–Ljungdahl pathway**, also known as the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, which is the central **CO₂-fixation route** in *M. thermoacetica* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=thermoaceticum,a%20wide%20variety%20of%20carbon)). Through this pathway, two molecules of CO₂ (or CO and CO₂) are reduced and combined to form acetyl-CoA, which can then be converted to acetate or used in biomass synthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=Acetogenic%20bacteria%20are%20strict%20anaerobes,27)). AcsD specifically enables the methylation step in this pathway, effectively linking the “Eastern branch” of the pathway (folate-dependent C1 reduction to a methyl group) with the “Western branch” (CO₂ reduction to CO and acetyl-CoA assembly) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=be%20cleaved%2C%20yielding%20acetate%2C%20CoA%2C,27)). By carrying the methyl group, AcsD helps generate **acetyl-CoA from CO₂**, which is subsequently converted to acetate by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase, yielding ATP. Thus, AcsD participates in **autotrophic growth on H₂/CO₂ or CO** by facilitating carbon fixation via the acetyl-CoA pathway (GO:0030634: carbon fixation by acetyl-CoA pathway) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=thermoaceticum,a%20wide%20variety%20of%20carbon)). In heterotrophic growth (e.g. on sugars), *M. thermoacetica* still uses the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway to dispose of reducing equivalents, meaning AcsD is also active in fermentation of organic substrates to acetate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=C,no%20effect%20on%20the%20specific)). The presence and activity of AcsD (and the entire acs gene cluster) define the homoacetogenic phenotype: organisms with this pathway convert a variety of substrates into acetate as a primary product ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=have%20a%20highly%20diverse%20metabolic,and%20electron%20donors%20and%20acceptors)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=Thermoanaerobacter%20tengcongensis%20%28Bao%20et%20al,the%20core%20genes%20of%20the)). In broader terms, AcsD is involved in **one-carbon metabolism** and **acetyl-CoA biosynthesis** from inorganic carbon (GO:0006085: acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process). This activity contributes to ecological processes like carbon cycling and energy conservation in anaerobes. Notably, acetogenic bacteria like *M. thermoacetica* play a role in certain ecosystems (e.g. animal gastrointestinal tracts) by consuming H₂ and CO₂ and producing acetate, a process in which AcsD is a key enzyme participant ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=%28Chassard%20and%20Bernalier,and%20since%20the)). There are **no known disease associations** for acsD, as *M. thermoacetica* is non-pathogenic; instead, its “phenotype” is a metabolic one – i.e. the ability to carry out acetogenesis. In various animal gut microbiomes (ruminants, termites, etc.), acetogens with the acsD-containing pathway provide acetate that can be a beneficial nutrient for the host and compete with methanogens for substrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=%28Chassard%20and%20Bernalier,and%20since%20the)). Thus, while acsD does not relate to human disease, it is central to the **acetogenic metabolic process** and can influence microbial community metabolism.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
**AcsD (CFeSP small subunit)** is a corrinoid-binding protein that contains the **binding pocket for a cobamide (cobalamin) cofactor**. Sequence analyses indicate that AcsD harbors conserved motifs typical of corrinoid-dependent enzymes, including a cobalt-coordinating histidine residue (a hallmark that directly binds the corrinoid’s cobalt). The protein’s structure has been determined as part of the CFeSP: it is predominantly α/β and forms a compact domain that clamps around the **corrinoid** cofactor ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,movements%20of%20proteins%20in%20a)). The **large subunit, AcsC**, provides a [4Fe–4S] cluster, and together the α (AcsD) and β (AcsC) subunits form a complete corrinoid/Fe-S protein with one corrinoid and one iron–sulfur cluster per αβ dimer ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=The%20corrinoid%2Firon,The%20protein%20was%20first%20purified)). Interestingly, although the **corrinoid-binding residues lie within AcsD**, the presence of AcsC is required to form a stable holoprotein that can tightly bind the corrinoid ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=per%20mol%20of%20an%20%CE%B1%CE%B2,who%20also%20expressed%20it)). AcsC contributes additional domains – including the Fe–S-binding domain – and likely helps orient AcsD’s corrinoid pocket for catalysis ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=fixation,2%7D%20fixation%20by%20anaerobic)). The **holo-CFeSP** has a molecular weight of ~88 kDa (33 kDa AcsD + 55 kDa AcsC) and contains one cobalt (in corrinoid) and one [4Fe–4S] cluster ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=The%20corrinoid%2Firon,The%20protein%20was%20first%20purified)). Structurally, the CFeSP has been crystallized in complex with its methyltransferase (AcsE) and folate, revealing that the protein undergoes significant **conformational changes** during methyl transfer ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,movements%20of%20proteins%20in%20a)). Notably, the X-ray crystal structures (2.4 Å resolution) of the *M. thermoacetica* CFeSP–MeTr complex captured the **B₁₂ cofactor in multiple positions** (between a “resting” site and the active site), illustrating how the protein’s domains move to deliver the corrinoid to the methyl donor and then to the acceptor ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,explain%20why%20such%20an%20elaborate)). These structures showed that a large **protein rearrangement (“molecular juggling”)** is required to shield and reposition the corrinoid cofactor during catalysis ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,explain%20why%20such%20an%20elaborate)). A flexible linker region (proline-rich, in AcsC) allows the small subunit AcsD to swing the corrinoid between different protein partners (the MeTr enzyme and the ACS active site) ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,movements%20of%20proteins%20in%20a)). Key **domains** identified by homology/InterPro include a cobalamin-binding domain (in AcsD) and an iron–sulfur ferredoxin-like domain (in AcsC) that work in tandem. The protein complex as a whole belongs to the **corrinoid/iron–sulfur protein family** (Pfam PF03599) and AcsD specifically corresponds to the smaller corrinoid-binding subunit (UniProt Q07341) ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=Synonyms%3A%20AcsD%3B%20corrinoid%2FFe,%CE%B1%20subunit)). In summary, AcsD’s structure is tailored to **bind the B₁₂ cofactor** and present it for methyl transfer, highlighting features such as the cobalt-binding site and interface with AcsC, while its partnership with AcsC provides the redox-active [4Fe–4S] cluster necessary for maintaining the cofactor in the correct state ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=fixation,2%7D%20fixation%20by%20anaerobic)). *(GO:0031418: cobalamin binding; GO:0051536: iron–sulfur cluster binding, **for CFeSP complex**).* 

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
The acsD gene resides in the **acs operon (acsA-E)**, a cluster of core Wood–Ljungdahl pathway genes that are co-transcribed and co-regulated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genes%20encoding%20homologs%20of%20the,to%20grow%20as%20an%20acetogen)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=Abbreviations%20are%20as%20follows%3A%20cooC%3A,COG1908%29%3B%20clp)). Expression of acsD is tightly linked to the metabolic state of the cell. Under autotrophic conditions (growth on H₂ + CO₂ or CO), the **acs genes are highly expressed**, as the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway is active to fix carbon and generate energy. Conversely, in the presence of alternative electron acceptors like nitrate, *M. thermoacetica* down-regulates the acetyl-CoA pathway. Specifically, adding nitrate to cultures causes a significant decrease in the levels of the CFeSP protein: Western blot analysis showed the CFeSP subunits (including AcsD) drop to ~40% of their normal level in nitrate-grown cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=activity%20paralleled%20a%20decrease%20in,fold%20decrease)). Nitrate-supplemented cultures had 5-fold lower CO-oxidizing activity and correspondingly lower CODH/ACS and CFeSP protein content ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=Nitrate%20has%20been%20shown%20to,levels%20of%20CODH%20in%20nitrate)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=activity%20paralleled%20a%20decrease%20in,fold%20decrease)). This indicates a **repression of acsD (and associated genes)** under nitrate respiration conditions. Indeed, transcriptional analyses confirmed that nitrate exerts a **transcriptional repression** on Wood–Ljungdahl pathway genes, while simultaneously inducing nitrate respiration genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=corrinoid%20iron,Ljungdahl%20pathway)). In contrast, the presence of CO₂ (as a carbon source/electron acceptor) appears to **induce expression** of the acs operon, ensuring the pathway is active when needed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=thermoaceticum,and%20repress%20nitrate%20reductase%20activity)). Regulation is therefore adaptive: *M. thermoacetica* prioritizes energetically favorable electron acceptors (like nitrate) over CO₂, and when nitrate is available, the cell suppresses the acetyl-CoA pathway to avoid wasteful operation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=thermoaceticum,and%20repress%20nitrate%20reductase%20activity)). Aside from electron acceptors, other environmental factors (e.g. carbon source) can influence acsD expression; for instance, during heterotrophic growth on glucose, the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway still operates to re-assimilate CO₂ produced in metabolism, so acsD is expressed to allow disposal of reducing equivalents as acetate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=C,no%20effect%20on%20the%20specific)). Genetic manipulation studies are limited (due to difficulties in acetogen genetics), but **acsD is believed to be essential** – deletion or inactivation would block acetyl-CoA synthesis from C1 units, preventing autotrophic growth. Heterologous expression has demonstrated that the acsD and acsC genes can be expressed in *E. coli* and reconstituted to form an active corrinoid enzyme ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=binding%20protein%20,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)), indicating that transcription and translation of acsD yield a functional protein given the right cofactor availability. In summary, **acsD expression is highest during acetogenic growth** and is attenuated when alternative metabolic modes are engaged, pointing to a coordinated regulation of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway genes in response to environmental conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=corrinoid%20iron,Ljungdahl%20pathway)).

## Evolutionary Conservation  
The AcsD protein and the acsD gene are highly conserved among **acetogenic bacteria** and other organisms that utilize the acetyl-CoA pathway. Comparative genomic analyses show that acsD is almost invariably found **in conjunction with the other Wood–Ljungdahl pathway genes** (e.g. acsA, acsB, acsC, acsE) and is absent in organisms that lack this pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genomes%20that%20also%20have%20acetyl,Ljungdahl%20pathway%20genes)). In a broad survey, only genomes containing the acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS, AcsB) also contained homologs of the CFeSP subunits (AcsC and AcsD); conversely, no genome lacking ACS was found to have acsD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genomes%20that%20also%20have%20acetyl,Ljungdahl%20pathway%20genes)). This strict **co-occurrence pattern** suggests that AcsD’s function is dedicated to the acetyl-CoA pathway and it has not been repurposed for other metabolic processes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genomes%20that%20also%20have%20acetyl,Ljungdahl%20pathway%20genes)). The acsD gene is present in diverse anaerobes: aside from *M. thermoacetica* (a Firmicute), it appears in other **homoacetogenic Firmicutes** (e.g. *Acetobacterium woodii*, *Clostridium ljungdahlii*), in some **Deltaproteobacteria** (such as *Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans* or *Desulfovibrio* species that can fix CO₂ via acetyl-CoA), and in certain **Dehalococcoidia** (e.g. *Dehalococcoides* sp., which harbor partial Wood–Ljungdahl pathways) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=The%20Wood,fumaroxidans%20and%20Candidatus%20Desulfococcus%20oleovorans)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=of%20the%20pathway%20%28Figure%202%29,located%20in%20the%20acs%20gene)). The gene is typically clustered with other pathway genes, though the operon arrangements can vary by lineage (some have additional genes inserted or missing, as noted in comparative genomics) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=The%20Wood,fumaroxidans%20and%20Candidatus%20Desulfococcus%20oleovorans)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=of%20the%20pathway%20%28Figure%202%29,located%20in%20the%20acs%20gene)). Interestingly, in a few organisms the functionality of AcsD is retained in a **fusion protein**: for example, one report noted a fusion between a methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase and a corrinoid protein small subunit (mthfr–acsD fusion), indicating a single polypeptide that links folate metabolism with the corrinoid protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=dehydrogenase%3B%20gcvH%3A%20glycine%20cleavage%20system,COG3383)). This suggests modular evolution and possible gene fusion events in certain lineages, although the separated form (as in *M. thermoacetica*) is more common. The strong conservation of AcsD and its universal pairing with ACS underscores that it performs a **highly conserved biochemical function** across these species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genomes%20that%20also%20have%20acetyl,Ljungdahl%20pathway%20genes)). In methanogenic archaea, an analogous role is played by subunits of the acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS) complex – these archaea have a five-subunit complex in which two subunits correspond functionally to AcsC/AcsD (often called CdhC and CdhD) participating in the reverse reaction (acetate oxidation to CO₂ and methane) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=co,CoA%20synthase%20and%20other%20Wood)). Thus, from an evolutionary perspective, AcsD (or its functional analogs) is an **ancestral enzyme component** in one-carbon metabolism, conserved from bacteria to some archaea that use the acetyl-CoA pathway. The distribution of acsD across distantly related microbes, and its absence in non-acetogens, implies that the entire pathway (including acsD) may have been transferred horizontally as a unit to confer autotrophic CO₂-fixing ability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=Since%20acetogenesis%20is%20a%20physiological,homologs%20in%20any%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genes%20encoding%20homologs%20of%20the,to%20grow%20as%20an%20acetogen)). In summary, AcsD is **evolutionarily conserved among acetogenic bacteria** and tightly associated with the presence of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, reflecting its indispensable role in that metabolism.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
The function of AcsD and the CFeSP has been elucidated through decades of biochemical and genetic studies on *M. thermoacetica* and related organisms. **Purification and characterization** of the CFeSP were first achieved in the 1980s – Hu *et al.* (1984) isolated the protein from *C. thermoaceticum*, confirming it contained a corrinoid (with cobalt) and iron–sulfur cluster cofactors ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=transfer%20function,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)). Spectroscopic analyses (Mössbauer, EPR) by Ragsdale and colleagues in 1987 further confirmed the presence of a [4Fe–4S] center and its redox interaction with the cobalt in the corrinoid ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=fixation,2%7D%20fixation%20by%20anaerobic)) ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=transfer%20function,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)). The **genes encoding CFeSP (acsD and acsC)** were cloned as part of the acs operon in *C. thermoaceticum* by Roberts *et al.* (1989) ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=binding%20protein%20,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)). This pioneering work identified the clustering of CODH (acsA), ACS (acsB), CFeSP (acsC, acsD), and MeTr (acsE) genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=be%20cleaved%2C%20yielding%20acetate%2C%20CoA%2C,27)), establishing the genetic basis of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. The acsD gene was sequenced in the early 1990s (Lu *et al.*, 1993), revealing the amino acid sequence and allowing expression in *E. coli* ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=binding%20protein%20,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)). **Recombinant AcsC/AcsD** produced in *E. coli* was successfully reconstituted with the corrinoid and [Fe–S] cofactors to restore full activity ([bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr](https://bf2i-artsymbiocyc.insa-lyon.fr/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=CPLX-2&type=ENZYME#:~:text=binding%20protein%20,expressed%20it%20in%20Escherichia%20coli)), underscoring that the gene sequence indeed encodes a functional corrinoid protein. Functional assays and rapid kinetics (e.g. by Ragsdale’s group) provided insight into the **mechanism of methyl transfer**: a seminal study by Menon & Ragsdale (1998) and Kumar *et al.* (1999) demonstrated that the methyl transfer from Me–Co(III)–CFeSP to ACS is an S<sub>N</sub>2-like nucleophilic attack and that the [4Fe–4S] cluster is required for reductive activation of the corrinoid ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=This%20paper%20focuses%20on%20how,I%29%20escapes%20from%20the)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=catalytic%20cycle%20one%20in%20every,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). These studies showed that when the cobalt on AcsD becomes oxidized (Co(II)), the [4Fe–4S] cluster (along with ATP and an external reductant) is needed to reduce it back to Co(I) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10206956/#:~:text=catalytic%20cycle%20one%20in%20every,reductants%20to%20the%20cobalt%20center)). The requirement of an ATP-dependent activating enzyme for CFeSP was also demonstrated (e.g. by Svetlitchnyi *et al.*, 2004, identifying an activator protein in acetogens), highlighting a crucial regulatory aspect of AcsD function. The ultimate **structural proof** of AcsD’s role came with X-ray crystallography: Kung *et al.* (2012) solved the crystal structures of the *M. thermoacetica* CFeSP in complex with its methyltransferase (MeTr) and folate ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=X,movement%20within%20the%20large%20enzyme)). This work, published in *Nature*, provided a 3D visualization of *M. thermoacetica* AcsD (and AcsC) with the corrinoid cofactor and captured snapshots of the **B₁₂ cofactor in transit** between protein modules ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,explain%20why%20such%20an%20elaborate)). The structures not only confirmed the domain architecture of AcsD (corrinoid-binding) and AcsC (Fe–S-binding), but also showed how the proteins undergo large conformational changes to protect and reposition the reactive methyl-cobalamin intermediate ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=all%20protein%20modules%20required%20for,explain%20why%20such%20an%20elaborate)). In tandem with **in crystallo spectroscopy**, these structural studies confirmed that the complex was catalytically active even in the crystal and exhibited one of the largest protein conformational movements observed in a crystal lattice ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4DJD#:~:text=and%20identification%20of%20the%20trajectory,simple%2C%20yet%20biologically%20essential%20reaction)). Additional evidence for AcsD’s function has come from mutational analysis (e.g. altering the cobalt-binding histidine abrogates methyl transfer) and from cross-species complementation (expressing *M. thermoacetica* CFeSP genes in other bacteria restores acetyl-CoA synthesis capability). Collectively, a rich body of literature – including enzyme assays, protein purification, spectroscopy, gene cloning/sequencing, structural biology, and regulatory studies – supports our current understanding of AcsD. This evidence base establishes that AcsD is the **corrinoid-dependent methyl carrier** at the heart of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis in acetogens, validating its assigned GO functions and its crucial role in microbial one-carbon metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2575129/#:~:text=genomes%20that%20also%20have%20acetyl,Ljungdahl%20pathway%20genes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC93538/#:~:text=be%20cleaved%2C%20yielding%20acetate%2C%20CoA%2C,27)).
