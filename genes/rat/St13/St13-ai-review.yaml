description: >-
  Hsc70-interacting protein (Hip/ST13) is a TPR-containing co-chaperone that
  regulates the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. Hip forms homo-oligomers (tetramers) and
  binds the ATPase domain of Hsc70, stabilizing the ADP-bound state which has
  high affinity for substrate proteins (PMID:7585962). By slowing ADP
  dissociation from Hsc70, Hip attenuates active cycling and enhances
  aggregation prevention (PMID:23812373). Hip possesses its own chaperone
  activity, binding non-native proteins but unable to facilitate their refolding
  independently (PMID:9183013). Hip competes with BAG-1 (a nucleotide exchange
  factor) for binding to the Hsc70 ATPase domain (PMID:9528774).

      Hip/St13 participates in protein folding as a co-chaperone of the Hsc70
