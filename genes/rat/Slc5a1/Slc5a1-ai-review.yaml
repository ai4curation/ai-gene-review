description: >-
  Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) is a high-affinity Na+-coupled symporter
  that actively transports D-glucose and D-galactose across the plasma membrane with
  2:1 Na+:glucose stoichiometry. SGLT1 is the primary transporter for dietary hexose
  absorption across the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine.
  In kidney, it functions in the S3 segment of proximal tubules for glucose reabsorption,
  handling approximately 3% of filtered glucose. Additionally serves as a water channel
  enabling passive water transport. Located at the blood-brain barrier in endothelial
  cells.
