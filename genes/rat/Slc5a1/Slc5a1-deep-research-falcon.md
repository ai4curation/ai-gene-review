## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P53790
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13866}; Short=Na(+)/glucose cotransporter 1; AltName: Full=High affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 5 member 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=Slc5a1; Synonyms=Sglt1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13866};
- **Organism (full):** Rattus norvegicus (Rat).

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Slc5a1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Rattus norvegicus (Rat).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Slc5a1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Slc5a1** (gene ID: Slc5a1, UniProt: P53790) in RAT.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status and verification
We verified the target identity: Slc5a1 encodes sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) in Rattus norvegicus. The collected evidence consistently describes a sodium:solute symporter (SSF family) that mediates 2 Na+ per glucose cotransport, is apically localized in intestinal enterocytes and in the S3 (late) segment of the proximal tubule, and is detected in heart—aligning with the UniProt P53790 annotation and SSF family/domain context (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88).

Executive summary
SGLT1 (Slc5a1) is a high‑affinity Na+-coupled symporter for D‑glucose and D‑galactose with 2:1 Na+:glucose stoichiometry. In rat, it operates at the apical (brush‑border) membrane of small‑intestinal enterocytes to absorb dietary hexoses and in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubule to reclaim a minor fraction of filtered glucose; it is also present in cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cells. Mechanistically, it follows an alternating‑access transport cycle characteristic of SSF transporters. SGLT1 is dynamically regulated by luminal carbohydrate and apical β2‑adrenergic receptor signaling (via PKA) that rapidly increases apical SGLT1 availability in rat intestine. Perturbations of SGLT1 function contribute to diarrheal pathophysiology and may shape renal compensation when SGLT2 is inhibited. Translationally, dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors (e.g., sotagliflozin) and intestine‑restricted SGLT1 inhibitors (e.g., LX2761) leverage these mechanisms but can cause GI adverse events when intestinal SGLT1 is inhibited. Key quantitative features and up‑to‑date references are summarized below (paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14, azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, rottenberger2024mechanismsunderlyingmonosaccharidea pages 66-70, kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).

Key concepts and definitions
• Primary function and substrates: SGLT1 is a Na+-dependent symporter for D‑glucose and D‑galactose, not fructose; it is characterized as high‑affinity/low‑capacity relative to SGLT2 (human/rodent consensus). The canonical stoichiometry is 2 Na+ per glucose, supporting uphill sugar transport (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1668400) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 2-3).
• Transport mechanism: SGLT1 conforms to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF) family’s Na+-coupled alternating‑access mechanism; structural advances in family members (SGLT2) and comparative analyses illuminate conserved motifs and gating transitions relevant to SGLT1 (Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1668400) (kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 2-3).
• Localization in rat tissues: SGLT1 is apical in small‑intestinal enterocytes (brush border), localized to the late proximal tubule (S3) in kidney (contributing a minor fraction of renal glucose reabsorption), and expressed in cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; preclinical/translational review, 2024) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationala pages 84-88).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 emphasis)
• Apical β2‑AR control of rat intestinal SGLT1: In everted rat intestinal sacs, epinephrine (10 μM) increased luminal‑to‑tissue glucose accumulation from 440 ± 132 to 833 ± 255 μM; this was prevented by the β2‑AR antagonist ICI 118,551 and was >90% suppressed by SGLT inhibitors (phlorizin 100 μM; LX4211 2 μM). Colchicine blocked the epinephrine effect without altering basal uptake, indicating β2‑AR–PKA‑dependent translocation of SGLT1 to the brush border (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.1041930) (paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14).
• Segmental intestinal regulation and incretin coupling: Recent syntheses highlight SGLT1’s proximal>distal intestinal gradient and its role in glucose‑dependent GLP‑1/GIP secretion, with pharmacologic or genetic inhibition blunting incretin responses; SGLT1 expression is responsive to luminal carbohydrate (Rottenberger, 2024) (rottenberger2024mechanismsunderlyingmonosaccharidea pages 66-70).
• Kidney physiology context and distribution of work between SGLTs: Contemporary analyses reiterate that early proximal SGLT2 handles the large majority of filtered glucose and SGLT1 in late S2/S3 reclaims the remainder; estimates include ~97% via SGLT2 vs ~3% via SGLT1 (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5).
• Intestinal transporter safety and drug interactions: A 2024 scoping analysis emphasizes that intestinal SGLT1 inhibition (e.g., dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors) can cause carbohydrate malabsorption and diarrhea; it catalogues intestinal transporter roles and potential unintended nutrient disposition changes (Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
• Dual SGLT1/2 inhibition: Sotagliflozin (LX4211) improves glycemic control by combining renal glucose excretion (SGLT2) with reduced postprandial intestinal absorption (SGLT1), but GI adverse effects reflect on‑target intestinal SGLT1 inhibition (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).
• Intestine‑restricted SGLT1 inhibition: LX2761 (nonabsorbable) is designed to limit systemic exposure and confine SGLT1 inhibition to the gut, aiming to reduce postprandial glycemia while mitigating systemic effects; reviews summarize its rationale and emergence (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).
• Selectivity ranking among marketed SGLT2 inhibitors: PBPK analysis indicates dual inhibitor sotagliflozin has the highest SGLT1 inhibition among tested agents, followed by ertugliflozin and empagliflozin (Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1142003) (kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).

Expert opinions and analysis
• Integrative positioning of SGLT1 in cardiorenal‑metabolic axis: Reviews synthesize that SGLT1 is high‑affinity/low‑capacity, localized to intestinal brush border and renal S3, and present in heart; SGLT1’s role becomes more prominent when SGLT2 is inhibited, with potential downstream compensations in late proximal segments (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; preclinical/translational review, 2024) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88).
• Intestinal endocrine–absorptive crosstalk: Contemporary analyses underscore SGLT1’s involvement in enteroendocrine sensing and incretin secretion, framing therapy designs (e.g., intestine‑restricted SGLT1 inhibitors) to modulate postprandial excursions while considering GI tolerability (Rottenberger, 2024) (rottenberger2024mechanismsunderlyingmonosaccharidea pages 66-70).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
• Stoichiometry: SGLT1 couples 2 Na+ to 1 glucose (vs SGLT2’s 1:1), enabling higher uphill transport capability per cycle (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5).
• Renal fractional reabsorption: Approximate division of filtered glucose reabsorption: ~97% SGLT2 (S1/S2) vs ~3% SGLT1 (late S2/S3) (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5).
• Rat intestinal β2‑AR regulation experiment: Epinephrine (10 μM) approximately doubled SGLT‑mediated glucose accumulation in rat everted sacs (440 ± 132 → 833 ± 255 μM), blocked by β2‑AR antagonism and SGLT inhibitors; colchicine abolished the epinephrine effect, consistent with SGLT1 translocation (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.1041930) (paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14).
• Clinical pharmacology context: Dual SGLT1/2 inhibition can provoke diarrhea due to unabsorbed intestinal carbohydrate and osmotic water retention when SGLT1 is inhibited (Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).

Detailed synthesis by topic
1) Primary function, substrates, stoichiometry, mechanism
SGLT1 (Slc5a1) is the apical Na+-dependent glucose/galactose symporter responsible for active uptake against the luminal gradient, with 2 Na+ per glucose coupling and an alternating‑access mechanism typical of the SSF transporter family. This high‑affinity profile contrasts with SGLT2’s lower affinity and 1:1 coupling (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1668400) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 2-3).

2) Tissue and cellular localization in rat
• Intestine: SGLT1 is localized to the brush‑border (apical) membrane of enterocytes, mediating dietary glucose/galactose absorption. Rat experiments directly demonstrate SGLT‑dependent uptake in intestinal sacs and β2‑AR‑driven acute regulation (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.1041930) (paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14).
• Kidney: In rat and other mammals, SGLT1 is localized to the late proximal tubule (S3), reclaiming the final portion of filtered glucose after the bulk reabsorption by SGLT2 in S1/S2 (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5).
• Heart: SGLT1 is detected in cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types; preclinical/translational compilations report upregulation in pressure/volume overload and diabetic/ischemic cardiomyopathy (preclinical/translational review, 2024) (mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationala pages 84-88).

3) Mechanism and domains (SSF family)
SGLT1 is an SSF family member whose Na+-coupled alternating‑access cycle enables secondary active transport. Comparative structural biology across SGLTs (including SGLT2 cryo‑EM with MAP17) provides mechanistic insights into Na+-binding, gating transitions, and inhibitor binding modes that, by homology, inform SGLT1 annotation (Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1668400) (kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 2-3).

4) Regulation by diet/fasting, hormones/GPCRs, kinases, ischemia
• Luminal carbohydrate and diurnal control: Intestinal SGLT1 expression/activity is upregulated by luminal carbohydrate and exhibits segment‑dependent regulation; contemporary syntheses highlight proximal > distal expression and incretin coupling as adaptive responses (Rottenberger, 2024) (rottenberger2024mechanismsunderlyingmonosaccharidea pages 66-70).
• β2‑AR/PKA signaling in rat intestine: β2‑adrenergic receptor at the apical membrane senses sugars and epinephrine, promoting PKA‑dependent SGLT1 translocation and enhanced uptake in rat enterocytes (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.1041930) (paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14).
• PKC/PKA post‑translational modulation and cardiometabolic stresses: Reviews summarize PKA/PKC phosphorylation sites, leptin/insulin effects, and upregulation with pressure/volume overload or ischemic/diabetic cardiomyopathy; these compile mechanistic regulation relevant to SGLT1 in intestine and heart (preclinical/translational review, 2024) (mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationala pages 84-88).

5) Roles in pathophysiology and compensatory changes
• Diarrhea: When intestinal SGLT1 is inhibited (e.g., dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors), carbohydrate malabsorption increases luminal osmotic load and water retention, leading to diarrhea; this mechanism is highlighted in transporter‑focused safety analyses (Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).
• Renal compensation during SGLT2 inhibition: With SGLT2 blocked, glucose delivery distally increases and SGLT1 in late PT/S3 becomes proportionally more consequential, with downstream segmental adjustments (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; preclinical/translational review, 2024) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88).

6) Applications: SGLT1‑selective and dual inhibitors; selectivity and clinical findings
• Sotagliflozin (dual SGLT1/2) lowers postprandial and fasting glucose via intestinal and renal actions but has GI adverse effects consistent with intestinal SGLT1 inhibition. Contemporary comparisons and PBPK modeling rank sotagliflozin highest for SGLT1 inhibition among evaluated agents (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1142003) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).
• LX2761 (nonabsorbable SGLT1 inhibitor) is designed to be gut‑restricted to reduce postprandial glycemia with reduced systemic exposure (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; Pharmaceutics, 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16040447) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, kharve2024impactofdrugmediated pages 4-7).

7) Quantitative parameters and data needs
• Stoichiometry and fractional renal contribution are well‑supported (2:1 Na+:glucose; ~3% SGLT1 renal reabsorption). Precise rat SGLT1 Km values were not directly resolved in the 2023–2024 sources identified here; the functional “high‑affinity” characterization is consistent across reviews and experimental contexts (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5).

*Table: Compact, sourced summary table of functional, localization, regulatory and translational data for rat Slc5a1 (SGLT1, UniProt P53790), with primary citations to the gathered evidence for quick reference.*

Mandatory verification (symbol, organism, family)
• Gene symbol Slc5a1 unambiguously matches the SGLT1 transporter in rat; the literature reviewed consistently refers to SGLT1’s intestinal/renal/cardiac expression and 2:1 Na+:glucose mechanism, matching UniProt P53790 and SSF family/domain annotations (Advanced Therapeutics, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202300143; preclinical/translational review, 2024) (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationalb pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslational pages 84-88, mroueh2024preclinicalandtranslationala pages 84-88).

Limitations and open points
• Rat‑specific kinetic constants (Km) and fine‑grained nephron‑segment expression atlases were not located within the retrieved 2023–2024 sources; future inclusion of rat‑focused primary physiologic measurements would strengthen quantitative annotation. Nonetheless, the key qualitative and semi‑quantitative features (stoichiometry, localization, regulatory paradigms) are robustly supported here (azizogli2023comparisonofsglt1 pages 3-5, paulussen2023theβ2adrenergicreceptor pages 11-14).
