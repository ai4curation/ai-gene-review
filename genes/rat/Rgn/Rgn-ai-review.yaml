description: Regucalcin (SMP30) is a multifunctional calcium-binding protein and gluconolactonase
  enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step in vitamin C biosynthesis. It regulates
  intracellular calcium homeostasis by modulating Ca2+-ATPase activity, suppresses
  protein translation as well as DNA and RNA synthesis, and has anti-apoptotic effects.
  Expression decreases with aging, hence its alternative name Senescence Marker Protein
  30.
