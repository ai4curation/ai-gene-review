# Rgn (Regucalcin) Research Notes

## Core Enzymatic Function

Regucalcin/SMP30 is the lactone-hydrolyzing enzyme gluconolactonase (GNL) in the liver responsible for L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthesis [PMID:16585534 "SMP30 purified from the rat liver had lactonase activity toward various aldonolactones, such as d- and l-glucono-δ-lactone, d- and l-gulono-γ-lactone, and d- and l-galactono-γ-lactone, with a requirement for Zn2+ or Mn2+ as a cofactor"]. The lactonase reaction with l-gulono-γ-lactone is the penultimate step in vitamin C biosynthesis [PMID:16585534 "The lactonase reaction with l-gulono-γ-lactone is the penultimate step in l-ascorbic acid (AA) biosynthesis"]. SMP30 knockout mice developed scurvy when fed vitamin C-deficient diet, confirming its essential role in vitamin C synthesis [PMID:16585534 "These knockout mice (n = 6), fed a vitamin C-deficient diet, did not thrive; i.e., they displayed symptoms of scurvy such as bone fracture and rachitic rosary and then died by 135 days"].

## Calcium Binding and Regulation

Regucalcin was originally discovered as a calcium-binding protein in 1978 [PMID:699201], though it lacks the typical EF-hand Ca2+-binding motif. It increases Ca2+-ATPase activity in heart mitochondria [PMID:16786169 "The addition of regucalcin (10^-11-10^-8 M) in the enzyme reaction mixture caused a significant increase in Ca2+-ATPase activity in heart mitochondria"]. This regulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity is important for maintaining calcium homeostasis [PMID:16786169 "regucalcin has an activating effect on Ca2+-ATPase in rat heart mitochondria, suggesting its role in the regulation of heart mitochondrial function"].

## Developmental Expression

Regucalcin expression is coordinately upregulated with tissue maturation and gradually downregulated with aging [PMID:8794449]. In liver, peak expression occurs in 5-day-old neonates with a second increase from day 7-10, then decreases in adults to about 1/3 of neonatal levels [PMID:8794449 from UniProt]. In kidney, expression increases from day 21, peaks at day 35, and remains high until 3 months.

## Cellular Functions Beyond Vitamin C Synthesis

### Regulation of Macromolecule Biosynthesis
- Inhibits aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, negatively regulating protein synthesis [PMID:2280766]
- Suppresses enhanced DNA synthesis in proliferating hepatoma cells [PMID:11500948]
- Suppresses enhanced RNA synthesis in regenerating liver [PMID:12397604]

### Anti-apoptotic Effects
- Overexpression suppresses apoptosis in hepatoma cells induced by sulforaphane [PMID:15806309]
- Suppresses apoptosis in kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells [PMID:16167335]
- Inhibits Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation in liver nuclei [PMID:2001740]

### Metabolic Regulation
- Enhances glucose utilization and lipid production in hepatoma cells [PMID:16817230]
- Increases fatty acid biosynthesis and triglyceride biosynthesis [PMID:16817230]
- Involved in intracellular calcium homeostasis and calcium-mediated signaling [PMID:16786169]

### Tissue-Specific Functions
- In bone: negatively regulates bone development [PMID:12239582, PMID:11129957]
- In testis: negatively regulates flagellated sperm motility but is required for spermatogenesis [PMID:23615721]
- In liver: essential for liver regeneration [PMID:7759556]
- In kidney: involved in epithelial cell proliferation control [PMID:16142398]

### Other Enzymatic Activities
- Increases calcium-independent proteolytic activity [PMID:1513338]
- Inhibits nitric oxide synthase activity in brain cytosol [PMID:12686401]

## Subcellular Localization

Regucalcin is found in:
- Cytoplasm (confirmed by multiple sources)
- Nucleus (ISS evidence)
- Mitochondria (especially in heart, where it regulates Ca2+-ATPase) [PMID:16786169]

## Clinical Significance

The protein is also known as Senescence Marker Protein 30 (SMP30) because its expression decreases with aging. Given its role in vitamin C synthesis and multiple regulatory functions, reduced expression with age may contribute to age-related dysfunction in calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress management, and metabolic regulation.
