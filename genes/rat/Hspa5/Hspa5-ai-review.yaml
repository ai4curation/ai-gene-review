description: >-
  Hspa5 (BiP/GRP78) is the ER-resident member of the HSP70 chaperone family. It
  functions as an ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone in the ER lumen, assisting
  in de novo folding of nascent polypeptides entering the secretory pathway and in
  quality control of misfolded proteins. BiP is a key regulator of the unfolded
  protein response (UPR), acting as a repressor of both IRE1 and PERK signaling
  arms by binding their luminal domains in the unstressed state and releasing them
  upon accumulation of misfolded proteins. It also participates in ERAD, post-
  translational translocation, and ER protein retention. BiP forms part of large
  ER chaperone complexes with co-chaperones (e.g., ERdj4, ERdj5), GRP94, and
  protein disulfide isomerases. It is also found at the cell surface in some
  contexts where it can act as a receptor for extracellular ligands.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for nuclear localization. BiP is primarily an ER lumen protein,
      but some HSP70 family members are found in the nucleus. UniProt notes cytoplasm
      and ER lumen as primary locations (PMID:3087629). Nuclear localization is not
      well documented for BiP/GRP78 specifically in the rat, though the IBA may
      reflect ancestral HSP70 family properties shared with cytoplasmic/nuclear
      paralogs.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is not a core feature of BiP/GRP78. The IBA likely
      reflects shared HSP70 family properties. BiP has a signal peptide and KDEL
      retention signal directing it to the ER lumen. Nucleus is not a primary
      location for this protein, though minor amounts may be detected.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for cytoplasmic localization. UniProt lists cytoplasm as a
      subcellular location for BiP, likely reflecting release from ER under stress
      or during apoptosis. This is a secondary localization for this ER-resident
      protein.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is secondary to BiP's primary ER lumen residency.
      The IBA reflects broad HSP70 family cytoplasmic presence. BiP can be released
      from ER under certain conditions, but the cytoplasm is not its primary
      functional location.

      IBA annotation for ATP hydrolysis activity. BiP has a well-characterized
      nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and is classified as EC 3.6.4.10 in UniProt.
      The ATPase activity is central to its chaperone cycle, regulated by J-domain

      ATP hydrolysis is a core molecular function of BiP/GRP78. UniProt assigns
      EC 3.6.4.10 and notes "ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate + H(+)" as the catalytic
      reaction. The ATPase activity drives the allosteric coupling between the
      nucleotide-binding and substrate-binding domains that is essential for
      chaperone function.

      Protein folding chaperone is the core molecular function of BiP. UniProt
      states BiP "plays a key role in protein folding and quality control in the

      IBA annotation for membrane localization. BiP is found associated with ER
      membranes (where it interacts with the translocon SEC61 complex) and can also
      be found at the cell surface. This is a very broad localization term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While very broad, this term is accurate. BiP associates with ER membranes
      during translocation (interacting with SEC61 and SEC62) and is also found at

      participate in refolding of misfolded proteins in the ER. This is consistent

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein refolding is a documented function of HSP70 chaperones including BiP.
      In the ER quality control context, BiP can assist in attempts to refold

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Response to ER stress is a core biological process for BiP. It is both

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Melanosome localization is based on proteomic detection by mass spectrometry
      and transferred by similarity. BiP is an abundant ER protein and melanosomes
      originate from the secretory pathway, so its presence may reflect transit

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Misfolded protein binding is a well-established function of BiP. It binds

  review:
    summary: >-
      ISO from human HSPA5. BiP/GRP78 was originally identified as a
      glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) -- its expression is strongly
      induced by glucose starvation, which triggers ER stress.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Response to glucose starvation is historically one of the defining
      features of GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78). BiP was named
      GRP78 precisely because of its robust induction by glucose
      deprivation. This is a well-established response.

    id: GO:0044183
    label: protein folding chaperone
  description: >-
    BiP/GRP78 is the ER-resident HSP70 chaperone that assists protein folding
    through ATP-dependent iterative binding and release cycles. This is its
    primary molecular function, supported by IBA (GO_REF:0000033), ISO
    (GO_REF:0000121), and extensive literature. UniProt classifies it as
    EC 3.6.4.10 with documented nucleotide-binding and substrate-binding
    domains. BiP sequesters IRE1 and PERK luminal domains in unstressed ER
    and releases them upon misfolded protein accumulation to activate UPR
    signaling. It also participates in ERAD through interaction with
    co-chaperones (DNAJC10/ERdj5) and ERAD machinery components.
    Per UPB project rules, HSP70 family members use GO:0044183 as
    the primary foldase term; holdase aspect awaits NTR.
