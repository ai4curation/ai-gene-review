description: PRKAA2 encodes the alpha-2 catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), a central cellular energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis.
  As a serine/threonine kinase, PRKAA2 is activated when cellular AMP/ATP ratios rise,
  triggering phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes to suppress anabolic processes (fatty
  acid/cholesterol synthesis) while promoting catabolic processes (fatty acid oxidation,
  glycolysis, autophagy). The protein forms heterotrimeric complexes with regulatory
  beta and gamma subunits, localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus, and phosphorylates
  key substrates including ACC (fatty acid synthesis), HMGCR (cholesterol synthesis),
  PFK-2 (glycolysis), and ChREBP (transcriptional regulation). Recent discoveries
  highlight its direct role in chromatin remodeling via histone H2B phosphorylation
  under stress conditions.

      PRKAA2 phosphorylates serine/threonine residues on numerous substrates (ACC,
      HMGCR, PFK-2, ChREBP, TSC2, Raptor). Multiple IDA studies confirm this activity
      (PMID:8955377, PMID:12065578).

  description: PRKAA2 executes ATP-dependent phosphorylation of key metabolic regulatory
    proteins in response to cellular AMP/ATP ratio changes. Primary phosphorylation
    targets include ACC (inhibiting fatty acid synthesis), PFK-2 (activating glycolysis),
    ChREBP (blocking lipogenic transcription), HMGCR (inhibiting cholesterol synthesis),
    and TSC2/Raptor (suppressing mTORC1). The kinase functions as part of a heterotrimeric
    complex activated by Thr172 phosphorylation when AMP levels rise, creating a molecular
    switch for cellular energy status.
