description: 'ABC transporter ATP-binding protein component of a carbohydrate import system for ribose, galactose, and methyl galactoside. Functions as the energy-coupling subunit that hydrolyzes ATP to drive substrate transport across the inner membrane. Contains two ABC transporter domains with conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs for ATP binding and hydrolysis.'

- term:

    label: D-ribose transmembrane transport
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation correctly identifies involvement in D-ribose transport, which is one of the substrates transported by this ABC transporter complex according to UniProt (EC 7.5.2.7). As the ATP-binding subunit, this protein provides the energy for ribose transport through ATP hydrolysis. The annotation is appropriate and represents a core function of this transporter.'

    label: ATP binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'This is a fundamental molecular function of ABC transporter ATP-binding subunits. The UniProt record confirms ATP binding sites at positions 46-53 and the presence of two ABC transporter domains with conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. This is absolutely core to the protein function as it must bind ATP before hydrolyzing it to power transport.'

    label: ATP hydrolysis activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'ATP hydrolysis is the core catalytic activity of this protein, converting the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical work for substrate transport. The UniProt record lists EC numbers 7.5.2.11 and 7.5.2.7, both of which involve ATP hydrolysis coupled to carbohydrate transport. This is an essential molecular function annotation.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This is a parent term of ATP binding (GO:0005524) and is redundant. While technically correct, it provides no additional information beyond the more specific ATP binding annotation. The ATP binding term is more informative for this protein.'

    label: plasma membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'The UniProt record specifies this protein is localized to the cell inner membrane as a peripheral membrane protein. For bacterial cells, the plasma membrane annotation is appropriate as it refers to the inner membrane. This is correct localization for an ABC transporter ATP-binding subunit that associates with membrane-embedded permease components.'
    action: ACCEPT
- term:
    id: GO:0015611
    label: ABC-type D-ribose transporter activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'This term describes the activity of the complete ABC transporter complex for D-ribose. However, this protein is specifically the ATP-binding subunit, not the complete transporter. The term would be more appropriate for the complex as a whole. A more precise term would be "ATPase-coupled D-ribose transmembrane transporter activity" (GO:0015407) or keep the broader ATP hydrolysis activity already annotated.'

    label: monosaccharide transmembrane transport
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'This is a broader parent term that encompasses both D-ribose and D-galactose transport, both of which are substrates for this transporter according to UniProt. While the more specific D-ribose transport term is already present, this broader term appropriately captures the galactose transport function (EC 7.5.2.11) as well. It represents a core function of the complex.'
