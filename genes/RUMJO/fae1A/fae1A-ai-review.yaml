  id: NCBITaxon:1499
  label: Ruminiclostridium josui
description: 'fae1A encodes a bifunctional enzyme with both cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) and feruloyl esterase activities. This bacterial enzyme from Ruminiclostridium josui catalyzes the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin and cereal beta-D-glucans, as well as the hydrolysis of feruloyl esters. The protein contains a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM6) and dockerin domain, suggesting it functions as part of a cellulosome complex for efficient plant cell wall degradation.'
