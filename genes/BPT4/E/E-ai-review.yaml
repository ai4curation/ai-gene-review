description: >-
  T4 endolysin (gene E product, also known as T4 lysozyme) is a GH24 family muramidase
  that catalyzes hydrolysis of the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid
  and N-acetylglucosamine in bacterial peptidoglycan. The enzyme functions in the periplasm
  after holin-mediated membrane permeabilization, degrading the peptidoglycan layer to enable
  viral release during the lytic cycle. It is one of the most extensively studied enzymes,
  with over 700 crystal structures deposited in the PDB. The catalytic mechanism involves a
  conserved Glu11-Asp20-Thr26 triad operating via an inverting glycosidase mechanism.

  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 endolysin has well-established lysozyme (muramidase) activity, catalyzing hydrolysis of
      the beta-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
      in peptidoglycan [PMID:4865643]. The enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 24 (GH24)
      with a conserved catalytic triad (Glu11-Asp20-Thr26). This IEA annotation is consistent with
      extensive experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core molecular function of the enzyme. Lysozyme activity is definitively established by
      biochemical characterization [PMID:4865643] and structural studies showing substrate binding
      and catalytic mechanism [PMID:8266098]. The deep research review confirms T4 endolysin acts as
      an endo-acetylmuramidase cleaving glycosidic bonds at muramic acid residues.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      General parent term for catalytic activity. T4 lysozyme is unequivocally a catalyst,
      but this term is very general and adds little information beyond the more specific
      lysozyme activity annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While redundant with more specific terms, this IEA annotation from keyword mapping is
      not incorrect. It serves as a catch-all parent term. The more informative GO:0003796
      (lysozyme activity) provides the specific function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 lysozyme degrades peptidoglycan by hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds in the polysaccharide
      backbone. This catabolic activity is central to its biological role in enabling phage release
      by degrading the host cell wall.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core biological process annotation. The enzyme directly catalyzes peptidoglycan degradation,
      which is its primary biological function. UniProt states it "degrades host peptidoglycans"
      [ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110]. The deep research confirms the enzyme "directly hydrolyzes
      peptidoglycan, weakening the sacculus."

  review:
    summary: >-
      General parent term for hydrolase activity. T4 lysozyme catalyzes hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds,
      so this parent term is correct but non-specific.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct parent term mapping. The enzyme is indeed a hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.17). While more
      specific terms are available (lysozyme activity, hydrolase activity acting on glycosyl bonds),
      this general IEA annotation is not wrong.

  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 lysozyme hydrolyzes beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds between NAM and NAG residues. This term
      correctly captures the enzymatic mechanism at an intermediate level of specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Appropriate parent term. T4 lysozyme cleaves glycosidic bonds as established by its EC
      number (3.2.1.17) and detailed structural/biochemical studies. This is more informative
      than generic hydrolase activity while being less specific than lysozyme activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Peptidoglycan is a major cell wall macromolecule in bacteria, and T4 lysozyme degrades it.
      This term is a parent of peptidoglycan catabolic process.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct parent term from InterPro mapping. The enzyme catabolizes peptidoglycan, which is
      the major structural component of bacterial cell walls. This is slightly less specific than
      GO:0009253 (peptidoglycan catabolic process) but correctly captures the biological process.

      T4 lysozyme accumulates in the host cell cytoplasm during viral replication before being
      released to the periplasm via holin-mediated membrane permeabilization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct subcellular localization. UniProt states: "The endolysin is cytoplasmic, but can reach
      the periplasmic space with the help of the holins which disrupt the host cell membrane." The
      protein is synthesized and accumulates in the cytoplasm, making this a valid localization annotation.

    label: killing of cells of another organism
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This term describes "killing of cells of another organism" and was mapped from UniProt keywords.
      While T4 lysozyme activity does lead to host cell death, this framing is questionable for a
      phage-encoded enzyme that kills its own host cell as part of the viral life cycle.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      This term is typically used for organisms with distinct identities where one kills cells of
      another (e.g., immune cells killing pathogens, antimicrobial peptides). For a phage enzyme,
      the host bacterium IS the organism in which the phage replicates - the relationship is more
      accurately described as "viral release from host cell" rather than killing another organism's
      cells. The term GO:0044659 (viral release from host cell by cytolysis) more accurately captures
      this biological context. This appears to be an over-annotation arising from keyword mapping.

    label: defense response to bacterium
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This term describes "reactions triggered in response to the presence of a bacterium that act
      to protect the cell or organism." This is fundamentally inappropriate for T4 lysozyme - a
      bacteriophage is not defending against bacteria; it is parasitizing them.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear case of inappropriate SPKW (SwissProt Keyword) over-annotation. The term
      GO:0042742 is designed for eukaryotic innate immunity and antimicrobial defense systems
      (e.g., lysozyme in tears defending against bacterial infection). T4 lysozyme is NOT a
      defense response - it is an offensive viral mechanism to lyse the host cell for progeny
      release. The phage does not "defend" against bacteria; it attacks and destroys them as
      part of its reproductive cycle. The correct process annotation is GO:0044659 (viral release
      from host cell by cytolysis). This annotation likely arose from the "Lysozyme" keyword being
      inappropriately linked to defense responses, without considering that phage lysozymes have
      the opposite biological context from eukaryotic lysozymes.

  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 lysozyme is an essential component of the phage lysis system, working with holins and
      spanins to achieve programmed host cell lysis and release of mature virions.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core biological process annotation. This accurately describes the primary biological role of
      T4 lysozyme. The deep research review states: "T4 E endolysin is produced late, accumulates
      in the cytoplasm, and acts in the periplasm once holin T forms pores; it directly hydrolyzes
      peptidoglycan, weakening the sacculus. Subsequent spanin action disrupts the outer membrane,
      completing lysis in Gram-negative hosts." UniProt confirms it "participates with the holin and
      spanin proteins in the sequential events which lead to the programmed host cell lysis releasing
      the mature viral particles."

    summary: >-
      PMID:4582731 (Inouye et al. 1973) is titled "Bacteriophage T7 lysozyme is an
      N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase" and describes T7 lysozyme, NOT T4 lysozyme. This
      reference is incorrectly attributed to the T4 gene E product. The annotation itself
      (GO:0003796 lysozyme activity) is correct for T4 lysozyme based on other evidence,
      but this specific annotation line should be removed due to incorrect reference.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this specific annotation line has an incorrect reference (PMID:4582731 is about T7 lysozyme,
      not T4 lysozyme), the GO term itself (GO:0003796 lysozyme activity) is unequivocally correct
      for T4 lysozyme based on extensive other evidence. The term should be ACCEPT because lysozyme
      activity is the core function of this enzyme. However, note that this specific reference
      attribution is erroneous - T4 and T7 lysozymes are unrelated enzymes with different catalytic
      mechanisms (T4 is a muramidase cleaving glycosidic bonds; T7 is an amidase cleaving peptide bonds).
      The annotation itself should remain, but the reference should be corrected in the source database.
