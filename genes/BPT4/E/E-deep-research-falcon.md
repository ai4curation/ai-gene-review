## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P00720
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Endolysin {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110}; EC=3.2.1.17 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:4865643}; AltName: Full=Lysis protein {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110}; AltName: Full=Lysozyme {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110}; AltName: Full=Muramidase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04110};
- **Gene Information:** Name=E;
- **Organism (full):** Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 24 family.
- **Key Domains:** Endolysin_T4_type. (IPR034690); Glyco_hydro_24. (IPR002196); Lysozyme-like_dom_sf. (IPR023346); Lysozyme_dom_sf. (IPR023347); Phage_lysozyme-like. (IPR052619)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "E" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'E' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **E** (gene ID: E, UniProt: P00720) in BPT4.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Gene/protein verification and scope
- Symbol and organism: The target is gene E of Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4), encoding the canonical T4 endolysin, also known as T4 lysozyme (UniProt P00720). Literature consistently places T4 lysozyme in glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24) and the T4-type lysozyme-like superfamily; catalytic features and substrate specificity match this assignment (Jun 2021; Viruses) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, ramesh2022alysozymemurein pages 1-2). No conflicting gene symbol “E” usages from other organisms are used here.

*Table: A compact reference table summarizing identity, mechanism, structural class, localization and regulation, recent 2024–2025 advances, applications, and key quantitative results for the T4 endolysin (gene E, UniProt P00720), with provenance to cited sources.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Endolysin (phage lysin): Phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase that degrades the bacterial cell wall at the end of the replication cycle to enable virion release. In Gram-negative hosts such as E. coli, endolysins act in the periplasm after holin-triggered access; outer-membrane rupture is mediated by spanins (2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- T4 endolysin (gene E product; T4 lysozyme): A GH24 muramidase that cleaves the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in peptidoglycan. Catalysis relies on a conserved triad Glu11–Asp20–Thr26, with an inverting mechanism in wild type; the T26H mutant exhibits a retaining mechanism in structural studies (Jun 2021; Viruses; 2017; Protein Science) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14).
- Holin–endolysin–spanin lysis system: Holin T (T4) forms inner-membrane lesions at a programmed time, allowing endolysin E to reach the periplasmic peptidoglycan; spanins effect outer-membrane disruption for explosive lysis (2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Lysis inhibition (LIN): In T4, antiholin RI modulates holin T to delay lysis. Recent work proposes that DNA stabilizes the RI–T complex and acts as the LIN signal (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3).

2) Primary function, catalytic activity, and structure of T4 endolysin (gene E)
- Reaction and substrate specificity: T4 E encodes a muramidase that hydrolyzes the β-1,4 NAM–NAG linkage in peptidoglycan, i.e., an N-acetyl-β-D-muramidase activity typical of GH24/T4-type lysozymes (Jun 2021; Viruses; 2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Catalytic residues/mechanism: The T4L-like catalytic triad Glu11 (general acid), Asp20 (general base), and Thr26 (positions nucleophilic water) is conserved across T4L-like endolysins; T4L is characterized as an inverting glycosidase, while T26H yields a retaining mechanism in structural analysis (Jun 2021; Viruses; 2017; Protein Science) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14).
- Structural family/domains: T4 endolysin belongs to GH24 and the lysozyme-like fold with a conserved motif Glu–(X)8–Asp–(X)5–Thr and a two-domain architecture (α-helix bundle plus catalytic domain); key positions that stabilize the catalytic glutamate and geometry are conserved across the family (Jun 2021; Viruses) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14).

3) Localization and role in the lysis pathway (holin T, antiholin RI, spanins) and lysis inhibition
- Localization and timing: Endolysin E functions in the periplasm following holin T pore formation; spanins mediate outer-membrane fusion/rupture to complete host-cell lysis in Gram-negative bacteria (2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Holin pore formation: Single-cell microfluidics and fluorescence tracking indicate that small assemblies of holin T (rings of dimers) can form aqueous pores sufficient to release endolysin; large multimerization is not required for endolysin release, and the short N-terminal cytoplasmic region of holin T is essential for pore formation (May 2025; Frontiers in Microbiology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1579756) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Lysis inhibition control: Structural and biochemical studies show RI–T complexes are stabilized by DNA, leading to the proposal that DNA (from superinfecting phage) acts as the LIN signal; RI also exhibits periplasmic targeting and regulated stability (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.06.013) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3).
- Holin–antiholin stoichiometry in 2024: Functional analyses support a physiologically relevant dimeric T/RI complex for LIN, with membrane-anchored partners and mutations in the holin–RI interface abolishing lysis, arguing that RI blocks holin oligomerization required for pore formation (Sep 2024; Frontiers in Microbiology; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1419106) (schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12).

4) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Dimeric holin/antiholin complex in T4: 2024 experiments reconstituted LIN in a phage-free system (RI, T, endolysin) and, through mutagenesis and functional assays, concluded that a dimeric T/RI complex mediates LIN by preventing holin oligomerization (Sep 2024; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12).
- DNA as the lysis-inhibition signal: 2020 structural work provided the mechanistic basis that DNA stabilizes the RI–T complex, reframing LIN signaling in T4 (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3).
- Holin pore visualization and minimal assemblies: 2025 microfluidics and modeling show small holin assemblies suffice to form pores, rebalancing prior assumptions about large holin holes and emphasizing the essential role of holin’s short cytoplasmic region (May 2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Endolysin therapeutics: 2024 preclinical data describe LysSYL, an anti-staphylococcal endolysin, with broad in vitro activity (100% of tested Staphylococcus strains vs. parent phage’s 41.7%), rapid killing of MRSA USA300 within 10 minutes, biofilm eradication, anti-persister activity, and strong efficacy in a murine peritonitis model (Mar 2024; Microbial Cell Factories; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-024-02359-4) (liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 1-2, liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 15-17).
- Clinical pipeline context: A 2026 selective review summarizes clinical development and combination strategies for Gram-positive endolysins, including the Phase 3 DISRUPT trial of exebacase reported in 2024 (Clinical Infectious Diseases, DOI listed therein), and multiple other clinical candidates (European Journal of Medical Research; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-025-03655-4) (elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 36-42, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 31-36).
- Relevance to T4 endolysin: T4 lysozyme is a paradigm GH24 enzyme and a common structural/biophysical model for engineering endolysins and understanding catalytic mechanisms used in antimicrobial design (Jun 2021; Viruses) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12).

6) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic paradigm: T4L remains a structural and mechanistic archetype for GH24 muramidases; conserved catalytic geometry and fold are re-used in many T4L-like endolysins, guiding rational engineering for stability and activity (Jun 2021; Viruses) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14).
- Lysis control in T4: Structural biology (J Mol Biol 2020) and functional reconstitution (Frontiers 2024) converge on a model where DNA-stabilized RI–T complexes implement LIN by blocking holin oligomerization, refining decades-old models of lysis timing control (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol; Sep 2024; Frontiers in Microbiology) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3, schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12).
- Holin pore formation: Single-cell and modeling data support minimal pore assemblies for holin T, underscoring regulatory roles of holin domains and suggesting that endolysin availability influences holin multimerization states (May 2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Catalytic mechanism and residues: The conserved T4L triad Glu–Asp–Thr is aligned in T4L-like endolysins; T4L is inverting, while T26H shows retaining features in structural studies (Jun 2021; Viruses; 2017; Protein Science) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14).
- Lysis-regulation data: DNA-stabilized 2RI–2T complexes proposed for LIN (structures deposited); functional 2024 work supports a physiologically relevant dimeric T/RI complex under membrane-anchored conditions (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol; Sep 2024; Frontiers in Microbiology) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3, schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12).
- Therapeutic efficacy: LysSYL reduced MRSA by 6 log10 at 50 µg/mL in vitro and achieved 100% survival at 50 mg/kg in a mouse peritonitis model; LysSYL lysed 100% of 115 Staphylococcus strains vs. 41.7% for the parent phage (Mar 2024; Microbial Cell Factories) (liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 15-17, liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 1-2).
- Clinical status: Exebacase Phase 3 (2024; Clinical Infectious Diseases) and broader clinical landscape summarized with trial identifiers and combination strategy analysis (Jan 2026; European Journal of Medical Research) (elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 36-42, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 31-36).

Biological pathway integration and localization (focused on precision of role)
- T4 E endolysin is produced late, accumulates in the cytoplasm, and acts in the periplasm once holin T forms pores; it directly hydrolyzes peptidoglycan, weakening the sacculus. Subsequent spanin action disrupts the outer membrane, completing lysis in Gram-negative hosts (2025; Frontiers in Microbiology) (schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Lysis timing is tuned by LIN: RI binds holin T; DNA stabilizes the complex to delay pore formation and endolysin release when superinfection occurs, thereby modulating the lytic schedule (Jul 2020; J Mol Biol; Sep 2024; Frontiers in Microbiology) (krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3, schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12).

Notes on applications and translational outlook
- As a well-characterized GH24 lysozyme, T4 endolysin remains a foundational model for designing and engineering T4L-like endolysins for therapeutic use, informing catalytic-site and stability modifications (Jun 2021; Viruses) (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12). 2024 preclinical data across the endolysin field (e.g., LysSYL) demonstrate rapid killing, biofilm clearance, and synergy with antibiotics in vivo; 2024 Phase 3 reporting for exebacase signals maturation of the field, with expert analyses suggesting combination strategies with standard-of-care antibiotics for systemic infections (Mar 2024; Microbial Cell Factories; Jan 2026; European Journal of Medical Research) (liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 1-2, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 36-42, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 31-36).

Conclusions
- The T4 gene E product is a GH24 muramidase that acts in the periplasm to cleave the NAM–NAG β-1,4 linkage, with conserved Glu11–Asp20–Thr26 catalysis and an inverting mechanism in wild type. Its role is tightly integrated into the holin–endolysin–spanin pathway and the LIN regulatory network, where recent work refined the molecular logic: DNA stabilization of RI–T underlies lysis inhibition, and small holin assemblies can form pores adequate for endolysin release. Translationally, T4L remains a benchmark mechanistic and structural template for engineering endolysins; 2023–2024 studies show compelling preclinical efficacy and advancing clinical programs, with expert analyses favoring combination strategies for systemic infections (love2021themolecularbasis pages 10-12, love2021themolecularbasis pages 12-14, schwarzkopf2025theshortcytoplasmic pages 1-2, krieger2020thestructuralbasis pages 1-3, schwarzkopf2024adimericholinantiholin pages 12-12, liu2024lyssylabroadspectrum pages 1-2, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 36-42, elst2026clinicalimplementationof pages 31-36).
