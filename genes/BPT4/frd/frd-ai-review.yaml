  label: Enterobacteria phage T4
description: >-
  T4 bacteriophage dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), encoded by the frd gene, catalyzes the
  reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate using NADPH as hydride donor (EC 1.5.1.3).
  The 193 amino acid protein (21.7 kDa monomer) functions as a homodimer and is essential for
  phage DNA precursor synthesis by regenerating reduced folate cofactors required by thymidylate
  synthase. T4 DHFR exists in two forms: a soluble enzymatic form in infected cells and a
  structural component embedded in the virion baseplate. The enzyme interacts with thymidylate
  synthase and dCMP hydroxymethyltransferase as part of a dNTP synthetase complex that
  coordinates nucleotide precursor synthesis during phage replication.

  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 frd encodes a bona fide dihydrofolate reductase that catalyzes the reduction of
      7,8-dihydrofolate to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate using NADPH as cofactor. This is the
      core enzymatic function of the gene product, supported by extensive biochemical
      characterization and structural data.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      DHFR activity is the primary molecular function of this enzyme. The annotation is
      well-supported by IDA evidence (PMID:4936128) and structural characterization.
      The enzyme belongs to the DHFR family with conserved domain architecture
      (IPR001796, IPR017925).

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      T4 DHFR regenerates tetrahydrofolate, which carries one-carbon units for biosynthetic
      reactions including thymidylate synthesis. The enzyme is part of a one-carbon metabolic
      pathway that supports DNA precursor production during phage infection.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      DHFR catalyzes a key reaction in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. The product
      tetrahydrofolate serves as a one-carbon carrier essential for thymidylate synthesis.
      The deep research confirms that frd-driven FH4 regeneration sustains thymidylate
      synthase conversion of dUMP to dTMP during infection.

  review:
    summary: >-
      DHFR is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to
      dihydrofolate. This is a correct but general annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct - DHFR is an oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.1.3). However, the
      more specific term GO:0004146 (dihydrofolate reductase activity) is also present
      and is the preferred annotation. This general term is acceptable as a parent
      annotation that captures the broader enzymatic class.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from the UniProt keyword "Methotrexate resistance" (KW-0487).
      T4 DHFR is competitively inhibited by methotrexate and other antifolates at the
      substrate binding site. However, the phage enzyme does not confer resistance to
      methotrexate and the phage does not "respond to" methotrexate as a biological process.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation represents a conflation of "being inhibited by a drug" with "responding
      to" that drug as a biological process. Methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of T4
      DHFR with respect to dihydrofolate. The enzyme is a TARGET of this drug, not a biological
      responder. The GO term "response to methotrexate" implies a coordinated cellular response
      pathway, which is inappropriate for: (1) a phage-encoded enzyme, and (2) an enzyme that
      is simply inhibited by the compound. The UniProt keyword "Methotrexate resistance" refers
      to the fact that DHFR is the target of methotrexate and mutations can confer resistance -
      but this phage enzyme is wild-type and simply subject to inhibition.

    label: response to antibiotic
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProt keywords "Antibiotic resistance" (KW-0046) and
      "Trimethoprim resistance" (KW-0817). T4 DHFR is inhibited by the antibiotic trimethoprim
      (and other antifolates), but the phage enzyme does not participate in an "antibiotic
      response" biological process. Recent phylogenomic analysis explicitly showed that
      phage-encoded DHFRs do NOT confer antibiotic resistance.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear example of inappropriate SPKW-based over-annotation. The annotation
      conflates two distinct concepts: (1) DHFR being a known target of antifolate antibiotics,
      and (2) organisms mounting a biological "response" to antibiotics. A 2020 phylogenomics
      study explicitly concluded that phage-encoded DHFRs do NOT confer trimethoprim resistance
      despite homology and that phage folA genes primarily serve phage nucleotide metabolism
      rather than resistance. The GO term "response to antibiotic" implies a coordinated
      biological response pathway - phages do not have antibiotic response pathways, and this
      particular enzyme is simply an enzymatic target that gets inhibited by certain drugs.
      The fact that an enzyme CAN BE INHIBITED by an antibiotic does not mean the organism
      "responds to" that antibiotic.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the structural and functional role of DHFR in the T4 virion baseplate?
    The enzyme is present in latent form in the baseplate - does it have a catalytic
    role during early infection or is it purely structural?

  hypothesis: >-
    While inhibition by antifolates is documented, precise kinetic parameters under
    modern conditions are not well-characterized in available literature.
