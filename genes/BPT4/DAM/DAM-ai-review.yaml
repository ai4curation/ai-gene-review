description: >-
  T4 Dam is a DNA adenine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.72) that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl
  group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the N6 position of adenine within GATC palindromic
  sequences. The enzyme functions as a monomer and methylates both cytosine- and
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine-containing DNA substrates. The primary biological role is to protect
  phage T4 genomic DNA from degradation by the host E. coli restriction-modification defense system.
  This is a well-characterized "orphan" methyltransferase with high-resolution crystal structures
  available (PDB: 1Q0S, 1Q0T, 1YF3).

      T4 Dam binds DNA as part of its methyltransferase activity. Crystal structures confirm
      DNA binding capability [PMID:12937411]. However, "nucleic acid binding" is overly general
      for a protein with well-characterized DNA-specific binding and enzymatic activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      This term is too general. The protein specifically binds DNA (not RNA) in a sequence-specific
      manner (GATC recognition). More specific terms like GO:0003677 (DNA binding) or GO:0043565
      (sequence-specific DNA binding) are more informative and are already annotated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      While T4 Dam methylates newly replicated phage DNA, the enzyme itself is not directly
      involved in DNA replication (DNA synthesis). Dam acts on DNA after or during replication
      to provide methylation-based protection, but does not participate in the replication
      machinery itself.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      T4 Dam is not part of the DNA replication machinery. It is a DNA modification enzyme that
      acts on replicated DNA. The methylation protects DNA from restriction enzymes but does not
      contribute to DNA synthesis. This appears to be an over-annotation based on the UniProtKB
      keyword "DNA replication" which may have been applied due to the gene's role in the phage
      replication cycle rather than the enzymatic mechanism of replication.

      This term and its definition ("A process in which a symbiont interferes with the ability

    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CRITICAL SEMANTIC ERROR: Bacteriophage T4 infects Escherichia coli, a bacterium. Bacteria
      do not possess an "innate immune response" - that is a eukaryotic immune system concept.
      The GO term GO:0045087 (innate immune response) is defined as "Innate immune responses
      are defense responses mediated by germline encoded components that directly recognize
      components of potential pathogens." This is a eukaryotic concept involving cells like
      macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, and pathways like NF-kB signaling. Bacteria have
      restriction-modification systems, CRISPR-Cas systems, and abortive infection systems -
      NOT innate immune responses. This annotation is a clear example of SPKW over-annotation
      where the keyword "Inhibition of host innate immune response by virus" was incorrectly
      applied to a bacteriophage. The correct term GO:0099018 (symbiont-mediated evasion of

      This is the correct term for T4 Dam's biological role. The GO definition explicitly
      states: "A process by which a symbiont evades the DNA restriction modification system
      of its host. This process occurs in phages to protect themselves from bacterial
      restriction enzyme systems. Some viruses encode their own methyltransferase in order

    action: ACCEPT

      This is the most accurate biological process term for T4 Dam. The enzyme methylates
      phage DNA to protect it from E. coli restriction enzymes. The term definition explicitly
