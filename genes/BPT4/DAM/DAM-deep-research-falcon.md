- **Gene Information:** Name=DAM {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2510127};
- **Organism (full):** Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the N(4)/N(6)-methyltransferase family.
- **Key Domains:** Ade_MeTrfase_dom_2. (IPR023095); DNA_methylase_N6_adenine_CS. (IPR002052); M_m6A_EcoRV. (IPR012263); MeTrfase_D12. (IPR012327); SAM-dependent_MTases_sf. (IPR029063)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DAM" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Enterobacteria phage T4 (Bacteriophage T4).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DAM' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DAM** (gene ID: DAM, UniProt: P04392) in BPT4.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target as DAM from Enterobacteria phage T4 (UniProt P04392), encoding the DNA (N6-adenine) methyltransferase commonly called T4 Dam. Structural and biochemical studies define it as an AdoMet-dependent m6A MTase with canonical motifs (e.g., motif I Phe-X-Gly; motif IV DPPY) in the N6-adenine/SAM-dependent MTase family, matching the domain annotations provided (SAM-dependent_MTases fold; N6-adenine MTase motifs) (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, yang2003structureofthe pages 9-11). All subsequent research and citations refer to this phage T4 Dam enzyme and not to E. coli Dam.

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary function and reaction: T4 Dam is a DNA N6-adenine methyltransferase that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the N6 position of adenine within GATC sites, generating S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973; Sep 2004, https://doi.org/10.1023/b:mbil.0000043943.07792.80) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, zinoviev2004molecularenzymologyof pages 1-2).
- Substrate specificity: Wild-type T4 Dam recognizes GATC and methylates the target adenine; variants can relax or alter specificity (see below) (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973; Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, miner1989singleaminoacid pages 1-3).
- Cofactor usage and mechanism: AdoMet binds in a conserved pocket; structural work captured the product AdoHcy in a closed cofactor pocket. Release/exchange of AdoHcy appears rate-limiting, and the enzyme likely diffuses along DNA between catalytic cycles (“processive” methylation on DNA bearing multiple sites) (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 6-8, yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3).
- Conserved motifs/domains: T4 Dam belongs to the alpha group of AdoMet-dependent MTases. Conserved motifs include motif I (Phe32–Ser33–Gly34), motif II (Asp50), motif IV (Asp-Pro-Pro-Tyr), and motif VI (Asp171-Pro172-Pro173). A cofactor-covering element (residues ~175–203, including helix αD1) closes the pocket in the AdoHcy-bound state (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 3-4, yang2003structureofthe pages 11-15, yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3).
- Structure: Crystal structures resolved a binary complex (Dam–AdoHcy) and a ternary Dam–DNA–AdoHcy complex. The protein is a monomer comprising a catalytic domain that binds cofactor and a target-recognition domain (TRD) with a 5-helix bundle and a distinctive β-hairpin. In the DNA-bound structure, the complex exhibits nonspecific DNA contacts with two Dam monomers per duplex; specific base-targeting is inferred from catalytic motifs and prior Dam family studies (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, yang2003structureofthe pages 6-8, yang2003structureofthe pages 11-15).
- Biophysical properties: The enzyme mass is ~30.4–30.7 kDa by sequence/ultracentrifugation; it is largely monomeric in solution, but forms higher-order complexes with DNA. With site-containing oligos, a 2:1 enzyme:duplex complex (E2S) was observed (Sep 2004, https://doi.org/10.1023/b:mbil.0000043943.07792.80) (zinoviev2004molecularenzymologyof pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Methylation-based engineering strategies: 2024 reviews highlight using DNA methyltransferases to pre-pattern incoming DNA with host-like methylation to evade R–M barriers, enabling transformation and gene transfer across difficult bacteria; MTases are also being repurposed as reporters and in memory circuits in microbial engineering (Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-024-02529-x) (won2024emergingmethylationbasedapproaches pages 3-5).
- Phage adenine MTases in defense evasion: A 2024 study on Shewanella phage Thanatos-1 characterized a phage adenine MTase (TH1_126) with a recognized 5′-ATC motif in E. coli, combining nanopore-based 6mA calling and LC-MS/MS quantification, illustrating modern workflows to profile phage-encoded Dam-like enzymes and link methylation to endonuclease/Cas resistance phenotypes (Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.582347) (brandt2024discoveryofa pages 4-6).
- Broader context: Reviews from 2023 synthesize Dam’s roles in bacterial epigenetics, replication control, mismatch repair, and virulence regulation, providing updated reference frameworks for Dam-family enzymes and their emerging biomedical potential (Mar 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1129437) (gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 3-4, gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 13-14).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Overcoming restriction barriers and enabling genetic access: Implementations leverage MTases (including Dam-family enzymes) to pre-methylate plasmid or genomic DNA to match target organisms, improving DNA transfer and stability. Strategies include co-expressing multiple target MTases in methylase-free E. coli to prepare shuttle DNAs and using MTase fusions as transcription reporters or epigenetic memory components (Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-024-02529-x) (won2024emergingmethylationbasedapproaches pages 3-5).
- Phage defense/counter-defense studies: High-throughput sequencing plus LC-MS/MS pipelines quantify 6mA patterns introduced by phage MTases and correlate with resistance to restriction endonucleases and CRISPR-Cas, informing phage genome engineering and anti-defense repertoire characterization (Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.582347) (brandt2024discoveryofa pages 4-6).
- Conceptual and translational opportunities: 2023 analyses point to Dam inhibitors as potential antibiotic adjuvants and Dam perturbation as a route to attenuated live vaccines in some bacterial pathogens, emphasizing Dam-family enzymes’ translational promise (Mar 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1129437) (gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 3-4, gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 13-14).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural mechanism and catalytic cycle: Expert structural work argues that cofactor/product handling is a key kinetic bottleneck (AdoHcy release), with a closed “cofactor cover” element gating exchange; Dam moves processively along DNA to methylate multiple sites, consistent with its role in comprehensive GATC methylation on phage DNA (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 6-8, yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3).
- Sequence specificity determinants: Classic and structural studies identify residues in the TRD and adjacent loops as critical for sequence recognition; single amino-acid changes at positions 126–127 can reprogram specificity or hypermethylation, with tangible effects on host restriction sensitivity—supporting a model where Dam specificity tuning is a phage strategy against diverse host restriction systems (Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149; Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (miner1989singleaminoacid pages 1-3, yang2003structureofthe pages 3-4).
- Oligomeric state and DNA engagement: Solution biophysics and crystallography agree Dam is monomeric but forms higher-order complexes with DNA; ternary structures with two Dam monomers bound per duplex suggest facilitated diffusion or sliding, aligning with observed processivity (Sep 2004, https://doi.org/10.1023/b:mbil.0000043943.07792.80; Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (zinoviev2004molecularenzymologyof pages 1-2, yang2003structureofthe pages 6-8).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- Kinetics and cofactor affinity: A measured Km for AdoMet of ~1.4 μM for T4 Dam; substitutions at Pro172 elevated Km for AdoMet by 5–20× and reduced activity unless AdoMet was increased, indicating motif VI’s role in cofactor binding and catalysis (Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149; Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (miner1989singleaminoacid pages 3-5, yang2003structureofthe pages 3-4).
- Processivity and rate limitation: Structural/biochemical analysis supports that AdoHcy release is rate-limiting and that Dam can diffuse along DNA to methylate multiple sites, consistent with processive behavior on multi-GATC substrates (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 6-8).
- Mass and oligomerization: Native molecular mass ~30.69 kDa by ultracentrifugation (vs 30.4 kDa by sequence); Dam–DNA complexes can assemble as E2S (two enzymes:one duplex) under certain conditions (Sep 2004, https://doi.org/10.1023/b:mbil.0000043943.07792.80) (zinoviev2004molecularenzymologyof pages 1-2).
- Specificity-altering mutations and anti-restriction: A Pro126→Ser mutation (damh) relaxes specificity, enabling methylation of noncanonical sites (e.g., internal adenine in AGACC) with 2–4× higher kcat on some noncanonical sequences, conferring resistance to specific host restriction systems such as EcoP1/P1, and causing virion DNA hypermethylation (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973; Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149) (yang2003structureofthe pages 3-4, miner1989singleaminoacid pages 1-3).
- Modern quantification in phage systems: 2024 work quantified fractions of modified adenines genome-wide using nanopore 6mA models, identified ATC as a preferred motif for a phage Dam-family MTase, and verified modifications by LC–MS/MS—illustrating current quantitative pipelines for assessing Dam-family activities in vivo (Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.582347) (brandt2024discoveryofa pages 4-6).

Functional context and localization in the phage lifecycle
- Site of action and timing: T4 Dam acts in the infected E. coli cytoplasm on phage DNA, methylating GATC sites as the genome is replicated or shortly after entry/replication, providing de novo and maintenance methylation to protect DNA and influence host DNA-interacting pathways (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3).
- Pathway roles: By methylating GATC, T4 Dam participates in phage counter-defense against host restriction systems. Dam-mediated patterns can shield the genome from specific host endonucleases; altered specificities (e.g., damh) increase protection breadth against diverse host RM systems (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973; Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149) (yang2003structureofthe pages 3-4, miner1989singleaminoacid pages 1-3).

Notes on domain/family alignment
- The identified catalytic motifs (motif I, DPPY motif IV, motif VI) and the SAM-dependent fold in T4 Dam align with the UniProt-listed domains: Ade_MeTrfase_dom_2, DNA_methylase_N6_adenine consensus, and SAM-dependent_MTases superfamily (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, yang2003structureofthe pages 11-15).

Conclusion
Enterobacteria phage T4 Dam (P04392) is a canonical SAM-dependent N6-adenine MTase acting at GATC sites. High-resolution structures and enzymology define its catalytic motifs, closed cofactor pocket, and processive DNA engagement. Genetic and structural evidence shows that subtle sequence changes tune specificity and anti-restriction efficacy, a critical trait for phage survival in diverse hosts. Recent 2023–2024 studies expand applications of Dam-family MTases in overcoming R–M barriers and in quantitative epigenome mapping within phage systems, underscoring the enzyme family’s ongoing utility in biotechnology and phage biology (Oct 2003, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsb973; Sep 2004, https://doi.org/10.1023/b:mbil.0000043943.07792.80; Oct 1989, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/17.20.8149; Jul 2024, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-024-02529-x; Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.582347; Mar 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1129437) (yang2003structureofthe pages 1-3, zinoviev2004molecularenzymologyof pages 1-2, miner1989singleaminoacid pages 1-3, won2024emergingmethylationbasedapproaches pages 3-5, brandt2024discoveryofa pages 4-6, gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 3-4, gao2023bacterialdnamethyltransferase pages 13-14).
