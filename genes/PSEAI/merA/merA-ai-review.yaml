description: Mercuric reductase (MerA) is a homodimeric flavoprotein enzyme that catalyzes
  the NADPH-dependent reduction of toxic Hg(II) to volatile elemental mercury Hg(0),
  serving as the central enzymatic component of bacterial mercury resistance systems.
  Located in the cytoplasm, MerA contains an N-terminal metal-binding domain (NmerA)
  that captures mercury ions, a FAD-binding catalytic core with redox-active disulfide
  bonds, and unique C-terminal cysteine residues (Cys558/Cys559) essential for mercury
  binding and catalysis. The enzyme is tightly regulated by the MerR transcriptional
  regulator as part of the mer operon, with expression induced specifically in response
  to mercury exposure.

    label: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: This annotation appears to be incorrect for MerA. While MerA is an NADPH-dependent
      oxidoreductase, it specifically reduces mercury ions, not quinones. The enzyme
      uses NADPH as an electron donor via FAD to reduce Hg(II) to Hg(0), not to reduce
      quinones.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: MerA specifically reduces mercury ions, not quinones. The enzyme's substrate
      specificity is for Hg(II), not quinone molecules.

  review:
    summary: This is the correct and most specific molecular function for MerA. Extensive
      biochemical evidence confirms MerA catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of
      Hg(II) to Hg(0) with high specificity.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: This is correct but too general. MerA is indeed an oxidoreductase, but
      the more specific term GO:0016152 (mercury (II) reductase activity) should be
      used as the primary annotation.

      acceptor
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is partially correct but misleading. While MerA has redox-active
      cysteines, it acts on mercury ions as the substrate, not sulfur groups as donors.
      The cysteines are part of the catalytic mechanism, not the substrate.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Misleading - MerA acts on mercury ions as substrate, not sulfur groups.
      The redox-active cysteines are part of the enzyme mechanism, not the substrate.

      cysteine pair (e.g., Cys558 and Cys559) which is not found in most other flavoprotein
      reductases. These residues form a flexible loop that transiently coordinates
      the Hg²⁺ ion.
