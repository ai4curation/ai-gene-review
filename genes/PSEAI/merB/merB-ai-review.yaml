description: Organomercurial lyase (MerB) is a monomeric ~22 kDa cytoplasmic enzyme
  that catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of carbon-mercury bonds in organomercury
  compounds, converting toxic organomercurials like methylmercury and phenylmercury
  into inorganic Hg(II) and releasing the organic moiety as a hydrocarbon. Functions
  as the first step in broad-spectrum mercury resistance, working sequentially with
  MerA to detoxify organomercurials. Contains essential catalytic cysteines (Cys96,
  Cys159) that coordinate mercury through bis-thiolate binding. Possesses a unique
  protein fold with no known paralogs outside mercury resistance systems. Expression
  is tightly regulated by MerR as part of the mer operon, induced specifically by
  mercury exposure.

  review:
    summary: This is the correct and most specific molecular function for MerB. Extensive
      biochemical evidence confirms MerB catalyzes the cleavage of carbon-mercury
      bonds in organomercurials.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct experimental evidence confirms alkylmercury lyase as MerB's primary
      molecular function

      supporting_text: MerB is an organomercurial lyase enzyme that catalyzes the
        protonolytic cleavage of the carbon–mercury bond in organomercury compounds.
        MerB converts toxic organomercurials (such as methylmercury or phenylmercury
        compounds) into an inorganic mercuric ion (Hg^2+), while releasing the organic
        moiety as a hydrocarbon (e.g. methane from methylmercury).

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is correct but too general. MerB is indeed a lyase, but the more
      specific term GO:0018836 (alkylmercury lyase activity) should be used as the
      primary annotation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Too general - more specific alkylmercury lyase term available
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: file:PSEAI/merB/merB-deep-research.md
      supporting_text: MerB functions as a proton-transfer enzyme that directly breaks
        the Hg–C bond (a rare lyase reaction) without requiring external cofactors.

  review:
    summary: Correct and well-supported biological process. MerB expression is specifically
      induced by mercury and is essential for the cellular response to organomercury
      compounds.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: MerB expression is specifically induced by mercury exposure via MerR regulation
      as part of mercury resistance response

      supporting_text: 'Expression of the mer operon is tightly regulated and induced
        in the presence of mercury ions. merB expression is inducible and tightly
        regulated: it remains virtually off in the absence of mercury and is highly
        upregulated when mercury (or certain organomercurials that release Hg^2+)
        is present.'

  findings:
  - statement: MerB enables broad-spectrum mercury resistance by converting organomercurials
      to Hg(II)

      only. MerB, an organomercury lyase encoded by the merB gene, provides a broader
      spectrum of resistance to mercury.

  title: Deep Research Report on merB gene
  findings:
  - statement: MerB is a cytoplasmic enzyme that cleaves carbon-mercury bonds in organomercurials
    supporting_text: MerB is located in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. It lacks
      any signal peptide or membrane-spanning domains, and it contains no disulfide
      bonds, consistent with a cytosolic enzyme that functions in the reducing environment
      of the cytosol.
  - statement: MerB uses essential cysteine residues for catalysis
    supporting_text: Two cysteine residues (conserved as Cys96 and Cys159 in E. coli
      MerB numbering) are essential for catalysis, forming a bis-thiolated Hg^2+ intermediate
      and likely delivering the proton to the bound organic group.
  - statement: MerB has a unique protein fold specific to mercury resistance
    supporting_text: MerB is a single-domain enzyme with a unique protein fold not
      found in other protein families. Solution NMR and crystal structure studies
      revealed that MerB consists of three small β-sheets surrounded by six α-helices,
      forming a compact globular protein.
  - statement: MerB expression is tightly regulated by MerR in response to mercury
    supporting_text: The merB gene in P. aeruginosa is typically co-transcribed as
      part of the mer operon, under the control of the MerR regulatory protein. When
      Hg^2+ is present, MerR binds the ion and undergoes a conformational change that
      activates transcription of the operon.
  - statement: MerB enables bioremediation of mercury-contaminated environments
    supporting_text: mercury-resistant pseudomonads with MerB can thrive in mercury-polluted
      soils, waters, or industrial effluents where they degrade organomercurials that
      would otherwise accumulate in the food chain. MerB-possessing bacteria have
      been explored as agents of bioremediation for mercury pollution.
