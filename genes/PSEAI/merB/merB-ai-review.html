        <p>Organomercurial lyase (MerB) is a monomeric ~22 kDa cytoplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of carbon-mercury bonds in organomercury compounds, converting toxic organomercurials like methylmercury and phenylmercury into inorganic Hg(II) and releasing the organic moiety as a hydrocarbon. Functions as the first step in broad-spectrum mercury resistance, working sequentially with MerA to detoxify organomercurials. Contains essential catalytic cysteines (Cys96, Cys159) that coordinate mercury through bis-thiolate binding. Possesses a unique protein fold with no known paralogs outside mercury resistance systems. Expression is tightly regulated by MerR as part of the mer operon, induced specifically by mercury exposure.</p>

<h1 id="merb-organomercurial-lyase-in-pseudomonas-aeruginosa">MerB (Organomercurial Lyase) in <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></h1>
<h2 id="function-and-molecular-mechanism">Function and Molecular Mechanism</h2>
<p>MerB is an organomercurial lyase enzyme that catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of the carbon–mercury bond in organomercury compounds (<a href="https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=GO%3A0018836&amp;type=go#:~:text=Definition%20%20,GO%3A0018836">ctdbase.org</a>). In practical terms, MerB converts toxic organomercurials (such as methylmercury or phenylmercury compounds) into an inorganic mercuric ion (Hg^2+), while releasing the organic moiety as a hydrocarbon (e.g. methane from methylmercury) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=IncM%20plasmid%2C%20R831%2C%20only%20two,16">academic.oup.com</a>). This reaction is the first step in the bacterial mercury detoxification pathway: the Hg^2+ produced by MerB is subsequently reduced to elemental mercury (Hg^0) by mercuric reductase (MerA), which volatilizes and escapes from the cell (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=IncM%20plasmid%2C%20R831%2C%20only%20two,16">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.00010-22#:~:text=The%20mer%20operon%20encodes%20enzymes,MeHg%20by%20MerB%2C%20independent%20of">journals.asm.org</a>). Together, MerB and MerA act sequentially to neutralize organomercurial toxins, conferring broad-spectrum mercury resistance to the bacterium (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=and%20merB%20confer%20broad,bioremediation%20at%20highly%20polluted%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). Notably, MerB’s activity is only beneficial when MerA is present to remove Hg^2+; in the absence of MerA, MerB-mediated demethylation can release Hg^2+ intracellularly and increase toxicity (<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.00010-22#:~:text=The%20mer%20operon%20encodes%20enzymes,MeHg%20by%20MerB%2C%20independent%20of">journals.asm.org</a>). </p>
<p>Mechanistically, MerB functions as a proton-transfer enzyme that <em>directly</em> breaks the Hg–C bond (a rare <strong>lyase</strong> reaction) without requiring external cofactors (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Meticulous%20characterization%20of%20the%20MerB,slow%20for%20an%20enzyme%2C%20these">academic.oup.com</a>). It is a ~22 kDa monomeric protein that uses cysteine thiolate groups in its active site to bind mercury and facilitate bond cleavage (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>). Two cysteine residues (conserved as Cys96 and Cys159 in <em>E. coli</em> MerB numbering) are essential for catalysis, forming a bis-thiolated Hg^2+ intermediate and likely delivering the proton to the bound organic group (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=rates%20of%20organomercurials,protein%20thiol%20groups%20might%20be">academic.oup.com</a>). The reaction proceeds via direct protonolysis with retention of the substrate’s configuration (an S_E2 mechanism rather than a radical-mediated process), and kinetic studies show that proton transfer is the rate-limiting step (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=rates%20of%20organomercurials,protein%20thiol%20groups%20might%20be">academic.oup.com</a>). After the carbon–Hg bond is cleaved, MerB remains bound to Hg^2+ until two molecules of a small thiol (e.g. cysteine or glutathione in the cytosol) displace the mercury from the enzyme, regenerating the free enzyme (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=coordinated%20complex%20by%20Cys96%20or,actually%20inhibits%20MerB%2C%20possibly">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>). This reliance on cellular thiols is consistent with MerB’s requirement for a thiol-rich environment – the enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum (&gt;9) and shows greatly accelerated reaction rates in the presence of excess thiols (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=substrate%20specificity%2C%20MerB%20has%20very,Hg%20protonolysis%20by%20a%20compound">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Meticulous%20characterization%20of%20the%20MerB,slow%20for%20an%20enzyme%2C%20these">academic.oup.com</a>). Overall, MerB’s unique catalytic strategy enables bacteria to enzymatically cleave organomercurial compounds at rates 10^6–10^7-fold faster than the spontaneous chemical breakdown, thereby initiating rapid mercury detoxification (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=very%20broad%20substrate%20tolerance%2C%20handling,effects%20were%20consistent%20with%20a">academic.oup.com</a>).</p>
<h2 id="cellular-localization">Cellular Localization</h2>
<p>MerB is located in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. It lacks any signal peptide or membrane-spanning domains, and it contains no disulfide bonds, consistent with a cytosolic enzyme that functions in the reducing environment of the cytosol (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>). In <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other Gram-negative bacteria, organomercurial compounds are sufficiently lipophilic to diffuse across cell membranes, so MerB can encounter and degrade its substrates inside the cell without needing a dedicated import system (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=permeability%20to%20phenylmercury%3B%20other%20mercurials,without%20a%20specific%20uptake%20system">academic.oup.com</a>). The enzyme thus operates in the intracellular space, often in tandem with MerA (which is also cytosolic) to detoxify mercury. Other components of the mercury resistance (mer) operon handle transport and sensing – for example, MerP and MerT are periplasmic and membrane proteins that import Hg^2+ ions, and some broad-spectrum operons encode MerG, a periplasmic protein that reduces uptake of organomercurials (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20merG,the%20periplasm%20and%20reduces%20cell">academic.oup.com</a>). However, MerB itself remains in the cytoplasm, where it cleaves incoming organomercurials and hands off the resulting Hg^2+ to MerA for reduction (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=although%2C%20with%20the%20exception%20of,We%20now%20consider">academic.oup.com</a>). The cytosolic localization of MerB is crucial, as it ensures proximity to abundant thiols (cysteine, glutathione) needed for its activity and for sequestering mercury until volatilization.</p>

<p>MerB is a key player in the bacterial <strong>mercury detoxification pathway</strong>, allowing <em>P. aeruginosa</em> to survive in mercury-contaminated environments. Bacteria possessing <strong>merB</strong> (in addition to <strong>merA</strong>) exhibit <strong>broad-spectrum mercury resistance</strong>, meaning they can detoxify both inorganic mercury (Hg^2+) and organic mercury compounds (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Work%20on%20the%20mechanism%20of,Somewhat%20surprisingly%2C%20each%20operon%20had">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=and%20merB%20confer%20broad,bioremediation%20at%20highly%20polluted%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). In contrast, bacteria with only <strong>merA</strong> (but no <strong>merB</strong>) have a <strong>narrow-spectrum resistance</strong> limited to inorganic Hg^2+ (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=both%20inorganic%20and%20organic%20mercury,spectrum%20Hg%20resistance%E2%80%99%20%5B11">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=and%20merB%20confer%20broad,bioremediation%20at%20highly%20polluted%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). By cleaving organomercurials, MerB enables the cell to convert highly toxic species such as methylmercury and phenylmercury into less toxic forms that can be further detoxified (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=functional%20genes%20are%20merA%20and,almost%20nontoxic%20volatile%20elemental%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). The coupled action of MerB and MerA ultimately results in the reduction of Hg^2+ to elemental mercury (Hg^0), which volatilizes out of the cell, effectively removing mercury from the cell and surrounding environment (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=and%20a%20periplasmic%20Hg%20binding,will%20act%20by%20regulating%20the">www.mdpi.com</a>). This <strong>volatilization of mercury</strong> is a distinctive biological process that bacteria use to detoxify mercury – MerB and MerA together catalyze the conversion of organomercury to volatile Hg^0, which is released into the atmosphere (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=and%20a%20periplasmic%20Hg%20binding,will%20act%20by%20regulating%20the">www.mdpi.com</a>) (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=reductase%20,presence%20of%20Hg%3B%20merD%20will">www.mdpi.com</a>). </p>
<p>In <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, the <strong>merB</strong> gene is part of the <strong>mer operon</strong>, a cluster of mercury resistance genes typically including regulatory and transport components. Expression of the mer operon is tightly regulated and induced in the presence of mercury ions (see below), ensuring that MerB (and MerA) are produced when needed for detoxification (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049809/#:~:text=Since%20the%20MerR%20family%20is,genes%20to%20investigate%20the%20expression">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). The biological processes involving MerB include <strong>organomercury catabolic processes</strong> – essentially the breakdown of organic mercury compounds – and the broader <strong>cellular response to mercury stress</strong>. These processes are ecologically significant: mercury-resistant pseudomonads with MerB can thrive in mercury-polluted soils, waters, or industrial effluents where they degrade organomercurials that would otherwise accumulate in the food chain (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=and%20merB%20confer%20broad,bioremediation%20at%20highly%20polluted%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). Because of this capability, MerB-possessing bacteria have been explored as agents of <strong>bioremediation</strong> for mercury pollution, leveraging their enzymatic machinery to detoxify contaminated sites (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0964830512002739#:~:text=and%20merB%20confer%20broad,bioremediation%20at%20highly%20polluted%20mercury">www.sciencedirect.com</a>). In summary, MerB’s physiological role is to confer the ability to <strong>transform organomercurials and contribute to mercury detoxification</strong>, an essential survival function in certain environments.</p>
<h2 id="disease-associations-and-phenotypes">Disease Associations and Phenotypes</h2>
<p>MerB itself is not known to be directly involved in pathogenesis or virulence in <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, but its presence can have important <strong>phenotypic and epidemiological implications</strong>. The primary phenotype associated with <strong>merB</strong> is the ability to grow and survive in the presence of organomercurial compounds that would normally be bactericidal. For example, MerB expression confers resistance to toxic organomercurial antiseptics such as phenylmercuric acetate (a mercurial disinfectant), allowing <em>Pseudomonas</em> cells to degrade this compound and thus tolerate concentrations that are lethal to other bacteria (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Work%20on%20the%20mechanism%20of,Somewhat%20surprisingly%2C%20each%20operon%20had">academic.oup.com</a>). Strains of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> carrying a functional mer operon (including merB) can therefore persist in mercury-rich environments – whether in industrial waste, contaminated soils, or even in clinical settings where mercurial compounds have been used as preservatives or disinfectants. </p>
<p>While MerB does not cause disease, the <strong>co-occurrence of mercury resistance with antibiotic resistance</strong> is a noted concern. Mercury resistance genes like <strong>merB</strong> often reside on plasmids or transposons that can also carry antibiotic resistance genes, leading to <strong>co-selection</strong> of multidrug-resistant strains in mercury-contaminated environments (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=may%20be%20a%20correlation%20between,such%20as%20a%20plasmid%20or">www.mdpi.com</a>). Exposure to mercury can select for bacteria harboring these mobile genetic elements, indirectly promoting the survival of antibiotic-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in hospitals or the environment (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=may%20be%20a%20correlation%20between,such%20as%20a%20plasmid%20or">www.mdpi.com</a>). Indeed, studies have found mercury-resistant bacteria (including <em>P. aeruginosa</em>) in clinical samples and environments heavily impacted by pollution, suggesting a link between metal resistance and the adaptability of opportunistic pathogens (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=metal%20resistances%20owing%20to%20concerns,and%20general%20themes%20arising%20from">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=merA%2C%20merD%2C%20merR%2C%20merP%2C%20merT,Myroides%20odoratus%2C%20Serratia%20liquefaciens%2C%20Vibrio">www.mdpi.com</a>). In summary, <strong>MerB’s “disease association” is indirect</strong> – it contributes to a survival trait (mercury resistance) that may enhance the persistence of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in certain settings, potentially compounding infection control challenges when such strains also carry drug resistance. The key phenotype to note is <strong>broad-spectrum mercury resistance</strong>, which is useful for environmental survival and bioremediation, but in a clinical context may correlate with hardier, more drug-resistant bacterial populations.</p>
<h2 id="protein-domains-and-structural-features">Protein Domains and Structural Features</h2>
<p>MerB is a single-domain enzyme with a <strong>unique protein fold</strong> not found in other protein families (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=is%20characterized%20by%20a%20novel,the%20broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of">www.rcsb.org</a>). Solution NMR and crystal structure studies revealed that MerB consists of three small β-sheets surrounded by six α-helices, forming a compact globular protein (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=is%20characterized%20by%20a%20novel,the%20broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of">www.rcsb.org</a>). This fold creates a specialized active-site region built around <strong>two key cysteine residues</strong> (Cys96 and Cys159 in the <em>E. coli</em> MerB, which is homologous to Pseudomonas MerB) (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=is%20characterized%20by%20a%20novel,the%20broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of">www.rcsb.org</a>) (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=data%20of%20free%20MerB%20and,broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of%20MerB">www.rcsb.org</a>). These two cysteines are positioned such that they can simultaneously coordinate a mercury ion; they form a bi-coordinate Hg^2+-binding site that is critical for catalysis (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=data%20of%20free%20MerB%20and,broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of%20MerB">www.rcsb.org</a>). A third conserved cysteine (Cys117 in <em>E. coli</em> numbering) lies nearby; studies indicate this residue is not directly involved in the chemical reaction but helps maintain the structural integrity of the active site (a structural cysteine) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>). Together, these conserved cysteine residues define the <strong>metal-binding motif</strong> of MerB, distinguishing it as a mercury-binding enzyme. </p>
<p>Around the catalytic cysteines, MerB has an <strong>extensive hydrophobic groove or pocket</strong> that accommodates the organic (alkyl or aryl) portion of the organomercurial substrates (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=data%20of%20free%20MerB%20and,broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of%20MerB">www.rcsb.org</a>). This hydrophobic pocket is thought to enable the enzyme’s broad substrate specificity, allowing it to bind various organomercury compounds of different sizes and hydrophobicities (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S6L#:~:text=data%20of%20free%20MerB%20and,broad%20substrate%20specificity%20of%20MerB">www.rcsb.org</a>). For instance, MerB can degrade both short-chain alkylmercurials (like methylmercury) and aromatic organomercurials (like phenylmercury) with only a slight preference for aryl substrates (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Meticulous%20characterization%20of%20the%20MerB,slow%20for%20an%20enzyme%2C%20these">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=very%20broad%20substrate%20tolerance%2C%20handling,effects%20were%20consistent%20with%20a">academic.oup.com</a>). The protein’s active site architecture positions the substrate’s carbon–Hg bond in proximity to the cysteine thiols, facilitating attack on the bond and protonation. Notably, MerB does <em>not</em> require any cofactors (such as metal clusters or organic coenzymes) – the mercury is directly coordinated by the protein’s own cysteine residues, and the proton needed for cleavage is provided by amino acid side chains or solvent, not an external cofactor (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Meticulous%20characterization%20of%20the%20MerB,slow%20for%20an%20enzyme%2C%20these">academic.oup.com</a>). This <strong>cofactor-independent metal-binding capability</strong> is a special feature of MerB. The enzyme’s overall size and composition (~215 amino acids, monomeric) and the presence of multiple conserved cysteines define it as a distinct family (often referred to simply as the MerB family). Importantly, MerB has no close relatives outside mercury resistance systems – it represents a novel fold and function that evolved specifically for organomercury degradation (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Recent%20phylogenetic%20analysis%20makes%20it,several%20subgroups%20distinguishable%20on%20the">academic.oup.com</a>). Its structure is optimized for stability in the intracellular reducing environment (no disulfides, as mentioned) and for reversible binding of a toxic metal. Structural studies continue to provide insight into how MerB stabilizes mercury intermediates and how it achieves catalytic cleavage of a very stable Hg–C bond.</p>
<h2 id="expression-patterns-and-regulation">Expression Patterns and Regulation</h2>
<p>The <strong>merB</strong> gene in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is typically co-transcribed as part of the <strong>mer operon</strong>, under the control of the <strong>MerR</strong> regulatory protein. In mercury-free conditions, MerR (a metal-responsive transcriptional regulator) binds to the mer operon promoter and keeps it inactive. When Hg^2+ is present, MerR binds the ion and undergoes a conformational change that activates transcription of the operon (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=reductase%20,presence%20of%20Hg%3B%20merD%20will">www.mdpi.com</a>). A distinctive feature of the mer operon promoter (exemplified by the well-studied Tn501 operon from <em>P. aeruginosa</em>) is an unusually long 19-base-pair spacer between the -35 and -10 elements of the promoter, which is crucial for MerR-mediated activation via DNA distortion (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049809/#:~:text=Since%20the%20MerR%20family%20is,genes%20to%20investigate%20the%20expression">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Upon Hg^2+ binding, MerR bends and unwinds the promoter DNA to align these motifs, enabling RNA polymerase to initiate transcription of merA, merB, and other downstream genes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049809/#:~:text=Since%20the%20MerR%20family%20is,genes%20to%20investigate%20the%20expression">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Thus, <strong>merB expression is inducible</strong> and tightly regulated: it remains virtually off in the absence of mercury and is highly upregulated when mercury (or certain organomercurials that release Hg^2+) is present. </p>
<p>The regulatory circuit often includes MerD, a secondary regulator that can bind the mer operator and dampen MerR activation, thus fine-tuning the response (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=match%20at%20L618%20increase%20in,detoxification%20mechanism%20in%20its%20most">academic.oup.com</a>). In <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and other bacteria with broad-spectrum operons, the gene order can vary, but merR (regulator) usually lies upstream of the structural genes, and merB is found downstream typically after merA (or in some cases separated by additional genes such as merC or merG) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=neurotoxic%20agent%20,relationships%20in%20many%20of%20these">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20merG,the%20periplasm%20and%20reduces%20cell">academic.oup.com</a>). For instance, on Tn501 (a transposon originally from <em>P. aeruginosa</em>), the operon includes <em>merTPCAD</em> (narrow spectrum), whereas broad-spectrum transposons like Tn5053 or plasmids like pMR26 include <em>merB</em> (and sometimes <em>merG</em>) after <em>merA</em> (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20merG,the%20periplasm%20and%20reduces%20cell">academic.oup.com</a>). All these genes share a common promoter controlled by MerR, making their expression synchronous upon induction. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> can therefore swiftly respond to mercury stress by producing MerB (and other Mer proteins) as needed. In terms of expression patterns, merB is generally silent during routine growth and is only expressed under conditions of mercury exposure. Laboratory studies using reporters have shown that mer operon expression can increase dramatically (tens to hundreds of fold) in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of Hg^2+ (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11049809/#:~:text=Since%20the%20MerR%20family%20is,genes%20to%20investigate%20the%20expression">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This tightly regulated inducible expression minimizes any fitness cost to the bacterium, as MerB (and MerA) are produced only when their detoxification function is required.</p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-conservation-and-diversity">Evolutionary Conservation and Diversity</h2>
<p>MerB is an enzyme that appears across a broad range of bacterial species, but its distribution is patchy and largely influenced by <strong>horizontal gene transfer</strong>. The merB gene is typically found on plasmids, transposons, or integrative elements that can move between bacteria, rather than being a core, vertically inherited gene. As a result, the phylogenetic relationships of MerB proteins do not correspond to the phylogeny of the host bacteria – MerB sequences from distantly related bacteria often cluster together, indicating common mobile genetic origins (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=its%20carriage%20by%20transferrable%20plasmids%2C,essential%20for%20catalysis%20and%20Cys117">academic.oup.com</a>). In fact, <strong>MerB is a unique enzyme with no known paralogs outside of mercury resistance contexts</strong>, and sequence analyses suggest it has evolved into several subgroups that are more closely related to each other than to their hosts’ lineage (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=basis%20of%20their%20primary%20and,essential%20for%20catalysis%20and%20Cys117">academic.oup.com</a>). This reflects the strong selective pressure in mercury-rich niches and the transfer of merB among microbial communities. </p>
<p>In terms of conservation, MerB proteins from different bacteria share the critical cysteine residues (and surrounding motifs) required for function, underscoring the importance of these residues (e.g. the Cys-x_x-Cys motif corresponding to positions ~96 and ~159) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>). However, outside these key regions, MerB sequences can diverge significantly, and overall identity between MerB from disparate bacteria can be modest. Most <strong>Gram-positive mercury-resistant bacteria</strong> characterized to date carry <strong>broad-spectrum mer operons</strong> (including merB), whereas in <strong>Gram-negative bacteria</strong> the presence of merB is somewhat less frequent (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Most%20described%20Gram,243%5D.%20Interestingly%2C%20in">academic.oup.com</a>). One survey found that roughly 20% of mercury-resistant Gram-negative strains had a merB gene, compared to a majority of Gram-positive strains (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Most%20described%20Gram,243%5D.%20Interestingly%2C%20in">academic.oup.com</a>). <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and other pseudomonads are among the Gram-negatives that commonly acquire broad-spectrum mer genes when needed. For example, <em>Pseudomonas strain K-62</em> (a soil isolate) harbors a plasmid with a complete broad-spectrum mer operon (<em>merTPCAGB</em>), enabling degradation of phenylmercury and other organomercurials (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20merG,the%20periplasm%20and%20reduces%20cell">academic.oup.com</a>). Environmental isolates of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> from mercury-contaminated sites have indeed been found to carry merA and merB, demonstrating that this pathogen can tap into the horizontal gene pool for mercury resistance when under heavy metal stress (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8007/4/4/111#:~:text=merA%2C%20merD%2C%20merR%2C%20merP%2C%20merT,Myroides%20odoratus%2C%20Serratia%20liquefaciens%2C%20Vibrio">www.mdpi.com</a>). Additionally, some strains can possess multiple mer operons; plasmids like R831 (in <em>E. coli</em>) or pDU1358 have two distinct mer modules (one narrow-spectrum, one broad-spectrum) on the same replicon , highlighting the mosaic and duplicative nature of mercury resistance loci. </p>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, <strong>merB appears to have evolved under strong selective pressure in environments with organomercury exposure</strong>. Its presence in diverse genera (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, etc.) and association with transposable elements suggest that merB has been disseminated widely due to human activities (e.g. use of mercury compounds) and natural mercury cycling (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=Work%20on%20the%20mechanism%20of,Somewhat%20surprisingly%2C%20each%20operon%20had">academic.oup.com</a>) (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=its%20carriage%20by%20transferrable%20plasmids%2C,essential%20for%20catalysis%20and%20Cys117">academic.oup.com</a>). Despite this diversity, the enzyme’s function has remained conserved – all known MerB proteins catalyze the same fundamental reaction of breaking Hg–carbon bonds. The conservation of function and critical residues across evolutionary distances underscores MerB’s importance and the convergent evolutionary solution it provides to the challenge of organomercury toxicity.</p>
<h2 id="relevant-go-terms-for-merb">Relevant GO Terms for MerB</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Molecular Function – Alkylmercury lyase activity (GO:0018836):</strong> MerB’s enzymatic function corresponds to alkylmercury lyase activity, defined as catalyzing the reaction <em>“an alkylmercury + H^+ → an alkane + Hg^2+”</em> (<a href="https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=GO%3A0018836&amp;type=go#:~:text=Definition%20%20,GO%3A0018836">ctdbase.org</a>). This is the specific activity of organomercurial lyase, breaking the carbon–mercury bond and liberating Hg^2+. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biological Process – Organomercury catabolic process (GO:0046413) and detoxification of mercury ion (GO:0050787):</strong> MerB is involved in the catabolism (breakdown) of organomercury compounds as part of the cell’s response to mercury. By converting organomercurials to inorganic mercury, MerB contributes to the broader process of mercury detoxification – any process that reduces mercury toxicity, including enzymatic conversion and volatilization of Hg^0 (<a href="https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=GO%3A0050787&amp;type=go#:~:text=Definition%20%20,0">ctdbase.org</a>). In GO annotation, this is captured by terms for organomercury compound catabolism and mercury ion detoxification. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cellular Component – Cytoplasm (GO:0005737):</strong> The cellular localization of MerB is the cytoplasm (intracellular space) of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. MerB lacks secretion signals and operates in the cytosolic compartment (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/27/2-3/355/615559?login=false#:~:text=other%20Gram,physiological%20thiols%2C%20glutathione%20or%20cysteine">academic.oup.com</a>), where it interacts with mercury substrates and partners like MerA. Thus, the appropriate GO term for its location is cytoplasm. </p>

description: Organomercurial lyase (MerB) is a monomeric ~22 kDa cytoplasmic enzyme
  that catalyzes the protonolytic cleavage of carbon-mercury bonds in organomercury
  compounds, converting toxic organomercurials like methylmercury and phenylmercury
  into inorganic Hg(II) and releasing the organic moiety as a hydrocarbon. Functions
  as the first step in broad-spectrum mercury resistance, working sequentially with
  MerA to detoxify organomercurials. Contains essential catalytic cysteines (Cys96,
  Cys159) that coordinate mercury through bis-thiolate binding. Possesses a unique
  protein fold with no known paralogs outside mercury resistance systems. Expression
  is tightly regulated by MerR as part of the mer operon, induced specifically by
  mercury exposure.

  findings:
  - statement: MerB is a cytoplasmic enzyme that cleaves carbon-mercury bonds in organomercurials
    supporting_text: MerB is located in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. It lacks
      any signal peptide or membrane-spanning domains, and it contains no disulfide
      bonds, consistent with a cytosolic enzyme that functions in the reducing environment
      of the cytosol.
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: MerB uses essential cysteine residues for catalysis
    supporting_text: Two cysteine residues (conserved as Cys96 and Cys159 in E. coli
      MerB numbering) are essential for catalysis, forming a bis-thiolated Hg^2+ intermediate
      and likely delivering the proton to the bound organic group.
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: MerB has a unique protein fold specific to mercury resistance
    supporting_text: MerB is a single-domain enzyme with a unique protein fold not
      found in other protein families. Solution NMR and crystal structure studies
      revealed that MerB consists of three small β-sheets surrounded by six α-helices,
      forming a compact globular protein.
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: MerB expression is tightly regulated by MerR in response to mercury
    supporting_text: The merB gene in P. aeruginosa is typically co-transcribed as
      part of the mer operon, under the control of the MerR regulatory protein. When
      Hg^2+ is present, MerR binds the ion and undergoes a conformational change that
      activates transcription of the operon.
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: MerB enables bioremediation of mercury-contaminated environments
    supporting_text: mercury-resistant pseudomonads with MerB can thrive in mercury-polluted
      soils, waters, or industrial effluents where they degrade organomercurials that
      would otherwise accumulate in the food chain. MerB-possessing bacteria have
      been explored as agents of bioremediation for mercury pollution.
