description: rDNA transcriptional regulator essential for ribosome biogenesis. Despite
  its name suggesting DNA polymerase activity, pol5 is a nucleolar protein that regulates
  rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I and plays critical roles in ribosome assembly,
  particularly for 60S subunit formation. Binds to rDNA sequences and is required
  for proper rRNA processing.

  review:
    summary: Pol5 localizes to the nucleolus where it functions in rRNA transcription
      and ribosome assembly. Multiple studies confirm nucleolar localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by literature evidence. Pol5 concentrates in the nucleolus,
      the site of rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. Immunofluorescence and
      GFP tagging studies confirm nucleolar localization. The nucleolar localization
      is functionally important as mislocalization leads to reduced rRNA transcription.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Pol5 directly binds to rDNA sequences, particularly rDNA promoter fragments,
      as demonstrated by experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Strongly supported by direct experimental evidence. Pol5 has been shown
      to bind rDNA promoter fragments and is required for rRNA transcription regulation.
      This is a core molecular function of the protein.

    label: nucleotide binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This is a very general term likely inferred from weak similarity to DNA
      polymerases. No specific evidence for nucleotide binding activity.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation appears to be based on weak computational inference from
      polymerase-like motifs, but pol5 lacks DNA polymerase activity and critical
      catalytic residues. The term is too general and not supported by functional
      evidence. Pol5's binding activities are better described by more specific terms
      like rDNA binding.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: file:pombe/pol5/pol5-deep-research.md
      supporting_text: Notably, Pol5 harbors sequence motifs weakly similar to B-family
        DNA polymerases (e.g. polymerases α, δ, ε), which led to its initial classification
        as a DNA polymerase-like protein. However, critical catalytic residues are
        absent or divergent, and Pol5 shows no DNA polymerase activity in vivo – consistent
        with it being 'unrelated to any known DNA polymerases' in function.

    label: nucleic acid binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: While pol5 does bind nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), this is a very general
      term that lacks specificity about pol5's actual binding activities.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Pol5 does bind nucleic acids but this term is too general. The protein
      specifically binds rDNA and rRNA, so more specific terms like 'rDNA binding'
      and 'rRNA binding' are more informative and accurate.

  review:
    summary: Pol5 does bind DNA, specifically rDNA sequences, but the more specific
      rDNA binding term is more informative.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While technically correct that pol5 binds DNA, this is a very general
      term. The more specific 'rDNA binding' term better captures pol5's function.
      This general term can be kept as non-core since it's not incorrect but is less
      informative than the specific rDNA binding annotation.

      Nuclear localization is well-established.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: While pol5 does regulate transcription, this general term lacks specificity.
      Pol5 specifically regulates rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I.
    action: MODIFY

    summary: General protein binding term based on interaction with Cdc10p. While

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While pol5 does bind proteins (specifically Cdc10), the general 'protein
      binding' term is not informative about the actual function. The specific interaction
      with Cdc10 might be relevant but the general protein binding term doesn't provide

    summary: Pol5 is required for proper rRNA processing, particularly at A2 and C2
      cleavage sites, and for 60S subunit assembly.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by literature. Pol5 depletion leads to defects in pre-rRNA

  review:
    summary: This is a NOT annotation indicating pol5 is not directly involved in

      a role for Pol5 in ribosome assembly rather than Pol I transcription.
