  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: rDNA transcriptional regulator essential for ribosome biogenesis. Despite its name suggesting DNA polymerase activity, pol5 is a nucleolar protein that regulates rRNA transcription by RNA polymerase I and plays critical roles in ribosome assembly, particularly for 60S subunit formation. Binds to rDNA sequences and is required for proper rRNA processing.

    id: GO:0005730
    label: nucleolus
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Pol5 localizes to the nucleolus where it functions in rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. Multiple studies confirm nucleolar localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by literature evidence. Pol5 concentrates in the nucleolus, the site of rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. Immunofluorescence and GFP tagging studies confirm nucleolar localization. The nucleolar localization is functionally important as mislocalization leads to reduced rRNA transcription.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Pol5 directly binds to rDNA sequences, particularly rDNA promoter fragments, as demonstrated by experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Strongly supported by direct experimental evidence. Pol5 has been shown to bind rDNA promoter fragments and is required for rRNA transcription regulation. This is a core molecular function of the protein.

    label: nucleotide binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This is a very general term likely inferred from weak similarity to DNA polymerases. No specific evidence for nucleotide binding activity.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation appears to be based on weak computational inference from polymerase-like motifs, but pol5 lacks DNA polymerase activity and critical catalytic residues. The term is too general and not supported by functional evidence. Pol5's binding activities are better described by more specific terms like rDNA binding.
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: file:pombe/pol5/pol5-deep-research.md
        supporting_text: "Notably, Pol5 harbors sequence motifs weakly similar to B-family DNA polymerases (e.g. polymerases α, δ, ε), which led to its initial classification as a DNA polymerase-like protein. However, critical catalytic residues are absent or divergent, and Pol5 shows no DNA polymerase activity in vivo – consistent with it being 'unrelated to any known DNA polymerases' in function."

    label: nucleic acid binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: While pol5 does bind nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), this is a very general term that lacks specificity about pol5's actual binding activities.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Pol5 does bind nucleic acids but this term is too general. The protein specifically binds rDNA and rRNA, so more specific terms like 'rDNA binding' and 'rRNA binding' are more informative and accurate.

  review:
    summary: Pol5 does bind DNA, specifically rDNA sequences, but the more specific rDNA binding term is more informative.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While technically correct that pol5 binds DNA, this is a very general term. The more specific 'rDNA binding' term better captures pol5's function. This general term can be kept as non-core since it's not incorrect but is less informative than the specific rDNA binding annotation.

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While pol5 does bind proteins (specifically Cdc10), the general 'protein binding' term is not informative about the actual function. The specific interaction with Cdc10 might be relevant but the general protein binding term doesn't provide meaningful functional information.
