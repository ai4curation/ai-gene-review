### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "cps1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain 972 / ATCC 24843) (Fission yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'cps1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **cps1** (gene ID: cps1, UniProt: O13968) in pombe.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: cps1 (SPAC24C9.08; UniProt O13968) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (972 h−)

Identity verification and symbol ambiguity

• Verified target: UniProt O13968 corresponds to SPAC24C9.08 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain 972 / ATCC 24843) and is annotated as an uncharacterized carboxypeptidase belonging to the metallopeptidase family M20A (peptidase M20 clan), with typical domains consistent with bacterial-type exopeptidase dimerization and a peptidase M20 catalytic core (per the user-provided UniProt summary).
• Mandatory symbol check: The symbol “cps1” is widely used in the fission yeast field for the essential β-1,3-glucan synthase subunit (also known as Bgs1) involved in cytokinesis and cell wall synthesis; that is a different protein from SPAC24C9.08 and not an M20A metallopeptidase. Therefore, the gene symbol “cps1” is ambiguous in S. pombe. In this report, I do not attribute literature from the β-1,3-glucan synthase gene to SPAC24C9.08. Instead, I focus on domain/family-based functional inference for SPAC24C9.08 (O13968) and recent work on M20/M20A enzymes. When direct experimental data on SPAC24C9.08 are lacking, I note this explicitly.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

• Metallopeptidase family M20/M20A: M20A enzymes are zinc-dependent metallopeptidases. Mechanistically, a Zn2+-bound water is deprotonated to generate the nucleophile; a catalytic glutamate participates in proton transfers as the tetrahedral intermediate forms and collapses. Metal coordination in M20A typically involves two histidines and two glutamates, with an aspartate often bridging or stabilizing the metal site; conserved residue sets have been delineated in contemporary enzymology of aminoacylases (e.g., MsAA and mammalian Acy1) (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6).
• Oligomerization and domain organization: M20 family peptidases often require oligomerization for full activity, with a characteristic “dimerization” domain in the architecture. Cross-subunit contributions to the active-site geometry and a catalysis-coupled “lid” movement have been shown in M20 exemplars such as bacterial carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2), where a conserved histidine from the partner subunit participates in catalysis; removing the dimerization domain compromises activity (Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2). Across M20A representatives, reported assemblies include monomers, dimers, tetramers, octamers, and even dodecamers, though eukaryotic aminoacylases like Acy1 and PM20D1 are commonly dimeric (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Substrate class and specificity: M20A subfamily members prominently include aminoacylases (Acy1-like) that hydrolyze non-peptidic amide bonds in N-acyl-L-amino acids. Other M20 members include carboxypeptidases and tripeptidases with exopeptidase specificity for peptide termini, reflecting a broader catalytic scope within the clan MH families (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7; Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6, yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2).
• Cellular localization (inferred): Eukaryotic Acy1 is a cytosolic enzyme in mammals; M20 family aminopeptidases/peptidases in bacteria can be cytosolic or membrane-associated. For example, two S. aureus M20B peptidases (PepT1, PepT2) distribute between cytosol and membrane fractions and impact virulence phenotypes, illustrating intracellular roles; however, these are bacterial M20B enzymes and not direct orthologs (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1176769) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8). Fungal degradome surveys emphasize abundant intracellular metallopeptidases, consistent with proteostasis roles; while not M20A-specific, they highlight the intracellular bias of many fungal proteases (Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137121) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

• Aminoacylase biocatalysis expanded: A 2024 review synthesizes new aminoacylases (including M20A representatives) amenable to synthesis of N‑acyl‑amino acids, noting diverse metal preferences (Zn2+ predominant, but Co2+/Mn2+/Ni2+/Cu2+ can substitute), clarified conserved residues, and systematically catalogs oligomeric states and production hosts. Notably, several enzymes characterized in 2023–2024 (e.g., MsAA, PmAcy) exhibited strong synthetic performance (“+”/“++” ratings), underscoring a growing toolkit for green chemistry applications (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6, haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Metallopeptidases in fungal degradomes: New 2024 degradome profiling in Aspergillus ochraceus identified 21 extracellular metallopeptidases and emphasized M20 and M28 representation, confirming the prominence of metallopeptidases in fungal proteolysis and suggesting functional breadth in nutrient acquisition and interspecies interactions (Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137121) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Ecological functional metagenomics: Comparative 2023 metagenomes from geothermal springs showed peptidase families are far more abundant than CAZymes, with M20 annotated among the prevalent families. This supports the widespread ecological utilization of protein/peptide catabolism, reinforcing the physiological plausibility of intracellular M20/M20A roles in diverse microbes (Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281277) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Pathogenesis relevance (bacterial M20B, contextual): Two S. aureus M20B peptidases (PepT1, PepT2) were required for full virulence, localized to cytosol and membrane, and are regulated by key virulence regulators (Agr/Rot/SarA). Although not directly transferable to M20A in fungi, these findings emphasize that M20 family members can be tightly integrated with cellular physiology and stress responses (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1176769) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).

Current applications and real-world implementations

• Biocatalysis and green chemistry: Aminoacylases (M20A) are utilized for enantioselective hydrolysis/synthesis of N‑acyl‑amino acids; the field is advancing with enzymes supporting surfactant synthesis and broader substrate spectra, with practical recombinant expression systems established (E. coli, Streptomyces, insect and mammalian cells) (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6, haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Therapeutic enzyme precedent (family context): Carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2; M20 family) underpins glucarpidase (Voraxaze) for high-dose methotrexate toxicity rescue and is used in directed enzyme–prodrug therapy platforms. Its structural mechanism illustrates the functional importance of the dimerization domain and cross-subunit active-site assembly (Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis

• The 2024 Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology review synthesizes catalytic, structural, and application-focused knowledge for aminoacylases, emphasizing conserved metal-binding/catalytic architectures, broad oligomerization, and the maturing potential of aminoacylases as sustainable biocatalysts for N‑acyl‑amino acid production (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6).
• Structural enzymology of M20 peptidases highlights the necessity of the dimerization domain for full activity and lid mechanics, indicating that for uncharacterized M20A proteins like SPAC24C9.08, oligomeric state and inter-domain coupling are likely determinants of function (Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent studies)

• Fungal degradome composition: In A. ochraceus, manual curation identified 21 extracellular metallopeptidases among the secreted degradome components (Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137121) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Environmental metagenomics: Across 63 geothermal springs metagenomes, extracellular peptidases outnumbered CAZymes by roughly two orders of magnitude; among peptidase families recorded were M20 (glutamate carboxypeptidase family) (Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281277) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).
• Oligomeric diversity snapshot: Acy1/PM20D1 are commonly dimeric (~43–48 kDa); the M20/M38 space includes monomers, dimers, tetramers, octamers, and dodecamers, indicating quaternary-structure heterogeneity with functional implications (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).

Family-based inference for SPAC24C9.08 (O13968) in S. pombe

Direct experimental characterization specific to SPAC24C9.08/O13968 in S. pombe could not be located in recent literature. Based on its assignment to metallopeptidase family M20A and the domain architecture consistent with the peptidase M20 catalytic core plus a dimerization domain, the following are plausible, testable inferences:
• Enzymatic class: A zinc-dependent exopeptidase likely within the aminoacylase/carboxypeptidase spectrum of M20A, catalyzing hydrolysis of amide/peptide bonds via a Zn2+‑activated water and a catalytic glutamate (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7; Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6, yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2).
• Active site and metal: Presumed dinuclear Zn2+ site with histidine and glutamate ligands and a supportive aspartate, by homology to characterized M20A aminoacylases (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 5-6).
• Oligomeric state: Likely oligomeric (often dimeric) given the presence of a dimerization domain and the common quaternary structures in M20A (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7; Apr 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzx005) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8, yachnin2017engineeringcarboxypeptidaseg2 pages 1-2).
• Localization: Likely intracellular (cytosolic) as for eukaryotic Acy1/PM20D1 and many fungal metallopeptidases; definitive localization for SPAC24C9.08 remains to be experimentally established (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13328-7; Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137121) (haeger2024perspectivesofaminoacylases pages 6-8).

Recommended next experiments

• Biochemistry: Express and purify SPAC24C9.08; determine metal content (ICP-MS), activity on N‑acyl‑amino acids and peptide termini; define pH/metal cofactor dependence; mutate predicted metal ligands/catalytic glutamate.
• Structure/oligomerization: SEC-MALS/native MS and cryo-EM/X-ray to resolve quaternary structure and confirm the dimerization domain’s role.
• Localization: Endogenous tagging in S. pombe and microscopy; fractionation to assess cytosolic vs membrane association.
• Genetic context: Deletion/overexpression with proteostasis stress assays to test roles in peptide/amino acid metabolism.

Compliance note on ambiguity

Because the symbol “cps1” in S. pombe commonly denotes a different, well-studied membrane glucan synthase, and no direct experimental papers were found for SPAC24C9.08 (O13968), I have based functional discussion on the M20A family/domain evidence above rather than cross-attributing evidence from unrelated proteins. Where claims are made, they are supported by the cited sources above.
