description: >-
  SPAC24C9.08 (O13968) is an M20A family metallopeptidase in S. pombe that is orthologous
  to mammalian PM20D1 (N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase). Unlike classical
  carboxypeptidases in the M20 family, PM20D1-like enzymes catalyze the bidirectional
  synthesis and hydrolysis of N-acyl amino acids from fatty acids and amino acids.
  The protein is a type II single-pass membrane protein localized to the vacuolar membrane
  with its catalytic domain in the vacuolar lumen. Based on domain architecture (M20
  peptidase domain and dimerization domain) and sequence homology to PM20D1, this enzyme
  likely functions in N-fatty-acyl-amino acid metabolism rather than as a classical
  carboxypeptidase. The protein contains a di-zinc catalytic center typical of M20 family
  enzymes, with conserved metal-binding residues (His, Asp, Glu). Notably, the gene symbol
  "cps1" is misleading as it suggests carboxypeptidase S activity; however, phylogenetic
  analysis places this protein with PM20D1 rather than with S. cerevisiae CPS1 (yscS).

    Catalysis of the condensation reaction: a fatty acid + an L-amino acid =
    an N-fatty-acyl-L-amino acid + H2O. This is the reverse (synthetic) direction
    of aminoacylase activity, specifically with fatty acid substrates.
  justification: >-
    The bidirectional nature of PM20D1 family enzymes is not captured by existing
    GO terms. Aminoacylase activity (GO:0004046) describes only the hydrolysis
    direction with generic acyl groups, not the synthesis direction with fatty acids.

      We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the
      condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also
      the reverse hydrolytic reaction

- hypothesis: >-
    SPAC24C9.08 catalyzes the bidirectional synthesis and hydrolysis of
    N-fatty-acyl-amino acids similar to mammalian PM20D1
  description: >-
    Express and purify recombinant SPAC24C9.08 and assay for both synthase
    activity (condensation of oleic acid with phenylalanine to form N-oleoyl-phenylalanine)
    and hydrolase activity (cleavage of N-oleoyl-phenylalanine). Compare substrate
    specificity profile with mammalian PM20D1 using various fatty acids and amino acids.
