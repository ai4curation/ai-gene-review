description: >-
  SPAC24C9.08 (O13968) is an M20A family metallopeptidase in S. pombe with predicted
  carboxypeptidase activity. The protein contains characteristic M20 peptidase domains
  including the catalytic domain (IPR002933) and dimerization domain (IPR011650), with
  a predicted di-zinc catalytic center. It localizes to the vacuole as a type II
  single-pass membrane protein. The gene is named "cps1" suggesting homology to
  S. cerevisiae carboxypeptidase S (CPS1/yscS), but this assignment should be treated
  cautiously: (1) the gene symbol "cps1" in S. pombe literature also refers to bgs1,
  a completely different glucan synthase; (2) the precise biochemical activity of
  SPAC24C9.08 has not been experimentally determined; (3) while S. cerevisiae CPS1
  is a well-characterized Gly-Xaa carboxypeptidase, the M20A subfamily has diverged
  to include enzymes with non-peptidase activities (e.g., mammalian PM20D1 which
  functions as an N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase). Without direct biochemical
  characterization, the precise enzymatic function remains uncertain.

      but this is based on sequence homology rather than direct biochemical characterization.

      The IBA annotation infers vacuolar lumen localization based on phylogenetic
      inference from S. cerevisiae CPS1. This is reasonable if the protein functions
      like S. cerevisiae CPS1, where the mature enzyme is soluble in the lumen.

      and released into the lumen.

      SpCPS belongs to the M20A subfamily of metallopeptidases, which is part of the
      larger M20 family within clan MH. The protein contains several characteristic domains
      including the peptidase M20 catalytic domain (IPR002933), the peptidase M20 dimer
      domain (IPR011650)

      The functional role of this enzyme can be reliably inferred from multiple lines
      of evidence: its classification within the well-characterized M20A peptidase family,
      its vacuolar localization, its structural homology to characterized vacuolar
      carboxypeptidases in other organisms

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Does S. pombe SPAC24C9.08 have carboxypeptidase activity (like S. cerevisiae CPS1)
    or aminoacylase/N-acyl amino acid hydrolase activity (like mammalian PM20D1)?

- question: >-
    What is the substrate specificity of S. pombe SPAC24C9.08? Does it cleave
    Cbz-Gly-Leu like S. cerevisiae CPS1, or does it act on N-acyl amino acids?
  experts: []

- question: >-
    Is the S. pombe "cps1" gene (SPAC24C9.08) an ortholog of S. cerevisiae CPS1,
    or has it diverged in function?

suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: >-
    SPAC24C9.08 has carboxypeptidase activity similar to S. cerevisiae CPS1
  description: >-
    Express and purify recombinant SPAC24C9.08 and assay for carboxypeptidase activity
    using Cbz-Gly-Leu as substrate. Compare activity to S. cerevisiae CPS1. Test
    substrate specificity with various dipeptides to determine P1 preference.
  experiment_type: biochemical enzyme assay

- hypothesis: >-
    SPAC24C9.08 has aminoacylase/N-acyl amino acid hydrolase activity like PM20D1
  description: >-
    Assay purified SPAC24C9.08 for hydrolysis of N-acyl amino acids (e.g., N-acetyl-
    L-methionine, N-oleoyl-phenylalanine) and for synthase activity (condensation
    of fatty acids with amino acids).

- hypothesis: >-
    SPAC24C9.08 deletion affects vacuolar proteolysis in S. pombe
  description: >-
    Generate SPAC24C9.08 deletion strain and assess vacuolar proteolysis using
    autophagy markers during nitrogen starvation. Compare to wild-type and to
    cpy1 (carboxypeptidase Y) deletion strains.
