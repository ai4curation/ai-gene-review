# Shu1 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Gene Research Report

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanism  
Shu1 is a **cell-surface heme-binding protein** in fission yeast that enables the uptake of extracellular heme as an iron source ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=the%20environment,pombe%20cells%2C%20their)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). Under iron-limited conditions, S. pombe can utilize heme from the environment, and Shu1 is **essential for assimilating heme-bound iron** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)). Shu1 binds hemin (iron-containing porphyrin) with micromolar affinity (K_D ≈ 2.2 μM) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=When%20heme%20biosynthesis%20is%20selectively,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). Mechanistically, Shu1 acts as a heme receptor: it captures exogenous heme at the cell surface and facilitates its internalization. In Shu1-deficient yeast (shu1∆), cells cannot grow when heme is the sole iron source (e.g. in a heme-deficient *hem1Δ* background), confirming Shu1’s **essential role in heme uptake for iron acquisition** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)). Once Shu1 binds heme, the Shu1–heme complex is rapidly endocytosed. Studies show that **heme binding triggers Shu1 internalization** from the plasma membrane to the vacuole, where the heme is transferred to intracellular pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=replaced%20with%20Ala%20residues%20fails,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). An ABC-family transporter, Abc3, located on the vacuolar membrane, then exports heme (or iron derived from it) into the cytosol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20low%20hemin,Taken)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=replaced%20with%20Ala%20residues%20fails,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). In *abc3∆* mutants, heme analogs accumulate in vacuoles and cannot reach the cytoplasm, phenocopying Shu1 loss ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20low%20hemin,Taken)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exporter%2C%20results%20with%20hemin,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). Together, Shu1 and Abc3 define a two-step pathway: Shu1 mediates **heme import** into the cell (via endocytosis into vacuoles), and Abc3 releases heme or iron from the vacuole, thereby contributing to cellular iron homeostasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exporter%2C%20results%20with%20hemin,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). Notably, S. pombe was previously known to acquire iron only through reductive uptake and siderophores; Shu1’s discovery reveals a **novel heme-iron acquisition mechanism** in this yeast ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Iron%20is%20an%20essential%20metal,type%20transcriptional)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=strategies%20to%20scavenge%20it%20from,6)). Shu1’s function is considered noncanonical because S. cerevisiae (budding yeast) lacks high-affinity heme importers and cannot effectively take up exogenous heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=may%20be%20the%20fact%20that,6)). Thus, Shu1 provides S. pombe a unique strategy to scavenge iron by importing heme, highlighting a specialized molecular mechanism for iron uptake under iron-starvation conditions.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
**Shu1 localizes to the cell surface**, anchored in the plasma membrane. A functional Shu1 tagged with HA epitopes was observed at the **plasma membrane** by fluorescence microscopy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=dependent%20down,Further%20analysis%20by)). Even after enzymatic cell wall digestion, Shu1 remains membrane-associated, indicating it is not merely cell-wall bound but attached to the plasma membrane proper ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Microscopic%20and%20biochemical%20analyses%20have,Although%20Shu1%20contains)). Shu1 is **anchored via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor**, as evidenced by its sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) cleavage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=showed%20that%20Shu1%20is%20released,but%20under%20high%20hemin%20concentrations)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=the%20model%20organism%20S,followed%20by%202%20relatively%20short)). PI-PLC “shaving” experiments released Shu1 from membranes, confirming that Shu1 is a GPI-anchored membrane protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=showed%20that%20Shu1%20is%20released,but%20under%20high%20hemin%20concentrations)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=the%20model%20organism%20S,followed%20by%202%20relatively%20short)). Sequence analysis identified a predicted GPI attachment site at **Serine 199** of Shu1, with the adjacent residues (Ser200, Ala201) fitting the ω-site motif that favors GPI addition ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exogenous%20PI,%CF%89%2B2%20residues%20of%20Shu1%20is)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=Ser,Overall%2C%20the%20predicted%20Shu1%20GPI)). A hydrophobic C-terminal tail (∼12 residues after the ω-site) and a short spacer region are present, consistent with GPI-anchored protein architecture ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=membrane,Overall%2C%20the%20predicted%20Shu1%20GPI)). Thus, Shu1 is an **extrinsic component of the plasma membrane (external side)**, tethered by a GPI lipid moiety. Under **low heme (iron-starved) conditions**, Shu1 resides predominantly at the cell surface (plasma membrane) to capture heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)). However, upon binding heme or when external heme is abundant, Shu1 undergoes **ligand-induced internalization**. It relocalizes from the plasma membrane to internal compartments, specifically the **vacuolar membrane**, at high heme concentrations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=replaced%20with%20Ala%20residues%20fails,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). This relocalization likely occurs via endocytic uptake of the Shu1–heme complex. The dynamic trafficking – cell surface in low heme vs. vacuole upon heme exposure – suggests a regulated process to avoid excess heme and to route bound heme to the vacuole for processing. In summary, Shu1 is a **plasma membrane, GPI-anchored glycoprotein** that cycles between the cell surface and vacuole, functioning at the interface of the cell and its environment to mediate heme import.

## Biological Processes Involvement  
Shu1 is chiefly involved in **iron ion homeostasis** and **heme transport** processes. Its activity allows S. pombe to utilize extracellular hemin (heme chloride) or heme-containing compounds as iron sources when free iron is scarce ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Iron%20is%20an%20essential%20metal,type%20transcriptional)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). Key biological processes associated with Shu1 include: 

- **Heme import and transport:** Shu1 contributes to the directed movement of heme into the cell. It can be annotated to *heme transport* and specifically *heme import across the plasma membrane*, as it mediates uptake of heme from the extracellular space ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)). This process supplements the organism’s iron acquisition strategies beyond traditional siderophore uptake and reductive iron uptake. Shu1-dependent heme assimilation ultimately feeds into cellular **iron utilization**, since internalized heme can be degraded (e.g., by heme oxygenases in other species or possibly by vacuolar enzymes) to release iron for metabolic needs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20suggested%20that,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=subsequently%20allowed%20heme%20to%20be,as%20a%20source%20of%20iron)). In S. pombe (which notably lacks a canonical heme oxygenase enzyme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20from%20protoporphyrin%20IX,as%20a%20source%20of%20iron))), the imported heme likely stores in vacuoles and then iron is released, making Shu1’s role critical for iron acquisition under heme-rich, iron-poor conditions. GO terms capturing these roles include **iron ion transport** and **iron assimilation from heme** (a subset of iron homeostasis). 

- **Response to iron starvation:** Shu1 is part of the cellular response to low iron availability. Its expression is strongly induced under iron-starved conditions, making it a component of the iron starvation response regulon ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Genome%20profiling%20studies%20have%20revealed,integrated)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)). This ties Shu1 to the biological process *cellular response to iron ion starvation*. By being upregulated when iron is limited, Shu1 helps the cell scavenge alternative iron sources (heme) to survive iron deprivation. Conversely, when iron is plentiful, Shu1 is repressed to avoid unnecessary or harmful uptake of heme-bound iron ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=further%20determine%20whether%20Fep1%20played,results%20showed%20that%20Fep1%20is)). 

- **Endocytosis and vacuolar transport:** Functionally, Shu1’s activity implicates **endocytic trafficking** (internalizing the heme–Shu1 complex) and **vacuolar transport** processes. Heme uptake via Shu1 likely proceeds through receptor-mediated endocytosis to deliver heme to vacuoles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20suggested%20that,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=subsequently%20allowed%20heme%20to%20be,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)). This is analogous to pathways in pathogenic fungi where cell-surface heme receptors facilitate endocytosis of heme for vacuolar sequestration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20suggested%20that,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=subsequently%20allowed%20heme%20to%20be,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)). In S. pombe, Shu1 and the vacuolar exporter Abc3 together define a pathway of **heme assimilation**: Shu1 enables endocytic uptake into vacuoles, and Abc3 handles export from vacuoles to cytosol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20low%20hemin,Taken)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exporter%2C%20results%20with%20hemin,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). These steps align with GO processes like *endocytosis*, *vacuolar transport*, and *intracellular heme distribution*. 

Through these processes, Shu1 plays a pivotal role in **maintaining iron homeostasis**. It essentially widens the organism’s capability to gather iron by adding heme uptake to its repertoire. This is especially important in environments where iron is predominantly found in heme (for example, during growth on heme or hemoglobin as an iron source). Additionally, by localizing initially to the plasma membrane and later to vacuoles, Shu1 integrates into the processes of membrane trafficking and vacuolar iron storage. In summary, Shu1 is involved in **heme uptake (GO:0015886)**, **iron ion homeostasis (GO:0055072)**, and the broader cellular adaptation to iron scarcity, ensuring the cell can capture and mobilize iron from heme when needed.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
**Phenotypic effects of Shu1 perturbation:** In laboratory conditions, deletion of *shu1+* (shu1∆) causes a specific growth defect when exogenous heme is the only iron source available. Wild-type S. pombe can grow if supplied with hemin to meet its iron needs (especially when heme biosynthesis is genetically blocked), but shu1∆ mutants fail to thrive in such conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=incubated%20in%20the%20absence%20of,heme%20under%20low%20iron%20conditions)). This phenotype demonstrates **Shu1’s essential role in heme-iron utilization**: without Shu1, cells cannot assimilate heme, leading to iron starvation and growth arrest on heme-based media ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)). In contrast, under iron-replete conditions or standard media (with ample free iron), shu1∆ mutants do not show pronounced growth defects, because the cells can rely on other iron uptake pathways (ferric reductase/ferroxidation systems and siderophore transporters) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=its%20acquisition,tagged%20Shu1%20localizes%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=%2822%20%29,genes%20is%20the%20fact)). Thus, the **shu1∆ phenotype** is context-specific – primarily manifesting as an inability to use environmental heme – rather than a general lethality or sickness. This suggests Shu1 is **non-essential for viability** when iron is readily available, but is critical for fitness in iron-poor, heme-rich environments. Besides growth phenotypes, a shu1∆ strain also fails to internalize fluorescent heme analogs (e.g., zinc mesoporphyrin, ZnMP), confirming the loss of heme uptake function at the cellular level ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=cells,from%20the%20vacuole%20to%20the)).

**Disease associations:** *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* is a model organism and not a human pathogen, so Shu1 itself is not implicated in human disease. However, Shu1’s function provides insights relevant to pathogenic fungi and iron-acquisition in host environments. Many pathogenic fungi scavenge host heme as an iron source, a process crucial for their virulence. For example, Candida albicans expresses GPI-anchored heme-binding proteins (Rbt5, Pga7, etc.) to capture heme from host hemoglobin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=Although%20Rbt5%20plays%20an%20important,of%20systemic%20infection%2C%20although%20this)). These proteins contain a CFEM domain (see below) and work in concert to import heme; deletion of certain heme-binding receptors in Candida significantly impairs its ability to grow on heme and can attenuate virulence in infection models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=defective%20in%20hemin%20assimilation%20,of%20systemic%20infection%2C%20although%20this)). Although Shu1 is **not a CFEM protein**, it functionally parallels those fungal heme receptors. The discovery of Shu1 bridges a gap: it is the first demonstration that a fission yeast (an ascomycete) can directly take up heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20iron,novel%20component%20for%20heme%20acquisition)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=strategies%20to%20scavenge%20it%20from,6)). This finding broadens our understanding of fungal iron uptake mechanisms, which were previously studied mostly in pathogens. By analogy, **Shu1 and its pathway have no direct human homolog** but highlight principles of heme utilization that could be relevant in infection or iron metabolism contexts. For instance, the two-step uptake via Shu1 and re-export via Abc3 in yeast is conceptually similar to how some human cells and parasites manage heme (e.g., mammalian Hrg1 transports heme from lysosomes, analogous to Abc3’s vacuolar export ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=acquire%20heme%20from%20the%20environment,are%20much%20less%20well%20understood)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=,are%20much%20less%20well%20understood))). 

In summary, while Shu1 is not associated with human disease, its **loss-of-function phenotype** in yeast is a failure to grow on heme as an iron source, and its existence underscores how fungi acquire iron in iron-poor scenarios. It provides a model to understand heme acquisition strategies, some of which are virulence factors in pathogens. For GO annotation of phenotypes, Shu1 relates to terms like *iron starvation response defective* (when deleted) and *abnormal heme utilization*. Experimentally, **restoring shu1+** in a shu1∆ strain rescues growth on heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=incubated%20in%20the%20absence%20of,heme%20under%20low%20iron%20conditions)), confirming that the phenotype is specifically due to loss of Shu1 function in heme uptake.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The Shu1 protein is relatively small (226 amino acids) and is rich in cysteine residues that form a distinctive motif for heme binding. **Shu1 does not belong to any well-known enzyme family or transporter family**; instead, it appears to be a novel **extracellular receptor protein**. Key structural features include: 

- **Signal peptide and GPI-anchor sequence:** Shu1 has an N-terminal signal peptide (directing it into the secretory pathway) and a C-terminal GPI-anchor attachment sequence. The predicted ω-site for GPI anchoring is at **Ser^199**, followed by the minimal recognition motif (Ser-Ala at ω+1, ω+2) and a hydrophobic tail ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exogenous%20PI,%CF%89%2B2%20residues%20of%20Shu1%20is)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=membrane,Overall%2C%20the%20predicted%20Shu1%20GPI)). This architecture is typical of GPI-anchored proteins and is experimentally supported by PI-PLC release assays (see above). Therefore, Shu1 is synthesized as a prepro-protein that becomes **GPI-anchored on the cell surface**, with its mature polypeptide ending at Ser^199 after GPI addition.

- **Cysteine-rich region (partial CFEM-like domain):** Shu1 contains **seven cysteine residues** in its sequence (at positions 72, 87, 92, 101, 130, 172, and 214) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Cig1%20or%20CFEM2%2C%20,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)). Four of these cysteines (Cys72, Cys87, Cys92, Cys101) are clustered in the N-terminal half of the protein and form a motif reminiscent of a **partial CFEM domain** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=seven%20Cys%20residues%20,hem1%CE%94%20shu1%CE%94%20cells%20expressing%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=is%20found%20in%20the%20canonical,tagged)). CFEM domains (Common in Fungal Extracellular Membranes) are eight-cysteine motifs found in many fungal heme-binding proteins, forming a “helical basket” structure to cradle heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Cig1%20or%20CFEM2%2C%20,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=is%20found%20in%20the%20canonical,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)). Shu1 does *not* have the canonical eight-Cys CFEM consensus (it has seven Cys in total, and their spacing is different) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Cig1%20or%20CFEM2%2C%20,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)). However, the spacing of Cys72–Cys101 in Shu1 (patterned approximately C–X_14–C–X_4–C–X_8–C) mirrors part of the CFEM cysteine arrangement ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=seven%20Cys%20residues%20,hem1%CE%94%20shu1%CE%94%20cells%20expressing%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=is%20found%20in%20the%20canonical,tagged)). This **cysteine-rich stretch is critical for heme binding**. Site-directed mutagenesis replacing those four cysteines with alanine (Shu1^C72A,C87A,C92A,C101A) abolishes Shu1’s function: the mutant protein is unable to support growth on heme as sole iron source ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=arrangement%20reminiscent%20of%20a%20partial,using%20protein%20lysates%20prepared%20from)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=%28Shu1,bind%20heme%20when%20subjected%20to)). Biochemically, the cysteine mutant showed greatly reduced binding to hemin–agarose and lost the characteristic spectroscopic heme-binding signal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=protein%20mislocalization%20because%20results%20showed,will%20require%20structural%20studies%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=%28Shu1,bind%20heme%20when%20subjected%20to)). Importantly, the mutant still localized to the cell surface like wild-type, indicating the loss of function is due to impaired heme coordination rather than mislocalization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=%28Shu1,bind%20heme%20when%20subjected%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=in%20the%20presence%20of%20hemin,However)). These results suggest that some of Shu1’s cysteines (likely in pairs or a cluster) directly coordinate the heme molecule, analogous to how CFEM-domain proteins bind heme through a coordinated network involving a critical aspartate and cysteine residues. Shu1’s **“noncanonical CFEM”** segment thus constitutes its heme-binding domain. No other recognizable domains (e.g. enzymatic domains or known folds) are present, so this cysteine-rich region is the prime functional domain. Shu1 also lacks a cytosolic tail (since it is GPI-anchored), consistent with its role purely as an extracellular ligand-binding receptor.

- **Glycosylation:** While not explicitly detailed in the literature, many GPI-anchored cell-surface proteins are glycosylated. Shu1 has several predicted N-glycosylation sequons. It is likely glycosylated in the secretory pathway, which could influence its stability or cell wall interactions. (For GO annotation, “protein glycosylation” could be relevant, though direct evidence for Shu1’s glycosylation is not yet provided in the literature.)

- **Tertiary structure:** The tertiary structure of Shu1 has not been solved. By analogy to CFEM proteins (whose structures reveal a helical basket fold stabilized by disulfide bonds ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=where%20X%20is%20any%20amino,predicted%20to%20stabilize%20the%20helical)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=Csa2%20are%20required%20for%20optimal,also%20predicted%20that%20a%20conserved))), Shu1’s four closely spaced cysteines may form disulfide bridges that create a binding pocket for heme. The absence of four additional cysteines means Shu1’s fold could be somewhat different or less stable than a full CFEM domain. Structural studies have been suggested to delineate how those cysteines contribute to heme coordination ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=this%20mutant%20did%20not%20possess,structural%20studies%20of%20the%20hemoprotein)). Until a crystal or NMR structure is available, Shu1’s precise folding remains predicted. It is clear, however, that Shu1’s structure is adapted for **ligand binding (heme)** rather than catalysis or transport, acting like a receptor/hemophore attached to the cell membrane.

In summary, Shu1 is characterized by a **GPI-anchored, cysteine-rich extracellular domain** that binds heme. The **partial CFEM-like motif** within Shu1 is a defining feature, functionally important for heme coordination. This makes Shu1 part of a broader class of fungal heme-binding proteins, even though it diverges from the classical domain architectures seen in other fungi.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
The expression of *shu1+* is tightly regulated by cellular iron levels. **Shu1 is an iron-regulated gene**, showing **high expression in iron-starved conditions** and **repression when iron is plentiful** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Genome%20profiling%20studies%20have%20revealed,integrated)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)). This pattern ensures Shu1 protein is made mainly when the cell needs to scavenge iron (e.g., when external iron is low), and is conserved resources when iron is abundant.

**Iron-responsive transcriptional control:** The regulation is mediated by the iron-sensing transcriptional repressor **Fep1**. Fep1 is a GATA-type zinc-finger protein that controls many iron-uptake genes in S. pombe. Under iron-replete conditions, active Fep1 binds GATA sequences in target promoters to shut off expression; when iron is scarce, Fep1 is inactive, allowing those genes to be transcribed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=heme%20for%20cell%20growth,Further%20analysis%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)). *shu1+* was identified in genome-wide studies as one of the Fep1-regulated genes induced upon iron depletion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Genome%20profiling%20studies%20have%20revealed,integrated)). The *shu1+* promoter contains multiple **GATA elements** (matches to 5’-(A/T)GATA(A/T)-3’), including a cluster of three sites (~120–140 bp upstream of the start codon) that conform to Fep1-binding consensus sequences ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=We%20then%20sought%20to%20identify,and%20partially%20overlapping%20these%20two)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Fep1,examine%20a%20region%20of%20the)). Promoter-reporter assays have demonstrated that these GATA motifs are essential for iron-dependent regulation: a *shu1+*–lacZ fusion containing the upstream region with intact GATA sites shows high reporter expression in low-iron and strong repression in high-iron, whereas mutation of the three GATA boxes abolishes this iron-responsive difference ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=promoter%20segment%20was%20fused%20upstream,%E2%88%92141%7D%20%28box%203%2C%20inverted)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=expression%20as%20a%20function%20of,negatively%20affect%20the%20ability%20of)). In wild-type cells, adding iron (or conversely, chelating iron) leads to ~18–30 fold changes in *shu1* mRNA levels, indicative of robust regulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=further%20determine%20whether%20Fep1%20played,results%20showed%20that%20Fep1%20is)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=promoter%20segment%20was%20fused%20upstream,%E2%88%92122%7D%20%28box%201)). In a **fep1∆ mutant**, *shu1+* mRNA becomes de-repressed: its transcript remains elevated even in iron-replete conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=further%20determine%20whether%20Fep1%20played,results%20showed%20that%20Fep1%20is)). Re-introduction of Fep1 restores iron-responsive repression of *shu1+*, confirming that Fep1 is necessary and sufficient for regulating *shu1+* in response to iron ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=further%20determine%20whether%20Fep1%20played,results%20showed%20that%20Fep1%20is)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=empty%20integrative%20vector%20exhibited%20sustained,in%20response%20to%20iron%20repletion)). Chromatin IP experiments further show Fep1 binds the *shu1+* promoter when iron is high, directly repressing the gene ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=heme%20for%20cell%20growth,Further%20analysis%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=dependent%20down,Taken%20together%2C%20results%20reported)). Thus, *shu1+* is part of the **Fep1 regulon**, behaving like other iron-uptake genes (e.g. **frp1, fio1, fip1, str1** ferric reductase and transporter genes) which are **induced in low iron and repressed by Fep1 in high iron** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=heme%20for%20cell%20growth,Further%20analysis%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron,37)). 

**Regulatory integration:** Interestingly, *shu1+* is also connected to another iron-responsive regulator, Php4, indirectly. Php4 is a CCAAT-binding factor subunit that represses iron-using genes during iron starvation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=,Google)). *shu1+* itself is *positively* regulated in iron starvation (opposite to Php4 targets), but genome studies (Mercier *et al.* 2008) noted *shu1+* induction requires Php4 in the sense that iron-starvation transcriptional responses broadly involve both activating uptake genes (via loss of Fep1 repression) and repressing iron consumption genes (via Php4) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=,Google)). However, the primary regulation of *shu1+* is through Fep1; Php4’s role may be limited to optimizing iron economy so that Shu1 and other uptake systems are effective when needed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=,Google)). There is no evidence that Php4 binds the *shu1+* promoter, so any connection is likely indirect.

Beyond iron, *shu1+* expression does not appear strongly responsive to other stimuli. It is not significantly induced by other metal stresses or by oxidative stress, except insofar as those might lower internal iron and thereby trigger the iron starvation response. One study on nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) in S. pombe examined Upf1 targets and found *shu1+* mRNA was not a significant NMD substrate ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904585/#:~:text=significantly%20upregulated%20in%20upf1%E2%88%86%20cells%2C,while%2037%20were%20downregulated)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904585/#:~:text=No%20,02)) – meaning *shu1+* transcript stability is mainly controlled by iron-dependent transcription, not by special mRNA decay pathways. Additionally, *shu1+* is not meiosis-specific or cell-cycle regulated (its transcript did not feature in lists of meiotic genes or periodic cell cycle genes). It appears to be primarily a nutrition-responsive gene.

**Expression pattern summary:** *shu1+* is **highly expressed during iron limitation**, with mRNA levels rising in minutes to hours after iron chelation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,The%20histogram)), and **virtually silent when iron is abundant**, due to Fep1 repression. This on/off expression is a common theme in iron acquisition genes to prevent iron overload and conserve energy. At the protein level, correspondingly, Shu1 is present in iron-starved cells (where it can be detected on the plasma membrane), but in iron-replete cells, *shu1+* transcription is off and any residual protein may be quickly turned over or internalized. Indeed, fluorescence microscopy showed that when cells pre-grown in low iron are shifted to high iron, Shu1-GFP (or HA-tagged Shu1) disappears from the cell surface, consistent with repression and perhaps degradation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20low%20hemin,Taken)). 

For Gene Ontology, relevant terms include **“iron-responsive element binding”** (for Fep1, not Shu1) and **“regulation of transcription by iron”** – but specifically for Shu1, we annotate **“iron ion homeostasis”**, **“response to iron ion starvation”**, and **“negative regulation by iron”** in its expression control. Experimentally, the evidence code **IDA** (direct assay) applies to the observed changes in *shu1+* mRNA under different iron conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)), and **IMP** (mutant phenotype) for the effect of fep1∆ on *shu1+* expression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=further%20determine%20whether%20Fep1%20played,results%20showed%20that%20Fep1%20is)). Together, these define *shu1+* as a **strictly iron-regulated** gene in S. pombe’s adaptive response to nutrient availability.

## Evolutionary Conservation and Homology  
Shu1 represents a relatively novel protein in fungal evolution, with a function conserved in concept (heme acquisition) but variable in molecular implementation across species. Within the **Schizosaccharomyces** genus (fission yeasts), Shu1 is likely conserved: *S. pombe* (strain 972h−) has Shu1, and its close relatives (*S. octosporus*, *S. japonicus*, *S. cryophilus*) have candidate orthologs (uncharacterized ORFs with similar cysteine patterns suggestive of a conserved role in heme uptake). This **archaeascomycete-specific presence** aligns with the finding that S. pombe, an early-diverging ascomycete, can import heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20iron,novel%20component%20for%20heme%20acquisition)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=strategies%20to%20scavenge%20it%20from,6)). By contrast, **budding yeasts (Saccharomyces clade)** do not possess an obvious Shu1 homolog. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is incapable of high-affinity heme uptake ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=may%20be%20the%20fact%20that,6)), and genome comparisons have not revealed any S. cerevisiae gene with significant similarity to *shu1+*. This suggests that the capacity for heme uptake was lost in the hemiascomycete lineage or uniquely evolved in the fission yeast lineage.

Across fungi, **functional analogs** of Shu1 do exist, although they are **not direct sequence homologs**. Pathogenic yeast like *Candida albicans* have a set of cell-surface heme-binding proteins (Rbt5, Pga7, Csa2, etc.) that fulfill a similar role in capturing heme for iron uptake ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=where%20X%20is%20any%20amino,predicted%20to%20stabilize%20the%20helical)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=Although%20Rbt5%20plays%20an%20important,of%20systemic%20infection%2C%20although%20this)). These Candida proteins belong to the CFEM protein family and share an eight-cysteine domain that is absent in Shu1. Despite the lack of sequence homology, the *function* – heme binding at the cell surface – is conserved. For example, **C. albicans Rbt5 and Pga7** are both GPI-anchored hemoproteins required for optimal heme iron utilization, analogous to Shu1’s role in S. pombe ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=Although%20Rbt5%20plays%20an%20important,of%20systemic%20infection%2C%20although%20this)). However, Shu1’s **partial CFEM-like motif** indicates it might have a convergent structural solution for heme binding. In *Cryptococcus neoformans* (a basidiomycete yeast), a secreted heme-binding protein Cig1 is required for heme uptake and virulence, and interestingly **Cig1 lacks a CFEM domain** just like Shu1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=not%20a%20member%20of%20the,albicans%20because%20Vps23%2C%20a)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=match%20at%20L970%20Cig1%20does,hemophore%20remains%20to%20be%20established)). Cig1 is rich in serines/threonines and has a GPI anchor signal; while Cig1 and Shu1 share no sequence similarity, both represent a strategy of non-CFEM, GPI-anchored hemophores in fungi. This underscores that **heme acquisition is a widely needed function** that fungi have evolved multiple times, with **Shu1 being a unique solution in fission yeasts**. 

No clear homologs of Shu1 are found in higher eukaryotes. Animals do require heme transporters (e.g., HRG1 in metazoans is a heme importer in lysosomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=acquire%20heme%20from%20the%20environment,are%20much%20less%20well%20understood)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=,are%20much%20less%20well%20understood)), FLVCR1/2 export heme in mammals), but these are membrane transport proteins with multiple transmembrane domains, entirely unrelated to fungal Shu1. Shu1 can thus be considered an **orphan protein** when it comes to standard homology searches beyond fungi – it is *Schizosaccharomyces*-specific in current databases ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/284812.Q92340#:~:text=...Your%20Input%3A%20,SPBC32H8.15)). PomBase notes Shu1 as “**Schizosaccharomyces pombe-specific protein**” ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/278312/summary/schizosaccharomyces-pombe/shu1.html#:~:text=SPAC1F8)), reflecting the lack of recognizable orthologs in distant species. 

From an evolutionary perspective, Shu1 and CFEM proteins in various fungi may have evolved from an ancestral fungal heme-binding protein but diverged. Shu1’s partial cysteine motif could be a degenerate descendant of a full CFEM domain, or it could be a lineage-specific innovation where only part of the motif was retained as sufficient for function. The **conservation of cysteine positions 72–101** among Shu1 orthologs in fission yeasts (if sequenced) would support functional conservation of the heme-binding mechanism in that clade. Meanwhile, the **divergence from CFEM** suggests that Shu1-like proteins and CFEM proteins evolved the heme-binding ability independently (or one lost cysteines relative to the other). This presents an interesting case of *analogous function with distinct domains* in fungal evolution.

In summary, Shu1 is **conserved in fission yeast species** but has **no close homolog in well-studied budding yeasts or mammals**. Its function is analogous to heme-binding proteins in other fungi (Candida Rbt5/Pga7, Cryptococcus Cig1), though the sequence and domain structure differ markedly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Cig1%20or%20CFEM2%2C%20,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=match%20at%20L970%20Cig1%20does,hemophore%20remains%20to%20be%20established)). For GO purposes, Shu1 can be linked to **fungal-type heme uptake systems**. Any annotation of homology would currently be limited to within the Schizosaccharomyces genus until further phylogenetic analysis is done.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Initial identification (transcriptomics):** *shu1+* (SPAC1F8.02c) was first flagged in global transcription studies as iron-responsive. Rustici *et al.* (2007) found it upregulated during iron depletion in S. pombe ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Genome%20profiling%20studies%20have%20revealed,integrated)), and Mercier *et al.* (2008) noted it in the set of genes controlled by iron-dependent regulators ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=,Google)). These genome-wide datasets suggested Shu1 might be part of the iron uptake machinery, prompting further investigation.

- **Gene deletion library phenotype:** The S. pombe deletion collection (Kim *et al.*, 2010) included *shu1∆*. While *shu1∆* was viable, it did not reveal strong fitness defects under standard conditions, aligning with the idea that a phenotype would appear only under specific iron/heme conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=its%20acquisition,type%20transcriptional)). This non-lethal deletion result indicated Shu1 is conditionally important rather than essential.

- **Mourer *et al.* 2015 (J. Biol. Chem. 290:10176)** – **Discovery of Shu1’s function:** This seminal study by Thierry Mourer and colleagues experimentally characterized Shu1. Key findings from this work: (1) *shu1+* transcription is induced in low iron and repressed by Fep1 in high iron, confirmed by Northern blot/RNase protection and reporter assays ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=expression%20as%20a%20function%20of,negatively%20affect%20the%20ability%20of)). (2) An epitope-tagged Shu1 localizes to the plasma membrane in iron-starved cells, as seen via fluorescence microscopy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). (3) *hem1Δ* cells (unable to synthesize heme) require Shu1 to grow when external heme is provided – providing functional proof that Shu1 enables heme uptake for growth ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)). (4) Shu1 binds heme directly: in vitro hemin–agarose pull-down assays and spectral scans demonstrated heme binding with ~2.2 µM affinity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=When%20heme%20biosynthesis%20is%20selectively,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). (5) Structure-function analysis showed the importance of the cysteine-rich region – mutation of 4 cysteines abolished heme binding and function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=%28Shu1,bind%20heme%20when%20subjected%20to)). This study concluded that **Shu1 is a novel cell-surface heme acquisition protein** in fission yeast ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Iron%20is%20an%20essential%20metal,type%20transcriptional)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)). It was the first to establish the concept of heme utilization in S. pombe, with extensive evidence: promoter analyses, mutant complementation, binding assays, and localization. For GO annotation, this paper provides **IDA evidence** for cellular component (plasma membrane), **IDA/IMP** for biological process (heme import, iron homeostasis), and **IDA** for molecular function (heme binding).

- **Mourer *et al.* 2017 (J. Biol. Chem. 292:4898)** – **Heme uptake mechanism and Abc3:** In a follow-up study, Mourer and Normant et al. explored how Shu1-mediated heme enters the cytosol. Major findings: (1) Shu1 is GPI-anchored – PI-PLC can release Shu1, and sequence analysis identified Ser^199 as the GPI anchor site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=%2825%20%29,the%20addition%20of%20a%20GPI)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=membrane,Overall%2C%20the%20predicted%20Shu1%20GPI)). (2) Live-cell imaging with a fluorescent heme analog (ZnMP) showed that in *hem1Δ* cells expressing Shu1, ZnMP is initially seen in vacuoles and later in the cytosol, whereas in *shu1Δ* cells ZnMP is not taken up ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=cleavability%20by%20PI,in%20hem1%CE%94%20abc3%CE%94%20mutant%20cells)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=biosynthesis%20is%20selectively%20blocked%20in,vacuoles%20and%20does%20not%20sequentially)). (3) High heme (hemin) conditions cause Shu1–HA to relocalize from the cell surface to vacuolar membranes, indicating **heme-triggered endocytosis of Shu1** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)). (4) Identified *Abc3+* as crucial for subsequent heme utilization: *hem1Δ abc3Δ* double mutants cannot grow on hemin, similar to *shu1Δ* phenotype ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=in%20response%20to%20low%20hemin,Taken)). ZnMP in *abc3Δ* cells got “stuck” in vacuoles, not reaching the cytosol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=encoding%20a%20vacuolar%20membrane%20transporter%2C,vacuolar%20membrane%20and%20that%20the)). (5) Abc3 protein was shown to bind heme (via hemin–agarose pull-down), and mutation of a conserved Cys-Pro motif in Abc3 abolished this binding ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=exporter%2C%20results%20with%20hemin,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)). These results established a model: Shu1 delivers heme to vacuoles, and Abc3 (an ABC transporter on vacuolar membrane) exports heme or iron out of the vacuole ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=replaced%20with%20Ala%20residues%20fails,the%20vacuole%20to%20the%20cytosol)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=cells,residues%20151%E2%80%93152)). This paper provided **direct evidence of Shu1’s internalization and interaction with the endosomal/vacuolar trafficking system**, further enriching GO annotations: *vacuolar membrane localization*, *heme transporter activity*, *endocytosis involved in iron uptake*. It also highlighted a broader network (ESCRT components, etc., in discussion) that might partake in the process, although those were inferred from analogies to Candida ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20suggested%20that,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=oxygenase%2C%20thereby%20leaving%20open%20the,as%20a%20source%20of%20iron)). The 2017 study solidified Shu1’s role and connected it to a second protein (Abc3) to complete the pathway.

- **Comparative analyses and other references:** Other literature has placed Shu1 in context. For instance, Protchenko et al. (2008) in *Eukaryot Cell* noted that S. cerevisiae lacks Shu1 but has a low-affinity porphyrin importer (Pug1) for protoporphyrin – highlighting the difference that S. pombe Shu1 is a dedicated high-affinity system ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=strategies%20to%20scavenge%20it%20from,6)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=acquisition%20from%20heme%20are%20still,6)). Kornitzer (2009) and others reviewed fungal iron uptake, referencing that **fission yeast uniquely has a heme uptake route** (likely citing unpublished observations at the time) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20iron,novel%20component%20for%20heme%20acquisition)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20This%20study%20is%20the,Archiascomycetes%20can%20acquire%20exogenous%20heme)). The conservation of CFEM heme-binding proteins in pathogenic fungi was noted by Kulkarni & Kelkar (2003) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Cig1%20or%20CFEM2%2C%20,residues%20were%20mutated%20in%20Shu1)) and others, providing background that encouraged the search for similar proteins in S. pombe. Indeed, Shu1’s discovery was influenced by in silico predictions that SPAC1F8.02c encoded a cell-surface protein, and transcriptomic hints of iron regulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Genome,type%20function)).

- **Bioinformatics and databases:** PomBase and BioGRID list Shu1 with curated data. BioGRID (ID 278312) reports a couple of interactions for Shu1, possibly including a negative genetic interaction with *hem1* (since combining *hem1Δ* and *shu1Δ* yields severe growth defect) or co-fitness interactions under specific conditions. No physical binding partners of Shu1 (besides heme) have been reported, which is expected given it likely interacts transiently with heme and possibly with components of endocytic machinery (like clathrin adaptors or ESCRT, by analogy to Candida, but these are not yet shown in S. pombe). STRING database predicts association of Shu1 with other iron-homeostasis proteins (e.g., the ferric reductase Frp1) based on co-expression ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/284812.Q92340#:~:text=,)), consistent with the idea that Shu1 functions in parallel with other iron uptake systems during iron starvation.

In conclusion, the body of evidence supporting Shu1’s annotations includes **gene expression analyses, localization studies, phenotypic assays, biochemical binding assays, and genetic interaction tests**. Together, these show that Shu1: **(a)** resides at the plasma membrane (IDA evidence from microscopy) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)), **(b)** binds heme (IDA from binding assays) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=When%20heme%20biosynthesis%20is%20selectively,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)), **(c)** is required for heme import and utilization (IMP from mutant growth phenotype) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)), **(d)** is regulated by iron via Fep1 (IMP from *fep1∆* effect on expression) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)), and **(e)** is a GPI-anchored vacuole-trafficked protein (IDA from PI-PLC and fluorescence relocation) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=showed%20that%20Shu1%20is%20released,but%20under%20high%20hemin%20concentrations)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)). These findings are well-documented in peer-reviewed literature, making Shu1 a well-supported candidate for Gene Ontology annotations in **molecular function (heme binding)**, **biological process (heme import, iron homeostasis)**, and **cellular component (external side of plasma membrane, vacuolar membrane)**. The discovery of Shu1 has expanded our understanding of how cells can acquire essential nutrients like iron from complex sources, and it stands as an interesting example of a niche-specific adaptation at the molecular level. 

**Relevant GO Terms:** Based on the above information, some GO terms appropriate for Shu1 might include: *heme binding* (GO:0020037) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=protein%20mislocalization%20because%20results%20showed,However)), *heme transporter activity* (GO:0015232) – though Shu1 acts via endocytosis rather than a pore, it facilitates heme transport into the cell ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)), *iron ion homeostasis* (GO:0055072) and *iron ion transport* (GO:0006826) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=shu1,of%20iron%20for%20cell%20growth)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=microscopic%20analyses%20revealed%20that%20HA_%7B4%7D,2%20%CE%BCm%20for)), *cellular response to iron starvation* (GO:0010106) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=iron%20availability%20,fold%29%20observed%20in%20the%20parental)), *plasma membrane, anchored component* (GO:0031225) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=Microscopic%20and%20biochemical%20analyses%20have,Although%20Shu1%20contains)), *external side of plasma membrane* (GO:0009897), *vacuolar membrane* (GO:0005774) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377804/#:~:text=within%20the%20cytoplasm%20in%20a,showed%20that%20Abc3%20binds%20to)), and *endocytosis* (GO:0006897) or *vacuolar transport* (GO:0007034) for the process of internalizing and routing heme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400333/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20suggested%20that,heme%20assimilation%20as%20well%20as)). Each of these can be supported by the cited experiments above, ensuring that the GO annotations for Shu1 are evidence-based and reflect its multifaceted role in the cell.
