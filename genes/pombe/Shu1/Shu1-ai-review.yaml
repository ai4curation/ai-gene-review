  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: Shu1 is a GPI-anchored cell surface heme receptor that enables high-affinity
  heme acquisition as an iron source during iron starvation in S. pombe. It binds
  hemin with micromolar affinity (KD ~2.2 μM) through a cysteine-rich region containing
  a partial CFEM-like motif (Cys72-Cys101). Under iron-limited conditions, Shu1 localizes
  to the plasma membrane where it captures extracellular heme, then undergoes ligand-induced
  endocytosis to deliver heme to the vacuole. This heme import pathway works in concert
  with the vacuolar ABC transporter Abc3, which exports heme or iron from the vacuole
  to the cytosol, completing the two-step heme assimilation process. Shu1 expression
  is tightly regulated by iron availability through the Fep1 repressor, ensuring it
  is produced only when cells need to scavenge iron from heme sources.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation appears to be based on inference from GO:0140488
      (heme receptor activity). While Shu1 does undergo heme-induced internalization
      from plasma membrane to vacuole, this is more accurately described as receptor-mediated
      endocytosis rather than general vesicle-mediated transport. The annotation captures
      a real aspect of Shu1 function but is somewhat generic.
