Structural Features Analysis
============================================================

JmjC Domain Structural Features:
- Position: 243-402
- Length: 160 aa
- Predicted α-helix: 15.0%
- Predicted β-sheet: 42.5%
- Predicted β-strands: 12
- Hydrophobic core: 40.6%

Key Observations:
1. Epe1 likely maintains the JmjC fold structure
2. HVD motif detected - deviates from canonical HXD
3. Histidine positions suggest altered metal coordination
4. Structure retained but catalytic activity lost
5. Functions as a pseudo-enzyme/structural scaffold
