JmjC Domain Analysis Results
============================================================

Epe1 JmjC Domain Features:
- Domain location: 200-350
- HXD motifs found: 1
  - Position 280: HVD
- HXE motifs found: 1
  - Position 297: HIE
- Total histidines in domain: 2

Analysis Results:
- Found atypical HVD motif at position 280
- Valine (V) is hydrophobic and bulky, incompatible with Fe(II) coordination
- This substitution likely abolishes catalytic activity
