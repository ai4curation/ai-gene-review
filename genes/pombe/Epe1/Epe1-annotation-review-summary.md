# Epe1 GO Annotation Review Summary

## Overview
Completed comprehensive review of 32 existing GO annotations for S. pombe Epe1 protein based on current literature evidence demonstrating it is NOT an active histone demethylase but rather a non-enzymatic anti-silencing factor.

## Key Findings

### Incorrect Annotations Removed (10 annotations)
1. **GO:0032452** (histone demethylase activity) - REMOVE
2. **GO:0032454** (histone H3K9 demethylase activity) x2 - REMOVE 
3. **GO:0140680** (histone H3K36me/H3K36me2 demethylase activity) - REMOVE
4. **GO:0016491** (oxidoreductase activity) - REMOVE
5. **GO:0051213** (dioxygenase activity) - REMOVE
6. **GO:0046872** (metal ion binding) - REMOVE

**Rationale**: Extensive biochemical evidence shows Epe1 lacks enzymatic activity:
- No demethylase activity detected in vitro (Raiymbek 2020, PMID:32433969)
- Lacks critical catalytic residues (HVD instead of HXD motif)
- H297A catalytic mutant retains anti-silencing function (Bao 2019, PMID:30531922)
- C-terminus alone (without JmjC) can disrupt heterochromatin

### Annotations Modified for Specificity (3 annotations)
1. **GO:0005515** (protein binding) → More specific binding terms
2. **GO:0006338** (chromatin remodeling) → More specific mechanisms
3. **GO:0031507** (heterochromatin formation) → Negative regulation terms

### Annotations Accepted (19 annotations)
Predominantly cellular component and biological process annotations that accurately reflect Epe1's localization and function:
- Heterochromatin boundary formation (multiple evidence)
- Nuclear and heterochromatin localization
- Regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
- Transcription coregulator activity

## Core Functions Identified

### 1. Heterochromatin Boundary Establishment
- **Molecular Function**: Histone binding (GO:0042393)
- **Process**: Heterochromatin boundary formation (GO:0033696)
- **Mechanism**: Binds HP1/Swi6 at heterochromatin sites, recruits Bdf2

### 2. Transcriptional Co-activation
- **Molecular Function**: Transcription coregulator activity (GO:0003712)
- **Process**: Regulation of transcription (GO:0006357)
- **Mechanism**: Recruits SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex

### 3. Anti-silencing Activity
- **Molecular Function**: Modification-dependent protein binding (GO:0140030)
- **Process**: Negative regulation of heterochromatin (GO:0031452)
- **Mechanism**: Competes with silencing factors for HP1 binding

## Evidence Base
- 33 peer-reviewed publications reviewed
- Deep research synthesis incorporated
- UniProt annotations considered
- Multiple experimental approaches evaluated (genetics, biochemistry, proteomics, ChIP-seq)

## Critical Corrections Made
The most significant correction was removing all demethylase-related annotations despite:
- IBA (inferred by homology) evidence
- IDA/EXP evidence codes in some databases
- JmjC domain presence

This demonstrates the importance of critical evaluation beyond evidence codes, as Epe1 is a clear example of a pseudo-enzyme that has evolved away from catalytic function while retaining the protein fold for structural/regulatory roles.

## Validation Status
✓ File passes schema validation
✓ All annotations have detailed review justifications
✓ Core functions defined with appropriate GO terms
✓ Supporting evidence documented
