description: Epe1 is a JmjC domain-containing protein that functions as a non-enzymatic
  anti-silencing factor in fission yeast. Despite having a JmjC domain typically associated
  with histone demethylases, Epe1 lacks catalytic activity due to degenerate active
  site residues. It maintains heterochromatin boundaries by binding HP1/Swi6, recruiting
  the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex and Bdf2 bromodomain protein, and promoting
  nucleosome turnover at heterochromatin sites. Epe1 prevents excessive heterochromatin
  spreading while paradoxically enabling RNAi-mediated silencing by promoting transcription
  of repetitive elements.

    label: histone demethylase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation is incorrect. Epe1 lacks critical catalytic residues
      for demethylase activity (has HVD instead of HXD motif) and shows no detectable
      demethylase activity in vitro despite extensive testing (Raiymbek 2020). The
      protein functions as a non-enzymatic anti-silencing factor that recruits SAGA
      histone acetyltransferase complex and Bdf2 bromodomain protein to heterochromatin
      boundaries.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Strong biochemical evidence demonstrates Epe1 lacks demethylase activity.
      Mass spectrometry assays using purified Epe1 with methylated H3K9 peptides showed
      no detectable removal of methyl groups, even with HP1/Swi6 present. The JmjC
      domain lacks conserved Fe(II)-binding residues essential for catalysis. Epe1
      H297A catalytic mutant retains anti-silencing function, demonstrating demethylase
      activity is not required for its biological role (Bao 2019). The C-terminus
      alone (without JmjC) can disrupt heterochromatin (Raiymbek 2020).

  review:
    summary: Epe1 does participate in chromatin remodeling through recruitment of
      the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex and promotion of nucleosome turnover
      at heterochromatin boundaries. However, this term is quite broad and less specific
      than the actual molecular mechanisms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While Epe1 does affect chromatin structure, more specific terms better
      describe its function. It recruits SAGA complex for histone acetylation (Bao
      2019) and promotes nucleosome turnover at heterochromatin sites. The broad chromatin
      remodeling term obscures the specific mechanisms.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: No dioxygenase activity detected in any biochemical assay. The JmjC domain
      has evolved away from catalytic function - lacks Fe(II) coordination, has Y307
      instead of catalytic histidine. Functions as a structural scaffold for protein

    summary: Epe1 prevents formation of ectopic heterochromatin islands in euchromatic
      regions. Its absence leads to H3K9me islands.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Studies show epe1Δ mutants accumulate aberrant small islands of H3K9me
      across euchromatic regions. Epe1 normally prevents these ectopic heterochromatin
      formations. When present at existing islands, it can promote their dissolution
      through SAGA recruitment and competitive HP1 binding.

  review:
    summary: Epe1 regulates facultative heterochromatin formation that can occur independently
      of the RNAi pathway, preventing excessive silencing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The cited study shows Epe1 regulates RNA elimination machinery-dependent
      facultative heterochromatin. In epe1 mutants, heterochromatin can form and be
      maintained without RNAi, demonstrating Epe1 normally prevents RNAi-independent
      silencing. This is consistent with its anti-silencing role.

  review:
    summary: Duplicate incorrect annotation. No direct biochemical evidence for H3K9
      demethylase activity exists. The paper shows genetic evidence only.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is a duplicate of the previous H3K9 demethylase annotation with different
      evidence code. The EXP code is inappropriate as no biochemical demethylase activity
      was demonstrated. The paper shows genetic suppression of H3K9me inheritance
      by Epe1, not enzymatic activity. Epe1 antagonizes H3K9me through non-catalytic
      mechanisms.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The Sorida 2019 paper demonstrates Epe1 regulates ectopic heterochromatin
      and maintains boundaries. Loss of Epe1 allows heterochromatin spreading and
      formation of new silenced domains. This boundary function is central to Epe1

  review:
    summary: Epe1 enables transcription of tandem repeats that generate RNAi substrates
      for heterochromatin formation, paradoxically promoting RNAi-mediated silencing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Recent study shows Epe1 is required for efficient transcription of tandemly
      repeated genes that trigger RNAi-dependent heterochromatin. By locally destabilizing
      heterochromatin to allow transcription, Epe1 enables production of RNAi substrates
      that reinforce silencing. This represents a regulatory feedback mechanism.
