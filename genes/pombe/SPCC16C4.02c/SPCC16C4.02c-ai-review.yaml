  id: NCBITaxon:284812
  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: Uncharacterized protein orthologous to human neurochondrin (NCDN). Contains
  a DUF1941 domain and appears to function as a scaffolding protein. Interacts with
  proteins involved in spindle pole body organization, cortical microtubule anchoring,
  and cellular aging processes. Non-essential for viability under standard laboratory
  conditions.
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0003674
    label: molecular_function
  evidence_type: ND
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: Root molecular function term with ND evidence indicates no specific molecular
      function has been experimentally determined. Based on protein-protein interaction
      data and orthology to neurochondrin, this protein likely has protein binding
      activity as a scaffolding protein, but this requires experimental validation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Root terms with ND evidence should be removed as they provide no functional
      information.
- term:
    id: GO:0008150
    label: biological_process
  evidence_type: ND
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: Root biological process term with ND evidence indicates no specific biological
      process has been experimentally determined. Protein interactions suggest involvement
      in spindle pole body organization, cortical microtubule anchoring, and cellular
      aging, but these require experimental validation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Root terms with ND evidence should be removed as they provide no functional
      information.

    label: nucleus
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16823372
  review:
    summary: Nuclear localization assigned based on high-throughput data (HDA). However,
      deep research indicates this protein is likely cytoplasmic based on orthology
      to human neurochondrin and predicted lack of nuclear localization signals. The
      HDA evidence may reflect transient nuclear association or experimental artifacts.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Conflicting with expected cytoplasmic localization based on orthology
      and domain analysis. HDA evidence alone is insufficient for confident localization
      assignment.
- term:
    id: GO:0032153
    label: cell division site
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16823372
  review:
    summary: Cell division site localization based on high-throughput data. This annotation
      is plausible given the protein interacts with Sfi1 (spindle pole body component)
      and may have roles in cell division-related processes. However, HDA evidence
      alone is not definitive.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Possible but not definitively established localization. May reflect transient
      association during cell division phases.
- term:
    id: GO:0044732
    label: mitotic spindle pole body
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16823372
  review:
    summary: Spindle pole body localization based on high-throughput data. This is
      supported by protein-protein interaction with Sfi1, a core spindle pole body
      component involved in SPB duplication. The localization may be cell cycle-dependent
      or represent a subset of the protein population.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Supported by interaction data with SPB component Sfi1, suggesting possible
      transient or partial association with spindle pole body structures.

    id: GO:0060090
    label: molecular adaptor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  review:
    summary: molecular adaptor activity identified from core_functions analysis
    action: NEW
    reason: This molecular function term is used in core_functions but was not in
      existing annotations. Adding as NEW annotation based on core function analysis.
