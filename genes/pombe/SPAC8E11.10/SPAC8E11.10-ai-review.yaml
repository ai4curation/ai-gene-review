description: 'Sorbose reductase enzyme belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family that catalyzes the NADP(H)-dependent reduction of L-sorbose to D-glucitol (sorbitol). Functions in alternative carbon source metabolism, enabling utilization of L-sorbose when present. The enzyme is likely cytosolic and represents a conserved metabolic capability for polyol interconversion in fission yeast.'

    label: oxidoreductase activity, acting on the CH-OH group of donors, NAD or NADP
      as acceptor
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This IBA annotation correctly identifies the core enzymatic function of sou1 as an oxidoreductase acting on CH-OH groups with NAD(P) as acceptor. The deep research confirms sou1 is an SDR family enzyme that specifically catalyzes sorbose-to-sorbitol reduction using NADPH. UniProt (Q9Y6Z9) explicitly states this catalytic activity. While accurate, a more specific term like "sorbose reductase activity" (GO:0032115) would be more informative.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The IBA annotation is biochemically accurate based on phylogenetic inference and aligns with the characterized function. The deep research states that S. pombe Sou1 "catalyzes the NADP(H)-dependent reduction of L-sorbose to D-glucitol (sorbitol)" and UniProt confirms "Catalyzes the NADP dependent reduction of L-sorbose to D-glucitol." This GO term correctly captures the oxidoreductase mechanism acting on alcohol groups, though GO:0032115 would be more specific.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'This broad IEA annotation is correct but non-specific. The deep research confirms sou1 is involved in carbohydrate metabolism, specifically "sorbose metabolic process" and "fructose and mannose metabolism pathway." The enzyme converts the ketohexose L-sorbose to the sugar alcohol D-sorbitol, clearly placing it within carbohydrate metabolism.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'While accurate, this term is very general. The deep research provides evidence for more specific processes like "sorbose metabolic process (GO:0019311)" which would be more informative. However, the annotation is not incorrect - sorbose/sorbitol interconversion is definitively a carbohydrate metabolic process. Accepting as a valid but broad categorization.'

  review:
    summary: 'This very broad IEA annotation is technically correct but provides minimal information. Sou1 is indeed an oxidoreductase, specifically a sorbose reductase (EC 1.1.1.289) that catalyzes redox reactions. However, this parent term is too general when more specific child terms like GO:0032115 (sorbose reductase activity) exist.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'While factually correct based on UniProt keyword mapping, this annotation lacks specificity. The deep research and UniProt both identify the enzyme as EC 1.1.1.289 (sorbose reductase), and more specific GO terms exist. However, the annotation is not wrong - just uninformatively broad.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is the most specific and accurate molecular function annotation for sou1.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The annotation is factually correct as sorbose (MW ~180) and sorbitol (MW ~182) are small molecules.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'This IEA annotation appears to be incorrect. Sou1 is a sorbose reductase that acts on sorbose/sorbitol, not a mannitol dehydrogenase. UniProt clearly identifies it as "Sorbose reductase" (EC 1.1.1.289), not mannitol dehydrogenase. The deep research provides no evidence for mannitol metabolism. This is likely a misannotation from automated prediction.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'Multiple lines of evidence contradict this annotation. UniProt explicitly names the enzyme "Sorbose reductase sou1" with EC 1.1.1.289, which is specific for sorbose/sorbitol interconversion, not mannitol. The deep research states the enzyme "specifically catalyzes the reversible reaction between L-sorbose and D-sorbitol" with no mention of mannitol activity. Mannitol and sorbitol are different sugar alcohols (epimers at C2), and the enzyme specificity is for sorbitol, not mannitol. This appears to be an incorrect automated annotation.'

    label: mitochondrion
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16823372
  review:
    summary: 'This HDA annotation from a large-scale localization study is likely incorrect. The cited study tagged 4,431 proteins (~90% of the proteome) with YFP and may have false positives. Sou1 lacks signal peptides or transmembrane domains, and sugar-metabolizing SDR enzymes are typically cytosolic. The deep research notes "global localization surveys in yeast have not flagged Sou1 as part of an organellar proteome" and states localization is "likely cytosolic."'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'Multiple lines of evidence suggest cytosolic, not mitochondrial, localization. First, the protein lacks any recognizable signal peptide or transmembrane domains per UniProt. Second, the deep research explicitly states "No direct localization studies have been published for Sou1 in S. pombe, but its features suggest a cytosolic localization." Third, orthologous sorbose reductases in other organisms are cytosolic. Fourth, NADPH (the required cofactor) is predominantly generated in the cytosol via the pentose phosphate pathway. The HDA evidence comes from a massive proteome-wide screen that likely has false positives. The biological context strongly supports cytosolic over mitochondrial localization.'
