description: Essential component of the GPI-anchor transamidase complex (GPIT) 
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. Catalyzes the terminal step of GPI anchor 
  attachment by facilitating the transfer of preassembled GPI glycolipids to 
  specific proteins at their C-terminal GPI-anchor signal sequence. Contains a 
  luminal domain homologous to M28 family metallopeptidases that is critical for
  the transamidation reaction. The multi-pass transmembrane protein anchors the 
  complex in the ER membrane and positions the catalytic machinery for GPI 
  attachment.
