  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: Uncharacterized protein identified through proteogenomic screening, named
  for its altered transcript levels during meiosis. tam10 is a sequence orphan with
  no identifiable protein domains or orthologs outside the fission yeast lineage.
  Despite meiotic upregulation, deletion mutants show no phenotype under standard
  conditions, suggesting a subtle, condition-specific, or redundant function.

    label: biological_process
  evidence_type: ND
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: This is a root biological process term with ND (No Data) evidence, used
      as a placeholder when no specific biological process is known. This annotation
      accurately reflects the current state of knowledge for tam10, which has no experimentally
      determined biological function despite being identified as having altered meiotic
      expression [PMID:21270388]. The meiotic expression change alone is insufficient
      to assign a specific biological process without functional data.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The ND annotation for biological_process is appropriate given the complete
      lack of functional characterization. While tam10 shows differential expression
      during meiosis [PMID:21270388], this correlative observation does not justify
      assignment to meiotic processes without direct functional evidence. The deletion
      phenotype shows no defects in growth, viability, or sporulation, consistent
      with unknown function.

    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: ISO
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: This RNA binding annotation is based on orthology transfer (ISO) from
      human KNOP1 (UniProtKB:Q1ED39). However, bioinformatics analysis reveals only
      16.7% sequence identity between tam10 and KNOP1, well below orthology thresholds.
      tam10 is described as a "sequence orphan" with no clear orthologs [PMID:21270388],
      making orthology-based transfer invalid. The similarity appears to be compositional
      (both lysine-rich) rather than evolutionary.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The ISO evidence is invalid because tam10 has no established orthologs.
      Bitton et al. (2011) classified tam10 and similar genes as having no detectable
      conservation even in other fungi. Our bioinformatics analysis confirms only
      16.7% identity to KNOP1, far below typical ortholog thresholds (>25-30%). The
      proteins share compositional features (high lysine content) but lack sequence
      homology. The ISO annotation appears to be an error based on superficial similarity
      rather than true orthology.

        Only 50 non-gap positions align between the proteins. The ISO annotation linking
        tam10 to KNOP1 appears to be INCORRECT
    - reference_id: file:pombe/tam10/tam10-deep-research.md
      supporting_text: Tam10 is poorly conserved across species... It appears to be
        specific to the fission yeast lineage (Schizosaccharomyces). Notably, no homolog
        of Tam10 exists in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or in higher
        eukaryotes

    label: nucleolus
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: This nucleolus localization annotation is based on sequence similarity
      (ISS) to human KNOP1 (UniProtKB:Q1ED39). However, our analysis shows tam10 has
      only 16.7% identity to KNOP1, insufficient for reliable similarity-based inference.
      tam10 lacks any recognizable domains, targeting signals, or valid orthologs
      that would support this localization transfer.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The ISS evidence is unfounded as tam10 has minimal sequence similarity
      to KNOP1 (16.7% identity). Bitton et al. (2011) found no conserved domains or
      motifs in tam10. The similarity to KNOP1 appears to be compositional (both lysine-rich)
      rather than based on conserved localization signals. Without valid sequence
      similarity or experimental data, this nucleolar annotation is speculative. The
      subcellular localization of tam10 remains completely unknown.
