description: 'Uncharacterized protein identified through proteogenomic screening, named for its altered transcript levels during meiosis. tam10 is a sequence orphan with no identifiable protein domains or orthologs outside the fission yeast lineage. Despite meiotic upregulation, deletion mutants show no phenotype under standard conditions, suggesting a subtle, condition-specific, or redundant function.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: 'This is a root biological process term with ND (No Data) evidence, used as a placeholder when no specific biological process is known. This annotation accurately reflects the current state of knowledge for tam10, which has no experimentally determined biological function despite being identified as having altered meiotic expression [PMID:21270388]. The meiotic expression change alone is insufficient to assign a specific biological process without functional data.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The ND annotation for biological_process is appropriate given the complete lack of functional characterization. While tam10 shows differential expression during meiosis [PMID:21270388], this correlative observation does not justify assignment to meiotic processes without direct functional evidence. The deletion phenotype shows no defects in growth, viability, or sporulation, consistent with unknown function.'

    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: ISO
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'This RNA binding annotation is based on orthology transfer (ISO) via GO_REF:0000024, likely due to the presence of a SMAP domain (PF15477). However, tam10 is described as a "sequence orphan" with no clear orthologs [PMID:21270388], making orthology-based transfer questionable. While SMAP/SmAP proteins in archaea bind RNA, the SMAP domain assignment itself lacks strong support given tam10 has "no identifiable protein domains" according to the primary literature.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The ISO evidence is invalid because tam10 has no established orthologs - it is explicitly described as a "sequence orphan" specific to the fission yeast lineage with no homologs in other fungi or model organisms [PMID:21270388]. The SMAP domain annotation appears to be a weak computational prediction that conflicts with the experimental finding that tam10 has "no known conserved motifs or domains". Bioinformatics analysis confirms no RNA-binding motifs and shows the putative SMAP region has atypical positive charge. Without valid orthologs or experimental RNA binding evidence, this annotation represents an over-interpretation.'

    label: nucleolus
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'This nucleolus localization annotation is based on sequence similarity (ISS) via GO_REF:0000024, but tam10 lacks any recognizable domains, targeting signals, or orthologs that would support this inference. No experimental localization data exists, and the protein has no predicted nuclear localization signals or nucleolar targeting sequences. The basis for this similarity-based transfer is unclear given tam10 is a sequence orphan.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The ISS evidence lacks foundation as tam10 has no sequence similarity to characterized proteins - it is explicitly a "sequence orphan" with no domains or motifs [PMID:21270388]. Without identifiable sequence features that would justify similarity-based localization inference, and lacking any experimental localization data, this annotation appears to be erroneous. Bioinformatics analysis shows 60-70% disorder and no nuclear localization signals. The subcellular localization of tam10 remains completely unknown.'
