# Bioinformatics Analysis Results for tam10 (SPBC14C8.19)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed on the S. pombe tam10 protein (UniProt: G2TRQ9), a 166-amino acid sequence orphan with no known orthologs. The analysis aimed to characterize this protein computationally, given the lack of experimental structural data and the absence of identifiable protein domains through standard homology searches.

## Key Findings

### 1. Basic Sequence Properties

**Physicochemical Characteristics:**
- **Molecular Weight:** 18,866 Da
- **Isoelectric Point (pI):** 10.02 (highly basic)
- **Instability Index:** 42.89 (classified as unstable in vitro)
- **GRAVY:** -1.32 (highly hydrophilic)
- **Aromaticity:** 0.042 (low aromatic content)

**Residue Composition:**
- **Basic residues (K,R,H):** 45 residues (27.1%) - exceptionally high
- **Acidic residues (D,E):** 20 residues (12.0%)
- **Net charge at pH 7:** +25 (highly positive)
- **Charged residues:** 65 total (39.2%) - unusually high
- **Hydrophobic residues:** 43 (25.9%) - relatively low

**Notable Features:**
- Lysine-rich: 20.5% of sequence is lysine (34 K residues)
- Serine-rich: 12.7% of sequence is serine (21 S residues)
- Complete absence of cysteine (no disulfide bonds possible)
- Low aromatic content (only 7 aromatic residues total)

### 2. Secondary Structure Prediction

**Consensus Structure Composition:**
- **Alpha helix:** 49.4% (82 residues)
- **Beta sheet:** 7.8% (13 residues)  
- **Turn:** 39.8% (66 residues)
- **Coil/Loop:** 3.0% (5 residues)

**Key Structural Elements:**
- **Major helix:** Positions 27-59 (33 residues) - central region
- **C-terminal helix:** Positions 141-151 (11 residues)
- **Multiple short helices:** Scattered throughout
- **High turn content:** Particularly in N-terminus (1-9) and multiple internal regions

The high proportion of turns and helices with minimal beta sheet content suggests a largely helical protein with significant flexibility.

### 3. Disorder Prediction

**Disordered Regions Identified:**
- **Region 1:** Positions 15-74 (disorder score: 0.67) - encompasses most of N-terminal half
- **Region 2:** Positions 70-100 (disorder score: 0.53) - central region
- **Region 3:** Positions 116-156 (disorder score: 0.80) - C-terminal region

**Interpretation:**
- Approximately 60-70% of the protein is predicted to be intrinsically disordered
- High disorder correlates with the abundance of K, S, and E residues
- The disorder profile is consistent with a regulatory or scaffolding protein

### 4. Motif and Pattern Analysis

**Identified Patterns:**
- **PEST region:** Position 127-131 (ESSPS) - potential degradation signal
- **Multiple coiled-coil heptad patterns:** Despite patterns detected, no significant extended coiled-coil regions formed
- **Repetitive elements:**
  - SSK repeat (3 occurrences)
  - KKL repeat (3 occurrences)
- **No classical protein domains detected**

### 5. SMAP Domain Analysis

Despite UniProt annotation suggesting a SMAP domain (PF15477), our analysis reveals:

**Top Candidate Region:** Positions 10-69
- **SMAP similarity score:** 4/5
- **Features supporting SMAP:**
  - Appropriate length (60 aa)
  - Contains acidic residues (16.7%)
  - Lacks cysteine
  - Contains D-X(2-4)-[DE] motif
- **Features against typical SMAP:**
  - Net positive charge (+13) rather than acidic
  - Very high basic residue content (38.3%)
  - Flanked by disordered regions

**Conclusion on SMAP domain:**
The putative SMAP domain region (10-69) shows some SMAP-like characteristics but has an atypical charge distribution. The high positive charge is inconsistent with classical SMAP domains, which are typically acidic. This may represent either:
1. A highly divergent or novel SMAP variant
2. A misannotation in UniProt
3. A different type of domain with superficial SMAP similarity

### 6. Coiled-Coil Analysis

**UniProt Annotation Review:**
UniProt suggests coiled-coil regions, but our analysis found:
- Multiple short heptad patterns identified
- No extended coiled-coil regions detected (threshold not met)
- Patterns too short or interrupted to form stable coiled-coils

This discrepancy suggests the UniProt coiled-coil annotation may be based on sequence patterns alone rather than structural propensity.

### 7. Functional Implications

Based on the computational analysis:

**Likely Properties:**
1. **Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP):** High disorder content (60-70%)
2. **Basic protein:** May interact with nucleic acids or acidic proteins
3. **Regulatory/scaffolding function:** Disorder and charge distribution suggest protein-protein interactions
4. **Unstable in isolation:** High instability index suggests requirement for binding partners
5. **Nuclear localization possible:** Multiple basic clusters could function as NLS

**Unlikely Properties:**
1. **Enzymatic function:** Lack of conserved domains or catalytic motifs
2. **Structural protein:** Too much disorder for stable structure
3. **Classical SMAP domain:** Charge properties inconsistent

## Methodological Notes

### Tools and Methods Used:
1. **Basic analysis:** BioPython ProtParam for physicochemical properties
2. **Secondary structure:** Chou-Fasman and GOR consensus methods
3. **Disorder prediction:** Composition-based method using disorder-promoting residues
4. **Motif search:** Regular expression patterns for known motifs
5. **Coiled-coil:** Heptad repeat pattern scoring
6. **SMAP analysis:** Custom scoring based on SMAP characteristics

### Limitations:
- No homology-based methods possible (sequence orphan)
- Predictions based on sequence composition may be less accurate for orphan proteins
- Lack of experimental validation
- Simple prediction methods used (more sophisticated tools require external servers)

## Conclusions

tam10 appears to be a highly basic, intrinsically disordered protein with no clear homologs or well-defined domains. The computational analysis suggests:

1. **The protein is largely unstructured** with ~50% predicted helical content that may be transient
2. **The putative SMAP domain annotation is questionable** - the region has atypical properties for SMAP
3. **The coiled-coil annotation is not strongly supported** - only short patterns detected
4. **High positive charge and disorder** suggest regulatory or scaffolding functions
5. **The PEST motif** indicates potential for regulated degradation

The lack of phenotype upon deletion, combined with these structural features, suggests tam10 may function redundantly with other proteins or have condition-specific roles (e.g., during meiosis where it shows differential expression).
