Notes:
------
- SMAP domains are typically 50-60 aa regions
- They often contain acidic residues but can have mixed charge
- The scoring system considers multiple factors including charge, hydrophobicity, and presence of characteristic residues
- A higher score suggests more SMAP-like characteristics, but experimental validation would be needed for confirmation
