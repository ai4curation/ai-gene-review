**Gene Function and Mechanism:** The **tam10** gene (systematic ID *SPBC14C8.19*) of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* encodes an **uncharacterized protein** with no known enzymatic function or pathway. It was identified in a proteogenomic screen as one of 14 novel genes whose **transcripts are altered during meiosis**, hence the “tam” (transcript altered in meiosis) designation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=Additional%20Genes%20Required%20for%20Growth,pombe%20counterpart%20of%20a%20novel)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)). To date, **no specific molecular function** has been ascribed to Tam10. Its sequence reveals **no known conserved motifs or domains**, classifying it as a “sequence orphan” with no obvious homology to characterized proteins ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). Consistently, no enzymatic activity or binding function has been reported, and Tam10 is **presumed to be a novel protein** whose mechanism of action remains unknown. Functional screens suggest that deleting *tam10* does not abolish cell viability or cause overt growth defects ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)), indicating it is **non-essential** under laboratory conditions. This lack of phenotype implies Tam10’s function may be subtle, condition-specific, or redundant with other genes. In summary, Tam10’s molecular role is currently undefined, and it likely represents a **previously unstudied protein** awaiting further experimental characterization ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)).  

**Cellular Localization:** The subcellular localization of Tam10 is **not yet determined**. No localization studies (e.g. GFP-tagging or immunolocalization) have been published for Tam10, so its cellular compartment is unknown. Since the protein lacks recognizable targeting signals (e.g. no predicted transmembrane helices or organelle-specific motifs) and has no known domains ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)), it provides no clear clues for localization. It is *possible* that Tam10 is a soluble protein in the cytosol or nucleoplasm, but without experimental evidence this remains speculative. Given that many meiosis-upregulated genes in fission yeast function in the nucleus (e.g. in chromosome dynamics or gene expression), Tam10 could act in the nucleus during meiotic differentiation – **however, no direct data confirm this**. Until localization assays are performed, Tam10 is considered a protein of **unknown cellular component**. (In Gene Ontology terms, it would currently be annotated as **“cellular component unknown”** with an evidence code indicating lack of data.)

**Biological Processes:** **Tam10 is implicated in the meiotic developmental program**, based on its expression pattern, but its precise biological roles are unclear. Bitton *et al.* (2011) noted that *tam10* mRNA levels fluctuate significantly during meiosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)), suggesting Tam10 may have some function in **sexual differentiation or meiotic progression**. Apart from this correlation, no direct process has been assigned. Deletion of *tam10* did not produce a noticeable phenotype in vegetative growth ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)), such as cell shape changes or cell cycle arrest, indicating it is not required for routine mitotic cell division. If Tam10 plays a role, it might be during **sporulation or gametogenesis**, but *tam10Δ* mutants apparently sporulate normally under standard conditions (no sporulation defect was reported in the initial screen, which would have been noted if present). Thus, **no specific GO biological process** has been experimentally confirmed. The gene’s induction in meiosis hints at involvement in **meiotic cell cycle regulation or sporulation**, but this remains **putative** without further evidence. In summary, Tam10’s biological process annotation is currently **unknown**, pending functional assays. Curators have not linked Tam10 to any particular pathway or process beyond noting its meiosis-associated expression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)).

**Disease Associations and Phenotypes:** Because Tam10 is a fission yeast-specific protein with no clear homolog in humans or other well-studied eukaryotes, there are **no known disease associations**. Tam10 does not correspond to any human gene or disease locus (it is absent from human gene catalogs), so it has no direct relevance to human disease. In *S. pombe*, the **phenotype of tam10 deletion is mild**: cells lacking *tam10* are viable and do not show obvious defects under normal laboratory conditions ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)). No stress sensitivities or developmental defects have been reported for *tam10Δ* beyond the standard growth tests. Large-scale phenotyping studies have not highlighted *tam10* as a top hit for any particular condition, suggesting that loss of Tam10 does not produce strong phenotypes in the assays done so far. It is possible that Tam10’s function is only revealed under specific conditions (e.g. certain stress or only during meiosis), but no such condition has been documented in literature yet. Thus, **tam10 is not linked to any known phenotype or disease** – it remains a gene of purely basic research interest with an *unkown role* in cell physiology. 

**Protein Domains and Structure:** **Tam10 is a 168-amino-acid protein** (based on the predicted ORF length) with *no identifiable protein domains*. The augmented genome annotation project explicitly noted Tam10 as a “sequence orphan,” meaning its sequence did **not match any Pfam domains or known protein families** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). Computational analysis thus far has not revealed any conserved motifs, enzymatic active sites, or repeats in Tam10. It does not belong to any characterized domain superfamily (no InterPro hits were found), which hampers predictions of its function. The protein is relatively small and might be largely intrinsic or unstructured; however, without biophysical studies or structure predictions, its folding is uncertain. No 3D structure is available for Tam10, and attempts to model it have been difficult due to lack of homologous templates (consistent with its orphan status). Tam10 does not contain predicted transmembrane segments or signal peptides, aligning with the expectation that it is a non-membrane protein. In summary, Tam10’s **primary structure is unique**, with **no known domains**, and this novelty is a main reason why its function remains elusive ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). Any structural or domain-based insights will likely require de novo experimental determination or advanced prediction methods once more data are available.

**Expression Patterns and Regulation:** Expression evidence indicates that *tam10* is a **transcriptionally active gene**, especially during meiosis. Bitton *et al.* confirmed *tam10* is transcribed, detecting its mRNA by RT-PCR and RNA sequencing ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=We%20next%20sought%20to%20confirm,gene%20architecture%20of%2033%20predicted)). In vegetative (mitotically growing) cells, *tam10* shows baseline expression (it was among the novel ORFs with detected transcripts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=We%20next%20sought%20to%20confirm,Using%205%E2%80%B2%20and))), but it drew attention for its **dynamic regulation in meiosis**. During a synchronized meiotic time-course (using a temperature-induced pat1 meiosis), *tam10* transcript levels changed significantly, making it one of 14 newly discovered genes with **differential expression in meiosis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)). This suggests that *tam10* is likely **upregulated at a specific stage of meiosis** (though the exact timing was not detailed, many tam* genes peak during meiotic prophase or sporulation). Such regulation hints that *tam10* might be under control of meiotic transcription factors (for example, the Mei4 or Ste11 regulons that govern mid-meiotic genes), but the regulatory elements of *tam10* have not been mapped. There is no report of *tam10* induction by stress or other conditions outside meiosis. High-throughput RNA-seq data (e.g. Monaghan et al. or Marguerat et al. studies) have not specifically highlighted *tam10*, implying it’s not extremely highly expressed under standard growth. Taken together, *tam10* expression is **low or moderate during vegetative growth** and then **transiently elevated during meiosis**, fitting a pattern of a meiosis-specific or sexual development gene ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)). Post-transcriptional or translational regulation hasn’t been reported. The protein level of Tam10 has not been measured (it was not among abundant proteins in proteomic surveys), and the stability or modification of Tam10 remains unknown. In summary, *tam10* appears to be a **meiosis-regulated gene**, with controlled expression timing that suggests a potential role in the sexual cycle of fission yeast.

**Evolutionary Conservation:** **Tam10 is poorly conserved across species.** In the study that identified it, Tam10 had no clear orthologs in the genomes of other fungi examined, hence its classification as a novel, orphan protein ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). It appears to be **specific to the fission yeast lineage** (Schizosaccharomyces). Notably, no homolog of Tam10 exists in the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* or in higher eukaryotes – searches in standard databases did not find significant similarity to any known protein in those organisms. It is possible that very closely related species (such as *S. octosporus, S. cryophilus,* or *S. japonicus*) encode weakly diverged Tam10 equivalents, but if so, they were not obvious from comparative genomics ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). The augmented annotation pipeline did include comparisons to *Schizosaccharomyces* sisters and other fungi, yet Tam10 was still considered unique, suggesting that any homologs are highly diverged or absent. Indeed, among the new genes, some were labeled “conserved eukaryotic” or “conserved fungal,” whereas Tam10 remained “sequence orphan,” implying **no detectable conservation even in other fungi** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=CG%20and%20PF%20%20,NA)). Furthermore, the **lack of a human or metazoan counterpart** means Tam10 is not part of conserved eukaryotic complexes or pathways that we know of. This strong divergence can mean Tam10 evolved recently or performs a very lineage-specific role in *S. pombe*. Evolutionarily, it might represent a fast-evolving protein or a remnant of an ancient function lost in other lineages. Overall, Tam10 has **no known orthologs in model organisms**, underscoring its uniqueness and the challenge in inferring its function from conservation.

**Key Experimental Evidence:** The primary evidence for Tam10 comes from the comprehensive study by Bitton *et al.* (2011) which re-annotated the *S. pombe* genome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=Genome%20annotation%20is%20a%20synthesis,Expression%20levels%20of%2014%20transcripts)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=the%20Schizosaccharomyces%20pombe%20genome%20that,The%20popularity%20of%20S)). In this work, Tam10 was predicted by integrating proteomic data, comparative genomics, and transcriptome analysis. **Transcripts for *tam10*** were confirmed by both RT-PCR and RNA-Seq, establishing that the gene is indeed expressed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=We%20next%20sought%20to%20confirm,gene%20architecture%20of%2033%20predicted)). Importantly, 5′ and 3′ RACE experiments defined the mRNA boundaries, verifying *tam10* as a bona fide protein-coding gene and not an artifact ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)). Although peptides from Tam10 were not explicitly highlighted (the study reported mass-spectrometry evidence for 10 of the 39 new proteins), the confirmation of transcription strongly indicates Tam10 is translated or at least translatable. **Gene deletion** experiments provided additional insight: the authors created a *tam10∆* knockout and observed its phenotype ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)). The *tam10* deletion strain was **viable with no apparent abnormalities**, as noted in their deletion phenotype survey ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)). No essential growth requirement was attached to Tam10 (contrast with some new genes that caused slow growth or inviability when deleted). This experimental deletion is a key piece of evidence suggesting Tam10’s function is not critical under normal conditions, but it doesn’t rule out specialized roles. The **naming of Tam10** itself is grounded in experimental observation – it was named for the altered mRNA profile in meiosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=Additional%20Genes%20Required%20for%20Growth,pombe%20counterpart%20of%20a%20novel)). Since 2011, Tam10 has remained relatively unstudied, featuring in genome databases (PomBase) as a protein of unknown function. Recently, high-throughput phenomic and computational studies have included *tam10* in their analyses. For example, broad screens of non-essential gene knockouts across diverse conditions have been done (Rodríguez-López *et al.*, 2023), and while *tam10∆* did not show dramatic phenotypes in those tests (consistent with earlier results), such datasets provide a resource suggesting conditions where Tam10 might have subtle effects. Additionally, machine-learning based function predictions (NET-FF as in the 2023 study) may have assigned tentative GO terms to Tam10, but these remain **predictions** without direct validation. Overall, the **key literature** on Tam10 is the initial discovery and characterization paper ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=We%20next%20sought%20to%20confirm,gene%20architecture%20of%2033%20predicted)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/187/4/1207/6063417?login=false#:~:text=Inviable%20CG%20and%20PG%20,NA)), which established Tam10 as a genuine protein-coding gene expressed during meiosis, and demonstrated that cells tolerate its loss. Further experimental work (e.g. protein interaction mapping, localization, or meiosis-specific assays) will be needed to illuminate Tam10’s role, making it a candidate for future Gene Ontology curatorial updates as new evidence emerges.

**Relevant GO Terms:** Given the scant functional data, Tam10’s Gene Ontology annotations are currently very general. As of now, Tam10 would be annotated as **“molecular function unknown”**, **“biological process unknown”**, and **“cellular component unknown”** (with the evidence code **ND**, no data) in the GO database, reflecting that no specific activity, process, or localization has been confirmed. Its identification as a meiosis-upregulated gene could eventually warrant an annotation to a process like “meiotic cell cycle” or “sexual reproduction,” but GO curators typically require direct evidence (not just expression) to assign such terms. No experimentally supported GO terms (IMP, IDA, etc.) have been assigned to Tam10 so far. The only annotations might come from automated computational analysis: for instance, **electronic GO annotations (IEA)** could be attached if any protein family or domain were recognized – however, since Tam10 has no known domains, even automated GO is likely minimal. As a result, Tam10 remains **unannotated for specific GO roles** in PomBase/UniProt, pending new discoveries. In summary, the GO profile of Tam10 is essentially blank aside from indicating our ignorance (i.e., “unknown function/process/localization”). Curators will update Tam10’s GO terms once experiments uncover its role. For now, researchers referencing Tam10 for GO curation should note it as a **protein of unknown function** involved in a *biological process that is not yet determined*, with a hint of meiotic program involvement based on expression timing ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3070528/#:~:text=qualitatively%20assess%20whether%20the%20level,For%209%20loci%2C%20data)).
