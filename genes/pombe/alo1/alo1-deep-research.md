# alo1 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) – Comprehensive Gene Analysis

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanism  
The **alo1** gene of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* encodes a flavin-dependent oxidoreductase known as D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/279850/network/schizosaccharomyces-pombe/alo1.html#:~:text=D)). This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of D-arabinono-1,4-lactone to dehydro-D-arabinono-1,4-lactone, using oxygen as an electron acceptor and producing hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct ([ctdbase.org](https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=GO%3A0003885&type=go#:~:text=...oxidase%20activity%20Related%20Synonym%20,GO%3A0003885%20External%20Links)). In practice, alo1’s activity is required for the biosynthesis of **D-erythroascorbic acid**, a five-carbon analog of vitamin C (L-ascorbate) that serves as an antioxidant in fungi ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,of%20526%20amino%20acids%20with)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). Consistent with this role, **alo1** performs the terminal step of the D-erythroascorbic acid pathway in yeast (GO:0003885: *D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase activity*) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). The molecular mechanism involves an FAD cofactor mediating electron transfer to oxygen; notably, the enzyme carries a covalently bound FAD, indicating a tightly associated prosthetic group typical for this oxidase family ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). Together, these features establish alo1 as a key enzymatic defender against oxidative damage, analogous to L-gulonolactone oxidase in vitamin C-synthesizing animals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)) (humans lack the functional **GULO** enzyme, explaining our dietary requirement for vitamin C). 

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
Evidence suggests that Alo1 is associated with **mitochondrial or other organelle membranes**. The S. pombe enzyme is predicted to contain a hydrophobic region that may serve as a transmembrane anchor ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). Similarly, the *S. cerevisiae* Alo1 ortholog was purified from the mitochondrial fraction of cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,of%20526%20amino%20acids%20with)), hinting that the enzyme localizes to mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes. The presence of a putative transmembrane segment at the N-terminus could target or tether Alo1 to a membrane compartment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). By analogy to the mammalian vitamin C synthesis enzyme (gulonolactone oxidase, which is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane), Alo1 may reside on the mitochondrial membrane (possibly the inner membrane) where it can access its substrate in the organelle. In summary, Alo1 is likely a **membrane-associated mitochondrial enzyme** (GO:0005739: mitochondrion; GO:0016020: membrane), though the precise organelle compartment in fission yeast awaits experimental confirmation.

## Biological Processes and Pathways  
**alo1** is involved in antioxidant metabolism and stress response. Its enzymatic product, D-erythroascorbic acid, is an important cellular antioxidant in yeast ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,of%20526%20amino%20acids%20with)). Accordingly, alo1 contributes to the **response to oxidative stress** (GO:0006979) by maintaining intracellular antioxidant levels. *S. cerevisiae* cells lacking ALO1 cannot synthesize D-erythroascorbic acid and show heightened sensitivity to oxidants ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). Conversely, ALO1 overexpression boosts D-erythroascorbate levels ~7-fold and confers greater resistance to oxidative damage ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). These findings indicate that Alo1 activity is part of the cell’s defense against reactive oxygen species, working in parallel with glutathione and other antioxidant systems. In *Candida albicans* (a pathogenic yeast), the Alo1 homolog is similarly required for coping with oxidative stress during filamentous growth ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=%2A%20Deficiency%20of%20D,and%20virulence%20of%20Candida%20albicans)), underscoring a conserved role in stress protection. Beyond general stress response, alo1-driven production of D-erythroascorbate may support longevity or stationary-phase survival in yeast, as higher antioxidant capacity can mitigate age-related oxidative damage (a hypothesis consistent with antioxidant-associated lifespan extension in various organisms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8476265/#:~:text=PMC%20pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%20%20,Mitochondrial))). Additionally, Alo1 might intersect with metabolic pathways for sugar acids; for example, it acts after the pentose phosphate pathway supplies precursors for D-arabinono-1,4-lactone ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)). While not classically viewed as a central metabolic enzyme, alo1 defines a specialized biosynthetic process – the **erythroascorbate biosynthetic process** – that is crucial under stress conditions.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
There are no direct human diseases caused by *S. pombe* alo1, since fission yeast is a unicellular model organism. However, knowledge of alo1 and its orthologs provides insights into pathogenicity and nutritional requirements in other species. In *Candida albicans*, deletion of the ALO1 gene (required for D-erythroascorbate production) leads to reduced hyphal growth and virulence ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=%2A%20Deficiency%20of%20D,and%20virulence%20of%20Candida%20albicans)). This suggests that fungal pathogens rely on this enzyme to withstand host-derived oxidative stress, making ALO1 a potential antifungal target. In plant pathogenic fungi like *Magnaporthe oryzae*, an **alo1** homolog (*Moalo1*) is required for normal fungal growth, spore development (conidiogenesis), and pathogenicity on rice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=A%20Putative%20D,and%20Pathogenicity%20in%20Magnaporthe%20oryzae)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). These disease-context studies imply that loss of alo1 function impairs the organism’s ability to handle oxidative challenges during infection. By extension, the human dependency on dietary vitamin C is a notable evolutionary “disease” association: humans carry a nonfunctional GULO (gulonolactone oxidase) gene (a distant relative of alo1) and thus develop scurvy without sufficient vitamin C intake ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). While scurvy itself is not linked to fungal alo1, this human condition highlights the physiological importance of the enzymatic activity that alo1 orthologs perform. In lab strains of *S. pombe*, an **alo1∆** (deletion) mutant is viable but expected to display phenotypes such as sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide or superoxide-generating drugs (by analogy to S. cerevisiae alo1 mutants ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress))). Indeed, *S. cerevisiae* alo1 mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative stress, and overexpression alleviates such stress ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=multicopy%20plasmid,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)). No gross developmental defects have been reported in alo1-null fission yeast under normal conditions, consistent with it being conditionally important (i.e. important for stress resistance rather than growth in rich media). Future studies on *S. pombe* alo1 mutants (for example, testing survival after peroxide exposure) would further illuminate its phenotypic impacts.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
Alo1 is a flavoprotein belonging to the oxygen-dependent FAD-linked oxidoreductase family ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/284812.Q9HDX8#:~:text=Your%20Input%3A%20%20,0.870)). The protein sequence (~461 amino acids in *S. pombe*) contains two characteristic domains: an N-terminal **FAD-binding domain** and a C-terminal **ALO domain** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=analysis%20was%20version%2027,domains%20are%20conserved%20in%20filamentous)). The FAD-binding region (Pfam PF01565, sometimes called FAD_binding_4) binds the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor that is integral to the enzyme’s redox activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=analysis%20was%20version%2027,domains%20are%20conserved%20in%20filamentous)). The ALO domain (Pfam PF04030) is named after *arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase* and likely forms the substrate-binding and catalytic site specific for sugar lactones ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=analysis%20was%20version%2027,domains%20are%20conserved%20in%20filamentous)). Notably, Alo1 is predicted to covalently attach FAD via a conserved histidyl residue – a feature it shares with its homologs in other species ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). This covalent FAD linkage is known from the rat L-gulonolactone oxidase structure and is inferred for yeast Alo1 based on sequence motifs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). The holoprotein is thus a **covalent flavoprotein**, which can enhance stability of the cofactor and enzyme. 

Structurally, Alo1 likely folds into a two-domain architecture common to many flavin oxidases: a Rossmann-like fold for FAD binding and a more specialized domain for substrate recognition. Comparative sequence analysis shows ~32% identity between *S. cerevisiae* Alo1 and rat gulonolactone oxidase, and ~21% identity to plant L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). These homologies suggest a conserved overall structure and mechanism among these enzymes despite differences in substrate specificity. Alo1 also has a hydrophobic segment near its N-terminus that may form a single-pass transmembrane helix ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). This segment is relatively short and could function either as a membrane anchor or a targeting signal for insertion into organelle membranes. Some analyses have called it a “putative transmembrane segment” ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)), though one yeast proteome resource did not predict any long transmembrane domain in the mature protein ([www.ymdb.ca](https://www.ymdb.ca/proteins/P54783#:~:text=Database%20www.ymdb.ca%20%20...,lactone%20oxidase)). It is possible that this region acts as a signal peptide that directs Alo1 to the mitochondrion and is cleaved upon import, meaning the active enzyme in the matrix is soluble (consistent with the lack of a long membrane span in the processed form). Overall, the key structural features of Alo1 include the FAD-binding site, the active-site ALO domain, and an N-terminal extension for subcellular targeting. No full 3D structure of Alo1 from fission yeast has been reported to date, but the conserved domains and sequence similarity to known enzymes provide a strong model for its structure and function.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Little specific data has been published on **alo1** transcriptional regulation in *S. pombe*. The gene’s mRNA is constitutively present under normal growth conditions (as inferred from its discovery as an ORF in the genome ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=binding%20site,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in))), suggesting a baseline requirement for the enzyme to maintain antioxidant levels. In *S. cerevisiae*, ALO1 is a single-copy gene expressed to produce a ~1.8 kb mRNA ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=from%20rat%20and%20L,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). Expression of ALO1 in budding yeast does not appear to be highly induced by ordinary stress; instead, regulation may occur at the level of enzyme activity or cofactor availability. However, there is evidence that under extreme oxidative or metal stress, cells may modulate pathways involving Alo1: for instance, overexpression of ALO1 (above normal levels) was deliberately shown to increase oxidative stress tolerance ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=multicopy%20plasmid,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)), implying that **increased expression or gene dosage** can be beneficial during stress. It is plausible that *S. pombe* upregulates alo1 under oxidative stress via stress-responsive transcription factors. The Pap1 and Atf1 pathways in fission yeast activate many antioxidant genes in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; whether **alo1** is a direct target remains to be confirmed. No canonical stress-responsive elements (such as Sty1-Atf1 binding sites) have been reported in the alo1 promoter, but given the enzyme’s role, a modest induction during oxidative stress is likely. In *Candida albicans*, ALO1 expression correlates with the yeast-to-hypha transition and is critical for survival in host-like conditions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=%2A%20Deficiency%20of%20D,and%20virulence%20of%20Candida%20albicans)), hinting at context-dependent regulation in that organism. 

From a biotechnological perspective, **alo1** has drawn interest: its expression in other systems has been manipulated for experimental purposes. For example, *S. cerevisiae* ALO1 has been overexpressed in bacteria to produce D-erythroascorbate in vitro ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC91626/#:~:text=Bacterial%20Production%20of%20d,the%20terminal%20step%20in%20the)), and introduced into plants to bolster stress resistance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=Overexpression%20of%20Yeast%20Arabinono,1.%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar)). These studies often use strong promoters to drive ALO1 expression, underscoring that higher Alo1 levels directly increase antioxidant output. In the natural context of *S. pombe*, the gene is likely expressed at a level sufficient for routine antioxidant defense, with potential upregulation when cells face heightened ROS. High-throughput transcriptome data (e.g., RNA-seq) under stress conditions could shed more light – future analyses may reveal if alo1 mRNA rises under oxidative or stationary-phase stress. In summary, alo1 appears to be a **constitutively expressed housekeeping gene** involved in redox homeostasis, with the capacity to enhance stress tolerance when expressed at higher levels.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
The function of alo1 is **highly conserved across different kingdoms of life**, reflecting the universal need for ascorbate or ascorbate-analogs in oxidative stress management. Orthologs of *S. pombe* Alo1 are found in many fungi, plants, and animals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). Sequence analysis confirms that the ALO domain and FAD-binding domain of Alo1 are present in diverse eukaryotes including budding yeast (*S. cerevisiae* ALO1), pathogenic yeasts (*C. albicans*), filamentous fungi (*Neurospora crassa*, *Fusarium oxysporum*, *Magnaporthe oryzae*), higher plants (e.g. *Brassica oleracea*), and mammals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). In mammals, the closest functional counterparts are enzymes like **L-gulonolactone oxidase** (GULO) in rats and mice, which synthesizes true vitamin C. The *S. cerevisiae* Alo1 shares ~32% identity with rat GULO and significant similarity with plant **L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase**, an enzyme in plant vitamin C biosynthesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). This moderate sequence identity, combined with conserved domain architecture, indicates a common evolutionary origin for these FAD-dependent lactone oxidases. Interestingly, while most mammals (except primates, guinea pigs, etc.) retain GULO for vitamin C production, fungi and yeasts have evolved the 5-carbon analog pathway with Alo1 – a convergence on the same biochemical solution (producing an antioxidant) via slightly different substrates. The presence of **alo1 homologs in virtually all fungi** examined suggests that D-erythroascorbic acid biosynthesis is a widespread fungal strategy for oxidative stress protection ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). Even non-pathogenic yeasts like *Schizosaccharomyces* and *Saccharomyces* use this pathway, highlighting its fundamental role in cell physiology. In plants, although the main vitamin C pathway uses a different enzyme (L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase in mitochondria), some plants and algae also contain genes with ALO/FAD_binding domains, possibly reflecting ancestral genes or parallel functions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). 

From an evolutionary perspective, alo1 and its orthologs form a sub-family within the broader vanillyl-alcohol oxidase flavoprotein family ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/284812.Q9HDX8#:~:text=Your%20Input%3A%20%20,0.870)). Phylogenetic analyses (such as those in *M. oryzae* Alo1 studies) show that fungal Alo1 enzymes cluster together, with plant and animal enzymes branching nearby, consistent with species phylogeny ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=the%20ALO%20domain%20and%20FAD_binding_4,a%20similar%20evolutionary%20relationship%20to)). This suggests that the enzyme’s function was present in a common ancestor prior to the divergence of fungi, plants, and metazoans. The human genome still contains a **GULOP pseudogene**, the remnants of the gulonolactone oxidase gene that our primate ancestors lost ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=2989#:~:text=GULOP%20gulonolactone%20%28L,Gene%20ID)). That loss, and our subsequent dependence on dietary ascorbate, underscores how critical – yet sometimes dispensable – this pathway can be: some organisms dropped it (e.g., primates in vitamin C-rich diets), whereas most others retained it for survival. In summary, alo1 is part of an evolutionarily conserved network of enzymes dedicated to ascorbate-like molecule production, spanning yeast to mammals, with conservation of key domains and catalytic mechanisms across ~1.5 billion years of evolution.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Discovery and Enzymatic Function (Yeast):** *S. cerevisiae* ALO1 was first identified as a gene encoding D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase, purified from yeast mitochondria ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,of%20526%20amino%20acids%20with)). Huh *et al.* (1998) demonstrated that this enzyme produces D-erythroascorbic acid and that **alo1∆ mutants completely lack D-erythroascorbate**, confirming Alo1’s role in its biosynthesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). They also showed that alo1∆ cells have no detectable D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase activity, whereas overexpression of ALO1 increases enzyme activity >7-fold ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). This study established D-erythroascorbic acid as an important antioxidant in yeast, with Alo1 being indispensable for its production ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). 

- **Stress Tolerance Phenotypes:** The Huh *et al.* 1998 study further reported that **alo1 mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative stress**, and extra copies of ALO1 render cells more resistant ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=multicopy%20plasmid,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). Subsequent work by Kim *et al.* and others demonstrated that providing yeast with D-erythroascorbic acid or overexpressing ALO1 can mitigate damage from oxidants like hydrogen peroxide or the superoxide-generating agent paraquat ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)). Min *et al.* (2015) even showed that expressing yeast ALO1 in tobacco plants enhanced their tolerance to oxidative stress and aluminum toxicity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=Overexpression%20of%20Yeast%20Arabinono,1.%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar)), illustrating the conserved protective effect of the enzyme across kingdoms.

- **Candida albicans Virulence:** Huh *et al.* (2001) cloned the *C. albicans* ALO1 and found that mutants lacking it could not produce D-erythroascorbate and had attenuated hyphal growth and virulence ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=%2A%20Deficiency%20of%20D,and%20virulence%20of%20Candida%20albicans)). This key evidence linked Alo1 activity to pathogenic fitness, likely by compromising the fungus’s ability to neutralize reactive oxygen from the host immune response.

- **Magnaporthe oryzae Pathogenicity:** Wu *et al.* (2022) characterized *M. oryzae* **MoAlo1**, confirming it has the same ALO and FAD_binding_4 domains as yeast Alo1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=analysis%20was%20version%2027,domains%20are%20conserved%20in%20filamentous)). Deletion of *Moalo1* caused severe defects in fungal growth, spore formation, and plant infection ability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=A%20Putative%20D,and%20Pathogenicity%20in%20Magnaporthe%20oryzae)). They also showed *MoAlo1* mutant is more sensitive to external H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2】, reinforcing that the enzyme’s role in oxidative stress resistance is critical for disease causation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8782026/#:~:text=some%20fungi%20,indicate%20that%20MoAlo1%20may%20be)).

- **Biochemical Properties:** The yeast Alo1 protein (526 aa in *S. cerevisiae*) was noted to have a **covalently bound FAD** and a predicted single transmembrane segment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). The covalent flavin was inferred from sequence motifs and later confirmed in related enzymes, indicating a common biochemical feature. Alignment of Alo1 with rat and plant enzymes provided early evidence of its evolutionary relatedness to known vitamin C biosynthetic enzymes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme%20shared%2032,transformant%20cells%20carrying%20ALO1%20in)). These comparative studies form the basis for current GO annotations of Alo1’s **molecular function** (oxidoreductase activity) and **biological process** (ascorbate analog biosynthesis and stress response).

- **Genetic Interaction and Omics:** Thus far, **alo1** has not featured prominently in *S. pombe* large-scale mutant screens for DNA damage or cell cycle (likely because its loss yields subtle phenotypes unless oxidative stress is applied). However, Alo1 does have a small network of protein interactions (e.g., reported physical or genetic interactions with four partners ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/279850/network/schizosaccharomyces-pombe/alo1.html#:~:text=Download%20Curated%20Data%20for%20this,Protein)) ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/284812.Q9HDX8#:~:text=,0.870)), one being a 6-phosphogluconolactonase in the pentose phosphate pathway). This hints at a possible metabolic linkage: the pentose phosphate pathway (which generates NADPH and pentoses) could supply precursors or reducing power for erythroascorbate synthesis, aligning with Alo1’s role in redox balance. No direct involvement of alo1 in cell cycle or meiosis was found in a fission yeast meiotic gene screen, indicating its functions are specific to metabolic stress contexts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5788524/#:~:text=Genes%20Important%20for%20Schizosaccharomyces%20pombe,carrying%20a%20GFP%20label%20on)).

In conclusion, the accumulated experimental evidence paints alo1 as a **metabolic stress-response gene**. It encodes an enzyme that is biochemically and functionally conserved, playing a crucial role in the biosynthesis of an antioxidant molecule. Curating Alo1 in Gene Ontology terms, one would capture its **oxidoreductase activity (acting on the CH-OH group of donors, oxygen as acceptor)**, its involvement in **ascorbate analog biosynthetic process and oxidative stress response**, and its association with the **mitochondrial/membrane compartment** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,of%20526%20amino%20acids%20with)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=size,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)). The literature cited above provides strong evidence for each of these facets, ensuring that GO annotations for alo1 are well supported by experimental findings.
