description: D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase that catalyzes the terminal step in fungal D-erythroascorbic acid biosynthesis. This mitochondrial outer membrane-anchored flavoprotein oxidizes D-arabinono-1,4-lactone using molecular oxygen as electron acceptor, producing D-erythroascorbic acid (a 5-carbon analog of vitamin C) and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme contains a covalently bound FAD cofactor and plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant defense, with deletion mutants showing hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Recent studies in S. cerevisiae reveal a potential moonlighting function where Alo1 binds the myosin V motor Myo2 and aids in mitochondrial inheritance, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (PMID:39775849), though this role remains to be confirmed in S. pombe.
