# Investigating the Function of *alo1* in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*

## Introduction

The *alo1* gene of *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* encodes a predicted enzyme **D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase** (ALO)[\[1\]](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?spo:2543430#:~:text=Pathway%20spo00053%20%C2%A0%C2%A0Ascorbate%20and%20aldarate,metabolism%20%205%C2%A0%C2%A0Metabolic%20pathways%20Brite). This enzyme is proposed to catalyze the final oxidation step in the biosynthesis of **D-erythroascorbic acid**, a five-carbon analog of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) found in fungi[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO). In fungi such as yeast, ALO converts D-arabinono-1,4-lactone to D-erythroascorbate, establishing an antioxidant system parallel to the ascorbic acid pathways of plants and animals[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO). Despite this annotated role, *alo1* has not been experimentally characterized in fission yeast. Uncovering its molecular function and biological role is important, as clues from other organisms suggest *alo1* may impact oxidative stress resistance, metabolism, and organelle function. Below, we critically review known and predicted features of *alo1* – drawing from databases (PomBase, UniProt) and comparative biology – and then propose a hypothesis-driven experimental plan to elucidate *alo1*’s function in *S. pombe*. Key gaps in knowledge are highlighted, and targeted approaches are outlined to address these gaps.

## Molecular and Biochemical Function of *alo1*

**Enzymatic activity:** *alo1* is predicted to encode a **flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase** that uses oxygen to oxidize D-arabinono-1,4-lactone[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO)[\[3\]](https://www.cusabio.com/Custom-Antibodies/ALO-Antibody-12903496.html#:~:text=Mitochondrion%20membrane). This reaction yields D-erythroascorbic acid (EASC), an antioxidant analogous to L-ascorbate (vitamin C)[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO). Notably, *alo1* is orthologous to the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* ALO1 gene, which was biochemically confirmed to catalyze EASC production[\[4\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,segment%20and%20a%20covalent%20FAD)[\[5\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=was%20present%20in%20the%20yeast,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress). In *S. cerevisiae*, ALO1 was purified and shown to create the redox-active enediol structure of erythroascorbate, similar to how L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) produces ascorbate in animals[\[6\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=cerevisiae,8kb%20in)[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO). Consistent with this, *S. pombe* Alo1 is classified in the same **aldonolactone oxidoreductase family** as GULO and plant L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalDH)[\[7\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=D,thereby%20generate%20the%20characteristic%2C%20redox). All these enzymes share a common mechanism: oxidation at the C2 hydroxyl of a sugar lactone to form a C2=C3 double bond, which is essential for antioxidant activity[\[8\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=L,1a).

**Protein features:** The Alo1 protein (461 amino acids) contains conserved domains characteristic of FAD-linked oxidases: an N-terminal **FAD-binding domain** and a C-terminal **ALO domain**[\[9\]](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?spo:2543430#:~:text=BRITE%20hierarchy%20SSDB%20Ortholog%20Paralog,ProteinID%3A%C2%A0NP_593526%20PomBase%3A%C2%A0SPAPB1A10.12c%20SPAPB1A10.12c.1)[\[10\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=17%20Conserved%20domains%20of%20ALO,1%29%2C%20Brassica%20oleracea). The FAD cofactor is likely **covalently attached** to Alo1 – *S. cerevisiae* ALO1 has a conserved histidine that binds FAD, and sequence analysis revealed a “covalent FAD-binding site” in the enzyme[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). This covalent flavin is a hallmark of the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family to which ALO1 belongs[\[7\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=D,thereby%20generate%20the%20characteristic%2C%20redox). Additionally, Alo1 is predicted to be an **integral membrane flavoprotein**: it has a hydrophobic segment near the C-terminus that likely anchors it to a membrane[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). PomBase and UniProt annotations indicate Alo1 localizes to the **mitochondrial membrane**[\[12\]](https://www.cusabio.com/Custom-Antibodies/ALO-Antibody-12903496.html#:~:text=Subcellular%20Location). In budding yeast, ALO1 was found associated with the **outer mitochondrial membrane**, exposing most of the protein to the cytosol[\[13\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/854888#:~:text=Enables%20D,Try%20the%20new%20%2021)[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress). We anticipate *S. pombe* Alo1 is similarly membrane-anchored, which would position the active site at the mitochondrial surface where it can access cytosolic D-arabinono-1,4-lactone. The **oxygen-dependent** nature of the reaction suggests Alo1 contributes to non-respiratory oxygen utilization in the cell. Notably, the enzyme may produce hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as a by-product (as animal GULO does), linking Alo1 activity to cellular redox balance.

**Substrate scope and mechanism:** Based on homology, Alo1 is expected to have a somewhat **broad substrate specificity** for lactone sugars. The *S. cerevisiae* enzyme not only oxidizes D-arabinono-1,4-lactone (to EASC) but can also oxidize analogs like L-gulono-1,4-lactone and L-galactono-1,4-lactone in vitro[\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/854888#:~:text=Enables%20D,lactone%20biosynthetic). This suggests the catalytic pocket recognizes the lactone ring rather than specific stereochemistry of the entire molecule. The ability to act on L-gulonolactone is especially intriguing, as it implies fungal ALO could theoretically produce L-ascorbate under engineered conditions[\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/854888#:~:text=Enables%20D,lactone%20biosynthetic). Mechanistically, Alo1 is a two-electron oxidase: it likely transfers electrons from the substrate to its FAD, and then from reduced FAD to oxygen, forming H₂O₂[\[8\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=L,1a). However, structural studies show that **small amino acid changes can convert an oxidase into a dehydrogenase** that uses alternative electron acceptors[\[16\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=activities%20and%20substrate%20preferences%20featured,During%20Eukarya%20evolution%2C%20the). In the aldonolactone oxidoreductase family, a single “flavin-interacting” residue modulates preference for oxygen vs. cytochrome *c*[\[16\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=activities%20and%20substrate%20preferences%20featured,During%20Eukarya%20evolution%2C%20the). It would be insightful to identify this residue in Alo1’s sequence; given that fungi use O₂ as acceptor, Alo1 likely has the variant that favors oxidase activity. Overall, the molecular function of Alo1 in *S. pombe* is strongly inferred to be a D-arabinono-1,4-lactone:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.37) that produces an antioxidant, with structural adaptations (flavin binding and membrane anchor) to operate in the mitochondrial context.

## Biological Role and Conservation Across Species

Although *alo1*’s biochemistry is predicted by homology, its **physiological role** in *S. pombe* remains to be demonstrated. Studies in other fungi provide important clues. In *S. cerevisiae*, ALO1 is essential for endogenous erythroascorbate production – **alo1Δ mutants completely lack D-erythroascorbic acid and ALO activity[\[5\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=was%20present%20in%20the%20yeast,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)**. Loss of ALO1 in budding yeast leads to heightened sensitivity to oxidative stress (e.g. H₂O₂ exposure)[\[17\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress). Conversely, overexpressing ALO1 increases cellular EASC levels \~7-fold and confers greater resistance to oxidants[\[5\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=was%20present%20in%20the%20yeast,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress). This establishes that the antioxidant function of ALO1 is physiologically important, protecting yeast from oxidative damage. We expect *S. pombe alo1* to play a similar role in oxidative stress defense. Consistent with this, *alo1* is categorized under “oxidative stress response” genes in high-throughput studies[\[18\]](https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0008152#:~:text=process%20www,References%3A%20GO_REF%3A0000024). Furthermore, *alo1* might be regulated by cellular oxygen and stress conditions. In *S. pombe*, the Sre1 hypoxia pathway controls many non-respiratory oxygen-utilizing enzymes[\[19\]](https://hughes.biochem.utah.edu/s/Sterol-Regulatory-Element-Binding-Protein.pdf#:~:text=activator%20of%20anaerobic%20gene%20expression%2C,required%20for%20nonrespiratory%20oxygen%20consumption); it is plausible that *alo1* expression is down-regulated anaerobically and up-regulated when oxygen is available for antioxidant biosynthesis (though direct data are lacking and warrant testing).

Beyond single-cell stress survival, fungal ALO1 homologs impact complex phenotypes. In the plant-pathogenic fungus *Magnaporthe oryzae*, deletion of the ALO1 ortholog (*MoALO1*) caused severe defects in **growth and development** – the mutant grew slower, produced fewer conidia (asexual spores), and had impaired appressorium formation[\[20\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=D,MoAlo1%20is%20essential%20for%20growth). Strikingly, *Moalo1* mutants also showed **diminished virulence**, failing to infect rice normally[\[21\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=exhibited%20defects%20in%20vegetative%20growth,oryzae). These defects were attributed to loss of EASC: the *ΔMoalo1* strain was hypersensitive to H₂O₂, and supplying exogenous D-erythroascorbate restored its pathogenicity to wild-type levels[\[22\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=found%20that%20MoAlo1%20was%20localized,oryzae). Thus, fungal ALO1 is not only an antioxidant enzyme but can be crucial for stress endurance during host infection. Similarly, in *Candida albicans* (a human pathogen), ALO1 is important for survival under host-derived oxidative stress – *C. albicans alo1Δ* mutants show attenuated hyphal growth and virulence[\[23\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=virulence%20of%20Candida%20albicans). These findings suggest that **ALO1-mediated EASC production is a conserved strategy in fungi to withstand oxidative challenges**, whether from the environment or immune system.

It is worth noting that higher eukaryotes have analogous enzymes, underscoring a broader evolutionary conservation. Animals synthesize ascorbic acid using GULO (absent in humans due to mutation), and plants synthesize ascorbate via GalDH; these enzymes share **significant sequence identity** with yeast Alo1 (e.g. \~32% identity to rat GULO)[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). Phylogenetic analysis confirms that ALO, GULO, and GalDH evolved from a common ancestral enzyme, diverging to meet the metabolic demands of different lineages[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO)[\[7\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=D,thereby%20generate%20the%20characteristic%2C%20redox). The core FAD-binding fold and catalytic residues are conserved from fungi to mammals[\[7\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=D,thereby%20generate%20the%20characteristic%2C%20redox). For example, Alo1 shares the signature **GGXW** motif of FAD-dependent oxidases and likely the histidyl-FAD linkage seen in VAO-family enzymes[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). Alignment of ALO1 homologs across species (yeasts, filamentous fungi, plants, animals) shows they all contain the FAD-binding\_4 domain and the ALO-specific C-terminal region[\[10\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=17%20Conserved%20domains%20of%20ALO,1%29%2C%20Brassica%20oleracea). This conservation suggests that *S. pombe* Alo1 will have a structure and mechanism closely resembling those of its fungal and metazoan counterparts, reinforcing our functional predictions.

An unexpected facet of ALO1 biology emerged from a recent study in *S. cerevisiae*: Alo1 appears to **moonlight in mitochondrial inheritance**. Chelius *et al.* (2025) identified Alo1 in a screen for proteins that bind the type V myosin motor Myo2 (which transports organelles along actin)[\[24\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=novel%20components%20involved%20in%20this,of%20mitochondria%20under%20these%20conditions). Alo1 was found anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane and capable of recruiting Myo2 to mitochondria[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress). Intriguingly, deletion of *ALO1* in budding yeast caused abnormal mitochondrial morphology and distribution between mother and daughter cells, especially under oxidative stress[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress). Overexpression of ALO1 could even counteract the stress-induced retention of mitochondria in mother cells[\[25\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=characterized%20D,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress). These results suggest Alo1 links mitochondria to the actin-based transport machinery, aiding their equal partitioning, particularly when oxidative damage might otherwise immobilize the organelles. It is unknown whether *S. pombe* Alo1 has a similar role – fission yeast divide by medial fission (not budding) and use different myosin motors (Myo52 is the class V myosin for cargo transport). However, this raises exciting questions about Alo1’s potential multifunctionality. In *S. pombe*, mitochondrial inheritance relies on proper transport and anchoring of organelles during cell division; if Alo1 or its binding partners contribute to this process, *alo1* deletion might subtly affect mitochondrial positioning or segregation in stressed cells. No such phenotype has been reported yet, but our experimental plan will consider assays to reveal any organelle dynamics role for Alo1.

**Summary of gaps:** In summary, *S. pombe* *alo1* is strongly predicted to encode a D-arabinonolactone oxidase producing an ascorbate analog and contributing to oxidative stress resistance. This is bolstered by cross-species evidence of its enzymatic activity and stress-protective function. However, *alo1* has not been directly studied in fission yeast: we lack data on its **loss-of-function phenotype, biochemical activity in vivo, regulation, protein interactors, and subcellular details**. It is also unclear if Alo1 has any non-enzymatic roles (e.g. in organelle maintenance) in *S. pombe*. These gaps motivate a comprehensive experimental approach to characterize *alo1*. Below, we outline a hypothesis-driven research plan to determine *alo1*’s function, combining genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and structural methods.

## Proposed Experimental Plan to Elucidate *alo1* Function

**Overview:** We propose a multifaceted strategy to define *alo1*’s role: firstly by creating *alo1* loss-of-function strains and characterizing their phenotype, then by probing genetic interactions and cellular processes that *alo1* might influence, and finally by biochemically verifying Alo1’s activity and structure. The working hypothesis is that *alo1* encodes an enzyme required for **antioxidant (erythroascorbate) production**, which in turn protects cells from oxidative damage. We also hypothesize *alo1* may interface with mitochondrial function (localization or inheritance). Each set of experiments below is designed to test specific predictions or reveal new functions:

1. **Generate *alo1* Null Mutants and Assess Viability and Stress Phenotypes:** We will delete the *alo1* gene in *S. pombe* (by homologous recombination replacing it with a marker) to obtain a clean **alo1Δ** strain. If *alo1* is essential for viability (unlikely given other fungi survive its loss[\[20\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=D,MoAlo1%20is%20essential%20for%20growth)), we will instead create a conditional knockdown or an inducible promoter swap. The knockout strain will be examined for **baseline growth and morphology** under normal conditions to see if *alo1* is required for optimal proliferation. Given Magnaporthe results, we will check for any growth defect on rich media and minimal media. Next, we will test the mutant’s sensitivity to **oxidative stress**. Spot dilution assays and growth curves will be performed with oxidants such as H₂O₂ and menadione (a superoxide generator). We expect *alo1Δ* cells to show reduced growth or viability compared to wild type when challenged with reactive oxygen species, reflecting loss of the EASC antioxidant. We will quantify survival fractions after acute peroxide exposure and measure any increase in protein oxidation or lipid peroxidation markers in the mutant. If *alo1* indeed confers oxidative stress protection, the knockout should phenocopy *S. cerevisiae alo1Δ* (hypersensitive to oxidants)[\[17\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress) and *M. oryzae* *alo1Δ* (H₂O₂-sensitive)[\[22\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357754691_A_Putative_D-Arabinono-14-lactone_Oxidase_MoAlo1_Is_Required_for_Fungal_Growth_Conidiogenesis_and_Pathogenicity_in_Magnaporthe_oryzae#:~:text=found%20that%20MoAlo1%20was%20localized,oryzae). As a control, we will complement the mutant by reintroducing *alo1+* on a plasmid to see if it restores normal resistance. In addition, because *alo1* might affect other stress responses, we will test *alo1Δ* under heat stress, osmotic stress, and nutrient starvation to uncover any broader role (e.g. if EASC protects during stationary phase). **Phenotypic analyses** will also include microscopic examination of cell morphology: cell length, septation, and any abnormalities in cell cycle progression or viability (e.g. via staining dead cells) to detect subtle effects. If Alo1 influences mitochondria, the mutant might display altered mitochondrial distribution or content; we will use a mitochondrial dye (e.g. MitoTracker) to see if *alo1Δ* cells have obvious mitochondrial morphology defects under normal or stress conditions. These initial phenotypes will establish the foundation for understanding *alo1*’s importance in vivo.

2. **Epistasis and Genetic Interaction Analysis:** To place *alo1* in cellular pathways, we will perform targeted genetic interaction studies with other mutations. One approach is to combine *alo1Δ* with mutants in known oxidative stress regulators and antioxidants. For example, we will create double mutants of *alo1Δ* with **Δpap1** *(Pap1 is the AP-1-like transcription factor that induces antioxidant genes in* S. pombe*). If* alo1 *and* pap1 *function in parallel oxidative stress defense pathways, the double mutant might show synthetic sensitivity to oxidative stress far greater than either single mutant. Similarly, we can combine* alo1Δ *with deletions of enzymes like catalase (*ctt1Δ*, which degrades H₂O₂) or glutathione biosynthesis (*gsh1Δ*). Enhanced stress phenotypes or synthetic sickness in double mutants would indicate that Alo1’s antioxidant role is partly redundant with these systems. For instance, if* alo1Δ* *ctt1Δ *is inviable under air (oxygen exposure), it means erythroascorbate and catalase normally provide parallel protection against peroxide. On the other hand, if double mutants are no worse than single mutants, Alo1 likely functions in the same pathway as those genes (or is not a major contributor under the tested conditions). We will also examine genetic interactions relevant to* *mitochondrial health. Combining* alo1Δ *with a mutant that impairs mitochondrial antioxidant defenses (e.g.* sod2Δ *encoding mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) could reveal additive effects on mitochondrial ROS accumulation or mitochondrial DNA stability. Additionally, to probe the possible link to organelle transport, we could cross* alo1Δ *with a mutant in mitochondrial trafficking.* S. pombe *transports mitochondria along microtubules and actin; Myo52 (class V myosin) is involved in cargo transport to cell tips, and* dnm1Δ *(dynamin) causes a mitochondrial network collapse. If* alo1 *deletion exacerbates any mitochondrial distribution defect of these mutants, it might hint Alo1 has a supportive role in that process. Conversely, if* alo1Δ *rescues a phenotype (which is less likely), it could suggest an unforeseen antagonistic relationship. Beyond targeted crosses, we will employ an unbiased approach: a* *genome-wide synthetic lethal screen* *(e.g. via haploid deletion collections or CRISPR libraries) to find genes that become essential when* alo1 *is deleted. Any hits from such a screen might point to pathways that buffer the absence of Alo1. For example, we might discover that mutants in the glutathione system cannot tolerate* alo1\* loss, reinforcing that EASC and glutathione serve overlapping roles. Overall, the epistasis analyses will help position Alo1 within the cellular network of stress response and metabolism.

3. **Cellular Localization and Organelle Dynamics:** To verify and refine Alo1’s subcellular localization, we will tag the endogenous *alo1* gene with a fluorescent protein (e.g. GFP) at the C-terminus (after the presumed transmembrane anchor). The functionality of the Alo1-GFP fusion will be confirmed by its ability to rescue the *alo1Δ* stress phenotype. **Live-cell fluorescence microscopy** will then be used to observe where Alo1 resides. We expect to see punctate or tubular signals co-localizing with mitochondria. Co-staining cells with MitoTracker or co-expressing a mitochondrial matrix marker (e.g. Rfp targeted to mitochondria) can demonstrate co-localization. If Alo1-GFP outlines the mitochondria similar to Tom20 (an outer membrane marker), it would confirm **mitochondrial outer membrane localization** as in budding yeast[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress). We will also perform biochemical fractionation: isolate mitochondria from cells and treat with protease in the absence vs. presence of detergents. If Alo1 is outer-membrane exposed, proteinase K should digest the GFP tag in intact mitochondria (rendering the fusion protein \~ lower molecular weight on a blot), whereas an inner membrane or matrix protein would be protected until membranes are solubilized. This **protease protection assay** will clarify which face of the membrane Alo1 occupies. Additionally, we will assess if Alo1’s localization or abundance changes under different conditions. For instance, does oxidative stress induce any relocalization or higher expression of Alo1-GFP? Using fluorescence intensity measurements or Western blotting, we can detect if H₂O₂ or oxygen shifts regulate the protein level or mitochondrial association (though *alo1* is likely constitutively mitochondrial).

We will also investigate **mitochondrial dynamics** in the absence of Alo1, given the Myo2-interaction reported in budding yeast. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (e.g. labeling mitochondria with matrix-targeted GFP in *alo1Δ* and wild type), we can track mitochondrial movement and segregation during the cell cycle. *S. pombe* normally partitions mitochondria between daughter cells during division; we will quantify if *alo1Δ* cells show any bias or delay in this partitioning. Under oxidative stress (e.g. treating cells with low doses of H₂O₂ during imaging), wild-type fission yeast might have a mechanism to retain damaged mitochondria on one side – does *alo1Δ* disrupt or exaggerate such behavior? We could also fluorescently mark one end of the cell’s mitochondria and see if movement to the other end is impaired without Alo1. If feasible, **fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)** on mitochondrial fragments could measure transport rates along actin cables in *alo1Δ* vs. wild type. While these experiments are exploratory, any observed mitochondrial distribution defect in *alo1Δ* (especially under stress) would be a novel finding, suggesting *alo1* in fission yeast, like in budding yeast, influences organelle dynamics. To complement this, we may test physical interaction between *S. pombe* Alo1 and myosin V (Myo52). Co-immunoprecipitation (see below) or a yeast two-hybrid assay between Alo1’s C-terminal domain and the cargo-binding domain of Myo52 can probe a direct interaction. A positive interaction would echo the *S. cerevisiae* result[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress), indicating a conserved link between antioxidant machinery and organelle transport.

1. **Proteomic Identification of Alo1-Associated Complexes:** We will perform **proteomics and interaction studies** to find binding partners of Alo1, which can shed light on its functional context. Using the *alo1*\-GFP or an epitope-tagged version (e.g. Alo1-3×Flag), we will immunopurify Alo1 from *S. pombe* cell lysates. Mass spectrometric analysis of co-purified proteins will be done to identify any **Alo1-interacting proteins**. We anticipate finding components of mitochondrial membranes – for example, the voltage-dependent anion channel (porin) or translocase proteins could co-purify due to proximity in the outer membrane. More interestingly, we will look for any **cytoskeletal or motor proteins** in the interactome (e.g. Myo52 or its adaptors like cargo-binding proteins). Detection of Myo52 or actin or organelle tethers would support the hypothesis of Alo1 serving as a physical linker in mitochondrial movement. Also, identifying any **enzymatic partners** could be informative. Perhaps Alo1 interacts with the enzyme that produces its substrate: in *S. cerevisiae*, D-arabinono-1,4-lactone is made by an arabinose dehydrogenase (Ara1). If *S. pombe* has a homologous enzyme for D-arabinose or D-arabinitol metabolism, Alo1 might form a metabolic microcompartment with it to channel the lactone substrate. The proteomics could reveal such a candidate dehydrogenase. Additionally, if Alo1 is part of a stress response pathway, we might find stress-related proteins (e.g. peroxiredoxins, signaling kinases) associating with it. All co-purifications will be compared between untreated cells and oxidatively stressed cells – stress conditions might strengthen or break certain interactions (for instance, Alo1 might bind a peroxidase only when EASC levels are low, etc.).

To complement the unbiased proteomics, we can perform **direct assays for known candidate interactions**. For example, we will test if Alo1 co-immunoprecipitates with Myo52-GFP or vice versa using specific antibodies. We will also test whether Alo1 physically associates with any subunits of mitochondrial contact site complexes or quality control machinery, as this could relate to how damaged mitochondria are handled. If our earlier epistasis tests suggested a genetic link between *alo1* and other pathways (say, glutathione or Pap1), we could ask if Alo1 pulls down any glutathione S-transferases or Pap1 itself (perhaps unlikely, but worth checking if Pap1 might regulate or bind antioxidant enzymes). The outcome of these interaction studies will reveal whether Alo1 functions purely as a solitary enzyme or as part of a larger **protein complex**. Any novel interacting protein will direct further functional experiments – for instance, if we find Alo1 binds a specific mitochondrial outer membrane protein, we could test *alo1Δ* and that gene’s mutant for similar phenotypes, or see if one controls localization of the other.

1. **Global Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Profiling:** To capture the broader impact of losing *alo1*, we will perform **transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq)** on *alo1Δ* vs. wild-type cells. This can uncover compensatory changes or pathways affected by Alo1 deficiency. For example, if *alo1Δ* cells experience chronic oxidative stress, we expect up-regulation of oxidative stress genes (catalases, peroxidases, heat shock proteins) even without external stress. If EASC is an important antioxidant, *alo1Δ* might exhibit a gene expression signature similar to cells lacking Pap1 or cells treated with mild H₂O₂. We will grow mutant and wild-type cells under normal conditions, as well as expose them to an acute oxidative stress (e.g. 0.2 mM H₂O₂ for 30 minutes), then extract RNA for sequencing. Differential expression analysis will identify genes whose expression is *alo1*\-dependent. For instance, are *Pap1* target genes hyperinduced in the *alo1Δ* background (suggesting Pap1 is overstimulated by ROS in the mutant)? Or does *alo1Δ* fail to induce certain genes upon stress (indicating an upstream role)? We will also check if *alo1* itself is induced by stress in wild-type cells’ transcriptome data. If *alo1* is significantly up-regulated by H₂O₂, it would reinforce its role as a stress response gene. Conversely, if *alo1* is down-regulated in low oxygen conditions (mimicking Sre1 targets), the RNA-seq of cells shifted to anaerobic conditions (in an anaerobic chamber or 0% O₂ environment) would show that. Indeed, prior studies found Sre1 controls many oxygen-regulated genes[\[26\]](https://hughes.biochem.utah.edu/s/Sterol-Regulatory-Element-Binding-Protein.pdf#:~:text=conditions.%20Sre1p%20controlled%2068,sre1%01%20promoter%20analysis%20identified)[\[19\]](https://hughes.biochem.utah.edu/s/Sterol-Regulatory-Element-Binding-Protein.pdf#:~:text=activator%20of%20anaerobic%20gene%20expression%2C,required%20for%20nonrespiratory%20oxygen%20consumption) – we will specifically inspect *alo1* expression in publicly available anaerobic transcriptome data or include our own anaerobic sample.

In parallel, we will perform **metabolomic analysis** focusing on ascorbate and related metabolites. We will attempt to **detect and quantify D-erythroascorbic acid** in *S. pombe* cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with UV detection or mass spectrometry can separate EASC from other sugars/acids. Using standards (possibly chemically synthesized D-erythroascorbate or purified from yeast), we will measure EASC levels in wild-type vs. *alo1Δ*. We expect wild-type fission yeast to contain measurable EASC (yeasts typically have 0.1–1 mM intracellular EASC[\[17\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,more%20resistant%20to%20oxidative%20stress)), whereas *alo1Δ* should have **undetectable or drastically reduced EASC**. This would be a direct confirmation of Alo1’s enzymatic product in *S. pombe*. If we detect EASC, we will also test how its levels change under stress (does the pool deplete upon oxidative challenge as it gets used to quench ROS, then rebound?). Moreover, we can feed cells with potential precursors to see if they enter the pathway. Feeding wild-type cells D-arabinose or D-arabinono-1,4-lactone might elevate EASC levels if the pathway is not saturated; *alo1Δ* cells fed these will likely just accumulate the lactone (which we can check by LC-MS). Metabolomics could also reveal if *alo1Δ* accumulates upstream metabolites (e.g. D-arabinono-lactone, D-arabinitol if present) or has altered glutathione redox state, etc. Collectively, the transcriptomic and metabolomic data will provide a **systems-level view** of how *alo1* loss affects cell state and will either corroborate the expected role in redox homeostasis or hint at new roles (for instance, if unexpected pathways are misregulated in the mutant).

1. **Biochemical Characterization of Alo1 Enzyme Activity:** To conclusively demonstrate Alo1’s biochemical function, we will purify the Alo1 protein and assay its enzymatic activity in vitro. We plan to express *S. pombe* Alo1 recombinantly, likely in a yeast system (such as *Pichia pastoris* or even *S. pombe* itself) to ensure proper folding and FAD insertion. Because Alo1 is membrane-bound, we will express a version **truncated** for the transmembrane helix (e.g. last \~20 amino acids removed) and include a polyhistidine tag for purification. The recombinant protein (potentially still carrying FAD) will be purified by nickel affinity and gel filtration. We will test its activity on various lactone substrates: **D-arabinono-1,4-lactone** (the native substrate), and for comparison **L-galactono-1,4-lactone** and **L-gulono-1,4-lactone**. The enzyme assay can be done by measuring oxygen consumption (using an oxygen electrode) or by a coupled reaction detecting H₂O₂ formation (e.g. via horseradish peroxidase and a dye). We expect the enzyme to show robust oxidation of D-arabinonolactone with O₂, confirming its annotated EC 1.1.3.37 activity. If Alo1 is functional, we may observe it can also oxidize L-gulonolactone (suggesting some ability to produce L-ascorbate in vitro, aligning with the broad specificity noted for yeast ALO1[\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/854888#:~:text=Enables%20D,lactone%20biosynthetic)). Kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax) for each substrate will be determined to quantify how specialized the enzyme is for the D-arabino substrate. We will also test if the enzyme truly requires oxygen or if it can use alternative electron acceptors (for example, adding cytochrome *c* in the assay to see if any dehydrogenase activity is detectable – although *in vivo* it likely uses oxygen as shown by sequence features[\[16\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=activities%20and%20substrate%20preferences%20featured,During%20Eukarya%20evolution%2C%20the)). To validate that the purified enzyme’s activity corresponds to the in vivo function, we will see if cell extracts from wild-type and *alo1Δ* behave similarly: wild-type extracts should convert D-arabinono-lactone to EASC (we can monitor EASC formation by HPLC or a colorimetric ascorbate assay), whereas *alo1Δ* extracts should not. Additionally, we will measure the **intracellular EASC** in wild-type vs. *alo1Δ* as described above; rescuing *alo1Δ* with a catalytically dead version of Alo1 should fail to restore EASC, confirming the necessity of the enzymatic function. We will create point mutants in Alo1’s predicted active site (for instance, mutate the histidine that binds FAD, or other conserved catalytic residues gleaned from alignment with GULO/GalDH) and test these in vivo by expressing them in *alo1Δ*. If those mutants cannot complement the stress resistance or do not produce EASC, that verifies those residues are essential for activity (further proving that the antioxidant function of Alo1 underlies the phenotype). Finally, we might attempt to detect the **FAD cofactor** in Alo1. UV-visible absorbance of purified Alo1 protein (yellow color and absorbance \~450 nm) would indicate FAD bound; treating the protein with acid can release the flavin for HPLC identification. If the flavin is covalently attached, it may not release easily, confirming the covalent FAD linkage[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). These biochemical assays will provide direct **proof of Alo1’s enzymatic role** and its catalytic properties, firmly assigning *alo1* the function predicted by sequence.

2. **Structural Modeling and Structural Biology:** To gain insights into Alo1’s structure and to guide mutagenesis, we will leverage **computational modeling** and potentially solve the structure experimentally. An **AlphaFold2 model** of *S. pombe* Alo1 will be generated to predict its 3D conformation. We expect the model to reveal the typical two-domain architecture: a FAD-binding domain (likely an α/β fold binding FAD in an extended conformation) and a smaller helical domain (possibly containing the membrane anchor at its end)[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular). The model should position a conserved histidine near the flavin isoalloxazine ring, consistent with the 8α-histidyl-FAD found in related enzymes. We will validate the model by checking it against known structures: for instance, the recent structural study by Boverio *et al.* (2024) solved representative aldonolactone oxidoreductases[\[27\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=Abstract), which we can use for comparison. If available, a crystal structure of *S. cerevisiae* ALO1 or an ancestor enzyme might exist from that study. We will align our model to any published structures (like rat GULO or plant GalDH which have known structures[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO)). This will help identify **active-site residues** that determine substrate specificity and electron acceptor preference. For example, Boverio *et al.* showed that a flavin-interacting amino acid dictates oxidase vs. dehydrogenase behavior[\[16\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=activities%20and%20substrate%20preferences%20featured,During%20Eukarya%20evolution%2C%20the). We will find the corresponding residue in Alo1’s model and confirm it matches the “oxidase-type” (likely a small residue that allows O₂ access to the flavin). We can test this by mutating Alo1 to the “dehydrogenase-type” residue and seeing if activity with oxygen decreases or if the mutant can partner with cytochrome *c* (though that would be a very exploratory experiment). The structural model will also highlight the **substrate binding pocket**. We will use docking simulations to see how D-arabinono-1,4-lactone likely sits in the active site. Key residues that hydrogen-bond to the lactone or position it for hydride transfer to FAD will be noted. These residues (for instance, a glutamate or tyrosine that might act as a general base to deprotonate the lactone) will be candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to probe their role. By creating point mutants (e.g. E→Q or Y→F) in the *alo1* gene and testing enzyme activity in vitro or the ability to complement *alo1Δ* in vivo, we can **validate the structural predictions**. If a predicted catalytic residue mutation abolishes activity and fails to rescue antioxidant function, it strongly supports the structural model’s accuracy.

For an experimental structure, we will attempt **X-ray crystallography** on the soluble portion of Alo1 (after removing the tail anchor). We can utilize homology to known crystallized enzymes (perhaps co-crystallize Alo1 with a substrate analog or FAD). If crystals are hard to obtain, an alternative is **cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)** given the protein is \~50 kDa (which might be borderline small for single-particle cryo-EM unless part of a larger complex). However, if Alo1 forms homodimers or higher oligomers (to be tested by gel filtration and crosslinking), that might aid cryo-EM. Another approach is to crystallize a close homolog: yeast ALO1s are similar enough that *S. cerevisiae* Alo1 (526 aa) could be tried; it was purified decades ago[\[4\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=D,segment%20and%20a%20covalent%20FAD), so obtaining it in quantity is feasible. A structure would allow us to directly observe the active site geometry, the FAD attachment (covalent link evidence), and the membrane helix orientation. It would also let us visualize any surface patches that might mediate protein-protein interactions (e.g. where Myo2 might bind on Alo1, possibly the surface of the C-terminal domain).

**Validation of the structural model** will come from the biochemical experiments above (successful prediction of which mutants lose function) and possibly from spectroscopy. For example, if the model suggests Alo1’s FAD is covalently bound to His^**X** (some position), we can mutate that His to Ala and see if the purified mutant shows loss of covalent FAD (the flavin would likely not stay attached and might be washed out, yielding an apoenzyme). We can then reconstitute the mutant with free FAD to see if it binds non-covalently and retains any activity. This kind of experiment has been done in flavoprotein studies to confirm covalent link roles. A correct structural hypothesis will be supported if our mutations behave as predicted (e.g. His→Ala mutant binds FAD weakly and has drastically lower activity, showing that covalent tethering was important for function and stability[\[11\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10094636/#:~:text=enzyme,The%20intracellular)).

1. **Addressing Gaps and Future Directions:** Our experiments explicitly target the current knowledge gaps about *alo1*. By analyzing the *alo1Δ* phenotype (step 1), we address **whether alo1 is important for cell fitness and stress survival in fission yeast**, which was previously unknown. The epistasis tests (step 2) will clarify **which pathways alo1 operates in or alongside**, shedding light on its functional context (antioxidant network, oxygen sensing, etc.). Localization and dynamics studies (step 3) directly tackle the question of **where Alo1 acts and whether it has a role in mitochondrial behavior**, an intriguing possibility raised by yeast studies[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775849/#:~:text=organelle%20transporter%20in%20yeast%2C%20as,particularly%20important%20under%20oxidative%20stress) but untested in *S. pombe*. The proteomic approach (step 4) will reveal **new protein partners**, potentially identifying regulators or effectors of Alo1 function (e.g. does it form part of a multi-enzyme complex? does it bind stress sensors or motors?). Transcriptomics and metabolite measurements (step 5) will uncover **how loss of alo1 perturbs cellular metabolism and gene expression**, empirically confirming its role in erythroascorbate production and any compensatory responses. The biochemical assays (step 6) will provide the **definitive proof of Alo1’s enzymatic activity** in fission yeast – currently, all assertions of D-arabinonolactone oxidase activity in *S. pombe* are predictions, so demonstrating this in vitro and in cell extracts will solidify the gene’s annotated function[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48410-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=f5ed6e42-5cc6-414a-a2bb-69306ea67f64#:~:text=glucose,9%20%2C%2045.%20GULO). Finally, the structural modeling and mutagenesis (step 7) address the **structure-function relationship** of Alo1: by confirming key structural features (FAD binding, active site residues, membrane attachment), we move from inference to a concrete molecular understanding. If successful, this could even allow us to rationalize how Alo1’s structure enables any moonlighting function (e.g. a surface loop might be responsible for Myo52 binding – if our model shows a unique extension on Alo1 relative to plant/animal enzymes, that could be a myosin-interacting region to test).

Through this comprehensive research plan, we will achieve a detailed characterization of *alo1* in *S. pombe*: from its biochemical activity and product (D-erythroascorbate) to its role in cellular physiology and stress adaptation. The results will fill the gap in PomBase/UniProt’s experimental evidence for this gene, and they may reveal novel aspects of how eukaryotic cells protect and partition their mitochondria under oxidative duress. Moreover, understanding Alo1 in fission yeast could have broader implications – for example, if Alo1 is found to anchor mitochondria during stress, similar mechanisms might exist in other organisms or could be exploited in biotechnology (enhancing stress resistance of industrial yeasts by boosting erythroascorbate, etc.). In conclusion, our proposed experiments will not only confirm *alo1*’s expected function as a **mitochondrial FAD-linked D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase** producing an ascorbate analog, but also rigorously investigate its cellular roles and mechanistic features, thereby significantly advancing the knowledge of this conserved yet under-studied gene.
