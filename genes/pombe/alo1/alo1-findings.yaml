  title: ORFeome cloning and global analysis of protein localization in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
  findings:
    - statement: Large-scale proteome localization study confirmed mitochondrial localization for 4,431 proteins in S. pombe, representing approximately 90% of the proteome
      supporting_text: "we determined the localization of 4,431 proteins, corresponding to approximately 90% of the fission yeast proteome, by tagging each ORF with the yellow fluorescent protein"

  title: A protein interaction map of the myosin Myo2 reveals a role for Alo1 in mitochondrial inheritance in yeast.
  findings:
    - statement: S. cerevisiae Alo1 physically binds to the myosin V motor protein Myo2
      supporting_text: "To search for novel components involved in this process, we performed a protein fragment complementation screen using the cargo-binding domain of Myo2, the major organelle transporter in yeast, as bait and a genome-wide strain collection expressing yeast proteins as prey. One robust hit was Alo1"
      reference_section_type: ABSTRACT

    - statement: Alo1 is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane in S. cerevisiae
      supporting_text: "Alo1, a poorly characterized D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase located in the mitochondrial outer membrane"

    - statement: Deletion of ALO1 causes abnormal mitochondrial morphology and inheritance defects
      supporting_text: "We found that mutants lacking Alo1 exhibited defects in mitochondrial morphology and inheritance"
      reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
      full_text_unavailable: true
    - statement: Alo1 activity is particularly important for mitochondrial inheritance under oxidative stress conditions
      supporting_text: "During oxidative stress, dysfunctional mitochondria are immobilized in the mother in wild-type cells. Intriguingly, overexpression of ALO1 restored bud-directed transport of mitochondria under these conditions"
      reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
      full_text_unavailable: true
    - statement: Alo1 supports recruitment of Myo2 to mitochondria for proper organelle partitioning
      supporting_text: "We propose that Alo1 supports the recruitment of Myo2 to mitochondria and its activity is particularly important under oxidative stress"
