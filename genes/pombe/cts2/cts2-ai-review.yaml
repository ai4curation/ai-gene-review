  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: "SPAPB1E7.04c is a chitinase-like protein belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family, specifically the chitinase class III subfamily. It is a secreted protein with a signal peptide and contains a GH18 domain. However, it lacks the conserved Glu residue at position 166 that is essential for chitinase activity, making its enzymatic function uncertain. The protein localizes to extracellular regions and fungal-type cell wall, and may be involved in carbohydrate metabolism despite its questionable chitinase activity."
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0005576
    label: extracellular region
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'Extracellular region localization is accurate. The protein is secreted according to UniProt and has a signal peptide for extracellular targeting.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation is well-supported by the presence of a signal peptide and secreted nature documented in UniProt. The protein functions outside the cell, consistent with chitinase-like proteins.'
- term:
    id: GO:0004568
    label: chitinase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is questionable. While the protein belongs to glycosyl hydrolase 18 family, UniProt specifically notes it lacks the conserved Glu residue at position 166 essential for chitinase activity.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'UniProt explicitly states the enzyme activity is unsure due to lack of the essential catalytic glutamate residue. Without experimental evidence of chitinase activity, this annotation should be removed.'
- term:
    id: GO:0005576
    label: extracellular region
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Duplicate extracellular region annotation with different evidence code. The localization is accurate and provides additional computational support.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation is correct and provides additional computational evidence for extracellular localization, complementing the phylogenetic and experimental evidence.'
- term:
    id: GO:0005975
    label: carbohydrate metabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'While the protein belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family and may be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, the specific activity is uncertain due to lack of essential catalytic residue.'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: 'The protein may retain some carbohydrate binding or metabolism functions despite lacking chitinase activity. This broad annotation is plausible but not definitively supported.'
- term:
    id: GO:0016787
    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'General hydrolase activity annotation is questionable given the lack of essential catalytic residue. Without the conserved glutamate, hydrolytic activity is uncertain.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'UniProt states enzyme activity is unsure due to missing catalytic residue. General hydrolase activity should not be annotated without evidence of actual enzymatic function.'
- term:
    id: GO:0016798
    label: hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This specific hydrolase activity is also questionable without the essential catalytic residue. Glycosyl bond hydrolysis requires the conserved glutamate that this protein lacks.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'Even more specifically than general hydrolase activity, glycosyl bond hydrolysis requires the catalytic machinery that UniProt indicates is defective in this protein.'
- term:
    id: GO:0005576
    label: extracellular region
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:39660919
  review:
    summary: 'Direct experimental evidence for extracellular localization. This provides strong support for the secreted nature of the protein.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'IDA evidence provides direct experimental confirmation of extracellular localization, consistent with signal peptide prediction and phylogenetic analysis.'
- term:
    id: GO:0000324
    label: fungal-type vacuole
  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:16823372
  review:
    summary: 'Vacuolar localization conflicts with secreted nature and extracellular localization evidence. This may be from high-throughput data with potential false positives.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'This annotation contradicts the strong evidence for secreted, extracellular localization. The protein has a signal peptide and experimental evidence for extracellular presence.'
- term:
    id: GO:0006032
    label: chitin catabolic process
  evidence_type: IC
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000111
  review:
    summary: 'Chitin catabolic process is inappropriate given the lack of chitinase activity. Without the essential catalytic residue, this protein cannot catabolize chitin.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'This annotation is based on curator inference but contradicts the biochemical evidence. UniProt clearly states the enzyme activity is unsure due to missing catalytic machinery.'
- term:
    id: GO:0009277
    label: fungal-type cell wall
  evidence_type: ISO
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'Fungal-type cell wall localization may be plausible for a chitinase-like protein even without catalytic activity. The protein could associate with cell wall components as a structural protein.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Even without enzymatic activity, chitinase-like proteins can still associate with cell wall components. This localization is consistent with the proteins structural role.'
