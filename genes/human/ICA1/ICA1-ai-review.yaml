description: 'Islet Cell Autoantigen 1 (ICA1/ICA69, ~483 amino acids, ~69 kDa), BAR
  (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing protein with arfaptin homology domain. Cytosolic
  scaffolding protein that dynamically associates with intracellular membranes, particularly
  Golgi complex and immature secretory granules. Critical regulator of dense-core
  secretory vesicle biogenesis in neuroendocrine cells. BAR domain forms dimers that
  sense and induce membrane curvature, facilitating vesicle budding. Functions as
  Rab2 effector - Rab2 (GTPase regulating ER-Golgi trafficking) recruits ICA1 to sites
  of vesicle formation. Forms stable heterodimers with PICK1 (Protein Interacting
  with C Kinase 1), another BAR domain protein. PICK1-ICA1 complexes bind immature
  insulin granules budding from trans-Golgi network (TGN), orchestrating granule formation
  and maturation. ICA1 dissociates once granules mature. Essential for insulin secretion
  - Ica1 knockout mice show impaired insulin granule maturation, elevated blood glucose,
  increased proinsulin-to-insulin ratios. PICK1-deficient mice show complete loss
  of ICA1 protein, indicating interdependence. Beyond endocrine function, ICA1 regulates
  neurotransmitter receptor trafficking in brain. In neurons, ICA1-PICK1 complexes
  control AMPA receptor (AMPAR) delivery to synapses. ICA1-null mice have normal basal
  synaptic transmission but selective impairment in long-term potentiation (LTP) -
  activity-dependent AMPAR insertion during LTP is defective, causing hippocampus-dependent
  learning deficits. ICA1 stabilizes PICK1 localization in neurons. Functions in de
  novo secretory pathway for AMPARs from Golgi to synaptic membrane. Also expressed
  in growth hormone-secreting pituitary cells where it regulates GH vesicle biogenesis.
  Conserved across species - C. elegans homolog RIC-19 required for neuropeptide cargo
  packaging in dense-core vesicles. Discovered as autoantigen in Type 1 diabetes -
  autoantibodies against ICA69 detected in T1D patients. Recent findings link ICA1
  to Alzheimer''s disease: reduced in AD brains, overexpression shifts APP processing
  toward non-amyloidogenic pathway by enhancing PKCα-mediated ADAM10/17 activity.
  Predominantly cytosolic with transient membrane association at Golgi/TGN and secretory
  vesicles. Serves universal role in vesicle budding and cargo delivery across neuroendocrine
  secretory pathways.'
