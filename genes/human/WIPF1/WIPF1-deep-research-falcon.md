### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O43516
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 1; AltName: Full=Protein PRPL-2; AltName: Full=Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-interacting protein; Short=WASP-interacting protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=WIPF1; Synonyms=WASPIP, WIP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the verprolin family. .
- **Key Domains:** PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); WAS/WASL-interacting_domain. (IPR053099); WH2_dom. (IPR003124); WH2 (PF02205)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "WIPF1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'WIPF1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **WIPF1** (gene ID: WIPF1, UniProt: O43516) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target is human WIPF1 (UniProt O43516), encoding WAS/WASL‑interacting protein family member 1 (WIP; aliases WASPIP, WIP). Literature consistently describes WIP as a ~503 aa, proline‑rich, verprolin‑family actin regulator that binds the N‑terminus (WH1/EVH1 domain) of WASP/N‑WASP, contains poly‑proline SH3‑binding segments, and harbors actin‑interacting motifs typical of verprolins; the organism context is Homo sapiens (human) (doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).

Comprehensive research report on WIPF1 (Human)
1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and family: WIPF1 encodes WASP‑interacting protein (WIP), a core member of the verprolin/WIP family that orchestrates actin dynamics in conjunction with WASP/N‑WASP and Arp2/3. WIP is ubiquitously expressed but highest in leukocytes and is essential for immune cell cytoskeletal functions (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).
- Domain architecture and interaction map: WIP is proline‑rich and modular. The C‑terminal WASP‑binding region (approximately aa 451–485) binds the N‑terminal WH1 domain of WASP/N‑WASP; Ser488 can be phosphorylated (e.g., by PKC‑θ) to regulate the WIP–WASP interaction. The central proline‑rich region recruits multiple SH3‑domain partners (e.g., Nck, CrkL) and cortactin, supporting a scaffolding function. The N‑terminal region contains actin‑interacting features (verprolin/WH2‑like properties) enabling G‑actin engagement and actin remodeling (doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).
- Core molecular function: WIP binds and stabilizes WASP (and associates with N‑WASP), scaffolding Arp2/3 activation to produce branched actin networks. Loss of WIP destabilizes WASP (loss of WASP protein in WIP‑deficient human lymphocytes), leading to profound defects in polarity, migration, and immune synapse formation (Blood; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383) (pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024, with synthesis up to 2025)
- Cancer biology: Recent syntheses highlight WIP as a context‑dependent regulator in cancer. Overexpression frequently associates with solid tumor invasion via invadopodia and ECM degradation, with WIP acting both through (N)WASP/Arp2/3 and actin‑independent stabilization of YAP/TAZ; however, WIP/WASP can have tumor‑suppressive roles in certain hematologic malignancies (e.g., selected T‑cell lymphomas). These conclusions integrate primary studies through 2023/2024 (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-11, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 8-9, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-10).
- Immunoactinopathies and WIP deficiency: Clinical literature consolidated in recent reviews underscores autosomal‑recessive WIPF1 loss‑of‑function as a rare “WAS‑like” immunodeficiency (sometimes referenced as WAS2), typically with severe early‑onset infections and immune dysregulation. A case series and reviews up to 2023/2024 document early life lethality in some patients (as early as 11 days–4 weeks), and a reported case with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) expands the phenotype spectrum (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).
- Mechanistic crosstalk with Rho GTPases and DOCK8: Contemporary mechanistic reviews emphasize a DOCK8–WIP–WASP complex linking T‑cell receptor (TCR) signals to actin cytoskeleton control, and broader crosstalk with Rho family GTPases to regulate migration and invasion in a cell‑type‑specific manner (Small GTPases; doi:10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522, Jan 2020; https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522) (anton2020crosstalkbetweenwip pages 6-7). Although the review is earlier, it synthesizes mechanistic work still foundational to 2023–2024 studies.

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostics: For suspected inborn errors of immunity with severe early‑onset infections/atopy and cytoskeletal phenotypes, targeted sequencing or exome/genome analysis of WIPF1 is clinically indicated. The pathognomonic cellular findings include loss of WIP and secondary loss of WASP protein with severe migration and immune synapse defects in patient lymphocytes (Blood; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383) (pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).
- Therapeutics: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is discussed as a curative option for severe WIPF1 deficiency in clinical reviews, analogous to other immunoactinopathies; preclinical/mechanistic oncology literature positions WIP pathway components (e.g., (N)WASP/Arp2/3, YAP/TAZ axes) as putative targets or biomarkers for invasion/aggressiveness, but there are no active clinical trials directly targeting WIP as of the latest synthesis (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative synthesis: The 2025 Cytoskeleton review by Alonso‑Eiras and Antón, long‑standing experts in WIP biology, provides an integrated and critical analysis of WIP’s dual roles across immunity and oncology, highlighting context‑dependent tumor promotion versus suppression and urging systematic validation of WIP as a potential aggressiveness biomarker across solid tumors (doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 8-9).
- Mechanistic consensus: The Small GTPases review emphasizes WIP’s centrality at the intersection of WASP/N‑WASP, Rho GTPases, and DOCK8 in T cells and invasive structures, a view consistent with accumulated functional data and widely accepted in the field (doi:10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522, Jan 2020; https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522) (anton2020crosstalkbetweenwip pages 6-7).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Human WIP deficiency case quantitation: A documented human WIPF1 LoF (homozygous stop‑gain c.C373T; p.R125X) abolished WIP protein and induced loss of WASP expression in patient lymphocytes, with severe T‑cell defects (e.g., profound CD4+ lymphopenia; reduced naïve T cells; impaired chemotaxis to CCL19/CXCL12; aberrant actin polarization). This study provides concrete cellular phenotypes and directly evidenced WIP’s stabilizing effect on WASP (Blood; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383) (pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4).
- Clinical timeline observations: Reviews collating reported cases indicate early‑life severe infections, with some fatalities in the first weeks of life (11 days–4 weeks), underscoring severity and need for rapid diagnosis (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4).
- Mechanistic nodes and modifications: WIP Ser488 phosphorylation can disrupt WIP–WASP binding, affecting WASP stability/localization, illustrating a regulatory post‑translational control point relevant to signaling contexts (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3).

Functional role and pathways
- Primary functional role: WIP is a scaffolding adapter for actin remodeling. It binds WASP/N‑WASP via its C‑terminus to stabilize these nucleation‑promoting factors and cooperates with them to activate Arp2/3‑mediated branched actin assembly. WIP also binds actin/monomeric actin via verprolin/WH2‑like features and coordinates SH3‑domain partners (e.g., Nck, CrkL) and cortactin at actin‑rich structures. These actions are essential for formation/function of immune synapses, podosomes, invadopodia, lamellipodia, and filopodia (doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-10, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).
- Pathway context: In lymphocytes, WIP sits in a DOCK8–WIP–WASP complex that relays TCR signaling to actin cytoskeleton rearrangements necessary for synapse assembly and motility; broader crosstalk with Rho GTPases modulates migration/invasion programs in other lineages (Small GTPases; doi:10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522, Jan 2020; https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522) (anton2020crosstalkbetweenwip pages 6-7). WIP‑dependent stabilization of WASP is critical; in human WIP deficiency, WASP protein is lost, producing severe polarity and chemotaxis defects (Blood; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383) (pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4).

Cellular and subcellular localization
- WIP localizes to cortical actin, immune synapses, podosomes/invadopodia, and other actin‑rich protrusions (filopodia/lamellipodia), often in complex with WASP/N‑WASP and cortactin; these localizations underlie its roles in migration, adhesion, and matrix remodeling (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-10, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5). In patient lymphocytes, WIP loss disrupts front–rear polarity and immune synapse assembly, demonstrating its requirement at these sites (Blood; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383) (pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4).

Human genetics and disease relevance
- Biallelic WIPF1 loss‑of‑function causes a WAS‑like primary immunodeficiency (autosomal recessive), with features including severe early‑onset infections (often viral), lymphopenia (especially naïve T cells), immune synapse defects, variable thrombocytopenia, and occasionally malignancy (e.g., JMML). Cellularly, WIP loss ablates WASP protein and cripples actin‑dependent immune functions (Cytoskeleton review; doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935; Blood case report; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).

Notes on 2023–2024 literature priorities
- While the most directly citable mechanistic and clinical anchors arise from earlier foundational work and a 2025 expert synthesis, the conclusions reflect and integrate studies published through 2023–2024 on WIP’s roles in cancer invasion (invadopodia), YAP/TAZ stabilization, and expanded immunodeficiency phenotypes. Where specific 2023–2024 primary references are needed for precision beyond this synthesis, further targeted retrieval is warranted; however, the curated review and human LoF case provide authoritative grounding for current understanding and applications (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-11, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 8-9, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-10, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5).

Summary
Human WIPF1 encodes WIP, a verprolin‑family, proline‑rich adapter that binds and stabilizes WASP/N‑WASP and scaffolds SH3‑domain partners and cortactin to promote Arp2/3‑dependent actin remodeling at immune synapses, endocytic/podosome/invadopodial sites, and cortical protrusions. Loss of WIP causes a severe WAS‑like immunodeficiency by eliminating WASP protein and disrupting lymphocyte polarity, chemotaxis, and synapse formation. In cancer, WIP commonly promotes invasion via invadopodia and can stabilize pro‑oncogenic YAP/TAZ, though tumor‑suppressive roles exist in select hematologic contexts. Clinically, WIPF1 sequencing supports diagnosis of rare immunoactinopathies; HSCT is a considered therapy in severe deficiency, and WIP pathway components are candidate biomarkers/targets for tumor aggressiveness assessment (doi:10.1002/cm.21935, Sep 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21935; doi:10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383, Oct 2017; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-04-777383; doi:10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522, Jan 2020; https://doi.org/10.1080/21541248.2017.1390522) (alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 1-3, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 3-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-11, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 8-9, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 10-10, pfajfer2017wipdeficiencyseverely pages 1-4, alonso‐eiras2025multifacetedroleof pages 4-5, anton2020crosstalkbetweenwip pages 6-7).
