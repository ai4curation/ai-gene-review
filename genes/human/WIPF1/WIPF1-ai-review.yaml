description: >-
  WIPF1 (WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 1, also known as WIP) encodes
  a 503-residue proline-rich adapter protein of the verprolin family that plays
  essential roles in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. WIP functions primarily
  as a stabilizer and localizer of WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and
  N-WASP (WASL), binding through its C-terminal WASP-binding domain (aa 451-485)
  to the WH1/EVH1 domain of WASP/N-WASP. This binding protects WASP from
  calpain-mediated degradation and facilitates WASP localization to sites of
  actin polymerization, including podosomes, immune synapses, and invadopodia.
  WIP contains a WH2 domain that directly binds G-actin, multiple proline-rich
  regions that recruit SH3 domain-containing partners (NCK1/NCK2, GRB2, CrkL,
  cortactin), and serves as a scaffold for Arp2/3-dependent branched actin
  nucleation. Loss-of-function mutations cause Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 2 (WAS2),
  a severe immunodeficiency characterized by impaired T-cell function, immune
  synapse defects, and secondary loss of WASP protein. WIP is essential for
  podosome formation in dendritic cells and macrophages, immune synapse assembly
  in T cells, and proper lymphocyte chemotaxis and migration.

      label: cytoskeletal anchor activity
    description: >-
      WIP anchors WASP and N-WASP at sites of actin polymerization, including
      podosomes in dendritic cells and macrophages, immune synapses in T cells,
      and cortical actin structures. This anchoring function is essential for
      proper WASP localization and is independent of WIP's chaperone function.

      - reference_id: PMID:17141616
        supporting_text: "These results indicate that WIP not only protects WASP from
          calpain cleavage but also facilitates the localization of WASP to sites
          of actin polymerization"

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0044183
      label: protein folding chaperone
    description: >-
      WIP functions as a molecular chaperone for WASP, stabilizing the protein
      and protecting it from calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation. This
      chaperone function is mediated by the C-terminal WASP-binding domain of
      WIP that wraps around the WH1 domain of WASP.

        supporting_text: "WIP prevents WASP cleavage by calpain in DCs since inhibition
          of this protease in WIP-/- DCs resulted in major recovery of WASP expression"

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0003779
      label: actin binding
    description: >-
      WIP directly binds G-actin through its N-terminal WH2 domain (aa 32-49).
      This binding is essential for WIP's role in promoting actin polymerization
      and maintaining actin cytoskeleton integrity, particularly in T cells.

          mutant that lacks the actin binding motif, increased polymerized actin content"

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0017124
      label: SH3 domain binding
    description: >-
      WIP's proline-rich regions bind SH3 domains of multiple signaling adaptors
      including NCK1/NCK2, GRB2, CrkL, cortactin, and TOCA-1/FNBP1L. This
      scaffold function integrates upstream signals to WASP/N-WASP activation.

        supporting_text: "The SH3 domain of C. elegans TOCA-1 is also functional and
          able to associate with one of the known mammalian ligands, N-WASP"

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0003779
      label: actin binding
    description: >-
      WIP is essential for podosome assembly in myeloid cells (dendritic cells,
      macrophages). WIP organizes F-actin into discrete foci and enables clustering
      of integrins and associated proteins into the characteristic podosome ring
      structure around the actin core.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Does WIP have functions independent of WASP/N-WASP binding?

  - question: >-
      What is the role of WIP phosphorylation (Ser488) in regulating WIP-WASP interaction?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Determine the structure of full-length WIP or WIP-WASP complex. Only the WH2
      domain and C-terminal WASP-binding region structures are known. Full structure
      would reveal how WIP coordinates its multiple functions.

  - description: >-
      Investigate WIP function in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. WIP is
      overexpressed in some cancers and promotes invadopodia formation. Detailed
      mechanistic studies could reveal therapeutic targets.
