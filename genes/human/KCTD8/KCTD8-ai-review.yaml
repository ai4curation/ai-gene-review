description: >-
  KCTD8 is a BTB/POZ domain-containing protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of GABA-B
  (metabotropic GABA) receptors. It belongs to the KCTD8/12/16 subfamily that shares a conserved
  domain architecture comprising an N-terminal T1-type BTB domain for receptor binding, an H1
  domain for G-protein beta-gamma binding, and (uniquely among KCTDs along with KCTD16) a distal
  H2 domain. KCTD8 forms pentamers that bind the intracellular C-terminus of GABA-B2 subunit,
  modulating receptor signaling kinetics. Unlike KCTD12/12b, KCTD8 lacks the canonical
  desensitization motif, resulting in more sustained GABA-B signaling responses. KCTD8 is
  enriched at presynaptic active zones in specific brain circuits (notably the medial
  habenula-interpeduncular nucleus pathway) where it binds Cav2.3 calcium channels and regulates
  neurotransmitter release probability. It accelerates GABA-B receptor activation onset through
  cooperative G-protein beta-gamma binding while promoting relatively non-desensitizing signaling
  compared to KCTD12-containing complexes.

      KCTD8 is an integral component of native GABA-B receptor complexes. Schwenk et al. (2010)
      demonstrated that KCTD8 co-purifies with GABA-B1/2 from brain tissue, establishing it as
      part of receptor heteromultimers. This IBA annotation is appropriate and supported by
      phylogenetic analysis consistent with the finding that KCTD8/12/16 are conserved auxiliary
      GABA-B receptor subunits across mammals (file:human/KCTD8/KCTD8-deep-research-falcon.md).

      While the annotation to GO:0043235 (receptor complex) is correct, there is a more specific
      term available. KCTD8 specifically associates with G protein-coupled GABA receptors
      (GABA-B receptors). GO:1902712 (G protein-coupled GABA receptor complex) is the appropriate
      specific term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      KCTD8 regulates GABA-B receptor signaling kinetics by binding both the GABA-B2 C-terminus
      (via BTB domain) and G-protein beta-gamma subunits (via H1 domain). Zheng et al. (2019)
      showed that KCTDs shape activation rise times and desensitization of GABA-B-evoked GIRK
      currents. KCTD8 specifically promotes non-desensitizing or slowly desensitizing responses
      due to the absence of the KCTD12 desensitization motif.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately captures the core regulatory function of KCTD8 in modulating
      GABA-B (a GPCR) signaling. The protein alters signaling kinetics through cooperative
      G-protein beta-gamma binding and by lacking the desensitization motif present in KCTD12.

          KCTD family members shape rise times and desensitization of GABAB-evoked GIRK currents;
          KCTD proteins bind G-beta-gamma and can rapidly strip G proteins from GIRKs to induce
          desensitization. KCTD12/12b harbor an H1 desensitization motif, whereas KCTD8 (and
          KCTD16) lack this motif and thus support comparatively non-desensitizing or slowly
          desensitizing responses.
