description: Beta-actin is a highly conserved cytoplasmic actin isoform that polymerizes to form actin filaments (F-actin), a major component of the cytoskeleton. It functions in cell motility, cell division, cytokinesis, and maintenance of cell shape. ACTB also has nuclear functions, participating in chromatin remodeling as a component of BAF/SWI-SNF complexes, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. It associates with the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC) to regulate microtubule nucleation. The protein has intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity essential for actin dynamics.
