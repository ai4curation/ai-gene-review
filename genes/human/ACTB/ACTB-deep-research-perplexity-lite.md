## Question

Research the ACTB (ACTB) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **ACTB gene** encodes **β-actin**, a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein essential for cell structure, motility, and numerous cellular processes[2][3][5][8][9][10][12][13]. β-actin is ubiquitously expressed in nonmuscle cells and plays a central role in maintaining cellular architecture and function.

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  β-actin is a major component of the **actin cytoskeleton**, providing structural support, enabling cell motility, division, and intracellular transport[2][3][5][8][9][10][12][13].  
  It exists in two forms:
  - **G-actin (monomeric)**
  - **F-actin (filamentous)**  
  These forms dynamically interconvert, crucial for processes like migration, contraction, and cytokinesis[1][2][4].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  β-actin is involved in:
  - **Cell migration and motility**
  - **Cytokinesis**
  - **Chromatin remodeling**
  - **Transcriptional regulation**
  - **DNA repair**
  - **Signal transduction**
  - **Assembly of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC), regulating microtubule nucleation**[3][10]

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  β-actin is found:
  - **Throughout the cytoplasm** as part of the cytoskeleton[2][8][9][10][12][13]
  - **In the nucleus**, where it regulates gene transcription and DNA repair[3][7]

---

### 2. Protein Domains

- **Actin Domain:**  
  β-actin contains a highly conserved actin domain responsible for ATP binding, polymerization, and interaction with actin-binding proteins[10].
- **3′-UTR “zipcode” sequence:**  
  The ACTB transcript has a unique 3′-UTR “zipcode” that targets mRNA to subcellular regions, regulating translation and spatial protein synthesis[1][4].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Protein-Protein Interactions:**  
  β-actin interacts with:
  - **Actin-binding proteins** (e.g., profilin, cofilin, tropomyosin)
  - **Chaperonin complexes** (e.g., CCT for folding)
  - **Transcription complexes** (RNA polymerases, chromatin remodelers)[7]
  - **Gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC)** for microtubule nucleation[3][10]
  - **Other partners:** protein disulfide isomerase, MARCKS, chorein, AIM1, and viral proteins (e.g., measles virus matrix protein)[7]

- **Post-translational Modifications:**  
  - **Methylation** (SETD3-mediated)
  - **S-nitrosylation** (nitric oxide–dependent)[7]

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Cancer:**  
  - **Upregulation** of ACTB is observed in many cancers (liver, melanoma, renal, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, leukemia, lymphoma)[2].
  - **Abnormal expression and polymerization** contribute to cytoskeletal changes linked to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis[2].

- **Genetic Disorders:**  
  - **Mutations in ACTB** cause severe developmental disorders, including Baraitser-Winter syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and brain malformations[6].
  - **Other associations:** cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders[2][6].

---

### 5. Recent Developments and Expert Analysis

- **2023–2024 Research:**  
  - Studies confirm that **β-actin protein is dispensable for most cellular functions**, but the **ACTB transcript’s nucleotide sequence and regulated translation (via the zipcode)** are essential for proper cellular localization and function[1][4].
  - **Compensatory mechanisms** exist: when β-actin is absent, γ-actin can substitute functionally, but transcript targeting remains critical[1][4].
  - **ACTB is a reference gene** in gene expression studies due to its consistent expression[2].

---

### 6. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Expression:**  
  - **ACTB is highly expressed** in most tissues, especially nonmuscle cells[2][8].
  - **Total actin protein levels** remain constant across genotypes due to protein-based feedback mechanisms[1].

**Summary:**  
**ACTB/β-actin** is a fundamental cytoskeletal protein with diverse roles in cell structure, motility, gene regulation, and disease. Its function is tightly regulated at both the protein and transcript level, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer and genetic disorders. Recent research highlights the importance of transcript localization and regulated translation for its cellular functions.
