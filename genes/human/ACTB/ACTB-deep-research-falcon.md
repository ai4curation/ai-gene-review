## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P60709
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Actin, cytoplasmic 1; EC=3.6.4.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68137}; AltName: Full=Beta-actin; Contains: RecName: Full=Actin, cytoplasmic 1, N-terminally processed;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ACTB;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the actin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Actin. (IPR004000); Actin/actin-like_CS. (IPR020902); Actin_CS. (IPR004001); ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Actin (PF00022)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ACTB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ACTB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ACTB** (gene ID: ACTB, UniProt: P60709) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Identity verified: ACTB (UniProt P60709) encodes human cytoplasmic beta-actin, a core actin-family ATPase (EC 3.6.4.-) that polymerizes into F-actin; recent structural and functional literature aligns with actin-family/domain annotations (Actin, ATPase_NBD) and human organism context. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report on human ACTB (beta-actin)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and core function: Beta-actin is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed nonmuscle actin isoform that exists as monomeric G-actin and polymeric F-actin. It is an ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP following polymerization; ATP/ADP state and filament end structure underlie asymmetric dynamics (“treadmilling”) with preferential subunit addition at barbed ends and dissociation at pointed ends. CapZ caps barbed ends and tropomodulin caps pointed ends to block exchange. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 1-2, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 4-6)
- Subcellular roles and localization: In the cytoplasm and cortex, ACTB participates in lamellipodia and focal adhesion dynamics; in the nucleus, polymerized actin contributes to chromatin accessibility, histone-mark redistribution, and differentiation responses. Nuclear actin also functions with actin-related proteins in chromatin-remodeling complexes and participates in mechanotransduction relayed via LINC from cytoplasmic F-actin. (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- Housekeeping status and caveat: Although widely used as a reference gene/protein, ACTB expression varies with cell type, disease and experimental perturbations; empirical validation is required before use as a normalizer. (adhikariUnknownyearhousekeepinggeneand pages 7-10, zareinejad2024exploringheterogeneousexpression pages 15-16)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Near-atomic cryo-EM of filament ends and capping (Science 2023; commentary 2023): Carman et al. resolved free and capped ends, showing flat F-actin-like terminal protomers at the barbed end (free barbed 3.30 Å) and G-actin–like twisted conformations at the pointed end (free pointed 2.84 Å). CapZ binding to the barbed end is captured at 2.79 Å and leaves barbed-end protomers largely flat while CapZ undergoes conformational change; tropomodulin binding at the pointed end (3.26 Å) forces the second protomer into an F-actin-like state, forming a knot-like interaction with the first three subunits. These conformations explain end-specific kinetics and capping mechanisms. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg6812 (Jun 2023); commentary: https://doi.org/10.1002/cm.21770 (Aug 2023). (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, carman2023structuresofthe pages 7-10, carman2023structuresofthe pages 3-4, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 1-2, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 4-6)
- Nuclear actin regulating chromatin accessibility (Nature Communications 2024): In human mesenchymal stem cells, Arp2/3 inhibition (CK666) decreased nuclear actin structure and broadly altered chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq at 24 h; cytochalasin D increased nuclear actin and induced distinct accessibility changes. CK666 reduced pericentric H3K9me3, while cytoD caused central redistribution of H3K27me3; Arp4 knockdown unpacked chromatin but only modestly increased transcription, implicating actin–Arp4 in transcriptional control. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48580-y (May 2024). (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- Isoform-specific nuclear roles (IJMS 2024): In A549 cells, β-actin knockdown increased nuclear area, decreased lamin A/C and increased lamin B2, with histone mark shifts (↓H3K9me2, ↑H3K9ac) and KDM3A upregulation (~1.6-fold), whereas γ-actin knockdown produced opposite lamina/mark effects, indicating isoform-specific control of chromatin compaction and nuclear mechanics. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413607 (Dec 2024). (shagieva2024divergentcontributionof pages 5-10)
- Cancer-focused expression heterogeneity (BMC Urology 2024): A new monoclonal antibody (6D6) recognized an ACTB isoform and revealed heterogeneous ACTB staining across bladder cancer lines and tissues, with strong binding in epithelial cells and weak/none in stromal/endothelial/smooth muscle cells. In silico pan-cancer analyses (GEPIA2) reported tumor-vs-normal differences in 9/31 cancers with largest fold-changes in PAAD (12.9×), TGCT (4.6×) and GBM (4.1×), and associations with overall survival in multiple cancers. URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-024-01489-6 (Jun 2024). (zareinejad2024exploringheterogeneousexpression pages 11-14)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Structural biology benchmarks and models: The 2023 cryo-EM maps deliver atomic-level end-state models for simulation and inhibitor design targeting capping-protein interfaces (CapZ at barbed end; tropomodulin at pointed end), enabling hypothesis-driven manipulation of filament dynamics in vitro and in cells. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, carman2023structuresofthe pages 4-6, carman2023structuresofthe pages 3-4)
- Nuclear actin as a regulatory lever: Pharmacological manipulation (CK666 vs cytochalasin D) and genetic perturbation (Arp4 KD) demonstrate practical routes to tune chromatin accessibility and histone mark distributions in stem-cell differentiation paradigms, with implications for regenerative medicine protocols. (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- Diagnostics/biomarker development: The 6D6 monoclonal antibody recognizing an ACTB isoform distinguished epithelial tumor cells and showed heterogeneous expression, suggesting utility in tumor stratification panels or as a counterstain to avoid stromal cross-reactivity. (zareinejad2024exploringheterogeneousexpression pages 11-14)
- Methodological controls: Continued caution against universal use of ACTB as a housekeeping normalizer; selection must be validated per tissue and perturbation, given documented variability in cancers and differentiation. (adhikariUnknownyearhousekeepinggeneand pages 7-10, zareinejad2024exploringheterogeneousexpression pages 15-16)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural consensus: Science 2023 provides definitive structural rationales for asymmetric actin treadmilling—barbed-end flat protomers favor addition; pointed-end G-actin-like protomers favor dissociation—while capping proteins enforce steric and conformational blocks; the Cytoskeleton commentary integrates these findings into the dynamic-filament paradigm. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 1-2)
- Nuclear actin paradigm: Nature Communications 2024 positions nuclear β-actin as an active regulator of chromatin architecture and accessibility rather than a passive structural component. Distinct responses to Arp2/3 inhibition versus barbed-end toxins underscore that not all actin-targeting agents produce equivalent nuclear outcomes. (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- Isoform nuance: Differential β- vs γ-actin depletion effects on lamins and histone marks in cancer cells caution against treating cytoplasmic actins as functionally interchangeable, with implications for interpreting ACTB perturbations and normalizer choice. (shagieva2024divergentcontributionof pages 5-10)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Cryo-EM resolutions and conformational metrics: Free barbed end 3.30 Å; CapZ-capped barbed 2.79 Å; free pointed 2.84 Å; Tmod-capped pointed 3.26 Å. Observed shifts included ~2.0 Å C-terminus movement at barbed end and ~15° CapZβ rotation; short-pitch pair splaying ~1.5 Å and ~2° rotation at terminal subunit. Publication date: June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg6812. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 3-4, carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14)
- Nuclear chromatin metrics: CK666 (Arp2/3 inhibitor) reduced nuclear actin structure and significantly altered ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility at 24 h; CK666 decreased pericentric H3K9me3 foci, while cytochalasin D redistributed H3K27me3 centrally—consistent with distinct differentiation outcomes. Publication date: May 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48580-y. (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- Isoform-specific effects: β-actin knockdown increased nuclear area and shifted lamins (↓A-type; ↑lamin B2) with histone PTM changes (↓H3K9me2; ↑H3K9ac); KDM3A mRNA up ~1.6-fold in β-actin–depleted A549 cells. Publication date: Dec 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413607. (shagieva2024divergentcontributionof pages 5-10)
- Cancer expression heterogeneity: Pan-cancer GEPIA2 analysis found tumor-vs-normal ACTB fold-changes: PAAD 12.9×, TGCT 4.6×, GBM 4.1×; survival associations in GBM, HNSC, KIRC, LGG, LIHC, LUAD, MESO, SKCM, UVM.

Conclusions and outlook
- ACTB’s canonical cytoskeletal role is now grounded by 2023 cryo-EM end-state structures that mechanistically explain treadmilling and capping, refining models of lamellipodial dynamics and capping-protein regulation. (carman2023structuresofthe pages 10-14, barrie2023conformationofactin pages 1-2)
- Nuclear ACTB is an active modulator of chromatin access and histone landscapes; selective perturbation of actin assembly pathways can steer differentiation, highlighting opportunities and caveats for pharmacological modulation. (sen2024nuclearactinstructure pages 1-2)
- In cancer, ACTB expression is heterogeneous and clinically associated with outcomes in multiple tumor types; dedicated antibodies (e.g., 6D6) and careful normalization strategies are practical steps to improve biomarker robustness.
