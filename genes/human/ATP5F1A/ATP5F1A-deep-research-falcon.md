## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P25705
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ATP synthase F(1) complex subunit alpha, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:823}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATP5F1A {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:823}; Synonyms=ATP5A, ATP5A1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:823}, ATP5AL2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:823}, ATPM {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:823};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
- **Key Domains:** ATP_synth_asu-like_sf. (IPR023366); ATP_synth_asu_C. (IPR000793); ATP_synth_asu_C_sf. (IPR038376); ATP_synth_F1_a_nt-bd_dom. (IPR033732); ATP_synth_F1_asu. (IPR005294)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5F1A" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5F1A' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5F1A** (gene ID: ATP5F1A, UniProt: P25705) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: ATP5F1A (UniProt P25705)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and nomenclature. ATP5F1A encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial F1 sector of F1FO-ATP synthase (Complex V) in Homo sapiens; it is a member of the conserved F-type ATPase alpha/beta chains family. The alpha subunit forms part of the catalytic head (F1) and provides noncatalytic nucleotide-binding sites within the α3β3 hexamer (the β subunits host the catalytic sites). This aligns with the UniProt description for P25705 and with structural/mechanistic literature on mammalian ATP synthase (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4). Mechanistic reviews and experimental work describe the F1 composition as α3β3γδε, consistent with ATP5F1A’s role in the α3β3 head (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4).
- Cellular localization. ATP5F1A resides in the mitochondrial matrix-facing F1 domain that is attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane-embedded FO sector; thus its functional location is the matrix side of the inner membrane (Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).
- Core biochemical function. Within F1FO-ATP synthase, chemiosmotic proton flow through FO drives rotation of the central stalk and conformational cycling in α/β pairs (binding-change mechanism) to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi; the alpha subunits contribute noncatalytic nucleotide-binding and structural roles essential for the β-subunit catalytic chemistry (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758; Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4, chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Human cancer signaling to ATP5F1A via tyrosine phosphorylation. A 2023 study showed the non-receptor tyrosine kinase TNK2/ACK1 phosphorylates ATP5F1A at Y243/Y246 (mature protein Y200/Y203), stabilizes complex V, augments mitochondrial energy output, and diminishes binding to the physiological inhibitor ATPIF1; TNK2 inhibition reverses these effects and induces mitophagy-based tumor suppression in prostate cancer models (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).
- IF1 (ATPIF1) regulation and mechanism refinements. 2024 work and curated reviews emphasize that IF1 binds the F1/OSCP region of ATP synthase to block ATP hydrolysis in a pH-regulated manner, with mitochondrial PKA-dependent phosphorylation of IF1 preventing its inhibitory binding; recent cellular studies further highlight IF1’s roles in bioenergetics, oligomerization, and stress adaptation (review/overview sources compiled within 2024 texts) (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758; Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655; 2024 review highlighting PKA modulation cited therein) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34).
- Therapeutic peptide strategies targeting the IF1–OSCP interface. In 2024, mitochondria-targeting peptides designed to displace IF1 from OSCP modulated the mitochondrial permeability transition in HeLa cells and altered apoptosis susceptibility without impairing respiration, suggesting tractable modulation of ATP synthase–IF1 interactions for therapy (IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).
- Structural advances. Recent cryo-EM studies (2019–2020 and further summarized in 2024 articles) revealed mammalian ATP synthase dimer/tetramer assemblies and IF1-bound states, reinforcing current models of α3β3 head architecture and peripheral/central stalk interfaces, which define ATP5F1A’s positioning in the complex (Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology applications. The TNK2–ATP5F1A phosphorylation axis identifies a mitochondrial bioenergetic dependency in prostate cancer, with a small-molecule TNK2 inhibitor ((R)-9b) triggering cancer-selective mitophagy; phosphorylation state (p-Y-ATP5F1A) emerges as a potential biomarker and pharmacodynamic readout (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).
- Peptide modulators of IF1–OSCP. Mitochondria-targeted peptides that interfere with IF1–OSCP binding can tune mitochondrial permeability transition/apoptosis in cancer cells, pointing to prototype therapeutics modulating ATP synthase regulation rather than the catalytic core (IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus. Contemporary structural/mechanistic syntheses reaffirm the binding-change/rotary catalysis mechanism, the α3β3 architecture, and the matrix-exposed localization of F1, placing ATP5F1A in noncatalytic yet essential nucleotide-binding/structural roles that coordinate with β catalytic sites and central/peripheral stalks (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758; Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18).
- Regulation by IF1 and phosphorylation pathways. Reviews and recent experiments converge on IF1 as a physiological, pH- and phosphorylation-regulated brake on ATP hydrolysis that can influence cristae organization and stress adaptation. Phosphorylation pathways that modify ATP5F1A itself (TNK2) or IF1 (PKA) exemplify how signaling impinges on OXPHOS output and mitochondrial resilience in disease contexts including cancer (review references collated within 2024 sources; Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34, chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Site-specific phosphorylation of ATP5F1A. TNK2 directly phosphorylates ATP5F1A at Y243/Y246; phospho-specific antibodies and mutational analyses (Y243/246A) demonstrate reduced basal OCR and membrane potential when phosphorylation is prevented, quantitatively linking p-Y-ATP5F1A to increased respiratory capacity in prostate cancer cells (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).
- Modulation of permeability transition by IF1–OSCP peptides. In situ peptide treatments in HeLa cells altered mitochondrial permeability transition metrics without depressing respiration, separating apoptotic control from ATP production and supporting a feasible therapeutic window (IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16).

Detailed mechanistic role of ATP5F1A within F1FO-ATP synthase
- Catalytic role and substrate specificity. The enzyme ATP synthase catalyzes ADP + Pi → ATP; catalysis occurs at β subunits, whereas α subunits (ATP5F1A) provide noncatalytic nucleotide-binding sites and structural scaffolding necessary for binding-change transitions and torque coupling from the central stalk (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4).
- Structural interfaces. ATP5F1A subunits alternate with β around the central stalk (γ/ε), contact the peripheral stator via δ/OSCP, and participate in the α/β head that couples to the FO rotor/stator; these interfaces are supported by mammalian cryo-EM organizations including IF1-bound states (Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).
- Localization. ATP5F1A operates in the mitochondrial matrix-facing F1 domain attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane (lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Regulation of ATP5F1A/ATP synthase
- Endogenous inhibitor IF1/ATPIF1. IF1 binds the F1/OSCP region to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis in the reverse mode; its inhibitory effect is pH-dependent and attenuated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of IF1, releasing ATP synthase activity (bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758; review citations compiled there; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4, konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).
- Oncogenic kinase regulation. TNK2/ACK1 phosphorylation of ATP5F1A increases complex V stability and mitochondrial energy output while reducing ATPIF1 binding; TNK2 inhibition ((R)-9b) reverses these effects and induces mitophagy with anti-tumor consequences in prostate cancer models (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).

Higher-order organization and functional implications
- Dimers/oligomers and cristae. Mammalian ATP synthase forms dimers and higher oligomers that sculpt cristae; IF1-bound states and peripheral stalk/OSCP interactions influence oligomerization and stress responses, reinforcing the architectural context for ATP5F1A function (Cells, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13060551; IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Human disease associations
- Mitochondrial disease (general). Reviews summarizing complex V defects link ATP synthase subunits/assembly factors to encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, and Leigh-like syndromes; while gene-by-gene statistics for ATP5F1A variants were not retrieved here, the disease literature situates ATP5F1A within essential Complex V function where subunit dysfunction is pathologic (review overview 2024 with human disease references) (konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34).
- Cancer. Phosphorylation of ATP5F1A by TNK2 supports prostate cancer cell survival and bioenergetics; inhibiting this axis yields mitophagy-based tumor control, highlighting p‑Y‑ATP5F1A as a candidate biomarker/vulnerability (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).

Real-world implementations and translational potential
- Pharmacologic kinase targeting. TNK2 inhibitors (e.g., (R)-9b) are leveraged to collapse the ATP5F1A phosphorylation-dependent energy gain and trigger mitophagy in tumors, suggesting a “mitocan” strategy targeting OXPHOS regulation (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).
- Peptide-based modulators. Cell-permeable peptides aimed at the IF1–OSCP interface provide proof-of-concept for modulating apoptosis via ATP synthase regulatory contacts without impairing respiratory flux, with implications for anti-cancer therapy development (IJMS, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Mandatory verification
- Gene symbol/protein description match. ATP5F1A encodes the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 alpha subunit in human; the literature above directly uses “ATP5F1A (ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha)” and places it in the F1 catalytic head, matching the UniProt-provided description (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4).
- Organism. All functional/structural claims cited here pertain to mammalian/human ATP synthase or human cancer models, satisfying Homo sapiens relevance (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).
- Family/domains alignment. Sources consistently describe ATP5F1A as the F-type ATPase alpha subunit in the α/β family, embedded in the α3β3 head of F1, agreeing with the ATPase alpha/beta chain family/domain annotations (Autophagy, Jul 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2022.2103961; bioRxiv, Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.06.606758) (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4, lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4).
- Ambiguity check. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found within the cited human-focused sources; references clearly denote ATP5F1A as the mitochondrial F1 alpha subunit in human contexts (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18).

Limitations and data gaps
- Specific human genetics statistics (e.g., counts of pathogenic ATP5F1A variants, prevalence) and comprehensive 2023–2024 expression-dataset meta-analyses were not retrieved in the gathered evidence. The disease connections summarized above reflect authoritative overviews rather than ATP5F1A-variant case series; targeted genetics resources would be needed for variant-level statistics (konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34).

Conclusion
ATP5F1A (P25705) is the human mitochondrial F1 alpha subunit, essential for the α3β3 catalytic head that executes binding-change catalysis; it localizes to the matrix-exposed F1 domain of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recent work illuminates regulatory control by IF1 and oncogenic signaling via TNK2 phosphorylation of ATP5F1A, with translational avenues emerging from kinase inhibitors and peptides that modulate the IF1–OSCP interface. While comprehensive 2023–2024 variant statistics were not captured here, the assembled evidence underscores ATP5F1A’s central biochemical role, regulatory interactions, and growing clinical relevance in cancer bioenergetics and mitochondrial stress responses (chouhan2023tnk2ack1mediatedphosphorylationof pages 2-4, lerouley2024novelif1mechanism pages 1-4, lauterboeck2024if1promotescellular pages 17-18, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17, konickova2024patofyziologickédopadyporuch pages 32-34).
