description: >-
  ATP5F1A encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (Complex V).
  Three copies of the alpha subunit alternate with three beta subunits (ATP5F1B) to form the
  alpha3-beta3 hexameric F1 catalytic head, which faces the mitochondrial matrix. Crucially,
  the alpha subunit provides the NON-CATALYTIC nucleotide-binding sites; catalytic ATP synthesis
  occurs at the beta subunit active sites (PMID:37244256). The alpha subunit plays a structural
  and regulatory role, binding ATP and ADP at non-catalytic sites that are essential for the
  binding-change rotary mechanism but do not directly catalyze ATP formation. Cryo-EM structures
  confirm that ATP5F1A forms a homotrimer that alternates with the beta subunit trimer around the
  central gamma subunit stalk (PMID:37244256). ATP5F1A is also present on the cell surface as
  part of ecto-ATP synthase, where it functions as a receptor for angiostatin (PMID:10077593),
  histidine-rich glycoprotein (PMID:19285951), and EMAP II/p43 (PMID:11741979), with roles
  in angiogenesis regulation. Pathogenic variants cause mitochondrial complex V deficiency
  (MC5DN4A, MC5DN4B, COXPD22). UniProt states that the alpha subunit "does not bear the
  catalytic high-affinity ATP-binding sites" (P25705).

      IBA annotation for CC. ATP5F1A is a core structural component of the proton-transporting
      ATP synthase complex (Complex V). This is well supported by cryo-EM structural data

      This is the defining complex membership for ATP5F1A. The alpha subunit is one of the major

      alpha3-beta3 hexamer (PMID:37244256). IBA annotation is appropriate and well conserved across

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for MF with contributes_to qualifier. The alpha subunit contributes to the
      proton-transporting ATP synthase activity of the holoenzyme complex via the rotational
      mechanism. The contributes_to qualifier is essential here because ATP5F1A provides

      (ATP5F1B).

      The contributes_to qualifier is correct and important for the alpha subunit. Unlike the beta
      subunit which houses the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, the alpha subunit provides
      structural support and non-catalytic nucleotide binding required for the rotational mechanism
      but does not itself catalyze ATP synthesis. UniProt states for P25705: "Subunit alpha does

    summary: >-
      IEA annotation for MF with contributes_to qualifier from Ensembl Compara. ATP hydrolysis
      is the reverse activity of ATP synthase, which can be activated in vitro. UniProt notes

      The contributes_to qualifier is appropriate. The Complex V can hydrolyze ATP (the reverse
      reaction) and this is regulated by IF1 (ATPIF1). The alpha subunit contributes to this
      activity as part of the complex. UniProt states: "In vivo, can only synthesize ATP although

      IMP annotation for BP from the thymosin beta-4 study (Freeman et al. 2011). The study
      showed that thymosin beta-4 increases cell surface ATP levels via ATP synthase, demonstrating
      ATP biosynthetic process. Although evidence comes from ecto-ATP synthase, the GO term
      (ATP biosynthetic process) describes a core function of ATP5F1A.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The GO term GO:0006754 is correct for ATP5F1A. While the evidence comes from the ecto-ATP
      synthase context, ATP biosynthetic process is a core function of the gene. Consistent with

      IGI annotation for BP from the thymosin beta-4 study. The study showed that thymosin beta-4
      promotes HUVEC migration through ecto-ATP synthase, with ATP-responsive P2X4 receptor

      complex.

      This is a downstream effect of ecto-ATP synthase function. While the interaction is

  description: >-
    ATP5F1A is the non-catalytic alpha subunit of the F1 head of mitochondrial ATP synthase
    (Complex V). Three alpha subunits alternate with three beta subunits to form the
    alpha3-beta3 hexameric F1 catalytic head on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial
    membrane. The alpha subunit binds ATP and ADP at non-catalytic regulatory sites that
    are essential for the rotational binding-change mechanism, but does NOT itself catalyze
    ATP synthesis -- the catalytic sites reside on the beta subunit (ATP5F1B). ATP5F1A
    therefore contributes_to the complex-level proton-transporting ATP synthase activity
    (GO:0046933) but does not independently enable it. The alpha subunit also plays a
    structural role in maintaining the integrity of the F1 head and accommodating the
    symmetry mismatch between the three-fold F1 and the c-ring rotor. Pathogenic variants
    (R207H, R329C, Y321C) cause severe Complex V deficiency (MC5DN4A/B). Cryo-EM structures
    at 2.4-2.9 A resolution (PMID:37244256) reveal three alpha chains (A/B/C) alternating
    with three beta chains (D/E/F), with clinically relevant mutations mapping to subunit
    interfaces. ATP synthase assembles through two intermediates: the F1-c-ring and the
    b-e-g stator complex (PMID:26297831). ATP5F1A also participates in ecto-ATP synthase
    activity on the cell surface, where it interacts with angiostatin (PMID:10077593),
    HRG (PMID:19285951), and EMAP II (PMID:11741979), but this is a non-core function.
