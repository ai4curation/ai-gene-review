description: >
  CACNB2 encodes the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-2 (CaVbeta2),
  an essential cytosolic auxiliary subunit of high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels.
  The protein contains a conserved SH3-HOOK-guanylate kinase (GK) module that binds
  the alpha-interaction domain (AID) in the I-II linker of the pore-forming alpha1
  subunit with nanomolar affinity. CaVbeta2 promotes proper channel trafficking to the
  plasma membrane and modulates voltage-dependent activation/inactivation kinetics
  of CaV1.x/CaV2.x channels. Multiple splice variants (beta2a-beta2e) differ in their
  N-termini, with beta2a being palmitoylated for membrane anchoring and beta2e capable
  of nuclear translocation. CaVbeta2 also mediates beta-adrenergic regulation of
  cardiac L-type channels through interaction with the RGK GTPase Rad.

  review:
    summary: >
      CaVbeta2 is an auxiliary subunit that promotes calcium channel trafficking and
      modulates channel gating. PMID:1309651 demonstrated that beta2 subunit coexpression
      is obligatory for functional calcium channel activity, and that it increases peak
      calcium current. The protein enables calcium ion transport by regulating the
      alpha1 pore-forming subunit.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      IBA annotations for calcium ion transport are appropriate. While CaVbeta2 is not
      itself the ion pore, it is essential for functional calcium channel expression
      and directly contributes to calcium transport by enabling channel trafficking
      to the membrane and modulating channel gating properties [PMID:1309651].

      CaVbeta2 is a core component of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex,

      This is a specific cardiac electrophysiology phenotype associated with
      CACNB2 mutations. While the annotation captures the disease phenotype,
      membrane depolarization is a downstream effect of calcium channel function
      rather than a direct function of CaVbeta2.

suggested_questions:
- question: >
    What is the relative contribution of different CaVbeta2 isoforms (beta2a-e) to
    channel function in different tissues? The isoforms differ in N-terminal sequences
    affecting membrane association (palmitoylation for beta2a, nuclear translocation
    for beta2e). Understanding tissue-specific isoform functions could clarify disease
    mechanisms.
- question: >
    How does the CaVbeta2-RRAD interaction modulate beta-adrenergic regulation of
    cardiac calcium channels at the molecular level? Recent work (PMID:36424916)
    showed Rad phosphorylation releases CaVbeta-mediated inhibition. The structural
    basis of this regulation is not fully understood.

suggested_experiments:
