description: >-
  IL7R encodes the interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha (IL-7Ralpha, CD127),
  a type I cytokine receptor that serves as the ligand-binding alpha chain of
  two distinct receptor complexes. It heterodimerizes with the common gamma
  chain (IL2RG) to form the functional IL-7 receptor, and with CRLF2 to form
  the TSLP receptor. IL-7 binding triggers JAK1/JAK3-STAT5 signaling and
  engages PI3K-AKT and MAPK cascades. IL7R is essential for T cell development
  in the thymus and for survival and homeostatic proliferation of naive and
  memory T cells. It also regulates B cell progenitor differentiation. The
  protein has an extracellular domain with Ig-like and fibronectin type III
  folds, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic domain containing
  box 1 motif for JAK association. An alternatively spliced soluble isoform
  modulates IL-7 bioavailability. Loss-of-function mutations cause T-B+NK+
  severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Gain-of-function mutations occur
  in T-ALL and AML. Common variants (rs6897932) are associated with
  susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.

      IL7R is annotated to hemopoiesis by phylogenetic inference. IL-7/IL7R

    summary: >-
      IL7R annotated to clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle membrane from
      Reactome clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Cytokine receptors
      including IL7R undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis as part of
      receptor internalization and signal attenuation. IL7R is ubiquitinated
      by MARCHF8, leading to lysosomal degradation (PMID:39311660), which
      is consistent with endocytic trafficking.

    reason: >-
      Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a general mechanism for receptor
      internalization. While IL7R does undergo endocytosis as part of
      receptor turnover and signal regulation, this is not a core localization
      for IL7R function. Its primary functional site is the plasma membrane.

      IL7R annotated to regulation of DNA recombination from PMID:9495344.
      This publication is not available for direct review. IL-7/IL7R
      signaling is known to promote V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte
      development by inducing accessibility of immunoglobulin and TCR gene
      loci. However, IL7R does not directly regulate recombination; it
      signals to promote the conditions under which RAG-mediated
      recombination can occur.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      IL-7 signaling promotes V(D)J recombination indirectly by inducing
      chromatin accessibility and survival of recombining lymphocyte
      progenitors. This is a downstream consequence of IL7R signaling
      rather than a direct molecular function. The annotation is not wrong
      but represents a secondary effect of IL7R signaling in the context
      of lymphocyte development.

      The protein has no immunoglobulin variable domains or other

    reason: >-
      Signal transduction is a correct broad annotation for IL7R. As a
      cytokine receptor, IL7R transduces signals from the extracellular
      ligand (IL-7 or TSLP) to intracellular effectors (JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT,
      MAPK). This was established in the original cloning paper.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IL7R annotated to cell surface receptor signaling pathway from Puel
      et al. (1998). This is a correct broader annotation capturing the
      fact that IL7R signals from the cell surface. The study demonstrated
      that loss of IL7R causes SCID, establishing its role as an essential
      cell surface signaling receptor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cell surface receptor signaling pathway accurately describes the
      mode of IL7R signaling. The annotation is correct, though broader
      than the more specific IL-7-mediated signaling pathway term.
