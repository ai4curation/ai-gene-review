## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P16871
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha; Short=IL-7 receptor subunit alpha; Short=IL-7R subunit alpha; Short=IL-7R-alpha; Short=IL-7RA; AltName: Full=CDw127; AltName: CD_antigen=CD127; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL7R;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Type 4
- **Key Domains:** FN3_7. (IPR040997); FN3_dom. (IPR003961); FN3_sf. (IPR036116); Hempt_rcpt_S_F1_CS. (IPR003531); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL7R" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL7R' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL7R** (gene ID: IL7R, UniProt: P16871) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Plan and methods
We verified identity and scope per your critical checks: IL7R encodes the human interleukin‑7 receptor alpha chain (CD127), a type I cytokine receptor family member that heterodimerizes with the common γ chain (IL2RG) to form the functional IL‑7 receptor; signaling proceeds via JAK1/JAK3→STAT5 and engages PI3K–AKT and MAPK pathways, consistent with UniProt P16871 and recent reviews (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2). We prioritized 2023–2024 peer‑reviewed sources and translational studies. Key quantitative results are explicitly cited.

> - IL7R (CD127) encodes the interleukin‑7 receptor α chain (IL7Rα) that pairs with the common γ chain (IL2RG) to form the functional IL‑7 receptor complex. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2)
> - IL7Rα is a plasma‑membrane receptor; an alternatively spliced soluble IL‑7Rα isoform is produced and can modulate IL‑7 bioavailability and activity. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 17-18)
> - Ligand binding induces IL7Rα–γc heterodimerization and activates JAK1/JAK3 → STAT5 signaling and engages PI3K–AKT and MAPK pathways. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2)
> - Core biology: IL‑7/IL7R is essential for thymic T‑cell development and peripheral naive/memory T‑cell survival/homeostasis; IL7R signaling also regulates human B‑cell progenitor differentiation and expansion. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2)
> - Disease relevance: biallelic loss‑of‑function IL7R variants cause T‑cell‑deficient SCID; activating IL7R mutations are oncogenic in T‑ALL; IL7R mutations were found in ~9.5% of AML patients and associated with worse 5‑yr OS (51.5% vs 72.2%) and EFS (36.1% vs 58.1%) in Tao et al. 2024. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, tao2024prognosticimpactof pages 1-1)
> - Applications: CD127 is a routine flow‑cytometry marker (e.g., CD25hi CD127low to identify regulatory T cells); CD127+ CD8+ subsets and IL7R expression patterns are under study as prognostic/predictive biomarkers in cancer and immunotherapy. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2)
> - Therapeutics & engineering: recombinant IL‑7 (CYT107) and long‑acting NT‑I7/efineptakin alfa are in clinical/translational development; engineered IL‑7 fusion proteins and IL7Rα‑based chimeric receptors (CCR) or CAR‑T constructs provide cell‑intrinsic IL‑7 signaling to enhance T‑cell persistence. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, vorri2024activationofcellintrinsic pages 1-2)
> - Standout 2023–2024 translational findings: tumor‑targeted IL‑7 immunocytokines can boost anti‑PD‑1 efficacy, and IL7Rα‑domain CCRs in CAR‑T cells activate canonical downstream signaling to improve persistence and functionality — supporting combination IL‑7/IL7R engineering strategies. (park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, vorri2024activationofcellintrinsic pages 1-2)


*Blockquote: Concise, citable bullet points summarizing IL7R identity, localization, signaling, biology, disease links, applications, and recent 2023–2024 translational advances with source citations for rapid reference.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and receptor composition: IL7R (CD127) is the ligand‑binding α subunit of the IL‑7 receptor; upon IL‑7 binding, IL7Rα pairs with IL2RG (γc) to initiate signaling through juxtaposed JAK1 (on IL7Rα) and JAK3 (on γc), activating STAT5 and additional PI3K–AKT and MAPK cascades (publication date Feb 15, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2).
- Cellular localization and isoforms: IL7Rα is a plasma‑membrane receptor; an alternatively spliced soluble IL‑7Rα isoform regulates ligand bioavailability and can potentiate IL‑7 activity in certain settings (Immune Network 2024; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 17-18).
- Core biology: IL‑7/IL7R signaling is non‑redundant for T‑cell development in the thymus and for survival/homeostatic proliferation of naïve and memory T cells in the periphery. Regulation includes feedback repression of CD127 following IL‑7 signaling and induction of SOCS proteins; IL‑7 is mainly produced by stromal/epithelial cells (Feb 15, 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9; Mar 28, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1090311) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Engineered IL7R signaling in CAR‑T cells: A 2024 study engineered a chimeric IL7Rα cytoplasmic domain (CCR) providing cell‑intrinsic IL‑7R signaling; CCR‑T cells activated canonical downstream pathways and maintained cytotoxic CAR function, supporting IL7R engineering to enhance persistence (Cancer Research Communications; Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1158/2767-9764.crc-24-0286) (vorri2024activationofcellintrinsic pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic IL‑7 modalities: Contemporary review summarizes recombinant IL‑7 (CYT107) and long‑acting NT‑I7/efineptakin alfa programs, including combinations with vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR‑T/TIL; species‑dependent pharmacodynamics and safety considerations are discussed (Immune Network; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21).
- Systems immuno‑oncology: Single‑cell and preclinical data show IL‑7 therapy expands effector CD8 T cells and activates pro‑inflammatory myeloid cells, supporting combined microenvironmental effects (British Journal of Cancer; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-024-02617-7) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 1-2).
- Hematologic oncology genetics: A 2024 AML cohort (n=346) reported IL7R mutations in 9.5% with significantly worse 5‑yr OS 51.5% vs 72.2% (p=0.008) and EFS 36.1% vs 58.1% (p=0.005); non‑relapse mortality was higher (21.4% vs 6.2%; p=0.004), and adverse impact persisted post‑HSCT (Therapeutic Advances in Hematology; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1177/20406207241279533) (tao2024prognosticimpactof pages 1-1).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostics/biomarkers: CD127 is widely used in flow cytometry; the CD25hiCD127low phenotype delineates regulatory T cells (Tregs) in clinical immunomonitoring panels; recent immunotherapy trials incorporate CD127‑based phenotyping and dynamic monitoring (reviewed Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2).
- Therapeutics in practice and trials: Recombinant IL‑7 (CYT107) and long‑acting IL‑7 (NT‑I7/efineptakin alfa) have been evaluated to reverse lymphopenia, augment vaccine responses, and combine with checkpoint blockade or CAR‑T; multiple early‑phase oncology trials and translational programs are summarized (Immune Network; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21).
- Cell engineering: Incorporating IL7Rα signaling motifs or IL‑7 payloads into CAR‑T products is an active strategy to enhance cell survival and memory formation while avoiding systemic IL‑7 toxicities; 2024 data support feasibility and canonical pathway engagement (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1158/2767-9764.crc-24-0286) (vorri2024activationofcellintrinsic pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- Authoritative reviews emphasize that IL‑7 is a master regulator of T cell immunity, produced by non‑lymphoid stroma, with IL7R abundance limiting signaling. Therapeutically, IL‑7 monotherapy expands non‑tumor‑specific T cells; thus, combination with vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, TIL, or CAR‑T is preferred to confer specificity and durability (Immune Network; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21).
- Cytokine engineering consensus (IL‑2 family review) highlights shared γc receptor architecture and JAK–STAT signaling with design strategies to overcome short half‑life and systemic toxicities via Fc‑fusions, immunocytokines, and biased agonists—principles actively applied to IL‑7 (Frontiers in Immunology; Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1090311) (zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Mutation prevalence and outcomes in AML with IL7R mutations: 33/346 (9.5%) mutated; 5‑yr OS 51.5% vs 72.2% (p=0.008), 5‑yr EFS 36.1% vs 58.1% (p=0.005), 5‑yr non‑relapse mortality 21.4% vs 6.2% (p=0.004); adverse effect remained after HSCT (61.9% vs 85.3% OS; p=0.003) (Therapeutic Advances in Hematology; Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1177/20406207241279533) (tao2024prognosticimpactof pages 1-1).
- Clinical/translational IL‑7: Reviews compile prospective trials where CYT107 or NT‑I7 increased absolute lymphocyte counts, enhanced thymic output or vaccine responses, and reversed lymphopenia in sepsis/COVID‑19 contexts; species differences in persistence are noted (Immune Network; Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21).
- Mechanistic confirmation of receptor signaling: Engineering an IL7Rα‑domain CCR in human T cells activated canonical IL‑7R pathways and improved persistence when paired with tumor‑targeted CARs (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1158/2767-9764.crc-24-0286) (vorri2024activationofcellintrinsic pages 1-2).

Additional notes on gene/protein verification and domain architecture
- The functional properties summarized align with the UniProt record P16871 for human IL7R (CD127), a type I cytokine receptor with Ig‑like/FN3 domains and a conserved box1/box2 cytoplasmic region for JAK association; recent reviews reaffirm these family/domain features and signaling behavior (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9; Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1090311) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 2-3, zhou2023theapplicationof pages 1-2).

Open questions and 2023–2024 frontiers
- Optimizing IL‑7 delivery and context (tumor‑targeted immunocytokines, long‑acting Fc fusions) to bias toward expansion of tumor‑specific or progenitor‑like T cells and minimize autoimmunity remains an active area; multiple clinical programs and preclinical data support continued exploration (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e9) (park2024harnessingthepower pages 14-16, park2024harnessingthepower pages 20-21).
- The breadth of IL7R mutation impact beyond T‑ALL (e.g., AML subsets) and potential integration with JAK inhibitors or pathway modulators is being clarified; single‑center AML data show prognostic value and motivate multicenter validation (Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1177/20406207241279533) (tao2024prognosticimpactof pages 1-1).

Conclusion
Human IL7R (CD127; P16871) encodes the IL‑7 receptor α chain, a plasma‑membrane type I cytokine receptor with Ig‑like/FN3 domains that dimerizes with γc to transduce IL‑7 signals via JAK1/JAK3→STAT5 and auxiliary PI3K–AKT/MAPK pathways. Contemporary 2023–2024 research underscores IL7R’s central role in T‑cell homeostasis, engineered cell therapies, and disease, including adverse‑prognosis IL7R mutations in AML. Clinical and translational programs using recombinant and engineered IL‑7 and IL7R‑domain CAR designs are advancing, with combination approaches emerging as best‑supported strategies.
