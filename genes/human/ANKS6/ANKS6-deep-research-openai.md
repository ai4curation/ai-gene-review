## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q68DC2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ankyrin repeat and SAM domain-containing protein 6; AltName: Full=Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 14; AltName: Full=SamCystin; AltName: Full=Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 6; Short=SAM domain-containing protein 6;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ANKS6; Synonyms=ANKRD14, PKDR1, SAMD6;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Ankyrin-KH/SAM_domain. (IPR051631); Ankyrin_rpt. (IPR002110); Ankyrin_rpt-contain_sf. (IPR036770); SAM. (IPR001660); SAM/pointed_sf. (IPR013761)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ANKS6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ANKS6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ANKS6** (gene ID: ANKS6, UniProt: Q68DC2) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# ANKS6 (SamCystin) – Function, Signaling, and Clinical Significance

## Introduction and Key Features  
**ANKS6** (ankyrin repeat and SAM domain-containing protein 6, also known as **SAMD6**, **ANKRD14**, or *SamCystin*) is a human protein characterized by multiple **ankyrin repeats** and a C-terminal **sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain** ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=Autosomal%20dominant%20polycystic%20kidney%20disease,with%20ankyrin%20repeats%20at%20the)) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). Ankyrin repeats typically mediate protein–protein interactions, suggesting ANKS6 acts as a scaffold or adaptor in cells. The SAM domain is a polymerizing protein–protein interaction module, and structural studies show ANKS6’s SAM domain binds to the SAM domain of its paralog ANKS3 ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=The%20SAM%20domain%20of%20ANKS3,SAM%20is%20lost)). In fact, ANKS3 can self-polymerize via its SAM domain, and ANKS6 attaches to the end of the ANKS3 polymer, forming a multi-protein complex ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=The%20SAM%20domain%20of%20ANKS3,SAM%20is%20lost)). This domain arrangement (ankyrin repeats + SAM) places ANKS6 in a family of intracellular adapter proteins involved in signaling complexes. **UniProt Q68DC2** confirms ANKS6’s identity in *Homo sapiens* and its domain architecture, ensuring we focus on the correct human gene product (NPHP16) and not a similarly named gene in another species.

## Localization and Biological Function  
ANKS6 localizes predominantly to the **primary cilium** of cells – a microscopic antenna-like organelle critical for sensing extracellular signals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793029/#:~:text=renal%20failure%20in%20childhood%20or,in%20a%20phenotype%20that%20resembles)). In kidney epithelial cells, ANKS6 is enriched in the proximal segment of the cilium (sometimes referred to as the “inversin compartment”) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793029/#:~:text=renal%20failure%20in%20childhood%20or,in%20a%20phenotype%20that%20resembles)). Notably, in the kidney’s proximal tubules, native Anks6 (Samcystin) was detected at the apical brush border region ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=Samcystin%20expression%20is%20consistent%20with,%E2%80%9CR823W%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20samcystin%20domain)), consistent with ciliary or periciliary localization. Through its ankyrin-repeat domain, ANKS6 binds other ciliary proteins, and it serves as a **molecular hub linking several nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins** ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). Specifically, ANKS6 directly connects to the kinase **NEK8 (NPHP9)** and the proteins **INVS (Inversin, NPHP2)** and **NPHP3** within the ciliary apparatus ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). This ANKS6-centered complex is crucial for renal tubular development: knockdown of Anks6 in model organisms (zebrafish and *Xenopus*) causes pronephric cysts and developmental defects ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). These findings indicate that ANKS6 is essential for **normal kidney morphogenesis and function**, likely by organizing protein signaling in **primary cilia**, the key organelle for coordinating developmental signals in kidney tubule cells ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)).

Beyond the kidney, ANKS6’s ciliary role extends to other developmental systems. Mutations in ANKS6 can cause **situs inversus** (left-right body axis reversal) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)), implying a role in embryonic node cilia that establish left-right asymmetry. Indeed, ANKS6’s partner protein inversin (NPHP2) is a known regulator of left-right patterning and **Wnt signaling**. ANKS6 lies upstream of inversin in the ciliary signaling hierarchy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=reported%20that%20ANKS6%20affects%20the,old%20Cy%2F%2B%20rats)). By tethering inversin and other factors in the cilium, ANKS6 helps control the **Wnt/β-catenin pathway** and planar cell polarity during development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=reported%20that%20ANKS6%20affects%20the,old%20Cy%2F%2B%20rats)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=diseases.%5E%7B24%E2%80%9326%7D%20The%20canonical%20%CE%B2,Wnt%20pathway%20lead%20to%20cystic)). Consistent with this, loss of ANKS6 function leads to aberrant Wnt signaling: patient kidney biopsies and Anks6-mutant rat kidneys show abnormally high levels of **active β-catenin** in renal tubules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=with%20specific%20antibodies%20against%20total,or%20only%20stain%20for%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Semiquantitative%20evaluation%20showed%20that%20tubular,catenin%20were%20increased%20in)). This indicates **overactivation of canonical Wnt signaling**, which is known to drive cyst formation when not properly balanced ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=diseases.%5E%7B24%E2%80%9326%7D%20The%20canonical%20%CE%B2,Wnt%20pathway%20lead%20to%20cystic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Semiquantitative%20evaluation%20showed%20that%20tubular,catenin%20were%20increased%20in)). Thus, under normal conditions ANKS6 (via inversin) likely acts as a brake on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the kidney, helping maintain the delicate signaling balance required to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation and cystogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=diseases.%5E%7B24%E2%80%9326%7D%20The%20canonical%20%CE%B2,Wnt%20pathway%20lead%20to%20cystic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Semiquantitative%20evaluation%20showed%20that%20tubular,catenin%20were%20increased%20in)).

## Signaling Pathways and Complex Interactions  
ANKS6 is emerging as a critical integrator of **ciliary signaling pathways**. One of its key functions is to facilitate the proper localization and activation of the kinase **NEK8** within the cilium. Recent studies indicate that ANKS6 physically **transports NEK8 from the cytoplasm into the cilium**, where NEK8 can be phosphorylated and activated in the presence of inversin and NPHP3 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=regulating%20polycystic%20kidney%20function,generating%20center)). In this capacity, ANKS6 acts as both a substrate *and* an activator of NEK8’s kinase activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=regulating%20polycystic%20kidney%20function,generating%20center)). Activated NEK8, in turn, is known to participate in the **Hippo signaling pathway** and other growth-regulatory cascades. Notably, NEK8 and other NPHP proteins (e.g. NPHP4, NPHP3) promote phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activator YAP/TAZ, sequestering YAP at the cilium and preventing excessive cell proliferation ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L337%20shown%20that,YAP%20imbalances%2C%20resulting%20in)). **ANKS6 is now recognized to modulate the Hippo–YAP pathway** through this mechanism ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=remodeling%20defects%20and%20periportal%20fibrosis,transcriptional%20activity%20%2814)). In ANKS6-deficient patient cells, researchers observed a mislocalization of YAP: phosphorylated YAP that normally decorates the ciliary axoneme was instead confined to the ciliary base, and total YAP became overactive and accumulated in nuclei ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=Immunofluorescence%20staining%20revealed%20that%20phosphorylated,cilia%20of%20the%20control%20cells)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L543%20mutant%20fibroblasts%2C,Nuclear)). Concordantly, **YAP target genes** (such as *CTGF*, *CYR61*, *JAG1*, and *TEAD4*) were significantly upregulated in ANKS6-mutant cells ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=Material%2C%20Fig,derived%20cells%20%28Fig.%203C)). This **YAP dysregulation** provides a mechanistic link between ciliary dysfunction and the pro-proliferative transcriptional changes seen in cystic kidney disease ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L351%20dysregulation%20of,pathway%20through%20modulating%20YAP%20activity)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=Material%2C%20Fig,derived%20cells%20%28Fig.%203C)). In short, **ANKS6 helps maintain proper Hippo/YAP signaling by anchoring relevant kinases and perhaps sequestering phosphorylated YAP in cilia**, thereby keeping cell growth in check.

ANKS6 also interacts with **ANKS3** (a related ankyrin/SAM protein) and the RNA-binding protein **BICC1** to influence cyclic AMP (cAMP)–dependent signaling in kidney tubules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20evidence%20of%20BICC1,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)). The cAMP pathway (stimulated by vasopressin via V2 receptors) is a known driver of cyst growth when overactive, due to increased epithelial cell proliferation and fluid secretion. In Anks6-mutant (*Cy/*+) rats, gene expression profiling revealed dysregulation of water channel aquaporins (AQP2/3/4) and other markers of **vasopressin/cAMP signaling**, suggesting that an ANKS6–ANKS3–BICC1 network normally restrains this pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=insight%20sheds%20light%20on%20the,in%20response%20to%20experimental%20anks3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20evidence%20of%20BICC1,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)). Evidence from Bicc1-knockout mice likewise indicates these proteins function together to modulate cAMP levels in renal epithelial cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20evidence%20of%20BICC1,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)). Thus, ANKS6 sits at a crossroads of multiple signaling routes – Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo-YAP, and cAMP/PKD-related pathways – all of which must be finely tuned for normal kidney structure. Interestingly, there are hints that ANKS6 may interface with the **polycystin-1/2 signaling pathway** as well. Cystic kidneys from Anks6-mutant rats show alterations in **MAPK/ERK, AKT/mTOR, and RXR pathways** similar to those seen with polycystin mutations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=cilia%2C%20where%20it%20is%20phosphorylated,47%20%2C%2082%2C63%5D.%20The)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=idea%20that%20ANKS6%20interacts%20with,Cy%2F%2B%29%20rats%2C%20suggesting)). Researchers have speculated that the SAM domain of ANKS6 might directly influence polycystin-1 signaling complexes, linking ANKS6 to the canonical autosomal dominant PKD pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=common%20denominator%20in%20the%20pathophysiology,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)). While the precise molecular events are still being uncovered, it is clear that ANKS6 serves as a **critical scaffold in the cilium that coordinates multiple signaling proteins**, ensuring proper downstream developmental signals and preventing pathogenic cascades.

## Clinical Significance and Disease Associations  
Mutations in **ANKS6** cause a human ciliopathy known as **nephronophthisis 16 (NPHP16)**, a form of recessive cystic kidney disease ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596574#:~:text=Background%3A%20Nephronophthisis%20,the%20early%20stages%20of%20life)). Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is characterized by fibrosis and cysts at the cortico-medullary junction of the kidneys, leading to chronic kidney failure typically in childhood or adolescence. Although NPHP is genetically heterogeneous (with over 20 genes identified), ANKS6 mutations represent a rare cause. According to GeneReviews (2023 update), **ANKS6 accounts for <1% of NPHP-related ciliopathy cases** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368475/#:~:text=Less%20common%20genes%20ADAMTS9%20,Liver%20dz%2C%20deafness)). Despite its rarity, ANKS6-associated disease is distinctive for often having **multi-organ involvement**. Patients with biallelic ANKS6 mutations (usually truncating or missense variants in conserved regions) develop cystic kidney disease that can range from infantile-onset to adult-onset in severity ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368475/#:~:text=Less%20common%20genes%20ADAMTS9%20,6)). Classically, childhood-onset **end-stage renal disease** was reported in several families, along with **congenital heart defects, liver fibrosis, and situs inversus** (reversal of left-right organ positioning) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). These extrarenal manifestations – which parallel those seen with mutations in INVS/NPHP2 and NEK8 – reflect the systemic role of ANKS6 in ciliary developmental processes. Notably, unlike many other NPHP genes, ANKS6 mutations have not been strongly linked to retinal degeneration (retinitis pigmentosa) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368475/#:~:text=Less%20common%20genes%20ADAMTS9%20,6)), suggesting a degree of tissue selectivity in where ANKS6 is most critical (kidney, liver, heart, brain laterality, etc.).

**Discovery and case studies:** ANKS6’s link to human disease was first demonstrated in 2013 when six unrelated NPHP families were found to carry mutations in ANKS6 ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). These individuals presented in childhood with renal failure and a constellation of anomalies (e.g. cardiopathy, biliary fibrosis, situs inversus), firmly establishing ANKS6 as a **ciliopathy gene** ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=ANKS6%20mutations%20affected%20by%20nephronophthisis%2C,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). In 2014, Taskiran *et al.* reported a Turkish kindred with ANKS6 mutations causing juvenile nephronophthisis and end-stage kidney disease by the late teens ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=reported%20that%20ANKS6%20affects%20the,old%20Cy%2F%2B%20rats)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Semiquantitative%20evaluation%20showed%20that%20tubular,catenin%20were%20increased%20in)). Kidney biopsies from that patient showed dilated tubules with **strong β-catenin staining**, implicating hyperactive Wnt signaling in the disease mechanism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Immunohistochemistry%20with%20anti%E2%80%93%CE%B2,bottom%29%20probed)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4116054/#:~:text=Semiquantitative%20evaluation%20showed%20that%20tubular,catenin%20were%20increased%20in)). Meanwhile, in animal models, the **Han:SPRD Cy rat** – a longstanding model of polycystic kidney disease – was unexpectedly found to harbor a mutation in the *Anks6* gene (a point substitution R823W in the SAM domain) ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=Autosomal%20dominant%20polycystic%20kidney%20disease,with%20ankyrin%20repeats%20at%20the)). This single mutation in Anks6 (*“Cy” allele*) is sufficient to cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in rats, with cystic enlargement of kidneys resembling human PKD ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=Autosomal%20dominant%20polycystic%20kidney%20disease,with%20ankyrin%20repeats%20at%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=mislocalization%20of%20the%20protein,not%20fully%20understood%2C%20a%20recent)). The Cy Rat (*Anks6^R823W*) has been used **extensively as a preclinical model** for testing PKD therapies and studying cystogenesis ([bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-14-17#:~:text=causal%20of%20disease%2C%20has%20been,domain%20of%20ANKS3%20as%20a)). Analysis of this model showed that the mutant Samcystin protein is mislocalized in cyst-lining cells and likely exerts a dominant-negative effect on the ciliary signaling complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=specificity%20for%20its%20localization%20to,and%20a%20dominant%20negative%20reaction)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=precise%20role%20of%20ANKS6%20in,an%20important%20regulator%20in%20kidney)). Together, human and animal studies underscore that *ANKS6 loss-of-function* (in patients) or *domain mutation* (in the rat) disrupts ciliary signal transduction, leading to renal cyst formation and fibrosis.

## Latest Research and Developments (2020–2024)  
**Recent insights (2020–2022)** have shed light on how ANKS6 mutations impact downstream pathways. In a 2022 study of two adult sisters with atypically **late-onset chronic kidney disease** (mid-adulthood) caused by biallelic ANKS6 mutations, Schwarz *et al.* discovered a link to the **Hippo/YAP pathway** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=remodeling%20defects%20and%20periportal%20fibrosis,transcriptional%20activity%20%2814)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=Material%2C%20Fig,derived%20cells%20%28Fig.%203C)). Patient-derived cells showed excess nuclear YAP and altered YAP phosphorylation at the cilium, resulting in increased expression of YAP-dependent genes that drive proliferation ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=Material%2C%20Fig,derived%20cells%20%28Fig.%203C)). This finding reveals that ANKS6 is required for proper Hippo signaling and that its disruption can lead to unchecked cell growth even in slowly progressive disease cases. Intriguingly, the same study noted **alterations in canonical Wnt signaling** in ANKS6-mutant cells (including elevated active β-catenin and GSK3β changes) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=nuclear%20yes,Upon)), reinforcing that ANKS6 normally helps balance Wnt activity as well. These mechanistic advances confirm a unifying concept: **cystic kidney diseases caused by ciliary gene defects (like ANKS6, NEK8, NPHP2/3)** may all promote cyst growth through a common nexus of Wnt and YAP/TAZ signaling dysregulation ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L337%20shown%20that,YAP%20imbalances%2C%20resulting%20in)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L351%20dysregulation%20of,pathway%20through%20modulating%20YAP%20activity)).

**Diagnostics and clinical applications (2023–2024):** As ANKS6’s role became recognized, it has been added to gene testing panels for inherited kidney diseases. Genetic diagnosis is particularly valuable in atypical or early presentations. A 2024 report described **three consanguineous families** from the Middle East in which fetuses or neonates presented with enlarged, echogenic polycystic kidneys ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596574#:~:text=Background%3A%20Nephronophthisis%20,the%20early%20stages%20of%20life)). Through whole-exome sequencing, those cases were solved by identifying **homozygous ANKS6 mutations** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596574#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20We%20identified%20homozygous%20ANKS6,echogenic%20kidneys%20in%20prenatal%20settings)). This expanded the clinical spectrum of ANKS6: it can cause perinatal massively polycystic kidneys (resembling severe ARPKD) in addition to the previously known juvenile or adult-onset presentations. These discoveries highlight the utility of **prenatal genetic testing** when ultrasound shows cystic kidney disease – in one family, an ANKS6 diagnosis was made **antenatally**, guiding early prognostic counseling ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596574#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20We%20identified%20homozygous%20ANKS6,echogenic%20kidneys%20in%20prenatal%20settings)). More broadly, recognizing ANKS6 mutations in patients with laterality defects or heart malformations can prompt screening for kidney issues, given the gene’s pleiotropic effects. There is no specific targeted therapy for ANKS6-associated NPHP yet, but management focuses on controlling cyst progression (e.g. blood pressure control, vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists to reduce cAMP if appropriate) and timely transplantation for kidney failure. On the research front, the **Anks6^Cy/+ rat** continues to be a valuable model – its use has illuminated how cAMP-modulating treatments (like vasopressin antagonists) might benefit cystic disease by counteracting the loss of ANKS6 function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20evidence%20of%20BICC1,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=common%20denominator%20in%20the%20pathophysiology,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)). As of 2024, ANKS6 stands out as a mechanistically informative gene in the ciliopathy field, and ongoing studies are probing its exact molecular interactions (e.g. with Polycystin-1, BICC1) and potential as a therapeutic target in cystic organ diseases.

## Expert Perspectives and Conclusion  
From an expert viewpoint, ANKS6 (*SAMD6/Samcystin*) exemplifies how **primary cilia act as signaling hubs in organ development and disease**. Friedhelm Hildebrandt and colleagues, who first pinpointed ANKS6’s role, described it as a *“central component”* of a ciliary protein module that explains why mutations in different module members (ANKS6, NEK8, INVS, NPHP3) cause strikingly similar syndromes ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2681#:~:text=hydroxylates%20ANKS6%20and%20INVS%20and,in%20ANKS6%2C%20NEK8%2C%20INVS%20or)). **GeneReviews (2023)** emphasizes the multi-system nature of ANKS6-related disease, noting that patients can have neurological involvement, congenital heart disease, biliary fibrosis, and situs inversus in addition to kidney failure ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368475/#:~:text=Less%20common%20genes%20ADAMTS9%20,Liver%20dz%2C%20deafness)). These clinical features mirror the protein’s involvement in fundamental developmental pathways across organ systems. Researchers also note that while ANKS6 is structurally distinct from the polycystin proteins (PKD1/PKD2), it likely converges functionally on **common cystogenic pathways**. For example, an analysis of the Cy/+ rat model suggested that the ANKS6 mutation triggers changes in **B-Raf/MEK/ERK and mTOR signaling**, akin to those seen in polycystic kidney disease ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=idea%20that%20ANKS6%20interacts%20with,Cy%2F%2B%29%20rats%2C%20suggesting)). This has led to the intriguing suggestion that **Samcystin’s SAM domain might directly partake in polycystin-1 related signaling** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10887417/#:~:text=common%20denominator%20in%20the%20pathophysiology,38%20%2C%2059%2C68)), hinting at a broader role in the kidney’s mechanosensory machinery. While many details remain to be uncovered, the current understanding presents ANKS6 as a **ciliary adaptor protein critical for routing signals (Wnt, Hippo/YAP, cAMP) from the cilium to the cell nucleus**. Disruption of ANKS6 destabilizes this signaling nexus – leading to misregulation of cell polarity, proliferation, and differentiation – and ultimately results in cystic organ pathologies. Ongoing research in 2023–2024 continues to refine this picture, with the hope that deeper insight into ANKS6’s function will open avenues for targeted interventions in ciliopathies and cystic kidney diseases ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/hmg/ddab322/6420895#:~:text=match%20at%20L351%20dysregulation%20of,pathway%20through%20modulating%20YAP%20activity)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596574#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20We%20identified%20homozygous%20ANKS6,echogenic%20kidneys%20in%20prenatal%20settings)). In summary, ANKS6 is a keystone in the ciliary signaling network, and its study is illuminating the delicate biochemical circuits that maintain renal architecture and organismal left-right patterning. Future studies and therapeutic developments will likely benefit from the rich mechanistic knowledge base that ANKS6 research has established in the past decade.
