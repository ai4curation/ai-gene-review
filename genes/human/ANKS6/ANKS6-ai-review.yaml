description: >-
  ANKS6 (ankyrin repeat and SAM domain-containing protein 6, also known as SamCystin)
  is a ciliary scaffold/adaptor
  protein essential for renal development and function. It contains multiple N-terminal
  ankyrin repeats that mediate
  protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal SAM domain that binds ANKS3. ANKS6
  localizes to the ciliary inversin
  compartment where it serves as a molecular hub linking NEK8, INVS (inversin), and
  NPHP3 in a critical nephronophthisis
  module. Through this complex, ANKS6 regulates canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
  (acting as a brake to prevent
  over-activation), Hippo-YAP signaling (by facilitating proper YAP phosphorylation
  and localization), and cAMP-dependent
  pathways via interactions with BICC1. Mutations in ANKS6 cause nephronophthisis
  type 16 (NPHP16), a ciliopathy
  characterized by cystic kidney disease, with potential extrarenal manifestations
  including situs inversus, congenital
  heart defects, and liver fibrosis.

    title: Deep research summary of ANKS6 function (OpenAI o3)
    findings:
      - statement: >-
          ANKS6 is a ciliary scaffold/adaptor protein that localizes to the inversin
          compartment and
          links NEK8, INVS, and NPHP3. It regulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (acting
          as a brake),
          Hippo-YAP signaling, and cAMP-dependent pathways. Mutations cause nephronophthisis
          type 16.
        supporting_text: >-
          ANKS6 serves as a molecular hub linking several nephronophthisis (NPHP)
          proteins; ANKS6
          directly connects to the kinase NEK8 (NPHP9) and the proteins INVS (Inversin,
          NPHP2) and
          NPHP3 within the ciliary apparatus
      - statement: >-
          ANKS6 transports NEK8 from the cytoplasm to the cilium where NEK8 is activated.
          ANKS6 is
          both a substrate and activator of NEK8 kinase activity.
        supporting_text: >-
          ANKS6 physically transports NEK8 from the cytoplasm into the cilium, where
          NEK8 can be
          phosphorylated and activated in the presence of inversin and NPHP3
      - statement: >-
          Loss of ANKS6 leads to overactivation of canonical Wnt signaling with increased
          beta-catenin
          accumulation in renal tubules.
        supporting_text: >-
          loss of ANKS6 function leads to aberrant Wnt signaling: patient kidney biopsies
          and
          Anks6-mutant rat kidneys show abnormally high levels of active beta-catenin
          in renal tubules
      - statement: >-
          ANKS6 modulates Hippo-YAP signaling; ANKS6-deficient cells show YAP mislocalization
          and
          nuclear accumulation with upregulation of YAP target genes.
        supporting_text: >-
          In ANKS6-deficient patient cells, researchers observed a mislocalization
          of YAP: phosphorylated
          YAP that normally decorates the ciliary axoneme was instead confined to
          the ciliary base, and
          total YAP became overactive and accumulated in nuclei

      ANKS6 serves as a molecular hub in the ciliary inversin compartment that organizes
      the nephronophthisis
      signaling module by linking NEK8 (kinase), INVS (inversin), and NPHP3. The ankyrin
      repeats mediate
      NEK8 binding while the SAM domain mediates ANKS3 binding and polymer formation.
