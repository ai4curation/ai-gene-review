description: >-
  RAB7B encodes a small Rab-family GTPase that regulates late endosomal traffic and
  retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The protein cycles
  between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states to control membrane trafficking.
  RAB7B localizes to late endosomes/lysosomes and the Golgi/TGN. It is distinct from RAB7A,
  which primarily regulates late endosome-lysosome fusion. RAB7B directly binds myosin II
  to couple endosomal transport to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. The protein also negatively
  regulates TLR4 and TLR9 signaling pathways by promoting receptor trafficking toward
  degradation, and promotes megakaryocytic differentiation through IL-6/STAT3/GATA-1 signaling.

  title: A novel interaction between Rab7b and actomyosin reveals a dual role in intracellular transport and cell migration.
  findings:
    - statement: RAB7B directly binds myosin II
      supporting_text: >-
        Rab7b, a Rab that controls the transport between late endosomes and the trans
        Golgi network, interacts directly with myosin II. We illustrate the functional
        relevance of this interaction, demonstrating that myosin II mediates the
        transport of Rab7b endosomes, as Rab7b dynamics are strongly affected after
        myosin II depletion or inhibition.

      supporting_text: >-
        We also demonstrate that a member of the Rab family regulates actin remodeling
        and, consequently, influences cell adhesion, polarization and migration. We find
        the molecular mechanism by which Rab7b influences stress fiber formation - through
        controlling the activation status of the small GTPase RhoA and therefore influencing
        myosin light chain phosphorylation.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      RAB7B functions as a small GTPase that regulates retrograde transport from late
      endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. It cycles between GTP-bound (active) and
      GDP-bound (inactive) states to control membrane trafficking.

          Rab7b is required for normal lysosome function, and, in particular, that it
          is an essential factor for retrograde transport from endosomes to the
          trans-Golgi network (TGN)

      RAB7B directly binds myosin II to couple endosomal transport to the actomyosin
      cytoskeleton, influencing cell adhesion, polarization, and migration through
      modulation of RhoA activation and myosin light chain phosphorylation.
