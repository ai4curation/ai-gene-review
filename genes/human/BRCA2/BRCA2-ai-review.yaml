description: >-
  BRCA2 (Breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein) is a critical tumor suppressor that functions
  as a mediator of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. The protein contains multiple functional
  domains: BRC repeats that bind RAD51 recombinase, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with OB folds and tower
  domain that binds ssDNA, and a C-terminal recombinase-binding region (CTRB) that engages both DNA
  and RAD51. BRCA2 loads and stabilizes RAD51 onto RPA-coated single-stranded DNA to form the
  presynaptic filament required for strand invasion during HR. Additionally, BRCA2 protects stalled
  and reversed replication forks from MRE11-mediated nucleolytic degradation, a function genetically
  separable from but coordinated with HR. Key partners include RAD51, PALB2, BRCA1-BARD1, and DSS1.
  Loss of BRCA2 function causes homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), conferring sensitivity to
  PARP inhibitors and platinum agents. Biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (complementation
  group D1/FANCD1). BRCA2 localizes predominantly to the nucleus at DNA damage sites.

- term:

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: BRCA2 binds single-stranded DNA through its DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing OB folds and through its C-terminal region (CTRB). This is essential for its function in loading RAD51 onto ssDNA during homologous recombination.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function. The DBD with OB folds directly binds ssDNA to facilitate RAD51 loading. This is well-supported by structural and biochemical studies (PMID:20729832, Kwon et al. 2023 Nature Comm).
