Comprehensive Research Report: Human WDR6 (UniProt Q9NNW5)

Abstract
WDR6 is a human WD repeat–containing protein (WD40 β-propeller family) that functions as the regulatory partner (human ortholog of yeast Trm734) for the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent tRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase FTSJ1 (yeast Trm7). In human cells, the FTSJ1–WDR6 complex installs 2′-O-methylation at position 34 (Nm34; notably Gm34) on specific cytosolic tRNAs, whereas FTSJ1–THADA installs Nm32 at position 32; the complexes are mechanistically distinct. Loss of FTSJ1-dependent Nm modifications alters codon-specific translation and is associated with nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability (NSXLID), with WDR6 implicated as the position-34–directing regulatory subunit. Recent structural, biochemical, and genetic studies across 2020–2024 clarify complex composition, prerequisites for catalysis, substrate specificity, and translational consequences. (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2, graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, brazane2023functionsofthe pages 49-54, funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7, funk2024identificationofamino pages 9-10, ishiguro2025structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

1) Identity verification and key definitions
- Gene/protein identity: WDR6 (WD repeat–containing protein 6) in Homo sapiens is a WD40 β-propeller protein that acts as the regulatory/auxiliary subunit for the tRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase FTSJ1 (ortholog of yeast Trm7), specifically for Nm at position 34 in the anticodon loop. This is consistent with WD40 domain proteins serving as scaffolding/positioning subunits in RNA methyltransferase holoenzymes and with the assignment of WDR6 as the human Trm734 ortholog in epitranscriptomic literature (WIREs RNA, May 2022; DOI: 10.1002/wrna.1673; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673). (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28)
- Division of catalytic versus regulatory roles: FTSJ1 is the SAM-dependent catalytic subunit; WDR6 contributes primarily to substrate recognition/positioning to enable Nm34 formation, analogous to yeast Trm7–Trm734 architecture (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; DOI: 10.15252/embr.202050095; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2)
- Contrast with THADA: FTSJ1 also forms a distinct complex with THADA to install Nm32 at tRNA position 32; human THADA–FTSJ1 structural details have recently been elucidated, underscoring partner-specific substrate engagement modes (Communications Biology, Jun 2025; DOI: 10.1038/s42003-025-08278-3; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08278-3). (ishiguro2025structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

2) Current mechanistic understanding and pathways
- Complex composition and prerequisites: Human FTSJ1–WDR6 reconstitutes robust 2′-O-methylation in vitro and specifically catalyzes Nm34 on select tRNAs. Catalysis requires prior m1G37 formation (i.e., m1G37 is a prerequisite), and anticodon-loop modifications at positions 32, 34, and 37 show hierarchical interdependence in vivo (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2)
- Site specificity by partner switching: Partner selection dictates site specificity—WDR6 directs FTSJ1 to Nm34, whereas THADA directs FTSJ1 to Nm32—consistent with the division of labor model in multimeric RNA methyltransferases (WIREs RNA, May 2022; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673; 2023 review excerpt). (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, brazane2023functionsofthe pages 49-54)
- Structural logic from orthologs: Structural work on yeast Trm7–Trm734 shows how a WD40 subunit (Trm734) positions the anticodon loop at the catalytic center of Trm7; mutational analysis places functionally critical Trm734 residues near the Trm7 active site and supports a role in tRNA binding/positioning rather than complex assembly per se (ACS Omega, Jun 2024; DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.4c02313; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313). These insights are directly informative for human WDR6 function. (funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7, funk2024identificationofamino pages 9-10)
- Partner-specific substrate engagement: Cryo-EM of the human FTSJ1–THADA complex reveals a THADA scaffold that encloses tRNA and anchors its anticodon loop to FTSJ1’s catalytic pocket, illustrating how the noncatalytic subunit choreographs tRNA recognition; by analogy, WDR6 is expected to play the analogous role in the FTSJ1–WDR6 Nm34 holoenzyme (Communications Biology, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08278-3). (ishiguro2025structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

3) Substrate specificity and biochemical activity
- Human substrates and differences to yeast: The human FTSJ1–WDR6 complex generates Gm34 on specific cytosolic tRNAs including tRNAPhe(GAA) and tRNALeu(CAA), and displays substrate selectivity distinct from yeast Trm7–Trm734 (e.g., some yeast targets such as tRNATrp(CCA) are not modified by the human complex) (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Hierarchical modification circuit: In vivo, Nm34 deposition is interdependent with Nm32 and m1G37 on the same tRNA species, indicating a conserved modification circuit at the anticodon loop that influences translation fidelity/efficiency (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095; WIREs RNA, May 2022; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2, graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28)

4) Subcellular localization
- Direct subcellular localization of human WDR6 in the context of FTSJ1-mediated tRNA methylation is not explicitly specified in the cited experimental sources; however, these tRNA modifications are canonical cytosolic tRNA anticodon-loop marks, and the yeast Trm7–Trm734 model supports a cytosolic/nucleocytoplasmic tRNA-processing context. More precise human localization will require targeted proteomic/cell-biological studies; such data were not provided in the reviewed sources. (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)

5) Functional consequences and phenotypes
- Codon-specific translational effects: FTSJ1 deficiency reduces translation efficiency of UUU (but not UUC) phenylalanine codons due to loss of Gm34/Cm32 on tRNAPhe(GAA); overexpression of tRNAPhe(GAA) can rescue growth defects in cellular models (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2)
- Gene set enrichment: Approximately 40% of genes with high TTT codon usage bias (decoded by UUU) are nervous system–related, linking defective FTSJ1-mediated methylation to neuronal gene expression programs (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Regulatory-subunit roles inferred from yeast: Mutational dissection of yeast Trm734 identifies residues essential for Nm34 formation that are dispensable for Trm7–Trm734 binding; such separation-of-function variants provide tools to parse tRNA-modification–dependent versus –independent phenotypes, a strategy likely transferrable to human WDR6 studies (ACS Omega, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313). (funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7, funk2024identificationofamino pages 9-10)

6) Disease associations and expert perspectives
- NSXLID and FTSJ1: Human FTSJ1 loss-of-function alleles cause loss of Cm32/Gm34 on tRNAPhe(GAA) and are implicated in nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability; the dependence of Nm34 on the WDR6 partner rationalizes WDR6’s centrality for the Nm34 arm of this pathway (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095; WIREs RNA, May 2022; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2, graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28)
- Expert analysis on multimeric methyltransferases: Reviews emphasize a division-of-labor paradigm in which WD40 partners scaffold and orient tRNA substrates to a Rossmann-fold catalytic subunit, consistent with WDR6’s proposed role in the FTSJ1 holoenzyme (WIREs RNA, May 2022; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673; 2023 review excerpt). (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, brazane2023functionsofthe pages 49-54)

7) Recent developments (priority 2023–2024)
- 2024 mechanistic advances: Yeast Trm734 mutational mapping (ACS Omega, Jun 2024) pinpoints tRNA-interacting surfaces critical for Nm34 and suggests design of nonfunctional yet stable Trm734 variants; these principles likely guide human WDR6 functional mapping and the creation of separation-of-function alleles for mechanistic and disease-modeling studies (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313). (funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7, funk2024identificationofamino pages 9-10)
- 2023 synthesis: A 2023 review highlights that human FTSJ1 leverages distinct partners—THADA for Nm32 and WDR6 for Nm34—to achieve site specificity, integrating structural insights from yeast holoenzymes and underscoring neurological implications (review excerpt). (brazane2023functionsofthe pages 49-54)
- 2022–2025 structural framework: The 2022 WIREs RNA review consolidates structural lessons from multimeric RNA MTases, while the 2025 cryo-EM structure of human FTSJ1–THADA provides a direct human blueprint for partner-mediated tRNA engagement; together these frame hypotheses for WDR6’s structural role in Nm34 (https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1673; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08278-3). (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, ishiguro2025structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

8) Applications and real-world implementations
- Molecular diagnostics/biomarkers: Loss of FTSJ1-dependent Nm modifications on tRNAPhe(GAA) provides a molecular signature that could be assayed in patient-derived cells to support NSXLID diagnoses and genotype–phenotype correlations; WDR6-dependent Nm34 may contribute to such readouts (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Functional variant engineering: Guided by 2024 Trm734 mutational data, analogous WDR6 variants can be engineered to test whether neurological or other phenotypes arise specifically from loss of Nm34 versus potential noncanonical WDR6 roles, facilitating target validation and pathway dissection (ACS Omega, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313). (funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7)
- Therapeutic hypothesis generation: Since reduced UUU translation contributes to dysregulation of TTT-biased neuronal genes when FTSJ1 function is compromised, interventions that restore tRNAPhe(GAA) function or mimic Nm34 could, in principle, ameliorate disease-relevant translational defects; such strategies remain to be experimentally validated (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)

9) Quantitative data and selected statistics
- Hierarchical modification: m1G37 is a prerequisite for FTSJ1–WDR6–mediated Nm34 in vitro; in vivo, positions 32, 34, 37 modifications are interdependent and ordered (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 1-2)
- Codon translation impact: FTSJ1 knockout reduces translation efficiency for UUU but not UUC codons decoded by tRNAPhe(GAA), demonstrating codon-specific effects of anticodon-loop Nm loss (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Nervous system gene bias: Approximately 40% of TTT-biased genes are related to brain/nervous system functions, connecting the translational phenotype to neuronal pathways (EMBO Reports, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202050095). (li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Structure–function residues (ortholog evidence): Trm734 residues proximal to the Trm7 active site are essential for Nm34 formation but dispensable for complex assembly, consistent with a substrate-docking role (ACS Omega, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313). (funk2024identificationofamino pages 7-7, funk2024identificationofamino pages 9-10)

10) Knowledge gaps and future directions
- Direct human FTSJ1–WDR6 structural biology: High-resolution structures of human FTSJ1–WDR6 (± tRNA) are needed to define WDR6’s tRNA-docking surfaces and partner interfaces; the THADA structure provides a compelling template for experimental design (Communications Biology, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08278-3). (ishiguro2025structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)
- Subcellular localization and dynamics: Definitive localization of WDR6 in the context of tRNA modification, its cell-cycle dynamics, and interaction proteome in human cells remain to be clarified in targeted studies (current sources do not specify). (graille2022divisionoflabor pages 25-28, li2020intellectualdisability‐associatedgene pages 9-11)
- Disease genetics for WDR6: While FTSJ1 variants are clearly implicated in NSXLID, the specific contribution of WDR6 variants to human disease via loss of Nm34 has yet to be systematically defined; separation-of-function alleles informed by ortholog studies can address this (ACS Omega, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02313).
