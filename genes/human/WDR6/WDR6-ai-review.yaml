description: >-
  WDR6 (WD repeat-containing protein 6) is the human ortholog of yeast Trm734, functioning
  as
  the regulatory subunit of the FTSJ1-WDR6 tRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase complex. WDR6
  binds
  directly to tRNA substrates and positions them for methylation by the catalytic
  subunit FTSJ1
  at the wobble position 34 of specific tRNAs. The FTSJ1-WDR6 complex specifically
  catalyzes
  2'-O-methylation of guanosine-34 (Gm34) on tRNAPhe(GAA) and tRNALeu(CAA), with m1G37
  as a
  prerequisite modification. WDR6 contains multiple WD40 repeats that form a beta-propeller
  scaffold critical for tRNA substrate recognition. Loss of WDR6 function impairs
  translation
  efficiency of UUU codons, particularly affecting neuronal genes with high TTT codon
  usage.

  - description: >-
      WDR6 is the regulatory subunit of the FTSJ1-WDR6 tRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase
      complex,
      functioning as the human ortholog of yeast Trm734. WDR6 binds tRNA substrates
      and
      positions them for 2'-O-methylation at the wobble position 34 by the catalytic
      subunit FTSJ1. The FTSJ1-WDR6 complex specifically modifies tRNAPhe(GAA) and
      tRNALeu(CAA), catalyzing Gm34 formation with m1G37 as a prerequisite.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What structural features of WDR6 determine tRNA substrate 
      specificity? Yeast Trm734 structural studies have identified residues 
      critical for Nm34 formation, but corresponding residues in human WDR6 have
      not been mapped.
  - question: Does WDR6 have functions independent of FTSJ1? WDR6 interacts with
      LKB1 and affects cell cycle and autophagy, but it is unclear if these are 
      mediated through altered tRNA modification or represent separate 
      FTSJ1-independent functions.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Structure determination of FTSJ1-WDR6-tRNA complex by cryo-EM. Recent cryo-EM
      structure
      of FTSJ1-THADA provides a template. FTSJ1-WDR6 structure would reveal how WDR6
      WD40
      domains position tRNA for Nm34 modification and identify key residues for substrate
      recognition.
    hypothesis: WDR6 WD40 domains form a scaffold that positions the tRNA 
      anticodon loop at the FTSJ1 active site
  - description: >-
      Generate separation-of-function WDR6 mutants based on yeast Trm734 mutational
      analysis.
      Create WDR6 variants that retain FTSJ1 binding but lose tRNA modification activity
      to
      separate modification-dependent from modification-independent phenotypes in
      cellular assays.
    hypothesis: Some WDR6 phenotypes (autophagy, cell cycle effects) may be 
      independent of tRNA modification
