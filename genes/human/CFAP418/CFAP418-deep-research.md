# CFAP418 (C8orf37) Gene – Comprehensive Profile

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
CFAP418 (also known as C8orf37) encodes a 207–amino acid protein implicated in the maintenance of photoreceptor cells and ciliary function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=Mutations%20in%20C8orf37%20cause%20Bardet,PLA%29%20of)). Its precise molecular function is not fully characterized, as it lacks known enzymatic domains or motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=The%20function%20of%20the%20C8ORF37,the%20base%20of%20the%20primary)). However, studies in model organisms suggest CFAP418 is crucial for photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis and protein homeostasis. In a C8orf37 knockout mouse, the absence of CFAP418 caused disorganized photoreceptor outer segment discs and reduced levels of key outer segment membrane proteins, despite normal targeting of these proteins to the outer segment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=Considering%20the%20distribution%20of%20C8ORF37,in%20photoreceptors%20and%20on%20the)). This indicates CFAP418 is required for proper assembly or stabilization of outer segment disks, which are the light-sensing organelles of photoreceptors. Consistently, researchers noted that **C8ORF37 is required for photoreceptor outer segment disc formation and alignment, a process critical for photoreceptor function and survival** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=patients,establishes%20a%20valuable%20mouse%20model)). 

Beyond the retina, CFAP418 appears to play a role in intracellular transport processes associated with cilia. It has been characterized as a *ciliary protein*, and loss of CFAP418 function in zebrafish leads to ciliopathy-like defects: embryos with c8orf37 knockdown showed impaired visual behavior and developmental left-right asymmetry defects due to abnormal Kupffer’s vesicle cilia, as well as delays in retrograde intraflagellar transport ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=recessive%20retinal%20dystrophies%20,This%20is%20the%20first%20functional)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=cilium%20and%20in%20the%20cytoplasm,localization%20of%20C8ORF37%20at%20the)). These findings suggest CFAP418 may influence microtubule-based transport or cargo trafficking within cilia. In line with this, CFAP418 was found to interact with FAM161A, a microtubule-binding protein of the photoreceptor cilium, implying that CFAP418 participates in a protein network at the ciliary base that could regulate ciliary or cytoskeletal dynamics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,suggest%20that%20the%20two%20photoreceptor)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=immunofluorescence%20staining%20and%20PLA,may%20contribute%20to%20photoreceptor%20health)). Thus, while CFAP418’s biochemical activity remains unknown, current evidence points to a role in supporting ciliary structure/function and photoreceptor cellular integrity.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
CFAP418 localizes predominantly to cilia-related compartments within the cell. Immunocytochemistry studies in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells revealed CFAP418 at **the base of the primary cilium** (the basal body/transition zone marked by polyglutamylated tubulin) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=matched%20control%20individuals%2C%20single,G%20%5Bp.Gln182Arg%5D%29%20in%20siblings)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=157657#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20ubiquitously,rod%20dystrophy%20%28arCRD%29%20and)). Similarly, in retinal photoreceptor cells, CFAP418 is enriched at the **connecting cilium** – the specialized ciliary structure linking the photoreceptor inner segment to the outer segment ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=matched%20control%20individuals%2C%20single,G%20%5Bp.Gln182Arg%5D%29%20in%20siblings)). High-resolution retina analyses have shown CFAP418 at the ciliary base **at the junction between the photoreceptor outer and inner segments** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=ciliary%20base%20at%20the%20junction,turboGFP%20fusion%20construct%20%28Supplementary%20Figure)). In addition, CFAP418 is present along the photoreceptor ciliary rootlet/axoneme and in the adjacent inner segment cytoplasm, co-localizing with microtubule structures ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=localized%20to%20photoreceptor%20cilia%20in,In%20addition%2C%20C8orf37%20was)). This distribution aligns with its association with microtubule-binding proteins and ciliary transport roles. Co-immunostaining experiments demonstrated that CFAP418 co-localizes with FAM161A at the photoreceptor ciliary base ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,of%20FAM161A%20were%20critical%20for)), further confirming its residence in ciliary basal body complexes. Outside of cilia, a portion of CFAP418 is diffused in the cytosol of photoreceptor cell bodies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=phenotype%20suggests%20a%20functional%20significance,localization%20of%20C8ORF37%20at%20the)), but notably it is absent from the photoreceptor outer segment itself ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=Considering%20the%20distribution%20of%20C8ORF37,in%20photoreceptors%20and%20on%20the)). Overall, CFAP418 is an **intracellular** protein concentrated at **primary cilia** and photoreceptor **connecting cilia** (ciliary base), consistent with its ciliary maintenance functions.

## Biological Processes Involvement  
Multiple lines of evidence link CFAP418 to biological processes in ciliated cells, especially photoreceptors. In the retina, CFAP418 is essential for processes underpinning photoreceptor cell maintenance and morphogenesis. Loss of CFAP418 function leads to degeneration of both rod and cone photoreceptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=generated%20using%20CRISPR%2FCas9%20technology,throughout%20the%20photoreceptor%20cell%20body)), highlighting its role in **photoreceptor cell survival**. Specifically, CFAP418 is required for the proper **organization of photoreceptor outer segment discs**, which develop as a specialized primary cilium. Disruption of CFAP418 causes failures in outer segment disc morphogenesis and alignment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=patients,establishes%20a%20valuable%20mouse%20model)), implicating CFAP418 in the biological process of *photoreceptor outer segment organization*. This process is critical to phototransduction and visual function, explaining why CFAP418 mutations result in vision loss. Accordingly, CFAP418 has been associated (by similarity and experimental evidence) with **photoreceptor cell morphogenesis** and the development of the light-sensitive outer segment structures ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=patients,establishes%20a%20valuable%20mouse%20model)).

Beyond the eye, CFAP418 participates in general ciliary processes. It appears necessary for normal **ciliogenesis and ciliary transport**. In zebrafish embryos, CFAP418 knockdown reduced the formation of Kupffer’s vesicle (a cilia-driven organ involved in left-right body axis specification) and caused defects in ciliary fluid flow, indicating a role in **motile cilia function** during development ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=system%2C%20we%20performed%20gene%20knockdown,hereby%20show%20that%20C8ORF37%20variants)). The same zebrafish model exhibited slowed retrograde melanosome transport in melanophore cells, a phenotype often linked to impaired **retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT)** in cilia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=cilium%20and%20in%20the%20cytoplasm,localization%20of%20C8ORF37%20at%20the)). Thus, CFAP418 likely contributes to **intraciliary transport** mechanisms, ensuring proper movement of ciliary cargo. In photoreceptors, which rely on IFT to traffic proteins through the connecting cilium, CFAP418’s involvement in transport may underpin its importance in outer segment renewal. In summary, CFAP418 is involved in key biological processes including **cilium assembly/function** and **photoreceptor outer segment development**, which collectively support sensory perception of light and cilia-related signaling.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
**Loss-of-function mutations** in CFAP418 (C8orf37) are known to cause several inherited human diseases, primarily affecting the retina and sometimes other organ systems. The gene was originally identified in the context of **autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy 16 (CORD16)** and **retinitis pigmentosa 64 (RP64)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=157657#:~:text=protein%20co,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Mar%202012)). In CORD16, patients first lose cone photoreceptor function (affecting central/color vision) followed by rod loss, while in RP64 rod degeneration precedes cone loss; mutations in CFAP418 can lead to either clinical presentation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=analysis%20of%20individuals%20who%20had,These)). Affected individuals typically experience progressive vision loss – in early-onset cone-rod dystrophy, photophobia and acuity loss occur, whereas in retinitis pigmentosa night blindness and peripheral vision loss are initial symptoms ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=Cone,nucleotide%20polymorphism%20databases%2C%20or%20the)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=probably%20pathogenic,the%20pathogenesis%20of%20retinal%20dystrophies)). Genetically, various biallelic CFAP418 mutations have been documented, including nonsense, splice-site, and missense changes that impact highly conserved residues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=revealed%20a%20homozygous%20nonsense%20mutation,G%20%5Bp.Gln182Arg%5D%29%20in%20siblings)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=analysis%20of%20individuals%20who%20had,These)). These pathogenic variants underscore CFAP418’s crucial role in photoreceptor viability. Notably, some patients with CFAP418-related retinal dystrophy exhibit mild systemic features: for example, two siblings with a splicing mutation had **postaxial polydactyly** (an extra digit) in one limb ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=of%20two%20other%20consanguineous%20families,the%20pathogenesis%20of%20retinal%20dystrophies)). The presence of polydactyly, a hallmark of ciliopathies, hinted that CFAP418 might have broader ciliary functions beyond the retina.

Importantly, CFAP418 has also been implicated in a **syndromic ciliopathy**, **Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS)**. A homozygous truncating mutation in C8orf37 was identified in a patient diagnosed with Bardet–Biedl syndrome who lacked mutations in known BBS genes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=with%20autism%2C%20among%20other%20features,rod%20dystrophy)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=Whole,rerio%20and%20assessed%20the%20cardinal)). This individual’s clinical features included rod-cone dystrophy (retinal degeneration), obesity (BMI ~29), three-site polydactyly (extra digits on limbs), a horseshoe kidney, reproductive tract malposition, and mild learning disability ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=Whole,rerio%20and%20assessed%20the%20cardinal)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=proband%20was%20overweight%20,phenotypes%2C%20specifically%2C%20defects%20in%20the)) – a constellation of findings consistent with BBS. Functional studies confirmed the link: zebrafish c8orf37 knockdown reproduced cardinal BBS phenotypes (such as ciliary transport defects and visual impairment), and human disease mutations failed to rescue these phenotypes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=recessive%20retinal%20dystrophies%20,This%20is%20the%20first%20functional)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=system%2C%20we%20performed%20gene%20knockdown,hereby%20show%20that%20C8ORF37%20variants)). This work established C8orf37 as **BBS21**, making CFAP418 the 21st gene associated with Bardet–Biedl syndrome ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=of%20these%20phenotypes%20to%20BBS,well%20as%20isolated%20retinal%20degeneration)). Unlike the isolated retinal dystrophies (RP64/CORD16), BBS21 patients have **multisystem involvement** – retinal degeneration accompanied by developmental and metabolic abnormalities – reflecting CFAP418’s role in primary cilia across various tissues. It is notable that CFAP418-deficient mice did **not** show overt polydactyly or other BBS systemic defects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=,to%20be%20normal%20in%20male)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)), suggesting species or context differences; however, the human genetics firmly link CFAP418 to the BBS spectrum. Overall, CFAP418 mutations can manifest as non-syndromic retinal degeneration (arRP, arCRD) or as a syndromic ciliopathy (BBS), united by the underlying disruption of ciliary/photoreceptor cell function.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The CFAP418 protein is relatively small (207 amino acids) and is not known to contain any well-characterized catalytic domains or binding motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=The%20function%20of%20the%20C8ORF37,the%20base%20of%20the%20primary)). Computational analysis identifies a conserved region corresponding to Pfam **RMP domain (pfam14996)**, standing for *Retinal Maintenance Protein* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=157657#:~:text=pfam14996%20Location%3A63%20%E2%86%92%20175%20RMP%3B,associated%20protein)). This so-called RMP domain constitutes the majority of the protein and is named for the gene’s role in retinal health – mutations in C8orf37 (RMP) cause retinal dystrophies CORD16 and RP64 ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam14996#:~:text=Image%20%20%203pfam14996%3A%C2%A0RMP%C2%A0Download%20alignment,colour%20blindness%20or%20blindness%20respectively)). Aside from this conserved region, CFAP418/C8orf37 does not share homology with other protein families and thus appears to represent a unique protein family. It has **no predicted transmembrane segments or signal peptide** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156172-CFAP418/summary/gene#:~:text=PROTEIN%20INFORMATION,associated%20protein%20418)), consistent with a cytosolic localization and function within intracellular compartments (like the ciliary base). Secondary structure predictions and disorder profiles are not well documented in literature; however, the lack of defined domains suggests CFAP418 may be largely disordered or adopt a novel fold until complexed with partners. 

Despite its simple architecture, CFAP418 has at least one defined functional interface: the **N-terminal segment** (approximately amino acids 1–75) is critical for binding to the ciliary protein FAM161A ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=with%20FAM161A%20at%20the%20ciliary,may%20contribute%20to%20photoreceptor%20health)). Interaction mapping experiments showed that CFAP418’s N-terminus directly interacts with a C-terminal domain of FAM161A (within FAM161A’s UPF0564 domain) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=with%20FAM161A%20at%20the%20ciliary,may%20contribute%20to%20photoreceptor%20health)). This indicates the N-terminus of CFAP418 may serve as a protein–protein interaction module. The C-terminal two-thirds of CFAP418 is highly conserved evolutionarily ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=The%20function%20of%20the%20C8ORF37,the%20base%20of%20the%20primary)), hinting that this region is functionally important (perhaps forming the RMP domain core required for retinal maintenance). In summary, CFAP418 is a **predicted intracellular protein** with a single conserved domain (RMP) and an interaction-prone N-terminus, lacking enzymatic or membrane-spanning features. Its structure appears tailored for a scaffolding or adaptor role in the ciliary photoreceptor context, rather than an enzymatic role.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
CFAP418 is **ubiquitously expressed** across human tissues, but shows elevated expression in certain organs, particularly those with ciliated cells. mRNA profiling indicates relatively high CFAP418 transcript levels in the **retina**, as well as in the **brain** and **heart** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=157657#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20ubiquitously,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). In fact, CFAP418 was first noted for its abundant expression in retinal tissue, aligning with its identification as a retinal disease gene. Within the eye, CFAP418 is expressed in the neural retina – notably in photoreceptor cells – and likely in the retinal pigment epithelium, given that the protein was detectable in RPE1 cell culture models ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=matched%20control%20individuals%2C%20single,G%20%5Bp.Gln182Arg%5D%29%20in%20siblings)). The Human Protein Atlas classifies CFAP418 among **disease related genes – eye disease** due to its retina-specific disease associations ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156172-CFAP418/summary/gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20BBS21%2C%20C8orf37%2C%20CORD16%2C%20FAP418%2C,i%7D%20Chromosome%208%20Cytoband%20q22.1)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156172-CFAP418/summary/gene#:~:text=Protein%20class,95269201)). Consistent with its ciliary role, CFAP418 may also be expressed in other ciliated tissues or cell types (e.g. the cells lining the respiratory tract, reproductive tract, or renal epithelium), though comprehensive single-cell data are not yet available. 

At the protein level, detecting CFAP418 has been challenging due to its small size and possibly low abundance. Nevertheless, *in situ* retina studies confirm its protein presence in photoreceptors (inner segments and ciliary structures) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=localized%20to%20photoreceptor%20cilia%20in,In%20addition%2C%20C8orf37%20was)). Large-scale proteomics (e.g. PaxDb, ProteomicsDB) have reported CFAP418 in many tissue extracts, corroborating its broad expression ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP418#:~:text=This%20gene%20is%20overexpressed%20in,3%29%2C%20Fetal)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP418#:~:text=)). There is currently limited information on *regulation* of CFAP418 expression – no specific transcription factors or signaling pathways have been definitively linked to its gene regulation in literature. The promoter region does not suggest unusual regulatory elements, although general transcription factors (like C/EBPβ, E2F, etc.) are predicted to bind the CFAP418 promoter region, as per in silico analyses ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP418#:~:text=Top%20Transcription%20factor%20binding%20sites,in%20the%20CFAP418%20gene%20promoter)). Given its requirement in fundamental cellular structures (cilia), CFAP418 likely has a constitutive expression pattern in most cell types, with possible upregulation during photoreceptor differentiation or cilia biogenesis. In summary, CFAP418 is **widely expressed**, with notable enrichment in the retina and other tissues reliant on ciliary function, and is generally considered a housekeeping gene necessary for cell structural maintenance.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
CFAP418 is highly conserved across diverse eukaryotic species, underscoring its fundamental role in ciliary biology. Orthologs of the human CFAP418 (C8orf37) gene are found in **mammals, birds, fish**, and even in some **unicellular eukaryotes** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=The%20function%20of%20the%20C8ORF37,the%20base%20of%20the%20primary)). Sequence analysis reveals that roughly the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein harbors the most conserved residues from humans down to organisms like flagellated protists and oomycetes (water molds) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=The%20function%20of%20the%20C8ORF37,the%20base%20of%20the%20primary)). This deep conservation suggests that the core function of CFAP418 was present early in eukaryotic evolution, likely related to the ancient origin of cilia/flagella. Indeed, many single-celled flagellates possess CFAP418 homologs, consistent with a role in flagellar function or assembly. The CFAP418 protein family (Retinal Maintenance Protein family) is identified in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database as a eukaryote-wide conserved domain (pfam14996) tied to retinal dystrophy when mutated in humans ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam14996#:~:text=Image%20%20%203pfam14996%3A%C2%A0RMP%C2%A0Download%20alignment,colour%20blindness%20or%20blindness%20respectively)). No homologs are evident in organisms that lack cilia (for example, flowering plants or fungi like yeast), highlighting a correlation between CFAP418 presence and ciliated cell types. 

Functional conservation is illustrated by cross-species studies. The **mouse** C8orf37 ortholog is ~82% identical to human and its knockout leads to retinal degeneration mirroring the human disease, indicating conserved function in photoreceptor cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=our%20understanding%20of%20the%20pathogenicity,involved%20in%20membrane%20disc%20organization)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)). In **zebrafish**, the c8orf37 gene is also conserved; knockdown of zebrafish c8orf37 causes visual impairment and ciliary defects, phenocopying aspects of human CFAP418 mutation effects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=unicellular%20flagellates%20and%20oomycetes%20%28Estrada,Kupffer%27s%20vesicle%2C%20a%20ciliated%20organ)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=system%2C%20we%20performed%20gene%20knockdown,hereby%20show%20that%20C8ORF37%20variants)). This conservation of phenotype – retinal dysfunction and ciliary process defects – across vertebrates (fish to mammals) supports the idea that CFAP418’s role in ciliary/photoreceptor biology has been maintained throughout evolution. Additionally, the interaction between CFAP418 and FAM161A (noted in primate retina) may be conserved, as many ciliary proteins co-evolved; for instance, rodents and primates share this interaction network at photoreceptor cilia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,of%20FAM161A%20were%20critical%20for)). Overall, both sequence and functional data demonstrate that CFAP418 is an **evolutionarily conserved** protein, likely present in the last common ancestor of ciliated eukaryotes, with a preserved role in maintaining ciliary structure and photoreceptor cell integrity across species.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
- **Identification as Retinal Dystrophy Gene (2012):** CFAP418 was first linked to disease by Estrada-Cuzcano et al. (2012) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=revealed%20a%20homozygous%20nonsense%20mutation,a%20consanguineous%20family%20and%20homozygous)). Using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in consanguineous families, they discovered **C8orf37 mutations** causing autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. This study also performed immunostaining, revealing CFAP418 protein at photoreceptor ciliary bases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=matched%20control%20individuals%2C%20single,G%20%5Bp.Gln182Arg%5D%29%20in%20siblings)), and concluded that disrupted ciliary processes underlie the retinal dystrophy phenotype ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=probably%20pathogenic,the%20pathogenesis%20of%20retinal%20dystrophies)). This seminal finding established CFAP418 as a cilia-associated protein required for retinal photoreceptor maintenance.

- **Additional Mutation Studies (2013–2015):** Subsequent genetic studies in diverse populations (e.g. van Huet et al. 2013; Jinda et al. 2014; Lazar et al. 2014; Ravesh et al. 2015) identified **multiple independent C8orf37 mutations** in patients with inherited retinal degenerations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=the%20development%20of%20effective%20treatments,2013%3B%20Jinda%20et)). These studies reinforced CFAP418’s role in **arCRD and arRP** by expanding the allelic series (including missense and nonsense variants) and refining clinical correlations. For instance, some reports noted macular involvement in the dystrophy or mild systemic anomalies, further hinting at ciliary involvement beyond the retina. Collectively, by 2015 CFAP418 was a well-established retinal disease gene, designated **CORD16** and **RP64** in the nomenclature of inherited retinal diseases.

- **Bardet–Biedl Syndrome Link (2016):** Heon et al. (2016) made a breakthrough by associating C8orf37 with **Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS)** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=Whole,rerio%20and%20assessed%20the%20cardinal)). They performed whole-genome sequencing on an atypical BBS patient and found a homozygous truncating C8orf37 mutation (K102*) after ruling out known BBS genes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=with%20autism%2C%20among%20other%20features,rod%20dystrophy)). To functionally validate this, they showed that morpholino knockdown of c8orf37 in zebrafish produced **BBS-like phenotypes**: retinal degeneration, defective Kupffer’s vesicle formation, and slowed intraciliary transport ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=recessive%20retinal%20dystrophies%20,This%20is%20the%20first%20functional)). Human CFAP418 mutants failed to rescue these defects, confirming pathogenicity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=system%2C%20we%20performed%20gene%20knockdown,hereby%20show%20that%20C8ORF37%20variants)). This study identified CFAP418 as **BBS21**, expanding its disease spectrum to a syndromic ciliopathy and providing the first in vivo evidence (zebrafish) of CFAP418’s role in ciliary biology.

- **Mouse Knockout Functional Study (2018):** Sharif et al. (2018) generated a **C8orf37 knockout mouse** to investigate CFAP418’s function in vivo ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=C8ORF37%20is%20a%20causative%20gene,onset%20of%20disc%20morphogenesis%20during)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=generated%20using%20CRISPR%2FCas9%20technology,throughout%20the%20photoreceptor%20cell%20body)). The knockout mice developed normally except for eyes, where they exhibited progressive degeneration of rods and cones (recapitulating human RP/CRD) with onset in early postnatal life ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=generated%20using%20CRISPR%2FCas9%20technology,throughout%20the%20photoreceptor%20cell%20body)). Ultrastructural analysis showed severely **disorganized outer segment discs** in photoreceptors lacking CFAP418 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)). Interestingly, the connecting cilium and other organ systems were structurally normal in these mice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=Considering%20the%20distribution%20of%20C8ORF37,in%20photoreceptors%20and%20on%20the)), suggesting CFAP418’s role is especially critical for outer segment disc morphogenesis rather than general ciliogenesis. The authors proposed that CFAP418 functions in the photoreceptor cell body to maintain outer segment membrane protein **homeostasis**, for example by facilitating proper packaging or trafficking of proteins needed to build stacked discs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=Considering%20the%20distribution%20of%20C8ORF37,in%20photoreceptors%20and%20on%20the)). This mouse model firmly established the functional requirement of CFAP418 in photoreceptor structure and provided an *in vivo* platform for testing therapies for CFAP418-related blindness ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=absent%20in%20the%20photoreceptor%20OS%2C,degeneration%20caused%20by%20C8ORF37%20mutations)).

- **Protein Interaction and Mechanistic Insight (2022):** Liu et al. (2022) explored CFAP418’s molecular partners using a yeast two-hybrid screen with C8orf37 bait, identifying **FAM161A** as an interacting protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=photoreceptor%20survival,Furthermore%2C%20interaction%20domain%20mapping)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,suggest%20that%20the%20two%20photoreceptor)). FAM161A is a known ciliary protein required for photoreceptor survival (mutated in RP28) that localizes to the photoreceptor ciliary base. The interaction between CFAP418 and FAM161A was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays in retinal cells, and mapped to CFAP418’s N-terminus and FAM161A’s C-terminal domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=with%20FAM161A%20at%20the%20ciliary,may%20contribute%20to%20photoreceptor%20health)). They also observed CFAP418 co-localizing with FAM161A at the cilium base in primate retina sections ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,of%20FAM161A%20were%20critical%20for)). This work provided **mechanistic insight** that CFAP418 is part of a protein complex at the photoreceptor ciliary base, potentially linking it to the microtubule network via FAM161A and other ciliopathy proteins. The study by Liu et al. helps explain how CFAP418 might stabilize the connection between the photoreceptor inner segment and outer segment, and underscores that **CFAP418 acts in concert with other ciliary proteins** to support photoreceptor structure.

Together, these key studies form a coherent picture of CFAP418: from gene discovery and disease association ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=the%20development%20of%20effective%20treatments,2013%3B%20Jinda%20et)), to animal models delineating its function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)), to molecular interaction mapping ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,suggest%20that%20the%20two%20photoreceptor)). They establish CFAP418 as an essential, evolutionarily conserved ciliary protein that underlies specific retinal diseases when mutated and interfaces with the broader ciliopathy protein network.

## Relevant Gene Ontology (GO) Terms

  - *Cytosol* **(GO:0005829)** – A fraction of CFAP418 is found in the cytoplasmic compartment of photoreceptor cells (excluding organelles) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=phenotype%20suggests%20a%20functional%20significance,localization%20of%20C8ORF37%20at%20the)). *(Predicted intracellular localization with no secretion or membrane association ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156172-CFAP418/summary/gene#:~:text=PROTEIN%20INFORMATION,associated%20protein%20418)).)*  

- **Biological Process:**  
  - *Photoreceptor cell outer segment organization* **(GO:0035845)** – CFAP418 is **required for proper outer segment disc morphogenesis and alignment**, crucial for photoreceptor function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=patients,establishes%20a%20valuable%20mouse%20model)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)). Mutations disrupt outer segment structure, leading to retinal degeneration.  
  - *Photoreceptor cell morphogenesis* **(GO:0008594)** – Involved in the developmental morphogenesis of photoreceptors, particularly in forming the outer segment (a modified cilium) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=patients,establishes%20a%20valuable%20mouse%20model)).  
  - *Cilium assembly* **(GO:0060271)** / *Cilium organization* – Implicated by zebrafish morphants that showed reduced Kupffer’s vesicle cilia and general ciliogenesis defects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008867/#:~:text=system%2C%20we%20performed%20gene%20knockdown,hereby%20show%20that%20C8ORF37%20variants)). CFAP418 supports normal formation of ciliary structures during development.  
  - *Intraflagellar transport (IFT)* **(related to GO:0042073)** – Knockdown of CFAP418 led to delayed retrograde transport of melanosomes, suggesting a role in retrograde IFT or cargo transport within cilia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=cilium%20and%20in%20the%20cytoplasm,localization%20of%20C8ORF37%20at%20the)). This links CFAP418 to the process of moving material along ciliary microtubules, important for cilium maintenance.  
  - *Visual perception* **(GO:0007601)** – Although CFAP418 is not directly a phototransduction protein, its necessity for photoreceptor structure means it is indirectly required for the process of vision. Mutations cause loss of photoreceptor function, thereby affecting visual perception ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=Cone,nucleotide%20polymorphism%20databases%2C%20or%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884456/#:~:text=photoreceptors%20but%20no%20non,our%20findings%20do%20not%20support)). *(This GO term would be a higher-level process reflecting the consequence of CFAP418 dysfunction.)*  

- **Molecular Function:**  
  - *Protein binding* **(GO:0005515)** – CFAP418 interacts with other proteins, e.g. FAM161A at the ciliary base ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,of%20FAM161A%20were%20critical%20for)). Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence of its protein-binding capability, suggesting it acts as an adaptor or scaffold. No enzymatic activity or ligand-binding has been reported, so its function is likely executed via protein–protein interactions.  

Each of the above GO terms is supported by experimental evidence from the literature, as cited, ensuring accurate Gene Ontology annotation for CFAP418. These annotations capture CFAP418’s role as an intracellular ciliary protein (cellular component), its involvement in building and maintaining photoreceptor cilium-derived structures (biological process), and its capacity to bind other ciliary proteins (molecular function), all of which are essential for normal photoreceptor and ciliary function ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257957/#:~:text=probably%20pathogenic,the%20pathogenesis%20of%20retinal%20dystrophies)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9570145/#:~:text=bait.%20FAM161A%2C%20a%20microtubule,suggest%20that%20the%20two%20photoreceptor)).
