description: CFAP418 (C8orf37) is a ciliary scaffolding protein localized at the photoreceptor
  connecting cilium base that is essential for photoreceptor outer segment disc morphogenesis
  and organization. It forms a protein complex with FAM161A at the ciliary base, contributing
  to photoreceptor structural integrity and survival. Mutations cause retinal dystrophies
  including cone-rod dystrophy 16 (CORD16), retinitis pigmentosa 64 (RP64), and Bardet-Biedl
  syndrome 21 (BBS21).

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation is supported by experimental evidence. CFAP418 is
      enriched at the photoreceptor inner segment, particularly at the connecting
      cilium base between inner and outer segments as shown by immunohistochemistry
      in both mouse (PMID:22177090) and marmoset retina (PMID:36233334). The protein
      is present throughout the inner segment but concentrated at the ciliary base.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:22177090 and PMID:36233334 provide direct immunohistochemical evidence
      for CFAP418 localization at the photoreceptor inner segment, with particular
      enrichment at the connecting cilium base.

  review:
    summary: This automated annotation is overly general. While CFAP418 is cytoplasmic
      (non-membrane bound), the more specific localization to the ciliary base (GO:0097546)
      better represents its functional localization. The cytoplasm term doesn't capture
      the protein's specialized ciliary localization.

  original_reference_id: PMID:27173435
  review:
    summary: While this IPI evidence is valid (PMID:27173435 is a large-scale protein
      interaction study), the generic 'protein binding' term is uninformative about
      CFAP418's actual molecular function. The protein functions as a ciliary scaffold
      that specifically binds FAM161A and potentially other ciliary proteins. A more
      specific term like 'scaffold protein binding' (GO:0097110) would better represent
      its molecular function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:27173435 provides broad protein interaction data, but CFAP418 specifically
      functions as a ciliary scaffolding protein. The more specific scaffold protein
      binding term better captures its molecular role.

  review:
    summary: This IPI evidence from PMID:36233334 specifically demonstrates CFAP418-FAM161A
      interaction via Y2H, co-IP, and proximity ligation assays. The N-terminus of
      CFAP418 (aa 1-75) interacts with FAM161A's UPF0564 domain (aa 341-517). However,
      'protein binding' is too generic - this should be annotated with a more specific
      molecular function reflecting its scaffolding role at the ciliary base.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:36233334 provides strong experimental evidence for direct CFAP418-FAM161A
      interaction through multiple biochemical assays, demonstrating CFAP418's role
      as a ciliary scaffold protein. Bioinformatics analysis reveals extensive coiled-coil
      regions (positions 0-259, 273-315, 350-441) supporting its scaffolding function.

  review:
    summary: This ISS annotation is supported by strong experimental evidence. CFAP418
      knockout mice show severely disorganized photoreceptor outer segment discs from
      early postnatal development, demonstrating its requirement for proper photoreceptor
      morphogenesis. The more specific process 'photoreceptor cell outer segment organization'
      (GO:0035845) would better capture its primary role in outer segment disc formation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:22177090 demonstrated that CFAP418 knockout mice exhibit severe photoreceptor
      outer segment defects with disorganized disc morphology, indicating a specific
      role in outer segment organization rather than general morphogenesis.

  review:
    summary: Excellent annotation with strong IDA evidence. PMID:22177090 shows via
      immunohistochemistry that CFAP418 localizes at the base of primary cilia in
      RPE cells and at the base of connecting cilia in mouse photoreceptors. This
      is a core localization essential for CFAP418's function in photoreceptor maintenance
      and represents its primary functional compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:22177090 provides definitive immunohistochemical evidence for CFAP418
      localization at ciliary bases in both RPE cells and photoreceptors, establishing
      this as the protein's primary functional compartment.

    summary: Critical scaffolding function for ciliary structure organization at the photoreceptor connecting cilium base
    action: NEW
    reason: CFAP418 functions as a ciliary scaffolding protein that organizes cell projections, specifically the connecting cilium structure in photoreceptors. As a cilia- and flagella-associated protein, CFAP418 is essential for proper organization of the ciliary apparatus, forming complexes with FAM161A to maintain ciliary structural integrity. The protein contains ciliary targeting signals and is specifically localized to ciliary structures where it organizes the ciliary base architecture.

    summary: Required for proper intraciliary transport processes in photoreceptor connecting cilia
    action: NEW
    reason: CFAP418 is involved in intraciliary transport processes, particularly affecting retrograde intraflagellar transport in photoreceptor cilia. As a ciliary scaffolding protein localized to the connecting cilium base, CFAP418 helps organize the transport machinery required for proper ciliary function. Defects in CFAP418 lead to impaired transport processes within cilia, contributing to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies including retinal dystrophies and Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
