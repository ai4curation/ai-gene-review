# CFAP418 Bioinformatics Analysis Results

## Summary
Bioinformatics analysis of CFAP418 (Q6ZT21) reveals a 453 amino acid protein with characteristics consistent with ciliary/flagellar associated proteins, including potential coiled-coil regions and protein interaction domains.

## Key Findings

### 1. Protein Properties
- **Length**: 453 amino acids
- **Molecular Weight**: ~57.6 kDa
- **Theoretical pI**: Basic (>7.0)
- **Charge distribution**: 45 basic residues vs 34 acidic residues

### 2. Structural Features

#### Coiled-Coil Regions
- **Multiple potential coiled-coil regions detected**
- Major coiled-coil domain spanning positions 0-259 (high confidence)
- Additional regions at positions 273-315 and 350-441
- Consistent with protein-protein interaction and structural roles

#### Domain Predictions (Pattern-based)
- 4 potential WD40-like repeat patterns detected
- 6 potential TPR-like motifs identified
- Note: These are simplified predictions requiring validation with HMM-based tools

### 3. Ciliary Localization Signals
- 3 VxPx-like motifs detected
- No canonical RVxP ciliary targeting signals found
- Pattern consistent with ciliary/flagellar localization (CFAP family)

### 4. Composition Analysis
- Proline content: 4.2% (normal range)
- Glycine content: 6.6% (slightly elevated)
- Serine content: 8.4% (elevated, potential phosphorylation sites)

## Functional Implications

1. **Ciliary/Flagellar Function**: Name (CFAP = Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein) and sequence features support ciliary localization

2. **Protein-Protein Interactions**: Extensive coiled-coil regions suggest roles in protein complex formation

3. **Structural Role**: Large size and coiled-coil architecture indicate potential structural/scaffolding function

## Limitations and Recommendations

### Current Analysis Limitations:
- Pattern-based domain predictions are approximate
- Coiled-coil prediction uses simplified algorithm
- No structural modeling performed

### Recommended Follow-up Analyses:
1. InterProScan for comprehensive domain annotation
2. COILS or Paircoil2 for refined coiled-coil prediction
3. AlphaFold structure prediction for 3D modeling
4. Ciliary proteomics database cross-reference
