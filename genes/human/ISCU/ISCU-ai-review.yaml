description: ISCU is the primary scaffold protein of the mitochondrial 
  iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery in human cells. It provides the 
  structural platform upon which nascent [2Fe-2S] clusters are assembled de novo
  before transfer to recipient apoproteins. The mature mitochondrial form 
  (isoform 1/ISCU2) functions in the mitochondrial matrix as part of a core ISC 
  complex that includes the cysteine desulfurase NFS1-LYRM4-NDUFAB1 subcomplex, 
  frataxin (FXN) as an allosteric activator, and ferredoxin-2 (FDX2) as the 
  electron donor. During cluster assembly, persulfide sulfur is transferred from
  NFS1 Cys381 to ISCU Cys138, and FDX2 provides reducing equivalents to reduce 
  persulfide to sulfide for [2Fe-2S] formation. ISCU dimerization, mediated by 
  Tyr-35, is critical for de novo cluster synthesis. Following cluster assembly,
  the HSPA9-HSCB chaperone system catalyzes ATP-dependent cluster release from 
  ISCU for transfer to downstream carriers (GLRX5, NFU1, ISCA1/ISCA2) and 
  ultimately to recipient Fe-S proteins. A cytosolic isoform (isoform 2/ISCU1) 
  participates in cytoplasmic Fe-S biogenesis. ISCU deficiency causes hereditary
  myopathy with exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation for cytoplasm localization based on phylogenetic 
        inference. ISCU has two isoforms - isoform 2 (ISCU1) lacks the 
        mitochondrial targeting sequence and localizes to the cytoplasm where it
        participates in cytoplasmic Fe-S cluster biogenesis (PMID:11060020, 
        PMID:16527810). The IBA is phylogenetically consistent with yeast and 
        other orthologs.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The cytoplasmic localization is well-supported for isoform 2 
        (ISCU1). UniProt confirms cytoplasmic localization for this isoform, and
        functional studies demonstrate a cytoplasmic ISC assembly complex exists
        (PMID:11060020, PMID:16527810, PMID:29309586).

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation for ferrous iron binding. ISCU binds Fe2+ as part
