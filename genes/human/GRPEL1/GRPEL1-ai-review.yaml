description: >-
  GRPEL1 encodes the primary human mitochondrial GrpE-like nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) that functions
  within the TIM23/PAM import motor complex. It accelerates ADP release from mitochondrial HSP70 (HSPA9/mortalin),
  enabling the chaperone to rebind ATP and release substrate proteins. GRPEL1 is essential for mitochondrial
  protein import, matrix protein folding, and Fe-S cluster biogenesis. It binds HSPA9 with high affinity
  (KD ~39 nM) and forms a stable hetero-oligomer with its paralog GRPEL2. GRPEL1 is the essential basal NEF
  (pLI ~0.90), while GRPEL2 provides stress-adaptive redox regulation.

    summary: >-
      GRPEL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for mitochondrial HSP70 (HSPA9). It accelerates ADP
      release and ATP rebinding on HSPA9, which is the defining biochemical activity of an adenyl-nucleotide
      exchange factor. Quantitative binding data show GRPEL1 binds HSPA9 with KD ~39 nM and inhibits
      single-turnover ATP hydrolysis at saturating concentrations, consistent with NEF activity
      (Srivastava et al., JBC 2017). The IBA annotation is phylogenetically well-supported, as GrpE family
      members across bacteria and eukaryotes share this conserved NEF function. This is the core molecular
      function of GRPEL1.
    action: ACCEPT

      Adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity is the defining molecular function of GRPEL1. This is

      activity on HSPA9, as well as by conserved domain architecture (GrpE family) and phylogenetic inference.

      GRPEL1 participates in protein import into the mitochondrial matrix as the NEF for HSPA9 within the
      PAM/TIM23 import motor. By cycling HSPA9 between ADP- and ATP-bound states, GRPEL1 enables the
      ratchet mechanism that drives preprotein translocation through the TIM23 channel (Srivastava et al.,

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation attributes direct unfolded protein binding to GRPEL1. However, GRPEL1 is a nucleotide
      exchange factor, not a substrate-binding chaperone. The unfolded protein binding activity in the
      Hsp70 system resides with HSPA9 itself (via its substrate-binding domain) and J-protein co-chaperones
      that deliver substrates. GRPEL1 acts on the nucleotide-binding domain of HSPA9 to accelerate ADP
      release, which indirectly causes substrate release. There is no evidence that GRPEL1 directly
      binds unfolded polypeptide substrates. The IBA annotation propagates from an IDA (PMID:11311562)
      that conflated the co-chaperone's role in the chaperone cycle with direct substrate binding.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      GRPEL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor that acts on the ATPase domain of HSPA9; it does not directly
      bind unfolded protein substrates. The chaperone system as a whole handles unfolded proteins, but
      GRPEL1's specific role is nucleotide exchange. This annotation confuses the system-level function
      with the molecular-level activity of this specific component. The core MF annotation should be
      GO:0000774 (adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity). The underlying IDA (PMID:11311562) does
      not demonstrate direct unfolded protein binding by GRPEL1.

      IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping. GrpE family proteins participate in the Hsp70 chaperone
      cycle, which assists protein folding. GRPEL1 contributes to protein folding indirectly by enabling
      HSPA9 to cycle through substrate binding and release, supporting folding of newly imported and
      misfolded matrix proteins. However, GRPEL1 is not itself a folding chaperone; it is a co-chaperone
      (NEF) that regulates the chaperone cycle.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While GRPEL1 participates in the protein folding process through its NEF function in the HSPA9
      chaperone cycle, protein folding is not its core evolved function. Its core function is nucleotide
      exchange factor activity (GO:0000774) within the mitochondrial protein import system. Protein folding
      is a downstream consequence of HSPA9 cycling that GRPEL1 facilitates, making it a non-core annotation.

      experiments demonstrated GRPEL1 (HMGE) binding to Hsp70 proteins (DnaK, Hsc70, Mt-Hsp70) and
      inhibiting HSJ1b-enhanced Hsc70 ATPase activity, not direct binding to unfolded protein substrates.
      The study characterized GRPEL1 as a GrpE homolog that interacts with Hsp70 chaperones, which is
      nucleotide exchange factor activity, not unfolded protein binding. The annotation appears to be
      a misinterpretation of the co-chaperone's role in the chaperone cycle as direct substrate binding.

  findings:
    - statement: >-
        Describes the human TIM23/TIM17 translocase complex, including Tim44 matrix localization
        and two TIM17 variants. GRPEL1 was not yet identified at the time of this study.

  title: Identification and characterization of a human mitochondrial homologue of
    the bacterial co-chaperone GrpE.
  findings:
    - statement: >-
        Original identification of GRPEL1 (HMGE). Demonstrated mitochondrial localization by
        subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry. Showed binding to DnaK, Hsc70, and
        Mt-Hsp70. Demonstrated inhibition of HSJ1b-enhanced Hsc70 ATPase activity. Modeled on
        the E. coli GrpE crystal structure with significant structural conservation.
      supporting_text: >-
        HMGE expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein co-purified with the E. coli Hsp70 protein DnaK
        in the absence of ATP. DnaK could be released from the GST-HMGE with a Mg-ATP wash.
        ...Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry studies using antisera raized against HMGE show
        that it is a mitochondrial protein.
