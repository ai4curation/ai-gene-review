## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9HAV7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=GrpE protein homolog 1, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=HMGE; AltName: Full=Mt-GrpE#1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GRPEL1; Synonyms=GREPEL1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GrpE family. .
- **Key Domains:** GrpE. (IPR000740); GrpE_CC. (IPR013805); GrpE_head. (IPR009012); GrpE (PF01025)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GRPEL1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GRPEL1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GRPEL1** (gene ID: GRPEL1, UniProt: Q9HAV7) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human GRPEL1 (UniProt Q9HAV7)

Identity verification and key definitions
- Gene/protein identity: GRPEL1 encodes the human mitochondrial GrpE-like 1 protein (GrpEL1), a member of the GrpE family of nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that regulate Hsp70 chaperone cycles. Experimental studies in human cells identify GRPEL1 and its paralog GRPEL2 as mitochondrial NEFs for mortalin/mtHsp70 (HSPA9) and place them in the mitochondrial protein import and quality control machinery (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2017; URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.788463; published Nov 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Organism and localization: Human (Homo sapiens). GRPEL1 localizes to mitochondria and partitions to the mitochondrial matrix by microscopy and subcellular fractionation in human cell lines (JBC 2017; URL above) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: GRPEL1 belongs to the conserved GrpE family co-chaperones that catalyze nucleotide exchange on Hsp70/DnaK systems; reviews and primary work affirm its role as the human mitochondrial GrpE-like NEF (IJMS 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158077; published Jul 2021) (havalova2021mitochondrialhsp70chaperone pages 26-27).

Biochemical function and pathway placement
- Primary function: GRPEL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor for mitochondrial Hsp70 (HSPA9). It accelerates ADP release and ATP rebinding on HSPA9, controlling substrate binding and release during protein folding and import. In vitro kinetics show tight binding of GRPEL1 to HSPA9 (KD ~39 nM) compared with GRPEL2 (~190 nM), and both NEFs inhibit single-turnover ATP hydrolysis at saturating concentrations as expected for NEF activity (JBC 2017; URL above; quantitative data within) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Import motor context (TIM23/PAM): GRPEL1 acts within the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) that powers import through the TIM23 channel. Co-immunoprecipitation in mitochondrial lysates shows GRPEL1/GRPEL2 associate with HSPA9 and TIMM44; ATP addition dissociates HSPA9–TIMM44 while the GRPEL1–GRPEL2 subcomplex remains stable, consistent with co-recruitment of the NEFs alongside HSPA9 at the import site (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6). Functionally, the GRPEL subcomplex fine-tunes import of preproteins and supports mitochondrial protein quality control and Fe–S cluster biogenesis downstream of HSPA9 (JBC 2017; URL above) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 11-12).

Cellular localization and interaction partners
- Localization: Mitochondrial matrix (microscopy with mitochondrial markers and fractionation) (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Interactors within the TIM23/PAM module: HSPA9/mtHsp70 and TIMM44; the J-protein co-chaperone module (DNAJC19/Tid1) and additional PAM factors (e.g., MAGMAS) operate in the same pathway context, with GRPEL1 functioning as the NEF for HSPA9 to drive the import motor (system-level reviews integrating these components) (IJMS 2021; URL above; Genes 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11050563; published May 2020) (havalova2021mitochondrialhsp70chaperone pages 26-27).

Distinctions versus paralog GRPEL2
- Binding and stability: GRPEL1 binds HSPA9 more tightly (KD ~39 nM) than GRPEL2 (~190 nM). Purified GRPEL1 or GRPEL2 alone tend to aggregate at 37 °C, whereas the GRPEL1–GRPEL2 hetero-oligomer (~150–160 kDa by native sizing) is more stable and retains robust NEF activity, indicating hetero-oligomerization stabilizes the NEFs in cells (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Redox/stress specialization: GRPEL2, not GRPEL1, forms a redox-sensitive disulfide-bonded dimer via Cys87 under oxidative stress; GRPEL2 knockout clones are viable in HEK293 cells, whereas no GRPEL1 knockout clones were obtained. Population genetics support essentiality of GRPEL1 (ExAC pLI ~0.90) versus tolerance for GRPEL2 (pLI ~0.01) (Redox Biology 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2018.07.024; published Oct 2018) (konovalova2018redoxregulationof pages 3-5). Together, data suggest GRPEL1 provides the basal essential NEF function, while GRPEL2 confers stress-adaptive regulation.

Essentiality, phenotypes, and quantitative data
- Essentiality indicators: Failure to recover GRPEL1 knockout clones in HEK293 cells and high LoF constraint (pLI ~0.90) indicate essentiality/LoF intolerance for GRPEL1 in humans, contrasting with GRPEL2 (pLI ~0.01) (Redox Biology 2018; URL above) (konovalova2018redoxregulationof pages 3-5).
- Quantitative mechanistic data: GRPEL1–HSPA9 KD ~39 nM vs GRPEL2 ~190 nM; EL1–EL2 hetero-oligomer ~150–160 kDa; EL1 shows greater aggregation propensity than EL2 at 37 °C unless in hetero-complex; assays used single-turnover [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis and biolayer interferometry (JBC 2017; URL above) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and stress signaling links
- Mitochondrial UPR activation (2023): Human UPRmt is activated by two integrated cytosolic signals generated by mitochondrial misfolding: (i) release of mtROS to the cytosol and (ii) accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol due to import defects (c-mtProt). Oxidation of cytosolic DNAJA1 enhances HSP70 engagement with c-mtProt, liberating HSF1 to drive UPRmt gene expression. These data implicate the TIM23/PAM import axis—including HSPA9 and its NEF system (GRPEL1/2)—as central in stress signaling when import is compromised (Nature, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06142-0; published Jun 2023) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Mitophagy upon import motor perturbation (2022, relevant to 2023–2024 context): A genome-wide CRISPR screen and proteomics show that dissociation of the PAM complex from the import machinery during mitochondrial misfolding reduces protein import and induces mitophagy in polarized mitochondria. The study reports decreased levels of HSPA9 and GrpEL1 under such stress conditions, consistent with import-motor remodeling as a mitophagy trigger (Nature Communications, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32564-x; published Sep 2022) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).

Biological processes and pathways
- Protein import and folding: GRPEL1 regulates HSPA9 cycling during presequence protein import via TIM23/PAM and assists folding/refolding of matrix proteins, maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Fe–S cluster biogenesis: Modulation of HSPA9 by GRPEL1 contributes to Fe–S protein biogenesis in the matrix, placing GRPEL1 in the ISC pathway context (JBC 2017; Reviews on Fe–S assembly also list GRPEL1 among matrix factors surrounding IscU/HSPA9) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1).
- Mitochondrial protein quality control (MPQC): GRPEL1 operates in the HSPA9/TIM23 import and chaperone system that underlies MPQC; reviews summarize NEFs (GRPEL1/2) as accelerating ADP/ATP exchange to initiate substrate release by Hsp70, integrating with J-proteins and other co-chaperones (Genes 2020; URL above; IJMS 2021; URL above) (havalova2021mitochondrialhsp70chaperone pages 26-27).

Current applications, real-world implementations, and expert analyses
- Research applications: The mechanistic framework places GRPEL1 as a prospective node to probe mitochondrial import stress, UPRmt induction, and mitophagy. System-level studies perturbing PAM/TIM23 or HSPA9 levels are used as experimental proxies for mitochondrial proteostasis stress and quality control, where GRPEL1 participates as the NEF controlling HSPA9 turnover on substrates (Nat Commun 2022; Nature 2023; URLs above) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Expert syntheses: Recent expert reviews on the mtHsp70 system and MPQC underscore the collaborative action of J-proteins, HSPA9, and GrpE-like NEFs (GRPEL1/2) in import and proteostasis and highlight disease associations when these systems fail (IJMS 2021; Genes 2020; URLs above) (havalova2021mitochondrialhsp70chaperone pages 26-27).

Statistics and datasets
- Binding affinity: GRPEL1–HSPA9 KD ~39 nM; GRPEL2 ~190 nM (biolayer interferometry) (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3).
- Oligomeric state: GRPEL1–GRPEL2 hetero-oligomer migrates at ~150–160 kDa; individual polypeptides ~25 kDa (JBC 2017) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6).
- Essentiality constraint: GRPEL1 pLI ~0.90 (loss-of-function intolerant) vs GRPEL2 pLI ~0.01 (tolerant) in ExAC; GRPEL2 knockout viable, GRPEL1 knockout not recovered in HEK293 (Redox Biology 2018) (konovalova2018redoxregulationof pages 3-5).

Conclusions
GRPEL1 (Q9HAV7) is the primary human mitochondrial GrpE-like NEF that localizes to the matrix and functions within the TIM23/PAM import motor to regulate HSPA9 chaperone cycling, thereby supporting presequence protein import, matrix proteostasis, and Fe–S cluster biogenesis. Compared with its paralog GRPEL2, GRPEL1 shows tighter HSPA9 binding and essentiality, whereas GRPEL2 confers redox-responsive modulation. Emerging studies tie perturbations of the import motor and HSPA9/GRPEL axis to human UPRmt activation and mitophagy, emphasizing GRPEL1’s central role in mitochondrial stress responses and quality control (JBC 2017; Redox Biology 2018; Nature Communications 2022; Nature 2023; URLs and dates above) (srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-1, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 2-3, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 11-12, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 5-6, konovalova2018redoxregulationof pages 3-5, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 1-2, srivastava2017regulationofmitochondrial pages 14-15, havalova2021mitochondrialhsp70chaperone pages 26-27).
