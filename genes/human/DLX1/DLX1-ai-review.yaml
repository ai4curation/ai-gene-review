description: >-
  DLX1 is a distal-less homeobox transcription factor that functions as a key regulator
  of GABAergic interneuron specification and migration in the ventral telencephalon.
  It
  contains a conserved homeodomain that binds TAAT/ATTA-like DNA motifs at enhancers
  and
  promoters to activate or repress developmental gene programs. DLX1 is a nuclear
  protein
  that acts in the forebrain as part of the ASCL1→DLX1/2→ARX/LHX6 GABAergic fate specification
  network. It also plays roles in craniofacial patterning and odontogenic development.
  The
  protein can modulate chromatin architecture through promoter-enhancer loop rewiring
  in a
  motif-dependent manner. In hematopoietic cells, DLX1 interacts with SMAD4 to inhibit
  TGF-beta
  superfamily signaling pathways including activin A, TGF-beta1, and BMP4.

proposed_new_terms:

      The process in which the developmental fate of a neuroblast becomes restricted
      such that it will
      develop into a GABAergic interneuron. This process occurs during ventral telencephalon
      development
      and involves specification of GABAergic identity before terminal differentiation.
    justification: >-
      While GO:0021893 (cerebral cortex GABAergic interneuron fate commitment) exists,
      it is specific
      to cerebral cortex. DLX1/2 act as early fate specification factors in the GABAergic
      lineage across
      multiple forebrain regions including ganglionic eminences. A more general term
      would be useful,
      though the existing cerebral cortex-specific term should be added to DLX1 annotations.

  - proposed_name: ventral forebrain GABAergic interneuron migration
    proposed_definition: >-
      The orderly movement of GABAergic interneuron precursors from their site of
      origin in the ganglionic
      eminences of the ventral telencephalon to their final positions in target regions
      such as cerebral
      cortex and hippocampus. This includes both tangential and radial migration components.
    justification: >-
      GO:0021853 (cerebral cortex GABAergic interneuron migration) exists but is specific
      to cortex.
      DLX1/2 regulate migration of GABAergic interneurons more broadly in the forebrain.
      A general term
      covering ventral forebrain GABAergic migration would be useful, though the existing
      cerebral
      cortex term should be added to DLX1.
