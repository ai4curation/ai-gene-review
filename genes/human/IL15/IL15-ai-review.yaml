description: >-
  Interleukin-15 is a cytokine that plays a major role in the development of
  inflammatory and protective immune responses. It stimulates proliferation
  of natural killer cells, T-cells, and B-cells, and promotes secretion of
  cytokines. Unlike most cytokines, IL15 is expressed in association with its
  high affinity receptor IL15RA on the cell surface (trans-presentation) and
  signals through the IL2RB/IL2RG receptor complex, triggering JAK1/JAK3
  phosphorylation and STAT3/STAT5 activation. Two isoforms exist: IL15-S48AA
  (secreted) and IL15-S21AA (intracellular, localized to cytoplasm and nucleus).

      summary: >-
        OVER-ANNOTATION: IL15 is a cytokine that INDUCES STAT phosphorylation via
        the
        JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but does NOT catalyze the phosphorylation reaction
        itself. Cytokines are signaling ligands that trigger downstream JAK kinases
        to
        phosphorylate STAT proteins. IL15 has no kinase activity. The appropriate
        term
        is GO:0042531 "positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein".
