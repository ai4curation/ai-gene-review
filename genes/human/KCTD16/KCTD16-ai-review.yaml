description: KCTD16 is an auxiliary subunit of GABA-B receptors that modulates the pharmacology and kinetics of receptor signaling. It contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain that forms an open pentamer and binds to the GABAB2 C-terminal tail in a 1:5 stoichiometry. Unlike KCTD12 which promotes rapid desensitization, KCTD16 generally confers sustained, non-desensitizing GABA-B receptor responses. KCTD16 is enriched in brain regions including thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, where it shapes postsynaptic inhibitory currents through GIRK channels. Notably, KCTD16 does not function as a Cullin3 E3 ligase adaptor, distinguishing it from other KCTD family members.

- term:
    id: GO:0042734
    label: presynaptic membrane
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: KCTD16 localizes to presynaptic membranes as part of GABA-B receptor complexes. Mouse brain studies show KCTD16 expression in regions with both presynaptic and postsynaptic localization (Metz et al. 2011). UniProt confirms presynaptic cell membrane localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is well-supported. KCTD16 functions as an auxiliary subunit of GABA-B receptors which are present at presynaptic terminals where they modulate neurotransmitter release via Gbetagamma signaling to voltage-gated calcium channels. This is consistent with the established role of GABA-B receptors in presynaptic inhibition.

  review:
    summary: KCTD16 is a component of postsynaptic GABA-B receptor complexes where it modulates GIRK channel-mediated inhibitory currents. Immunolocalization studies show KCTD16 at neuronal somata and neuropil (Metz et al. 2011).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is well-supported. KCTD16 tethers to GABAB2 C-terminus and shapes Gbetagamma-GIRK signaling kinetics at postsynaptic sites. Structural studies confirm the KCTD16-GABAB2 interaction (Zuo et al. 2019, PNAS). UniProt also confirms postsynaptic cell membrane localization.

  review:
    summary: KCTD16 is an integral auxiliary subunit of the GABA-B receptor complex. Multiple structural studies have demonstrated that KCTD16 pentamers bind the GABAB2 C-terminal tail.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While GO:0043235 (receptor complex) is correct, a more specific term exists. KCTD16 specifically forms part of the G protein-coupled GABA receptor complex (GABA-B receptor). The term GO:1902712 (G protein-coupled GABA receptor complex) is the appropriate specific term for GABA-B receptors.

    reason: This annotation accurately captures the core biological process function of KCTD16.

    reason: This annotation is strongly supported by structural evidence. Crystal structures show KCTD16 forms an open pentamer via its BTB/T1 domain (Zuo et al. 2019, Pinkas et al. 2017). The pentamerization is functionally important for receptor complex assembly.

  review:
    summary: This annotation derives from a yeast two-hybrid study that identified KCTD16 as an interactor of APP (amyloid precursor protein) extracellular domain. The interaction was confirmed in mammalian cells.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: GO:0005515 (protein binding) is an uninformative annotation that should be avoided. The referenced study (Yu et al. 2016) is a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen for APP interactors. While the interaction was confirmed, there is no clear physiological relevance established for a KCTD16-APP interaction, and this does not represent the core function of KCTD16. More informative molecular function terms should be used instead, such as the GABA-B receptor binding function.

    action: NEW
    reason: This molecular function annotation captures the core activity of KCTD16 as a GABA-B receptor auxiliary subunit. The BTB/T1 domain of KCTD16 directly binds the C-terminal tail of GABAB2 with characterized interfacial residues (Q34, F80, P101, E102 on KCTD16; I898, Y903, L904 on GABAB2).

  review:
    summary: KCTD16 H1 domain binds Gbetagamma subunits, analogous to KCTD12. This interaction shapes GABA-B receptor signaling kinetics.
    action: NEW
    reason: KCTD16, like other GABA-B associated KCTDs, possesses an H1 domain that engages Gbetagamma subunits. While the detailed kinetic effects differ from KCTD12 (which causes desensitization), the structural architecture for Gbetagamma binding is conserved. This is a key molecular function enabling KCTD16 to modulate GPCR signaling.

    action: NEW
