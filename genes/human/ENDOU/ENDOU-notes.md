# ENDOU Gene Research Notes

## Gene Overview
ENDOU (Endonuclease, Poly(U) specific) encodes a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, also known as human placental protein 11 (PP11). Originally misidentified as a serine protease, it was later demonstrated to be an RNA endonuclease with poly(U) specificity.

## Primary Function and Biochemical Properties

### Endoribonuclease Activity
- **Primary function**: Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded RNA at uridine-rich sequences [PMID:18936097 "The tumor marker human placental protein 11 is an endoribonuclease"]
- **Substrate specificity**: Preferentially cleaves at UU or GU dinucleotides [PMID:18936097 "cleaves single stranded RNA harboring U-rich sequences"]
- **Metal cofactor requirement**: Mn²⁺-dependent activity, unlike classical RNase A [PMID:18936097 "Mn²⁺-dependent RNA cleavage at uridines"]
- **Cleavage products**: Generates 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini on cleaved RNA fragments [PMID:18936097 "producing cyclic phosphate ends"]

### Catalytic Mechanism
- **Active site**: Contains a conserved His–His–Lys catalytic triad similar to RNase A
- **Enzymatic classification**: EC 3.1.-.- (endoribonuclease) and EC 4.6.1.- (lyase activity)
- **NOT a protease**: Despite original annotation, ENDOU has no detectable serine protease activity [PMID:18936097 "PP11 Has No Detectable Serine Protease Activity"]

## Structural Features

### Domain Architecture
- **Signal peptide**: N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (18 amino acids) for secretion [PMID:2350438 "typical hydrophobic signal sequence of 18 amino acids"]
- **Somatomedin B domain**: Contains a single somatomedin B domain at the N-terminus [PMID:1710108 "presence of a single somatomedin B domain in the recently cloned placental protein 11"]
- **EndoU domain**: C-terminal endoribonuclease domain with conserved His–His–Lys catalytic triad
- **Total length**: 410 amino acids (approximately 46.9 kDa mature protein)

### Evolutionary Conservation
- **Homologs**: Related to Xenopus XendoU and viral coronavirus Nsp15 endoribonucleases
- **Conservation**: EndoU family proteins are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and some viruses
- **Functional rescue**: Human ENDOU can rescue Drosophila Arlr mutants, demonstrating functional conservation [PMID:37803019 "human ENDOU can rescue arlr mutants"]

## Expression Patterns and Cellular Localization

### Tissue-Specific Expression
- **Placenta**: Highly expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts [PMID:2350438 "abundant expression of PP11 in syncytiotrophoblast"]
- **Tumor tissues**: Aberrantly expressed in various cancers, particularly ovarian carcinomas
  - 66.7% of mucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinomas express PP11 [PMID:6755403 "PP11 in 66.7%"]
  - 57.1% of serous ovarian cystadenocarcinomas express PP11 [PMID:6755403 "PP11 in 57.1%"]
- **Normal tissues**: Generally low expression in most adult tissues except placenta

### Subcellular Localization
- **Secreted protein**: Directed to secretory pathway by N-terminal signal peptide
- **Extracellular region**: Functions primarily in extracellular space [GO:0005576]
- **Cytoplasmic**: Also detected in cytoplasm of secretory cells prior to secretion [GO:0005737]
- **ER localization**: Colocalizes with ER markers during processing

## Biological Functions and Processes

### RNA Metabolism
- **RNA catabolic process**: Involved in degradation of specific RNA substrates [GO:0016075]
- **RNA processing**: May participate in processing of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) by analogy to Xenopus XendoU
- **Post-transcriptional regulation**: Implicated in post-transcriptional gene silencing [GO:0016441]

### Lipid Homeostasis (Novel Function)
- **Lipid metabolism regulation**: Acts as a negative regulator of lipolysis [PMID:37803019 "The endoribonuclease Arlr is required to maintain lipid homeostasis by downregulating lipolytic genes during aging"]
- **mRNA degradation mechanism**: Degrades mRNAs of lipolytic genes to maintain lipid storage
- **Age-related function**: Drosophila ortholog (Arlr) is essential for lipid accumulation during aging [PMID:37803019 "high expression levels of Arlr during aging are essential for lipid accumulation in LDs"]
- **Functional conservation**: Human ENDOU can rescue lipid defects in Drosophila Arlr mutants [PMID:37803019 "human ENDOU also act as negative regulators of lipolysis"]

### Immune System Function
- **B cell tolerance**: Mouse studies suggest role in activation-induced cell death (AICD) of B cells
- **Peripheral tolerance**: May contribute to elimination of auto-reactive B lymphocytes

## Disease Associations

### Cancer Biology
- **Tumor marker**: Originally identified as a diagnostic tumor marker [PMID:2350438 "putative serine protease with diagnostic significance as a tumor marker"]
- **Oncofetal expression**: Expression pattern similar to oncofetal antigens (high in tumors and placenta, low in normal adult tissues)
- **Ovarian cancer**: Particularly elevated in ovarian adenocarcinomas [PMID:6755403]
- **Diagnostic potential**: Proposed as molecular marker for tumor diagnosis

### Pregnancy and Development
- **Placental function**: Highly expressed during pregnancy in placental tissue [GO:0007565 female pregnancy]
- **Trophoblast biology**: May play role in trophoblast invasion and placental development

## Functional Interactions and Pathways

### Molecular Function Annotations
- **RNA binding**: Direct RNA binding capability [GO:0003723] [PMID:18936097]
- **RNA endonuclease activity**: Primary molecular function [GO:0004521]
- **Metal ion binding**: Requires manganese ions for activity [GO:0030145]
- **Growth factor activity**: Suggested growth factor-like properties [GO:0008083]

### Regulatory Networks
- **Lipolysis pathway**: Negatively regulates lipolytic gene expression
- **RNA surveillance**: May participate in RNA quality control mechanisms
- **Stress response**: Potentially involved in cellular stress responses during aging

## Research Significance and Open Questions

### Key Discoveries

2. **Lipid homeostasis role**: Novel function in metabolic regulation discovered through Drosophila studies [PMID:37803019]
3. **Evolutionary conservation**: Functional rescue across species demonstrates conserved role

- **Diagnostic applications**: Continued utility as tumor biomarker

## Summary
ENDOU represents a fascinating example of gene function evolution and misannotation correction. Originally thought to be a serine protease, it is actually a unique uridylate-specific endoribonuclease with roles in RNA metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and potentially immune regulation. Its expression in placenta and tumors, combined with its newly discovered metabolic functions, makes it an important gene for understanding both normal physiology and disease pathogenesis.
