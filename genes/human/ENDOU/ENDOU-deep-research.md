# ENDOU (Poly(U)-specific Endoribonuclease) Gene in Homo sapiens

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms

The human **ENDOU** gene encodes a **poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease** that binds and cleaves single-stranded RNA, particularly at uridylate-rich sequences ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=involved%20in%20small%20nucleolar%20RNA,like)). Unlike classical RNase A, which is secreted and cuts RNA without metal cofactors, ENDOU’s activity is **Mn²⁺-dependent** and cuts at the 5′-side of uridine residues, generating 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini on the cleaved RNA fragments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=expressed%20human%20PP11%20displays%20RNA,like)). Biochemical studies demonstrated that recombinant ENDOU (also known as **placental protein 11, PP11**) can bind polyuridine stretches and selectively cleave RNA at **UU or GU motifs**, reflecting a preference for U-rich targets ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=involved%20in%20small%20nucleolar%20RNA,like)). This endoribonuclease activity was a surprising discovery because ENDOU was **initially misannotated as a serine protease** based on sequence similarity; subsequent structural and mutagenesis analyses revealed that it actually shares **striking parallels with amphibian XendoU ribonuclease**, not proteases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Human%20PP11%20,capability%20and%20cleaves%20single%20stranded)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=2%E2%80%B2%2C3%E2%80%B2,like)). The **catalytic mechanism** of ENDOU involves a **His–His–Lys triad** in the active site, analogous to that of RNase A: two histidines act as general acid/base catalysts, and a lysine stabilizes the transition state ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)). Point mutations in these conserved active-site residues abolish the nuclease activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=expressed%20human%20PP11%20displays%20RNA,like)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)), confirming that ENDOU uses a conserved ribonucleolytic mechanism. Through this enzymatic activity, ENDOU likely participates in **RNA processing or turnover**; for example, its Xenopus homolog (XendoU) is involved in small nucleolar RNA processing, and the viral homolog Nsp15 is essential for coronavirus RNA replication ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Several%20PP11,uridylates%2C%20to%20produce%20molecules%20with)). By analogy, human ENDOU may process or degrade specific cellular RNAs, although its precise endogenous RNA substrates remain to be fully identified.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components

ENDOU is a **secreted protein**, synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal signal peptide that directs it into the secretory pathway ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20prognostic%20summary%20Prognostic%20marker,binding)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Splice%20variant%20%20,specific%20endoribonuclease)). It is predicted to be **extracellular (locally secreted)** rather than retained on the plasma membrane ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20prognostic%20summary%20Prognostic%20marker,binding)). Consistent with this, immunohistochemistry shows ENDOU in the **extracellular space (GO:0005615)** and in the **cytoplasm (GO:0005737)** of producing cells ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=protein.%20,1)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Predicted%20location,binding)). In placenta and certain epithelia, ENDOU protein exhibits a punctate **cytoplasmic distribution**, likely reflecting localization to secretory granules or vesicles prior to secretion ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=protein.%20,1)). There is no strong evidence that ENDOU localizes to the nucleus or other organelles in human cells. Instead, once secreted, it presumably functions in the **extracellular region (GO:0005576)**, possibly in the immediate vicinity of the cells that produce it ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20prognostic%20summary%20Prognostic%20marker,binding)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=protein.%20,1)). Notably, **ENDOU is not detectable in blood plasma under normal conditions** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20distribution%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%20Low%20region%20specificity)), suggesting it acts locally (e.g. in tissues like placenta or mucosa) rather than as a circulating enzyme. In summary, ENDOU is a **secreted, extracellular ribonuclease** that also resides transiently in the cytosol of secretory cells, aligning with its designation as a locally acting secreted enzyme.

## Biological Processes Involvement

Given its ribonuclease activity, ENDOU is implicated in **RNA metabolic processes**. By cleaving single-stranded RNAs, it likely contributes to **RNA catabolic process** (degradation of RNA) or the processing of specific noncoding RNAs. In Xenopus, the homolog XendoU participates in **snoRNA biogenesis**, and by homology ENDOU may also assist in processing small RNAs required for **ribosome biogenesis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=amphibian%20endoribonuclease%20that%20participates%20in,considered%20as%20a%20major%20genetic)), though a direct role in human snoRNA processing has not been confirmed. Instead, emerging evidence links ENDOU to the immune system: in mice, Endou was identified as a **critical regulator of activation-induced cell death (AICD) in B cells**, a process that eliminates self-reactive B lymphocytes as part of peripheral tolerance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=auto,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). Mouse B cells lacking Endou are resistant to AICD and fail to downregulate c-Myc upon antigen receptor engagement, indicating that Endou normally promotes apoptosis in overstimulated or auto-reactive B cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=auto,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). This places ENDOU in a novel **RNA-mediated pathway of immune tolerance**, where its ribonuclease activity might degrade specific mRNAs or non-coding RNAs to trigger cell death in activated B cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=RNA,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). Additionally, ENDOU has been associated with **trophoblast invasion and tumor progression**. Both placental syncytiotrophoblasts and malignant tumors (especially of placenta origin) are invasive tissues, and the high ENDOU expression in these cells suggests it could facilitate **cell invasion or immune evasion** in the microenvironment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=its%20high%20levels%20of%20expression,be%20utilized%20for%20specialized%2Faberrant%20activities)). For instance, ENDOU might degrade extracellular RNAs that would otherwise activate immune responses or influence intercellular communication, thereby creating a milieu favorable for tissue invasion. While the exact biological processes are still being elucidated, current data indicate that ENDOU plays roles in **RNA turnover**, **apoptotic processes in immune regulation**, and possibly in supporting the unique invasive functions of placental and cancer cells.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes

ENDOU was originally described as a **tumor-associated placental protein** and is now studied as a potential **tumor marker**. It is notably expressed in certain cancers: one survey found ENDOU (PP11) **upregulated in 66.7% of mucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinomas and 57.1% of serous ovarian carcinomas, while absent in normal ovarian tissue** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,molecular%20marker%20for%20tumor%20diagnosis)). ENDOU was also detected in ~47% of breast carcinomas and ~38% of testicular and gastric cancers examined ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,molecular%20marker%20for%20tumor%20diagnosis)). Because of this oncofetal expression pattern (present in tumors and placenta but low in most normal adult tissues), ENDOU has been proposed as a **diagnostic marker for cancers** like ovarian carcinoma ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,molecular%20marker%20for%20tumor%20diagnosis)). Its functional role in cancer is not fully understood, but the correlation with invasive tumors suggests ENDOU might contribute to tumor progression or metastasis – possibly by remodeling the tumor microenvironment or helping tumor cells evade RNA-mediated immune surveillance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=its%20high%20levels%20of%20expression,be%20utilized%20for%20specialized%2Faberrant%20activities)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,of%20all%20breast%20cancers%20examined)). In support of a functional role, *in vitro* studies have noted that **high ENDOU levels in head and neck cancer correlate with better prognosis** (a favorable prognostic marker) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20prognostic%20summary%20Prognostic%20marker,binding)), hinting that ENDOU could influence tumor behavior or patient response. Aside from cancer, ENDOU’s role in **autoimmunity** is of interest due to its function in B cell tolerance; dysregulation of ENDOU could, in theory, affect autoimmune disease development, though no specific autoimmune disorder has been directly linked to ENDOU in humans yet. There are also references associating ENDOU with a congenital disorder (distal arthrogryposis type 6) via bioinformatic text-mining ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENDOU#:~:text=ENDOU%20,type%20peptidase%20activity)), but **no direct genetic evidence** currently connects ENDOU mutations to this phenotype. Overall, ENDOU’s main disease relevance lies in oncology (as a marker and potential modulator of tumorigenesis) and possibly immunology (tolerance and autoimmunity), warranting further clinical research.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features

The ENDOU protein is **410 amino acids** in length (∼46.9 kDa) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENDOU#:~:text=410%20amino%20acids%20Molecular%20mass%3A,46872%20Da)), comprising a signal peptide (for secretion) and a large enzymatic domain. It belongs to the **XendoU/EndoU endoribonuclease family**, whose members share a conserved catalytic core. The enzyme’s **active site** contains a **His–His–Lys motif** required for catalysis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)). This motif lies in the central region of the protein and is responsible for binding and cleaving the RNA substrate via general acid-base catalysis (by the two histidines) and transition state stabilization (by the lysine) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)). ENDOU’s tertiary structure is expected to be similar to other family members (e.g., viral Nsp15 endonuclease), which have a mixed α/β fold forming a nuclease domain ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=The%20EndoU%20nuclease%20active%20site,The%20EndoU%20catalytic)). Although the high-resolution crystal structure of human ENDOU has not been published as of yet, **homology models** and mutagenesis data support a structure with similarity to *X. laevis* XendoU ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=predicted%20serine%20protease%20function%3B%20it,directed%20mutagenesis)). ENDOU is likely a **monomeric enzyme** in its secreted form, though some homologs (like coronavirus Nsp15) assemble into oligomers for full activity. The protein is predicted to have several **disulfide bonds**, consistent with being a secreted glycoprotein; multiple cysteine residues are present (including in Cys-rich segments) that probably form intra-molecular disulfide linkages important for structural stability in the extracellular environment. ENDOU also contains consensus **N-linked glycosylation sites**, suggesting it is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Indeed, placental PP11 was characterized as a glycoprotein in early studies ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,it%20was%20shown%20that%20the)). There are no known additional large domains in ENDOU – the protein is essentially a single-domain ribonuclease (after the signal sequence is cleaved) with **poly(U)-specific RNase activity**. Notably, earlier names like **PRSS26** (serine protease 26) arose from a presumed trypsin-like domain; however, we now know ENDOU’s domain is an RNase fold, not a serine protease, despite superficial sequence motifs. In summary, ENDOU’s structure features a **secretory signal peptide**, a **core endoribonuclease domain** with a His–His–Lys catalytic triad, and likely several **post-translational modifications** (disulfides and N-glycans) that support its function as a secreted enzyme.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation

**Tissue distribution:** ENDOU shows a highly skewed expression pattern. It was first identified in the **placenta**, and indeed placenta (specifically the syncytiotrophoblast layer) exhibits very high ENDOU expression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,1)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)). In early reports, ENDOU/PP11 was undetectable in most adult tissues aside from placenta ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,1)). Modern transcriptome analyses confirm that ENDOU is **tissue-enhanced in placenta**, and also in a few other tissues such as the **esophagus and tongue**, which have squamous epithelial cells ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)). Immunohistochemistry data indicate prominent **cytoplasmic ENDOU expression in placental trophoblasts and in stratified squamous epithelia** (e.g. epidermal keratinocytes, esophageal lining) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=protein.%20,1)). By contrast, most other tissues (brain, muscle, etc.) show little to no ENDOU expression. Notably, **immune cells do not express ENDOU at baseline** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20specificity,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)), which correlates with its absence from blood and restriction to specific cell types. There is some expression in skin and gastrointestinal tract epithelia, but overall ENDOU is best characterized as an **oncofetal or tissue-selective gene**.

**Regulation:** The factors regulating ENDOU expression are not fully defined. Because ENDOU is elevated in placenta, it may be influenced by **pregnancy-related hormones** or transcription factors active in trophoblasts. Its induction in tumors suggests that **oncogenic pathways or epigenetic changes** can upregulate ENDOU in cancer cells – for example, hypomethylation or specific transcription factors in trophoblast-like cancers might activate ENDOU transcription (this is an area of ongoing research). In the immune context, while resting lymphocytes do not express ENDOU, it might be **induced upon B cell activation** or stress, as implied by the phenotype of Endou-deficient mice (where B cells likely expressed it during activation to undergo AICD) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=auto,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). Thus, ENDOU expression could be conditional, turning on in B cells only under certain stimulation conditions to enforce tolerance. Additionally, multiple **alternative splicing isoforms** of ENDOU mRNA exist ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8909#:~:text=protease,1%20other%20tissue%20See%20more)), which might be differentially expressed or regulated. However, the dominant transcript encodes the secreted form described above. In summary, ENDOU is expressed strongly in placenta and some epithelia (possibly under hormonal or developmental regulation), is aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers, and may be inducible in immune cells during specific activation events. The **Gene Ontology (GO) classification** reflects this pattern: ENDOU’s RNA is “**detected in some tissues**” and shows **group-enriched expression in syncytiotrophoblasts and suprabasal keratinocytes** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)), consistent with the known biology of this gene.

## Evolutionary Conservation

ENDOU is an **evolutionarily ancient gene**, with homologs found across a broad range of organisms. Orthologs of ENDOU (or closely related endoribonucleases) exist in **vertebrates** (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) and even in invertebrates such as **nematode worms**, indicating that this gene family was present in a common ancestor of bilaterian animals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Human%20PP11%20,capability%20and%20cleaves%20single%20stranded)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Several%20PP11,uridylates%2C%20to%20produce%20molecules%20with)). The family is defined by the EndoU/XendoU domain with the His–His–Lys catalytic triad, and these key residues are conserved from **Xenopus** (frog) to **Homo sapiens** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)). The strong conservation of the active site suggests that the fundamental biochemical function – cleaving RNA at uridines – has been maintained throughout evolution. Intriguingly, EndoU-related enzymes are also found in **viruses**: many coronaviruses encode an endoribonuclease called **Nsp15 (also known as NendoU)** that is clearly homologous to ENDOU ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=processes,uridylates%2C%20to%20produce%20molecules%20with)). This viral enzyme is crucial for viral RNA processing and immune evasion, hinting that viruses may have co-opted an ancestral cellular EndoU-like enzyme for their lifecycle. There is even evidence of EndoU-like domains in certain **bacterial toxin systems**, implying that the basic fold and mechanism have been adapted in different biological contexts ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Functional%20plasticity%20of%20antibacterial%20EndoU,The%20EndoU%20catalytic)). In mammals, ENDOU is syntenic and relatively conserved; for example, the **mouse Endou** shares high sequence identity with human ENDOU and mirrors its biochemical activity (the mouse protein can likewise cleave poly(U) RNAs and has the same catalytic motif). Functional conservation is illustrated by the mouse phenotype in B cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=auto,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)), suggesting an ancient role in immune regulation or RNA metabolism that might be shared across species. Therefore, ENDOU represents a gene with **deep evolutionary roots**, conserved catalytic machinery, and diversified roles – from snoRNA processing in amphibian oocytes to antiviral defense in viruses to immunological and placental functions in mammals. The evolutionary retention of ENDOU underscores the importance of its RNA cleavage activity in fundamental cellular and physiological processes.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature

- **Identification as Placental Protein 11 (1980s):** ENDOU was first isolated in the 1980s as **placental protein 11 (PP11)**, one of several glycoproteins uniquely abundant in term placentas ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,1)). Initial characterization (cDNA cloning in 1990) predicted it to be a secreted trypsin-like protease, based on sequence motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Human%20PP11%20,capability%20and%20cleaves%20single%20stranded)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,1)). It was noted that PP11 appeared **placenta-specific** and was undetectable in other normal tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=PP11%20,1)).

- **Tumor Marker Discovery:** Subsequent studies in the 1990s and 2000s found that ENDOU/PP11 is **expressed in many tumors**, especially germ cell and epithelial cancers. For example, Huppertz et al. and others reported high PP11 levels in ovarian cancer and trophoblastic tumors (choriocarcinoma) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,molecular%20marker%20for%20tumor%20diagnosis)). By the 2000s, ENDOU was recognized as an oncofetal antigen that could serve as a **molecular marker for tumor diagnosis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=placenta,molecular%20marker%20for%20tumor%20diagnosis)).

- **Laneve et al. 2008 (J. Biol. Chem.):** This pivotal study **redefined ENDOU’s function**. Laneve and colleagues showed that recombinant human PP11 is not a protease but an **endoribonuclease** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=involved%20in%20small%20nucleolar%20RNA,like)). They demonstrated **Mn²⁺-dependent RNA cleavage at uridines**, producing cyclic phosphate ends, and identified key active-site residues by homology modeling and mutagenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=expressed%20human%20PP11%20displays%20RNA,like)). This work firmly established ENDOU as a **poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease**, related to Xenopus XendoU and coronavirus Nsp15 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Several%20PP11,features%2C%20together%20with%20structural%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=2%E2%80%B2%2C3%E2%80%B2,like)).

- **Poe et al. 2014 (J. Exp. Med.):** This study uncovered a **biological role for EndoU in immune tolerance**. Using a mouse model, the authors found that EndoU is a “**major regulator of B cell survival**” during activation-induced cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=egg%20lysozyme%20,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). Mice with Endou disruption had B cells that resisted AICD, implicating EndoU’s RNase activity in an RNA-dependent cell death pathway. This provided the first in vivo evidence of ENDOU’s function in regulating cell fate (apoptosis) and immunity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=RNA,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)).

- **Structural and Mechanistic Studies:** Various structural biology efforts (e.g., Ivanov et al. 2004; Guarino et al. 2005) on XendoU and Nsp15 have informed our understanding of ENDOU. These studies revealed the **His–His–Lys catalytic triad** and a conserved fold for EndoU-family nucleases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)). While a human ENDOU crystal structure is pending, modeling suggests a similar configuration. Such studies also highlight mechanistic parallels to RNase A, despite ENDOU’s requirement for metal ions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173971/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20EndoU%20nucleases%20cleave%20phosphodiester,equivalent%20to%20the%20catalytic%20His)).

- **Database Annotations and Current Knowledge:** Comprehensive databases corroborate these findings. UniProt and Gene Ontology annotations list ENDOU as an **RNA-binding endoribonuclease** (with GO terms for **RNA binding** and **endoribonuclease activity**) and place it in the **extracellular region** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,binding)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Show%20all%20%20,extracellular%20space)). The Human Protein Atlas confirms ENDOU protein expression in placenta and certain epithelia and its secretion localization ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Predicted%20location,protein%20with%20protease%20activity%20and)). Ongoing research is exploring ENDOU’s substrates and its potential as a drug target or diagnostic marker in cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Relevant GO Terms

- **Molecular Function:** RNA binding **(GO:0003723)** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,binding)); endoribonuclease activity **(GO:0004521)**, cleaving RNA to yield 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=expressed%20human%20PP11%20displays%20RNA,like)); metal ion binding (e.g., manganese) **(GO:0046872)** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=termini,binding)). *(Historically, ENDOU was misannotated with serine-type peptidase activity, but this has been corrected as it has no protease activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=Human%20PP11%20,capability%20and%20cleaves%20single%20stranded)).)*

- **Biological Process:** RNA catabolic process/RNA metabolism **(GO:0016075)**, particularly degradation of single-stranded RNA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=expressed%20human%20PP11%20displays%20RNA,like)). Implicated in **activation-induced cell death of B cells** (peripheral B cell tolerance) and apoptotic process **(GO:0006915)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3892980/#:~:text=RNA,to%20peripheral%20B%20cell%20tolerance)). Possibly involved in **small nucleolar RNA processing** **(GO:0016074)** by analogy to XendoU ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3259861/#:~:text=amphibian%20endoribonuclease%20that%20participates%20in,considered%20as%20a%20major%20genetic)), and in **immune system process** **(GO:0002376)** through its role in tolerance. Also associated with **multicellular organism development** (placental development) and **cell invasion** in the context of placentation and cancer (though no specific GO term is yet assigned for the latter).

- **Cellular Component:** Extracellular region **(GO:0005576)** and extracellular space **(GO:0005615)** ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Predicted%20location,protein%20with%20protease%20activity%20and)) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Show%20all%20%20,extracellular%20space)); cytoplasm **(GO:0005737)** (within secretory cells, prior to secretion) ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=protein.%20,i%7D%20Group%20enriched)). ENDOU is secreted and not typically associated with organelle membranes or the nucleus. *(Note: ENDOU lacks a transmembrane domain and is described as a locally secreted soluble protein ([v20.proteinatlas.org](https://v20.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405-ENDOU#:~:text=Cancer%20prognostic%20summary%20Prognostic%20marker,binding)).)*
