description: Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded RNA
  at UU and GU motifs in a Mn2+-dependent manner. Originally misidentified as a serine
  protease (placental protein 11/PP11), ENDOU is now established as a poly(U)-specific
  ribonuclease with emerging roles in lipid homeostasis and immune regulation. The
  enzyme produces 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini through a His-His-Lys catalytic triad
  mechanism. Secreted protein expressed predominantly in placenta (syncytiotrophoblast)
  and various tumor tissues, with newly discovered functions in downregulating lipolytic
  gene expression to maintain lipid storage during aging.

    summary: ACCEPT - Core enzymatic function strongly supported by IBA and confirmed
      experimentally. This phylogenetically-inferred annotation aligns perfectly with
      the demonstrated molecular function of ENDOU.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:18936097 definitively established ENDOU as an RNA endonuclease with
      Mn2+-dependent activity that cleaves single-stranded RNA at UU and GU dinucleotide
      motifs, producing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. This core function is strongly
      supported by phylogenetic analysis.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: REMOVE - This vague IEA annotation likely derives from obsolete protein
      family classifications. No direct evidence supports ENDOU involvement in signal
      transduction pathways. The protein functions as an RNA endonuclease that affects
      gene expression post-transcriptionally, not through signal transduction.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: No evidence from PMID:18936097, PMID:37803019, or other references supports
      signal transduction activity. ENDOU functions as an RNA-degrading enzyme, not
      a signaling molecule.

      through the secretory pathway, this annotation implies active participation

  review:
    summary: REMOVE - No evidence supports scavenger receptor activity. This erroneous
      annotation likely stems from early misidentification of ENDOU as a serine protease
      or confusion with other placental proteins. ENDOU is an RNA endonuclease, not
      a receptor.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PMID:18936097 definitively disproved receptor activity and established
