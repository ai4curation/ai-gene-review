description: >-
  AFAP1 (Actin filament-associated protein 1, also known as AFAP-110) is a modular
  adaptor/scaffold protein that crosslinks F-actin and directly regulates Src-family
  kinase signaling. The protein contains two PH domains (PH1 binds PKCalpha), N-terminal
  proline-rich SH3-binding motifs and SH2-binding motifs that engage c-Src, a central
  leucine-zipper/coiled-coil for multimerization, and a C-terminal actin-binding domain
  (ABD) that mediates F-actin binding. AFAP1 localizes to stress fibers and focal adhesions
  under basal conditions but redistributes to podosomes/invadopodia upon PKC/Src activation.
  It functions as an adapter linking Src and PKC to the actin cytoskeleton, and is required
  for proper c-Src activity spatially and temporally during lactation in mammary epithelium.
  AFAP1 is implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis through its role in cytoskeletal
  remodeling and podosome/invadopodia formation.

      AFAP1 localizes to actin filaments through its C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD).
      The protein is distributed along actin filaments and can directly activate c-Src
      through binding to its SH3 and/or SH2 domains (PMID:15485829). Deep research confirms
      that AFAP1 contains a C-terminal ABD that mediates F-actin binding and multimerization
      enables actin cross-linking (AFAP1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is well-supported by the phylogenetic analysis (IBA) and is consistent
      with the extensive literature documenting AFAP1 localization to actin filaments via

  review:
    summary: >-
      AFAP1 regulates Src-family kinase signaling through direct binding to c-Src via
      proline-rich SH3-binding motifs and can activate Src. Mechanical stretch-induced
      c-Src protein tyrosine kinase activation is mediated through AFAP (PMID:15485829).
      The deep research confirms AFAP1 functions in the PKC-AFAP1-Src signaling axis
      (AFAP1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This biological process annotation is appropriate for AFAP1, which functions as an

  review:
    summary: >-
      AFAP1 can exist in the cytosolic fraction, particularly when not associated with the
      actin cytoskeleton. The deep research indicates that deletion of the actin-binding
      domain shifts AFAP1 from the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction to the soluble
      fraction (AFAP1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation is consistent with biochemical fractionation studies showing that
      AFAP1 partitions between cytoskeletal and soluble fractions. While the primary
      functional localization is at actin structures and focal adhesions, cytosolic
      localization is a valid secondary location.

      AFAP1 was identified in the focal adhesion proteome by mass spectrometry (Kuo et al.
      2011, PMID:21423176). AFAP1 localization to focal adhesions is consistent with its
      role in cell-matrix adhesion and regulation of focal contact dynamics. Downmodulation
      of AFAP-110 results in defective focal adhesions (PMID:17885682).
    action: ACCEPT

      The HDA (high-throughput direct assay) annotation is based on proteomic identification
      of AFAP1 in isolated focal adhesions. The finding is consistent with the known function
