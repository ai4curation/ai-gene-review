## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P46531
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1; Short=Notch 1; Short=hN1; AltName: Full=Translocation-associated notch protein TAN-1; Contains: RecName: Full=Notch 1 extracellular truncation; Short=NEXT; Contains: RecName: Full=Notch 1 intracellular domain; Short=NICD; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NOTCH1; Synonyms=TAN1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the NOTCH family. .
- **Key Domains:** Ankyrin_rpt. (IPR002110); Ankyrin_rpt-contain_sf. (IPR036770); EGF-like_Ca-bd_dom. (IPR001881); EGF-like_CS. (IPR013032); EGF-like_dom. (IPR000742)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NOTCH1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NOTCH1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NOTCH1** (gene ID: NOTCH1, UniProt: P46531) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human NOTCH1 (UniProt P46531)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Target verification. NOTCH1 encodes a single-pass transmembrane receptor of the NOTCH family with a large extracellular domain containing multiple EGF-like repeats, a Negative Regulatory Region (LNR + HD), a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain (NICD) that bears a RAM region, ankyrin (ANK) repeats, nuclear localization sequences, a transcriptional activation region, and a C-terminal PEST degron—consistent with UniProt P46531 and contemporary reviews (human, Homo sapiens) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01828-x, May 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15050529, Apr 2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, papageorgiou2024snpandstructural pages 2-3).
- Canonical Notch signaling. Ligand engagement (Jagged/Delta family) on a neighboring cell triggers proteolytic activation of NOTCH1: S2 cleavage by ADAM10/17 produces NEXT; S3/S4 intramembrane cleavage by the γ-secretase complex releases NICD, which enters the nucleus to form the CSL/RBPJ–MAML ternary complex that displaces corepressors and recruits co-activators to drive target genes (e.g., HES/HEY) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01828-x, 2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2). Mechanical pulling via ligand endocytosis facilitates exposure of the S2 site, and cis-inhibition/cis-activation dynamics modulate signal strength (2024 overview) (feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).
- Primary molecular role. NOTCH1 is a juxtacrine signal transducer that directly converts cell–cell contact into transcriptional responses without second messengers; its intracellular domain functions as a transcriptional co-activator with CSL/RBPJ and MAML rather than an enzyme (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01828-x, 2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Domain architecture and activation refinements. Contemporary cancer-focused reviews reaffirm the modular organization (EGF repeats, NRR, TMD, RAM/ANK/PEST) and the proteolytic steps S1 (Furin), S2 (ADAMs), S3/S4 (γ-secretase) with ligand dependence, and clarify that S2 is the sole ligand-dependent step (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, martinezgascuena2025modulationofoncogenic pages 3-5).
- Subcellular trafficking/localization. Updated schematics emphasize maturation in the ER/Golgi (S1), surface activation at the plasma membrane, complex endocytosis in the ligand-presenting cell that exerts force on NOTCH1, subsequent γ-secretase cleavage likely in the plasma membrane/early endosome, NICD nuclear translocation, and RBPJ corepressor exchange (2024) (feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).
- Post-translational regulation. 2024–2025 syntheses highlight O-fucose, O-glucose, and O-GlcNAc modifications on NOTCH1 EGF repeats; Fringe-mediated elongation modulates ligand selectivity (enhancing DLL4/NOTCH1 and often attenuating JAG interactions). Phosphorylation of the PEST region (and adjacent degron motifs) recruits FBXW7 to promote NICD turnover; PEST deletions or FBXW7 impairment stabilize NICD (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8). SERCA-dependent ER calcium is required for S1 maturation and trafficking; SERCA inhibition selectively impairs mutant NOTCH1 in T-ALL (2024) (sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8).
- Disease-mechanistic nuances. Cancer overviews in 2024 reinforce the context-dependent oncogene/tumor-suppressor roles: activating NOTCH1 is classical in T-ALL; loss-of-function alterations in squamous carcinomas often indicate a tumor-suppressive role; DLL4 vs JAG1 exert opposing angiogenic effects (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, martinezgascuena2025modulationofoncogenic pages 5-7).

3) Function, pathways, and subcellular localization
- Function and pathway position. NOTCH1 sits at the apex of a conserved cell-fate pathway. Upon activation by DSL ligands (DLL1/3/4; JAG1/2), NICD enters the nucleus and converts CSL/RBPJ from a repressor (with SHARP/FHL corepressors) to an activator by recruiting MAML and co-activators (p300/Mediator), initiating transcription of targets that regulate lineage decisions, proliferation, and survival (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).
- Subcellular localization (where NOTCH1 acts). In resting cells, NOTCH1 resides primarily at the plasma membrane as a calcium-stabilized heterodimer formed by S1 furin cleavage; activation involves membrane-proximal (S2) cleavage and intramembrane (S3/S4) proteolysis with NICD accumulation in the nucleus to execute function (2024) (feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).
- Key post-translational modifications. EGF-repeat O-glycans (O-fucose, O-glucose, O-GlcNAc) regulate ligand binding, receptor stability, and trafficking; Fringe-mediated extension of O-fucose specifically biases ligand responsiveness. NICD PEST-phosphorylation enables FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation; PEST truncations stabilize NICD and prolong signaling (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8, feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).

4) Disease relevance and quantitative data (selected 2023–2024 highlights)
- T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Activating NOTCH1 mutations remain highly prevalent; contemporary summaries report approximately 60% of T-ALL harbor NOTCH1 activating lesions (e.g., HD/NRR alterations and/or C-terminal PEST truncations that stabilize NICD), establishing NOTCH1 as a driver and therapeutic target (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252312839) (sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8). Mechanisms include ligand-independent S2 exposure (NRR mutations), increased S3 processing, and NICD stabilization (PEST) (2024) (sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8, martinezgascuena2025modulationofoncogenic pages 5-7).
- Other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Reviews synthesize roles for NOTCH1 in CLL and cutaneous, head and neck, lung squamous carcinomas (often as tumor suppressor when inactivated), and as an oncogenic driver in specific contexts (e.g., subsets of breast cancer and NSCLC), with pathway cross-talk influencing EMT, stemness, and angiogenesis (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, martinezgascuena2025modulationofoncogenic pages 5-7).
- Cardiovascular and developmental disorders. NOTCH1 mutations are implicated in congenital heart disease and calcific aortic valve disease; NOTCH signaling is essential for angiogenesis and cardiogenesis. CADASIL is chiefly a NOTCH3 disorder, helping distinguish gene-specific pathologies within the family (Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15050529) (papageorgiou2024snpandstructural pages 2-3).
- Endothelium and neurobiology. 2024 syntheses emphasize endothelial DLL4–NOTCH1 in tip/stalk cell selection and vascular patterning, and roles in neural stem cell maintenance/adult neurogenesis, consistent with canonical nuclear NICD–RBPJ activity (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations (therapeutics and tools)
- γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Broad GSIs historically showed dose-limiting GI toxicity; however, clinical developments continue. Nirogacestat achieved efficacy in desmoid tumors (NEJM 2023), while other GSIs (crenigacestat/LY3039478, AL101) have been evaluated in T-ALL/adenoid cystic carcinoma; PSEN1-selective strategies are being advanced to improve therapeutic index in T-ALL by more selectively attenuating NOTCH1 S3 cleavage (2024 review) (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117). For recent mechanistic/clinical context in oncology, see 2024 overview (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01828-x) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2).
- ADAM protease inhibition. Inhibition of S2 cleavage (e.g., INCB7839/TMI-005) has been combined with trastuzumab and explored preclinically/clinically as a way to blunt ligand-dependent NOTCH activation (2024 review) (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117).
- Ligand/receptor antibodies. Clinical and preclinical programs have targeted DLL4 (e.g., demcizumab, enoticumab) and NOTCH1 (e.g., brontictuzumab), with mixed efficacy and toxicity outcomes; contemporary reviews catalog these antibodies and their trial status up to 2023–2024 (2024 reviews) (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117, shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2).
- Transcriptional complex inhibitors. CB-103, a small molecule designed to disrupt the NICD–CSL–MAML transcriptional complex, entered first-in-human studies by 2023; 2024 reviews summarize its early clinical trajectory (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117).
- Upstream maturation targeting (SERCA). Given ER Ca2+-dependence of S1 maturation, SERCA inhibition can preferentially impair mutant NOTCH1 trafficking in T-ALL; medicinal chemistry aims for isoform-selective or targeted delivery approaches (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252312839) (sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8).

6) Expert perspectives and synthesis
- Mechanistic consensus. Across recent authoritative reviews, NOTCH1’s essential features are reaffirmed: direct cell–cell signal transduction, mechanical ligand activation, sequential proteolysis, and nuclear co-activator function with CSL/MAML. Modulation via EGF O-glycans and PEST/FBXW7 turnover provides precise, druggable regulatory nodes (2024) (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, feng2024thestructuraland pages 25-28, sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8).
- Translational outlook (2023–2024). Oncology translation is refocusing from broad GSIs to higher-selectivity (e.g., PSEN1-biased) γ-secretase inhibition, ligand/receptor-blocking antibodies, and NICD–CSL–MAML disruptors; combination regimens and biomarker stratification (e.g., NOTCH1 mutation status, FBXW7) are expected to improve outcomes while mitigating on-target intestinal toxicity (2024) (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117, shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8).

7) Relevant statistics and data points (recent)
- T-ALL mutation frequency. Approximately 60% of T-ALL cases harbor activating NOTCH1 mutations, often combining NRR and PEST alterations to enhance NICD generation and stability (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252312839) (sergio2024notchinhibitorsand pages 7-8).
- Clinical activity snapshots. Nirogacestat demonstrated efficacy in desmoid tumors (NEJM 2023), while crenigacestat and AL101 have been explored in hematologic/solid cancers; CB-103 progressed through phase I by 2023 (compiled in 2024 therapeutic reviews summarizing trial registries and publications) (vandersmissen2024psen1selectivegammasecretaseinhibition pages 114-117, shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2).

Notes on gene/protein identification
- Ambiguity check passed: The above research pertains to human NOTCH1 (Homo sapiens), a NOTCH family receptor with EGF-like repeats, NRR, TMD, and NICD bearing RAM/ANK domains and PEST, exactly matching UniProt P46531. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in the cited 2024 sources (shi2024notchsignalingpathway pages 1-2, martinezgascuena2025modulationofoncogenic pages 3-5, papageorgiou2024snpandstructural pages 2-3).
