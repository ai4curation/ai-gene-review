description: NOTCH1 is a type I transmembrane receptor that functions as a master regulator of cell-fate determination through juxtacrine signaling. Upon binding membrane-bound ligands (JAG1/2, DLL1/3/4) on neighboring cells, NOTCH1 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages by furin (S1 in Golgi), ADAM10/17 (S2 at plasma membrane), and gamma-secretase (S3/S4), releasing the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus where it forms a transcriptional activation complex with RBPJ and MAML coactivators to drive expression of target genes including HES and HEY family members. NOTCH1 plays essential roles in T-cell development, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, heart development, and somitogenesis. Mutations cause T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (activating) and aortic valve disease/Adams-Oliver syndrome (loss-of-function).

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: NOTCH1 is the canonical receptor for the Notch signaling pathway. Upon ligand binding (JAG1/2, DLL1/3/4), NOTCH1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage releasing NICD which translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes via RBPJ/MAML complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core function of NOTCH1. The protein is THE defining receptor of the Notch signaling pathway, as documented extensively in UniProt and literature (Shi et al. 2024, doi:10.1038/s41392-024-01828-x).

  review:
    summary: NOTCH1 is a type I transmembrane receptor that resides at the plasma membrane where it receives ligand signals from adjacent cells.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Plasma membrane localization is essential for NOTCH1 receptor function. The mature NOTCH1 heterodimer traffics to and resides at the plasma membrane where it undergoes ligand-dependent activation. UniProt confirms cell membrane localization.

    label: axon guidance
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: The IBA annotation derives from PTHR45836 family which includes both NOTCH receptors and SLIT proteins. Axon guidance is a primary function of SLIT proteins, not NOTCH1.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation likely results from family-level inference that inappropriately transfers SLIT protein functions to NOTCH1. While NOTCH signaling has roles in neurogenesis, axon guidance is not a characterized function of NOTCH1. SLIT1-3 proteins (also in PTHR45836) are the canonical axon guidance molecules.

  review:
    summary: NOTCH1 exists as a heterodimeric receptor complex formed by furin cleavage during maturation. The N(EC) and N(TM) fragments remain associated at the cell surface.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: NOTCH1 forms a heterodimeric complex after S1 furin cleavage in the Golgi. The extracellular and transmembrane fragments are non-covalently associated. This is well-documented in UniProt and structural studies.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
