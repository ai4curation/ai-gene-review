## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene EIF2B4 (Q9UI10) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# EIF2B4 and the eIF2B Complex: Function, Regulation, and Localization

**Gene and Complex Overview:**  
EIF2B4 encodes the δ subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a multi-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor essential for protein synthesis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8890#:~:text=Summary%20Eukaryotic%20initiation%20factor%202B,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Jul%202008)). The eIF2B complex is composed of five different subunits (α, β, γ, δ, ε), present as two copies each in a twofold-symmetric decamer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7990499/#:~:text=guanine%20nucleotide%20exchange%20factor%20,Stress%20sensing%20is)). This heterodecameric assembly consists of two βδεγ tetramers bridged by an α₂ homodimer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=each%20of%20the%20regulatory%20subunits,32%E2%80%9334)), yielding a ~600 kDa complex. The δ subunit (EIF2B4) together with the α and β subunits forms a **regulatory subcomplex** that senses cellular stress signals, while the γ and ε subunits constitute the **catalytic core** responsible for nucleotide exchange ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=by%20genetic%20and%20biochemical%20methods%2C,subcomplex%20containing%20the%20remaining%20three)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=eIF2B%20and%20eIF2,as%20a%20GEF%20for%20eIF2)). Notably, evolutionary analyses suggest the γ₂ε₂ catalytic core arose first, with the regulatory subunits like δ added later to fine-tune eIF2B’s control of translation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=exists%20as%20a%20decamer%20formed,resulting%20in%20the%20structural%20intricacy)). By assembling these subunits, eIF2B serves as the **sole guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)** for eIF2, playing a pivotal role in recycling eIF2 for continued protein synthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=eIF2,subsequent%20rounds%20of%20translation%20initiation)). Proper regulation of this complex is vital for cells to adjust protein production to changing conditions and stresses ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/EIF2B4#:~:text=with%20eIF2%2C%20an%20initiation%20factor,to%20adapt%20to%20changing%20conditions)).

**Primary Function – GEF Activity in Translation Initiation:**  
The primary function of eIF2B (and thus EIF2B4 as part of it) is to reactivate the translation initiator factor eIF2 by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2’s γ subunit ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/EIF2B4#:~:text=EIF2B4%20is%20part%20of%20the,leading%20to%20decreased%20protein%20synthesis)). During translation initiation, eIF2·GTP binds initiator methionine-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosome; GTP is hydrolyzed upon start-codon recognition, and eIF2-GDP is released ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=initiation%20factors%20%28eIFs%29,the%20ribosome%20in%20complex%20with)). eIF2B then displaces the GDP-bound inhibitor (eIF5) from eIF2-GDP and **catalyzes GDP release so a new GTP can bind**, “recharging” eIF2 for another round of initiation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=carried%20out%20by%20the%20guanine,a%20complex%20interplay%20between%20eIF2B)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=eIF2,subsequent%20rounds%20of%20translation%20initiation)). Structural studies show that eIF2Bε (catalytic subunit) and eIF2Bγ engage eIF2γ in a way that **pries open the nucleotide-binding site** of eIF2, stabilizing an empty (apo) state to promote nucleotide exchange ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7990499/#:~:text=IF2%20engage%20eIF2%CE%B3%20,its%20%CE%B1%20subunit%20across%20eIF2B%E2%80%99s)). In this manner, eIF2B acts as a classic GEF: it converts inactive eIF2-GDP into active eIF2-GTP, which is necessary for maintaining overall protein synthesis. Quantitatively, the fully assembled eIF2B decamer has **>20-fold higher nucleotide exchange activity** than partial subcomplexes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7990499/#:~:text=into%20decamers,exchange%2C%20presumably%20due%20to%20enhanced)), emphasizing that all subunits (including δ) are required for maximal function. The tight coupling of eIF2B’s activity to the translation cycle is critical – if eIF2B function is impaired, eIF2 remains GDP-bound and global translation initiation is impeded. Consistent with this, **mutations in EIF2B4 that reduce eIF2B’s GEF activity cause severe translational defects**, as seen in the genetic disorder vanishing white matter disease ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/eif2b4/#:~:text=Mutations%20in%20the%20EIF2B4%20gene,by%20an%20abnormal%20response%20to)).

**Regulation via the Integrated Stress Response (ISR):**  
eIF2B4’s role is especially important in the **integrated stress response**, a conserved signaling pathway that downregulates protein synthesis under stress. In response to various stresses (e.g. nutrient starvation, viral infection, ER stress), specialized kinases such as PKR, GCN2, PERK, and HRI phosphorylate eIF2 on its α subunit at Ser51 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=tRNA_,response%20genes%20and%20is%20called)). Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into a **competitive inhibitor** of eIF2B ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=as%20viral%20infection%20or%20starvation%2C,a%20common%20node%20for%20multiple)). Mechanistically, unphosphorylated eIF2 binds productively to eIF2B at multiple interfaces (contacting eIF2Bβ and eIF2Bδ among others) to permit GDP–GTP exchange ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=eIF2%20makes%20contact%20with%20the,the%20eIF2B%CE%B1%20and%20eIF2B%CE%B4%20subunits)). However, **phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2α-P) binds eIF2B in an alternative mode**: the N-terminal region of eIF2α-P docks at the interface between the eIF2Bα and δ subunits ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=eIF2%20makes%20contact%20with%20the,the%20eIF2B%CE%B1%20and%20eIF2B%CE%B4%20subunits)). This interaction locks eIF2B in a “nonproductive” conformation that **prevents it from catalyzing nucleotide exchange on other eIF2 molecules** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10616414/#:~:text=branch%20of%20the%20ISR%20is,called%20PKR%20antagonists)). In essence, eIF2B becomes sequestered in an inactive eIF2α-P•eIF2B complex, and cannot recycle GTP for the pool of eIF2. Functionally, this leads to a rapid reduction in global translation initiation, helping cells conserve resources and reprogram gene expression under stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=as%20viral%20infection%20or%20starvation%2C,a%20common%20node%20for%20multiple)). As an NIH summary explains, under normal conditions eIF2B increases protein synthesis by GTP recycling, **whereas under stress, eIF2B binds tightly to phospho-eIF2 and is rendered inactive, stalling further GTP recycling** ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/eif2b4/#:~:text=Under%20some%20conditions%2C%20eIF2B%20increases,and%20prevents%20recycling%20of%20GTP)). This switch is the core of the ISR: general protein synthesis is suppressed while specific stress-responsive mRNAs are selectively translated (e.g. ATF4) to adapt to the stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=as%20viral%20infection%20or%20starvation%2C,a%20common%20node%20for%20multiple)). The δ subunit (EIF2B4) is central to this regulation, since along with α and β it forms the binding interface for eIF2α-P ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=by%20genetic%20and%20biochemical%20methods%2C,subcomplex%20containing%20the%20remaining%20three)). **Experimental evidence** from yeast and human cells shows that mutations in the regulatory subunits (including δ) can abolish eIF2α-P binding and render eIF2B insensitive to stress signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=by%20genetic%20and%20biochemical%20methods%2C,subcomplex%20containing%20the%20remaining%20three)). Indeed, a recent 2023 structural study confirmed that eIF2α-P engages a specific cavity spanning eIF2Bα and δ, and if this interaction is blocked, eIF2B stays active despite eIF2 phosphorylation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10616414/#:~:text=branch%20of%20the%20ISR%20is,called%20PKR%20antagonists)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10616414/#:~:text=with%20eIF2B%20in%20its%20%E2%80%9Cproductive%E2%80%9D,a%20switch%20to%20the%20nonproductive)). Intriguingly, several viruses have evolved proteins to exploit this: viral “ISR antagonists” can occupy the eIF2α-P binding site on eIF2Bδ/α, **preventing the inhibitory switch** and allowing viral mRNA translation to continue even when the host cell triggers PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10616414/#:~:text=with%20eIF2B%20in%20its%20%E2%80%9Cproductive%E2%80%9D,a%20switch%20to%20the%20nonproductive)). This underscores how pivotal EIF2B4’s function is – both cellular stress responses and pathogens target the eIF2Bδ interface to control protein synthesis.

**Subcellular Localization and eIF2B Bodies:**  
The EIF2B4 gene product (eIF2Bδ) carries out its function in the **cytosol**, where translation initiation occurs. Early cell biology studies indicated eIF2B is largely a cytosolic complex, not concentrated in organelles or the nucleus. More recently, live-cell imaging has shown that eIF2B subunits assemble into distinct **cytoplasmic foci known as “eIF2B bodies.”** In human cells, fluorescent-tagged eIF2B subunits revealed that eIF2B is not diffused uniformly but clusters in a few cytoplasmic puncta ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=factor%202B%20,P.%20In)). **Larger eIF2B bodies** contain all five subunits of the decameric complex, whereas **smaller bodies** often contain predominantly the γ and ε (catalytic) subunits ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=factor%202B%20,P.%20In)). These bodies appear to be functional sites of action: the translation factor eIF2 itself localizes to eIF2B bodies and shuttles in and out of them in correlation with active nucleotide exchange ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=smaller%20bodies%20contain%20predominantly%20catalytic,into%20their%20potential%20mechanism%20of)). Under stress conditions, phosphorylated eIF2α concentrates in the larger eIF2B bodies, which coincides with a **decrease in eIF2 mobility** – essentially trapping eIF2 in inactive complexes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=smaller%20bodies%20contain%20predominantly%20catalytic,into%20their%20potential%20mechanism%20of)). Interestingly, during acute stress the composition of smaller bodies can change, with eIF2Bδ (and other regulatory subunits) redistributing to them, suggesting the **assembly state of eIF2B shifts in response to stress** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=activity.%20On%20stress%2C%20eIF2%CE%B1,the%20composition%20and%20function%20of)). This dynamic localization is thought to modulate eIF2B activity: active eIF2B may operate in smaller complexes or diffuse form when translation is robust, whereas upon stress, eIF2B gathers into larger assemblies that hold phospho-eIF2α, thereby spatially segregating the inhibited complexes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726166/#:~:text=smaller%20bodies%20contain%20predominantly%20catalytic,into%20their%20potential%20mechanism%20of)). Similar **eIF2B bodies have been observed in yeast**, where a single large focus (sometimes a filamentous assembly) contains all eIF2B subunits ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=eIF2B%20subunits%20in%20Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae,mRNA%20and%20other%20translation%20initiation)). The conservation of this phenomenon suggests that clustering of eIF2B is functionally relevant, possibly to efficiently coordinate the exchange cycle or to integrate stress signals. In summary, EIF2B4’s protein product is **cytoplasmic** and often localized in specialized subcellular structures (eIF2B bodies) where it carries out and regulates its GEF function.

**Biological Pathways and Interactions:**  
EIF2B4/eIF2Bδ functions within the core **translation initiation pathway**. By recycling eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, eIF2B enables continuous rounds of translation initiation – a process diagrammed in standard models of the translation cycle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=translation%20initiation%20is%20the%20recycling,a%20complex%20interplay%20between%20eIF2B)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=eIF2,subsequent%20rounds%20of%20translation%20initiation)). This places eIF2B at a critical node in proteostasis regulation. The integrated stress response (ISR) is the chief signaling pathway that modulates eIF2B’s activity via eIF2α phosphorylation, as discussed. Beyond the ISR, **growth factor and metabolic signaling** also impinge on eIF2B. For example, insulin – through the PI3K/Akt pathway – **activates eIF2B** by inhibiting GSK-3 kinase. GSK-3 can phosphorylate the eIF2Bε subunit at Ser535, which diminishes eIF2B’s activity; insulin signaling blocks GSK-3, leading to Ser535 dephosphorylation and enhanced eIF2B function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=Post,of%20eIF2B%CE%B5%20facilitate%20eIF2%20binding)). Thus, in insulin-responsive tissues, eIF2B serves as a point of crosstalk between nutrient/growth signals and the protein synthesis machinery. This regulation ensures that in fed conditions (high insulin) eIF2B is maximally active to promote protein synthesis, whereas in energy stress or diabetes (high GSK-3 activity) eIF2B may be less active, contributing to reduced protein synthesis capacity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=Glycogen%20synthase%20kinase,of%20eIF2B%CE%B5%20facilitate%20eIF2%20binding)). EIF2B4, as part of the regulatory holoenzyme, is required for these modulation effects – studies in cell and animal models have shown that altering eIF2B4 levels or mutating its critical residues can affect how eIF2B responds to both stress and insulin signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=Glycogen%20synthase%20kinase,of%20eIF2B%CE%B5%20facilitate%20eIF2%20binding)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4046112/#:~:text=binding%20to%20eIF2%CE%B19%20,that)).

**Physiological and Real-World Significance:**  
The precise function of EIF2B4 in the eIF2B complex is underscored by its importance in human health and disease. **Loss-of-function mutations** in EIF2B4 (and other eIF2B subunit genes) cause **Leukoencephalopathy with Vanishing White Matter (VWM)**, a fatal neurodegenerative disease ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8890#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20initiation%20factor%202B%20,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Jul%202008)). VWM patients’ cells have partially impaired eIF2B activity, making them unable to properly resume protein synthesis after stress, particularly in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes that support white matter ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/eif2b4/#:~:text=Mutations%20in%20the%20EIF2B4%20gene,by%20an%20abnormal%20response%20to)). This leads to chronic white-matter degeneration provoked by minor stresses (fever, head trauma, etc.), highlighting how crucial eIF2B’s stress-regulatory function is in vivo ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/eif2b4/#:~:text=partial%20loss%20of%20eIF2B%20function,leukoencephalopathy%20with%20vanishing%20white%20matter)). The δ subunit is one of the genetic loci for VWM (VWM type 4), and dozens of **EIF2B4 missense mutations** have been documented in patients ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8890#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20initiation%20factor%202B%20,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Jul%202008)). These mutations often map to surfaces involved in eIF2 or other subunit interactions, consistent with destabilizing the complex or disrupting eIF2α-P binding. Aside from rare genetic disorders, eIF2B (and thus EIF2B4) has attracted interest in common conditions as well. **Neurological functions** like memory formation rely on regulated protein synthesis, and studies in mice show that dysregulation of the eIF2/eIF2B axis can impair synaptic plasticity and memory ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=review%20by%20Costa,also%20review%20studies%20of%20cellular)). Conversely, **reducing excessive eIF2α phosphorylation** (to boost eIF2B activity) can enhance memory in neurodegenerative or depressive models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11442801/#:~:text=Defective%20regulation%20of%20the%20eIF2,like%20behavior%20in%20mice)). For instance, the small molecule *ISRIB* (Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor) **binds eIF2B and allosterically promotes its active conformation**, even in the presence of eIF2α-P ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7990499/#:~:text=2018%29,acts%20as%20a%20%E2%80%98molecular%20staple%E2%80%99)). ISRIB essentially antagonizes the inhibitory effect of phospho-eIF2 and **reactivates translation**, a discovery that has led to exploration of eIF2B activators in traumatic brain injury, cognitive decline, and other conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=,with%20the%20rare%2C%20frequently%20fatal)). A derivative compound called *2BAct* has also shown therapeutic benefits in mouse models of vanishing white matter disease by **enhancing eIF2B GEF activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208314/#:~:text=have%20investigated%20the%20therapeutic%20potential,In%20vitro%20studies%20have)). These developments demonstrate real-world applications of our understanding of EIF2B4/eIF2B function: from **diagnostic assays** that measure eIF2B’s GEF activity in patient cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2789406/#:~:text=Eukaryotic%20Initiation%20Factor%202B%20,to%20help%20in%20the%20molecular)), to **targeted drugs** aiming to modulate eIF2B for treating disease. 

**Conclusion:**  
In summary, EIF2B4 encodes the δ subunit of eIF2B, an essential enzyme complex governing the **rate of translation initiation**. EIF2B4’s product is a part of the regulatory scaffold that controls when eIF2B is active or inhibited, by sensing signals like eIF2’s phosphorylation state. Through its participation in eIF2B’s GTP-exchange reaction, EIF2B4 helps maintain the balance between active protein synthesis and translational shutdown during stress. This gene’s function is carried out in the cytosol, often localized to **eIF2B-body** structures where it interacts with eIF2. The current understanding – fortified by high-resolution structures (2018–2023) and mechanistic studies – is that eIF2Bδ (EIF2B4) is indispensable for coupling signaling pathways to the translational apparatus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10616414/#:~:text=branch%20of%20the%20ISR%20is,called%20PKR%20antagonists)) ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/eif2b4/#:~:text=Under%20some%20conditions%2C%20eIF2B%20increases,and%20prevents%20recycling%20of%20GTP)). Its precise role in the eIF2B complex exemplifies how cells globally regulate protein synthesis, and disruptions of EIF2B4 vividly illustrate the consequences of losing that regulation. Ongoing research continues to uncover how this translation-initiation factor can be targeted or tuned in various physiological and disease contexts, reaffirming EIF2B4’s importance in cellular homeostasis and stress adaptation.
