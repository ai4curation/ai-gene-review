description: >-
  EIF2B4 encodes the delta subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B),
  a heterodecameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) essential for translation initiation.
  The delta subunit, together with alpha and beta subunits, forms the regulatory subcomplex that
  senses cellular stress signals, particularly through binding phosphorylated eIF2alpha. The
  eIF2B complex catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange on eIF2, regenerating active eIF2-GTP complexes
  required for continued protein synthesis. EIF2B4 is critical for the integrated stress response
  (ISR), where phosphorylated eIF2alpha binds at the interface between eIF2Balpha and eIF2Bdelta
  subunits, inhibiting GEF activity and reducing global translation. Mutations in EIF2B4 cause
  vanishing white matter disease (leukoencephalopathy with VWM), demonstrating the essential
  role of this subunit in normal eIF2B function, particularly in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes.

      EIF2B4 is essential for protein synthesis, which is required for all developmental
