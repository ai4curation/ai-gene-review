description: >-
  TMEM70 is a scaffold protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane that plays a critical role
  in the biogenesis of mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V). It facilitates the membrane
  insertion and oligomer formation of the subunit c (ATP5MC1) into the c8-ring, which is the
  membrane sector of the enzyme's rotor. TMEM70 forms oligomeric scaffolds within mitochondrial
  cristae that promote in situ assembly of the ATP synthase proton channel. TMEM70 deficiency
  causes severe ATP synthase deficiency and neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy.
  TMEM70 also has a secondary role in the stability of Complex I membrane-bound subassemblies
  through interaction with the MCIA complex.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TMEM70 is confirmed to localize to the mitochondrial inner membrane based on multiple
      experimental studies. While this IBA annotation is correct, it is less specific than
      what is experimentally demonstrated - TMEM70 localizes specifically to the inner
      mitochondrial membrane and cristae.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is phylogenetically inferred and is broadly correct. Multiple experimental
      studies confirm mitochondrial membrane localization. UniProt states TMEM70 is located in
      "Mitochondrion inner membrane; Multi-pass membrane protein" (PMID:20937241, PMID:24576557,
      PMID:33359711). While a more specific term (GO:0005743 mitochondrial inner membrane) would
      be preferable, this annotation is valid as a broader term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IBA annotation correctly captures the core biological function of TMEM70. The protein
      is a scaffold factor essential for ATP synthase (Complex V) assembly, specifically required
      for the formation of the c8-ring component of the enzyme's rotor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core function of TMEM70. Multiple experimental studies demonstrate that TMEM70
      functions in ATP synthase biogenesis by promoting subunit c incorporation into the c8-ring.
      Loss of TMEM70 results in severe ATP synthase deficiency with accumulation of the F1 sector
      and loss of the Fo proton channel (PMID:18953340, PMID:31652072, PMID:32275929, PMID:33359711,

      deficiency. The localization to mitochondrial membrane was part of the initial characterization.
      While less specific than GO:0005743, this annotation is valid and historically important.

    summary: >-
      This is the original IMP annotation from the seminal paper identifying TMEM70 as
      an ATP synthase assembly factor through patient mutation studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      PMID:18953340 identified TMEM70 mutations as causing isolated ATP synthase deficiency
      through whole-genome homozygosity mapping and complementation studies. This paper
      established TMEM70 involvement in ATP synthase biogenesis in higher eukaryotes.

          Complementation of the cell lines of these individuals with wild-type TMEM70
          restored biogenesis and metabolic function of the enzyme complex.

    label: protein-macromolecule adaptor activity
  description: >-
    TMEM70 acts as a scaffold/adaptor protein that brings together subunit c molecules
    during c8-ring assembly. It forms oligomeric complexes that interact with subunit c
    and promote its membrane insertion and oligomerization. UniProt describes TMEM70
    as a "Scaffold protein that participates in the c-ring assembly of mitochondrial
    ATP synthase" (PMID:32275929, PMID:31652072, PMID:33359711).

    id: GO:0140260
    label: mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex binding
  description: >-
    TMEM70 directly binds to ATP synthase subunit c (ATP5MC1/ATP5MC3) during the
    assembly process. This interaction is essential for facilitating c-ring formation
    and membrane insertion. Multiple studies have demonstrated direct interaction
    between TMEM70 and subunit c using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
    (PMID:31652072, PMID:33359711, PMID:33753518).
