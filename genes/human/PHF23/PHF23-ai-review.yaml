description: PHD finger protein 23 is a nuclear/cytoplasmic protein containing a PHD-type zinc finger domain that functions as a negative regulator of autophagy. PHF23 promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of LRSAM1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is key for autophagy induction in response to starvation or bacterial infection. The PHD finger domain is essential for the interaction with LRSAM1. PHF23 is also implicated in the NUP98-PHF23 fusion oncoprotein found in acute myeloid leukemia, where the PHD domain recognizes H3K4me3 marks at HOX/MEIS loci.
