description: >-
  DNAJB2 (also known as HSJ1) is a neuronally enriched class II J-domain protein (HSP40 co-chaperone)
  that functions as a co-chaperone for HSP70 family members, stimulating their ATPase activity and
  regulating substrate binding. It contains an N-terminal J domain required for HSP70 interaction
  and two C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that link chaperone recognition of misfolded
  proteins to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. DNAJB2 exists as two alternatively spliced
  isoforms: the ER-membrane-anchored HSJ1b (isoform 1) and the cytoplasmic HSJ1a (isoform 2). It
  plays a critical role in protein quality control in neurons, and mutations in DNAJB2 cause autosomal
  recessive distal hereditary motor neuropathy (HMNR5).

      DNAJB2 (HSJ1) stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP70/Hsc70 via its conserved J domain.
      Cheetham et al. (1994) showed that both HSJ1a and HSJ1b enhance the weak intrinsic ATPase
      activity of constitutive Hsc70 more than fivefold (PMID:7957263). Gao et al. (2012) confirmed
      that the J domain of HSJ1a mediates interaction with and ATPase activation of HSP70 (PMID:22219199).
      The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound for J-domain proteins, and the term accurately
      captures a core molecular function of DNAJB2.

      However, DNAJB2 is constitutively expressed and functions as a co-chaperone rather than being
