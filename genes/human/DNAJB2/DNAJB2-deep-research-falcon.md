### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DNAJB2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DNAJB2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DNAJB2** (gene ID: DNAJB2, UniProt: P25686) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human DNAJB2 (HSJ1) (UniProt P25686)

Publication date: 2026-02-20

1. Target verification (gene/protein identity)

The target protein UniProt P25686 corresponds to the human gene DNAJB2 (synonyms HSJ1, HSPF3), encoding a neuronal-enriched Hsp40/J-domain co-chaperone known as HSJ1. Retrieved literature consistently describes DNAJB2/HSJ1 as a class II J-protein (DNAJB family) with (i) an N-terminal J-domain that regulates Hsp70/Hsc70 ATPase cycling and (ii) a distinctive C-terminal region harboring two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that bind polyubiquitylated clients. Two major splice isoforms are emphasized: DNAJB2a/HSJ1a (277 aa) and DNAJB2b/HSJ1b (324 aa). (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

2. Key concepts and current mechanistic understanding

2.1. What DNAJB2 is (definitions)

J-domain proteins (JDPs; also called Hsp40s or DNAJ proteins) are co-chaperones defined by a J-domain containing a conserved HPD motif that stimulates Hsp70-family ATPase activity, thereby regulating client binding/release and routing of non-native proteins through the proteostasis network. DNAJB2 is a JDP whose function is tightly coupled to both folding and protein disposal pathways, including the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 1-3)

2.2. Domain architecture, isoforms, and subcellular localization

Canonical features highlighted across reviews and primary papers include:

• N-terminal J-domain: mediates interaction with Hsp70/Hsc70 and stimulates ATP hydrolysis, central to DNAJB2 cochaperone function. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

• G/F region: characteristic of DNAJB family JDPs and implicated in cochaperone regulation/client interactions. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

• Two C-terminal UIMs: enable binding to polyubiquitin chains and thereby connect DNAJB2-client complexes to the UPS. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

Isoforms and localization:

• DNAJB2a (HSJ1a): reported as ~277 aa (~31 kDa) and localized to cytosol and nucleus. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

• DNAJB2b (HSJ1b): reported as ~324 aa (~36 kDa) and anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a C-terminal geranylgeranyl motif. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

Expression context:

DNAJB2 is repeatedly described as predominantly neuronal (with high expression noted in the neocortex), consistent with a key role in neuronal proteostasis; lower expression is described in fibroblasts and skeletal muscle, although both isoforms are detectable in skeletal muscle and may be present at roughly similar levels in that tissue. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2)

2.3. Primary molecular function: proteostasis triage (fold/hold/degrade)

The central functional theme for DNAJB2 is “triage” of misfolded/unfolded proteins in concert with Hsp70 systems, with a notable emphasis on delivery to degradation (rather than refolding) through ubiquitin recognition.

Mechanistic roles supported in the retrieved sources include:

• Hsp70 co-chaperone activity: DNAJB2 “traffics unfolded proteins” to Hsp70 and stimulates Hsp70 ATPase activity via its J-domain, a canonical JDP activity. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

• Ubiquitin-dependent proteasome targeting: DNAJB2 binds polyubiquitylated proteins via its UIMs and facilitates delivery to the proteasome, linking chaperone recognition of non-native proteins to clearance by the UPS. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

• Cooperation with ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1: DNAJB2 is described as cooperating with STUB1/CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation and protecting polyubiquitin chains from deubiquitylation, supporting a “shuttle” and/or stabilization role for ubiquitinated clients destined for proteasomal degradation. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2)

Regulatory mechanism (post-translational modification):

A key control concept is that phosphorylation within UIM2 can tune ubiquitin binding and client processing. Specifically, a regulatory axis involving CK2 phosphorylation of HSJ1 is described as reducing HSJ1’s ability to bind ubiquitylated clients and exert chaperone activity, implying that kinase signaling can modulate DNAJB2’s ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis functions. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

2.4. Roles in aggregation biology and neurodegeneration-relevant clients

DNAJB2 is repeatedly discussed as an anti-aggregation cochaperone that can suppress aggregation of diverse neurodegeneration-associated proteins (e.g., polyQ-expanded huntingtin/androgen receptor, parkin variants, SOD1 variants, and TDP-43) in vitro and in vivo, including evidence for phenotypic improvement in a SOD1 G93A ALS mouse model when DNAJB2 is increased. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

3. Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)

3.1. 2023: First dominantly acting DNAJB2 mutation with a defined molecular mechanism

A major 2023 development was the report of the first dominantly acting DNAJB2 mutation causing a late-onset neuromyopathy phenotype. The variant (c.832T>G; p.(*278Glyext*83)) abolishes the stop codon of the DNAJB2a isoform, generating an 83-amino-acid C-terminal extension. The extension creates a transmembrane helix that drives mislocalization of mutant DNAJB2a to ER/membrane compartments, leading to rapid proteasomal degradation and increased turnover of co-expressed wild-type DNAJB2a, consistent with a dominant-negative (and/or combined loss-of-function plus toxic gain-of-function) mechanism. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 5-7)

Visual evidence: In Sarparanta et al., fractionation and imaging show the extension mutant’s enrichment in microsomal/ER-associated fractions relative to wild-type, and cycloheximide chase experiments indicate rapid loss of mutant protein that is rescued by proteasome inhibition (MG132), supporting proteasome-dependent turnover. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe media 5c24ea0c, sarparanta2023extensionofthe media ca42d1ba, sarparanta2023extensionofthe media 3e09dd10, sarparanta2023extensionofthe media dfd6be39)

3.2. 2024: DNAJB2 recognized among “new” distal myopathy/neuromyopathy genes, including dominant inheritance

A 2024 review of distal myopathy genetics highlights DNAJB2 as a gene newly implicated in late-onset distal myopathy and neuromyopathy, placing it among recently expanded genetic causes of distal muscle disease. (rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 1-2)

The same 2024 review emphasizes that DNAJB2 variants historically linked to recessive progressive peripheral axonal neuropathies are now also associated with (i) recessive neuromyopathy featuring rimmed-vacuolar myopathy plus dHMN and (ii) the first dominantly inherited DNAJB2-related disease described in 2023, characterized as late-onset sensorimotor polyneuropathy with distal myopathy. (rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 2-3, rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 6-7)

4. Pathways and cellular processes in which DNAJB2 operates

4.1. Hsp70-centered proteostasis network

DNAJB2 functions within the Hsp70 chaperone system as a JDP cochaperone, driving ATPase activation and client processing. This places DNAJB2 upstream of multiple downstream fates for clients: refolding, triage to the proteasome, and (directly or indirectly) routing to autophagic processes, as discussed broadly for JDPs and neuromuscular chaperonopathies. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 1-3)

4.2. Ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD)

DNAJB2 is repeatedly framed as a “neuronal shuttling factor” or adaptor that couples ubiquitin recognition (via UIMs) with client delivery to the proteasome, including cooperation with CHIP/STUB1 and facilitation of degradation of Hsp70 clients. A 2023 mechanistic discussion further notes involvement in ERAD for ER clients, consistent with the existence of an ER-anchored isoform (DNAJB2b) and the importance of ER/cytosol interfaces in proteostasis. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2)

5. Disease relevance (neuromuscular and neurodegenerative phenotypes)

5.1. Genetic disease spectrum

Across reviews and primary reports, DNAJB2 pathogenic variants are linked to inherited neuromuscular disorders spanning distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), spinal muscular atrophy with parkinsonism, and mixed neuropathy–myopathy (“neuromyopathy”) phenotypes; some cases include central features such as pyramidal signs, hearing loss, and parkinsonism. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2, rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 2-3, rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 6-7)

Inheritance patterns:

• Historically: most reported DNAJB2 mutations were recessive and often loss-of-function (frequently reducing/abolishing protein expression). (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 2-3)

• New: a dominant DNAJB2 mutation has now been demonstrated (stop-loss extension of DNAJB2a) with cellular evidence for mislocalization, proteasome-dependent degradation, and dominant-negative effects on wild-type protein. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 5-7)

5.2. Recent clinical and experimental quantitative data

Dominant neuromyopathy family (2023 HMG):

• Clinical biochemistry: creatine kinase (CK) elevations were reported, ranging from ~2.5× upper limit of normal (ULN) in the proband to >7× ULN in an affected individual, while another affected sibling had normal CK—illustrating intrafamilial variability. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 2-3)

• Molecular readout in patient muscle: approximately ~50% reduction of both DNAJB2 isoforms was reported in patient muscle tissue, consistent with reduced steady-state protein levels. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 5-7)

Cell biology of the stop-loss extension mutant (2023 HMG):

• Turnover assays used cycloheximide chase (40 µg/ml) and showed rapid degradation of the extension mutant; MG132 (10 µM) rescued protein levels, indicating proteasome dependence, whereas lysosomal inhibitors had little effect. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 9-10, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 5-7)

• Imaging/fractionation: mutant DNAJB2a extension is enriched in membrane/microsomal fractions and shows ER colocalization. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe media 5c24ea0c, sarparanta2023extensionofthe media ca42d1ba)

Patient fibroblast stress-response study (2025; relevant to translational direction):

• Heat shock challenge: 1 hour at 42 °C showed impaired DNAJB2 induction in patient fibroblasts carrying a heterozygous splice-region variant. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2)

• Small-molecule modulation: 48-hour pretreatment with cystamine (150 µM) increased DNAJB2 levels in both control and patient fibroblasts, supporting a possible pharmacologic “boosting DNAJB2” strategy. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2)

6. Current applications and real-world implementations

6.1. Clinical genetics and diagnostics

The most immediate real-world implementation of DNAJB2 knowledge is in genetic diagnosis and variant interpretation for neuromuscular disease. Current clinical and research practice increasingly recognizes DNAJB2 in the differential for distal hereditary motor neuropathies/CMT2 and for distal myopathy/neuromyopathy, including late-onset presentations and both recessive and dominant inheritance patterns. Reviews in 2024 explicitly position DNAJB2 among newly identified genes for late-onset distal myopathy/neuromyopathy, implying its inclusion in next-generation sequencing panels for distal myopathies and related neuromuscular syndromes. (rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 2-3, rantaaho2024currentadvanceon pages 1-2)

6.2. Therapeutic concepts (preclinical)

Two therapeutic logic lines emerge from the literature retrieved here:

• Enhancing DNAJB2 abundance/function to improve proteostasis capacity: DNAJB2 overexpression is described as suppressing aggregation of multiple neurodegenerative proteins and improving phenotype in SOD1 G93A ALS mice, motivating the concept that increasing DNAJB2 activity might be beneficial in protein-aggregation disorders. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2)

• Pharmacologic modulation: cystamine increased DNAJB2 levels in patient-derived fibroblasts, supporting feasibility of chemical upregulation of DNAJB2 in human cells. (pradhan2025impaireddnajb2response pages 1-2)

Additionally, kinase signaling is implicated in regulating DNAJB2 ubiquitin-binding via phosphorylation (CK2→UIM2), supporting a concept that kinase inhibitors might modulate DNAJB2 function (e.g., to “release” ubiquitin-binding capacity), although direct clinical application remains unproven. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15)

7. Expert opinions and synthesis (authoritative interpretations)

Authoritative reviews emphasize that DNAJB2 is not a generic folding factor but a neuronally important co-chaperone that integrates Hsp70 cycling with ubiquitin recognition to route damaged proteins toward proteasomal degradation, a function especially critical in long-lived cells such as neurons. This mechanistic framing is consistent with the broad client range (aggregation-prone proteins) and with human disease phenotypes driven by impaired proteostasis, spanning neuropathy, motor neuron disease-like presentations, and mixed neuromyopathy. (sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 12-15, koutras2014jproteinmutations pages 1-2, sarparanta2020neuromusculardiseasesdue pages 1-3)

The 2023 dominant mutation study provides a concrete mechanistic illustration of how altering DNAJB2’s localization and stability (ER mislocalization plus proteasomal degradation) can reduce functional DNAJB2 dosage and potentially perturb proteostasis networks in muscle and peripheral nerve, thereby widening the conceptual disease mechanism beyond pure recessive loss-of-function. (sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 1-2, sarparanta2023extensionofthe pages 5-7)

8. Gaps and limitations of the current evidence base (as of 2026)

While 2023–2024 brought important expansion of the phenotype/inheritance spectrum and a clear dominant-mutation mechanism, the retrieved corpus here contains limited 2023–2024 primary mechanistic studies beyond Sarparanta et al. (2023) and relies on prior reviews for many biochemical specifics (e.g., detailed client specificity, structural determinants of UIM-polyubiquitin binding, and quantitative binding affinities). Thus, mechanistic conclusions about precise substrate specificity remain primarily qualitative (polyubiquitin binding and broad anti-aggregation activity), and additional recent structural biology may exist but was not retrieved in this tool session.
