## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q6UWE3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Colipase-like protein 2; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CLPSL2; Synonyms=C6orf126; ORFNames=UNQ3045/PRO9861;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the colipase family. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-
- **Key Domains:** Colipase. (IPR001981)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CLPSL2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CLPSL2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CLPSL2** (gene ID: CLPSL2, UniProt: Q6UWE3) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research plan and approach
We verified the target identity, searched primary and review literature for CLPSL2/Q6UWE3 and synonyms (C6orf126), gathered evidence about function, localization, expression, domains, and evolutionary family, and assessed clinical associations. We prioritized recent and authoritative sources; however, direct human experimental literature for CLPSL2 remains sparse. Where human evidence was unavailable, we clearly indicate inference from mouse studies and reviews.

Comprehensive research report on CLPSL2 (Q6UWE3)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and nomenclature: CLPSL2 (colipase-like protein 2), also known as C6orf126, is a human gene encoding a secreted protein that belongs to the colipase family. Phylogenetic analyses place human CLPSL2 with colipase-like proteins and show it is part of a mammalian cluster with CLPS and CLPSL1 on chromosome 6 (human ortholog included in the phylogeny as NP_997292) (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (Published Jun 2018).
- Domain architecture: CLPSL2 contains a signal peptide and the conserved cysteines characteristic of colipase family proteins, with an additional C-terminal cysteine; key residues used by pancreatic colipase to interact with pancreatic lipase are not conserved, suggesting a function distinct from classical lipase activation (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Primary biological role (current understanding): CLPSL2 is best characterized in mouse as an epididymis-specific secretory protein that coats spermatozoa, contributing to sperm motility and acrosomal integrity; its biochemical behavior is consistent with lipid/membrane binding rather than lipase cofactor activity (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- CLPSL2-specific human studies in 2023–2024 were not identified in our searches. The most authoritative functional study remains Lu et al. (2018) in mouse, and a reproductive biology review (2019) that contextualizes CLPSL2 among epididymal proteins (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5). URLs: Reproduction review https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (Nov 2019); primary study https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (Jun 2018).
- The 2019 review synthesizes that human CLPSL2 is expressed in the caput epididymis (citing older primary literature) and that mouse CLPSL2 binds sperm and affects sperm function (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Fertility research: Mouse data indicate that knockdown of Clpsl2 in the caput epididymis impairs sperm motility and acrosomal integrity and reduces fertility, positioning CLPSL2 as a potential target for studying epididymal contributions to male fertility and possible nonhormonal contraceptive strategies. These applications are presently preclinical and based on mouse models (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018); contextual review: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019).
- Biomarker potential: The epididymis-restricted expression and sperm-coating behavior could make CLPSL2 a candidate biomarker of epididymal function in semen, but direct human validation studies were not found in the retrieved literature (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The Reproduction review (Björkgren & Sipilä, 2019) identifies CLPSL2 as an epididymal secreted protein, with reported human expression in caput epithelium and mouse functional data indicating roles in sperm motility and acrosome integrity. The review interprets CLPSL2 as a sperm-membrane remodeling/maintenance factor rather than a classical lipase cofactor, aligning with sequence differences from pancreatic colipase (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (Nov 2019).
- Primary functional study (Lu et al., 2018) concludes that Clpsl2 is critical for normal sperm function and male fertility in mouse, is luminal and sperm-surface associated, and lacks lipase activation activity, providing mechanistic support for a membrane/lipid-binding role (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 17-20, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (Jun 2018).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Localization dynamics: In mouse, immunofluorescence labeling showed that more than 80% of caput sperm were coated with Clpsl2; binding decreased along the epididymis (caput to corpus to cauda), consistent with remodeling during transit (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Biochemistry: Recombinant Clpsl2 did not promote pancreatic-lipase-dependent triolein hydrolysis, contrasting with pancreatic colipase; sequence analysis indicates substitutions at residues mediating lipase interaction and a distinct hydrophobic surface, compatible with lipid/membrane binding (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Functional phenotype: Lentiviral shRNA knockdown in mouse caput epididymis decreased cauda sperm counts, attenuated motility, reduced intact acrosome rates, and lowered fertilization/fecundity metrics in IVF and mating assays, demonstrating causality for male subfertility (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

Functional annotation for human CLPSL2 (integrating cross-species evidence)
- Subcellular compartment and site of action: Human CLPSL2 is inferred to be a secreted epididymal protein based on conserved signal peptide/colipase fold and human caput expression reported in a review; in mouse, the protein is secreted into the lumen and coats the sperm acrosome and principal piece (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 17-20). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Biochemical function: Despite colipase homology, CLPSL2 is unlikely to act as a lipase cofactor. Mouse assays show no activation of pancreatic lipase on triolein; sequence differences at lipase-interaction residues and hydrophobic surface patterns support a lipid-binding or membrane-stabilizing role (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Biological process: In mouse, Clpsl2 supports sperm motility and acrosome integrity, likely by influencing sperm membrane composition and stability during epididymal maturation. By homology and expression, human CLPSL2 plausibly participates in analogous processes, but direct human functional validation is not yet reported in retrieved sources (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25, bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018); https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019).
- Evolutionary context: Mammalian duplication yielded CLPSL1 and CLPSL2 adjacent to CLPS; conserved colipase cysteines and secretion signal are retained, while lipase-interaction residues diverged—consistent with subfunctionalization toward sperm membrane interaction (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

Disease and clinical associations
- Human disease associations: No direct human disease or clinical associations were identified for CLPSL2/Q6UWE3 in the retrieved literature. The strongest evidence concerns male fertility phenotypes in mouse following epididymal knockdown (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

Gene/protein identification verification and ambiguity check
- Symbol/identity check: CLPSL2 (C6orf126) with UniProt Accession Q6UWE3 corresponds to colipase-like protein 2 in human, consistent with inclusion of the human ortholog in colipase-family phylogeny and with a mammalian genomic cluster with CLPS/CLPSL1 (lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).
- Organism check: Evidence for functional roles is from mouse; human organism annotation is consistent but direct human functional data are limited. The protein family/domain (colipase) matches available literature; no conflicting gene symbol usage was found in our evidence set (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

Limitations and gaps
- Human-specific functional assays, tissue-level protein localization, and clinical genetics for CLPSL2 are currently lacking in the retrieved corpus. Current understanding of human CLPSL2 function is largely inferred from conserved domains, phylogeny, and mouse studies (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1530/rep-18-0589 (2019); https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.26668 (2018).

Conclusion
Human CLPSL2 encodes a secreted, colipase-family protein with domain features suggesting membrane/lipid binding rather than lipase cofactor activity. Robust in vivo mouse data show epididymal expression, sperm-surface coating, and essential roles in sperm motility and acrosomal integrity, leading to subfertility upon knockdown. Human expression has been reported in the caput epididymis in reviews citing earlier work, but direct human functional and clinical evidence remains to be established. These findings motivate targeted human studies to validate CLPSL2’s role in epididymal sperm maturation and to assess potential as a fertility biomarker or contraceptive target (bjorkgren2019theimpactof pages 7-8, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 1-5, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 20-23, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 17-20, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 23-25, lu2018anepididymis‐specificsecretory pages 11-14).
