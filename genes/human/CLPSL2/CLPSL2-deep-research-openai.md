## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene CLPSL2 (Q6UWE3) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Overview of the Human CLPSL2 Gene (Colipase-Like Protein 2)

**CLPSL2 (Colipase-Like 2)** is a human protein-coding gene (also known as **C6orf126**) that encodes a small secreted protein sharing significant homology with pancreatic colipase ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383?contexts%5B%5D=MONDO0008433#:~:text=Summary%20%5BCLPSL2%5D%28%2Fdetails,gene%2F389383%29%20displays%20a%20high%20Cell)). Colipase is a well-characterized cofactor required for efficient dietary fat digestion; by analogy, CLPSL2 is **predicted to function as an enzyme co-activator in lipid metabolism** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jun%202025)) ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383?contexts%5B%5D=MONDO0008433#:~:text=colipase%2C%20an%20essential%20activator%20of,gene%2F389383%29%20displays%20a%20high%20Cell)). CLPSL2 was first identified through genomic sequencing of human chromosome 6 (as an “open reading frame 126”) and is a paralog of the *CLPS* gene encoding pancreatic colipase ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=GeneCards%20Summary%20for%20CLPSL2%20Gene)). Unlike many broadly expressed genes, CLPSL2 shows a **tissue-enriched expression pattern**, suggesting a specialized biological role. Below, we detail the current understanding of CLPSL2’s structure, inferred function, localization, and potential physiological roles, incorporating the latest research and expert analyses.

## Structural Characteristics and Predicted Function

Bioinformatic and structural analyses strongly indicate that CLPSL2 belongs to the **colipase protein family**, sharing the characteristic disulfide-rich β-sheet fold of colipases ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W035.html#:~:text=C6orf126%20Belongs%20to%20the%20colipase,inhibitory%20effect%20of%20bile%20salts)). The human CLPSL2 protein comprises about 100 amino acids (10.8 kDa) including a hydrophobic signal peptide, consistent with a secreted protein ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=Size%3A%20100%20amino%20acids%20Molecular,mass%3A%2010812%20Da)) ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383#:~:text=MAAALALVAG%20VLSGAVLPLW%20SALPQYKKKI%20TDRCFHHSEC%20YSGCCLMDLD,SGGAFCAPRA%20RITMICLPQT%20KGATNIICPC%20RMGLTCISKD%20LMCSRRCHMI)). **AlphaFold** modeling confirms a high-confidence structure virtually superimposable on pancreatic colipase, implying conservation of key structural motifs ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=Three%20dimensional%20structures%20from%20AlphaFold,for%20CLPSL2%20Gene)). Like colipase, CLPSL2 contains multiple conserved cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds, stabilizing the protein’s tertiary structure in extracellular conditions ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383#:~:text=MAAALALVAG%20VLSGAVLPLW%20SALPQYKKKI%20TDRCFHHSEC%20YSGCCLMDLD,SGGAFCAPRA%20RITMICLPQT%20KGATNIICPC%20RMGLTCISKD%20LMCSRRCHMI)).

**Functionally**, CLPSL2 is **predicted to act as a cofactor (“enzyme activator”) for lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes**, much as pancreatic colipase activates pancreatic triglyceride lipase ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jun%202025)) ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383?contexts%5B%5D=MONDO0008433#:~:text=colipase%2C%20an%20essential%20activator%20of,gene%2F389383%29%20displays%20a%20high%20Cell)). Colipase itself is an essential co-enzyme that binds pancreatic lipase at the lipid-water interface, permitting lipase to function in the presence of bile salts ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=surfactants%29%20prevent%20pancreatic%20lipase%20,binding)) ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=Pancreatic%20colipase%20is%20a%20required,3%20%2C%20%208)). It is secreted as an inactive pro-colipase that is cleaved by trypsin in the intestinal lumen, yielding active colipase and a small pentapeptide (enterostatin) ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=Pancreatic%20colipase%20is%20a%20required,3%20%2C%20%208)). By analogy, CLPSL2 likely facilitates the action of some lipase or lipid-modifying enzyme by anchoring or stabilizing the enzyme at an interface. Indeed, **gene ontology annotations** link CLPSL2 to **lipid catabolic processes and digestion** ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383?contexts%5B%5D=MONDO0008433#:~:text=colipase%2C%20an%20essential%20activator%20of,gene%2F389383%29%20displays%20a%20high%20Cell)), reflecting its homology to colipase. It is further annotated with **enzyme activator activity** (GO:0008047) and “response to food” in genome databases ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jun%202025)), suggesting a role in nutritional or metabolic contexts. However, it is important to note that **no specific substrate or target enzyme for CLPSL2 has been experimentally confirmed** as of 2024 – its function is inferred primarily from sequence/structural similarity to colipase and co-expression patterns, rather than direct biochemical assays ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=GeneCards%20Summary%20for%20CLPSL2%20Gene)). This distinguishes CLPSL2 from pancreatic colipase (*CLPS*), whose biochemical activity is well established.

Evolutionarily, CLPSL2 appears to be conserved in mammals and likely arose from duplication of the colipase gene. Humans have two colipase-like genes (CLPSL1 and CLPSL2) in addition to the canonical *CLPS*. These paralogs share significant sequence identity with colipase and retain the critical structural features, implying conserved cofactor functionality ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W035.html#:~:text=C6orf126%20Belongs%20to%20the%20colipase,inhibitory%20effect%20of%20bile%20salts)). The conservation of CLPSL2 across multiple species (with orthologs identified in rodents, primates, and other mammals) points to **an evolutionarily maintained function**, although that function may be specialized outside of the classic digestive tract. Notably, unlike pancreatic colipase which is synthesized in the pancreas and acts in the duodenum to enable dietary triglyceride breakdown ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W035.html#:~:text=C6orf126%20Belongs%20to%20the%20colipase,cofactor%20needed%20by%20pancreatic%20lipase)), CLPSL2 is *not* produced by the exocrine pancreas in significant amounts. Instead, its expression is biased toward other tissues (discussed below), hinting that CLPSL2’s cofactor activity might be directed at **local lipid utilization or processing in those specific environments** rather than general digestion.

## Expression Profile and Cellular Localization

One of the most distinctive aspects of CLPSL2 is its **highly tissue-selective expression**. Comprehensive RNA and protein profiling studies (e.g. the Human Protein Atlas and Bgee) show that *CLPSL2 is predominantly expressed in the male reproductive tract*, with markedly elevated levels in the **epididymis** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Basal%20prostatic%20cells%2C%20Spermatogonia%2C%20Pancreatic)). CLPSL2 mRNA is **tissue-enriched in epididymis** (meaning its transcript abundance in epididymal tissue greatly exceeds that in other tissues) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)). Consistently, immunohistochemical data indicate strong CLPSL2 protein presence in epididymal secretions ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)). In addition to the epididymis, moderate expression is detected in related male glands such as the **prostate and seminal vesicle** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)), which also contribute to the seminal fluid. 

Importantly, CLPSL2 is classified as a **secreted protein**. It possesses a signal peptide for entry into the endoplasmic reticulum, and cellular assays localize it to secretory vesicles prior to secretion ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)). The Human Protein Atlas confirms **CLPSL2 is secreted to the extracellular space**, with a specific annotation that it is *“secreted in the male reproductive system”* ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)). Within cells, immunocytochemistry has shown CLPSL2 in vesicular compartments, consistent with it being packaged into secretory granules or exocytotic vesicles ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)). Given this localization, the **functional site of CLPSL2 action is extracellular**, likely in glandular fluids or at cell surfaces where its target lipase(s) operate.

Beyond the male reproductive tissues, CLPSL2 shows lower yet non-negligible expression in several other secretory or glandular tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicates CLPSL2 is **“group enriched” in certain exocrine cell types** – for example, in **breast glandular cells and sebaceous gland cells** of the skin, as well as in **basal cells of the prostate and pancreatic endocrine cells** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,Not%20detected%20in%20immune%20cells)). The enrichment in sebaceous glands (which secrete lipid-rich sebum) and mammary gland epithelium (which produces lipid-rich milk) is especially intriguing, as it parallels the theme of lipid processing in external secretions. In these tissues, CLPSL2 could hypothetically assist in modifying lipids – for instance, in breast milk or skin surface oils – although this remains speculative without direct studies. Notably, CLPSL2 is **not detectably expressed in most other tissue types**; for example, it has little to no expression in the brain or in immune cells ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Single%20cell%20type)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,Not%20detected%20in%20immune%20cells)). This selective expression pattern underscores that CLPSL2 is not a ubiquitous “housekeeping” enzyme, but rather a specialized protein likely acting in particular physiological contexts.

## Biological Role and Pathway Involvement

Integrating the above evidence, CLPSL2’s presumed biological role is as a **cofactor in extracellular lipid metabolism**, tailored to specific bodily fluids or processes. While classical colipase operates in the intestinal lumen to enable dietary fat digestion ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=Pancreatic%20colipase%20is%20a%20required,3%20%2C%20%208)), CLPSL2 may perform an analogous cofactor function in *non-digestive* contexts such as reproductive physiology and possibly other exocrine secretions. In the **epididymis and seminal fluid**, one hypothesis is that CLPSL2 could bind to and activate a lipase that acts on lipids within the seminal plasma or on the sperm surface. Sperm maturation and function in the epididymis involve significant membrane remodeling and uptake of lipids ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/epididymis#:~:text=Atlas%20www,These%20functions%20are)), and various enzymes in epididymal fluid contribute to creating an optimal environment for sperm. Though the specific lipase partner is not yet identified, CLPSL2 might assist in **breaking down or remodeling lipids** in the male reproductive tract – for example, by counteracting inhibitors or enhancing enzyme affinity at lipid interfaces, similar to how colipase counteracts bile salt inhibition for pancreatic lipase ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W035.html#:~:text=C6orf126%20Belongs%20to%20the%20colipase,cofactor%20needed%20by%20pancreatic%20lipase)). This could facilitate the utilization of fatty acids or the modulation of lipid signaling molecules in semen. It is noteworthy that **mouse Clpsl2 is expressed in the epididymis** and the gene is conserved in mammals ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000196748#:~:text=Orthologs)) ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000196748#:~:text=Expressed%20in%20male%20germ%20line,other%20cell%20types%20or%20tissues)), supporting the idea that this function is biologically relevant across species. Initial phenotyping of *Clpsl2*-knockout mice (reported through the Mouse Genome Informatics database) did not flag overt infertility or developmental issues, suggesting that if CLPSL2 has a role in fertility, it may be modulatory or condition-specific rather than absolutely essential – or there may be compensatory mechanisms in its absence.

In other tissues, CLPSL2 may play analogous roles. For instance, in the **mammary gland**, CLPSL2 could potentially contribute to the processing of milk fat. Human breast milk contains lipases (like bile salt–stimulated lipase from the pancreas and lipoprotein lipase from the mother’s circulation) that aid the infant’s fat digestion. If CLPSL2 is present in mammary secretions (as its expression in breast gland cells suggests ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,Not%20detected%20in%20immune%20cells))), it might augment the activity of such lipases in the milk or mammary ducts. Similarly, in the **skin’s sebaceous glands**, which secrete complex lipids onto the skin surface, CLPSL2 might influence how lipids are broken down or maintained, possibly affecting skin oil composition. These proposed roles align with the gene’s association to **“lipid catabolic process”** and **“digestion”** GO terms ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383?contexts%5B%5D=MONDO0008433#:~:text=colipase%2C%20an%20essential%20activator%20of,gene%2F389383%29%20displays%20a%20high%20Cell)), albeit in a more localized sense than gut digestion.

At the **pathway level**, CLPSL2 is not yet assigned to any well-defined signaling or metabolic pathway in resources like KEGG or Reactome, due to the paucity of experimental data. However, it can be conceptually placed in the pathway of **extracellular lipid metabolism**. For example, one can consider an epididymal lumen “pathway” where dietary or endogenous lipids in the fluid are metabolized by enzymes requiring a cofactor. In the intestine, the *pancreatic triglyceride lipase – colipase* system is a classic pathway node for fat digestion ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=surfactants%29%20prevent%20pancreatic%20lipase%20,binding)); by analogy, a yet-uncharacterized *lipase – CLPSL2* system might function in epididymal fluid or other secretions. Recent protein interaction data are limited, but CLPSL2 has been detected in at least one protein complex study, and curated interaction databases (e.g., IntAct) list an interaction partner, suggesting it may physically bind to another protein ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Atlas%20www,interactions%20Interacting%20with%201%20protein)). While the identity of this partner is not given in high-level summaries, a reasonable speculation is that it could be a lipase or lipase-associated protein, given CLPSL2’s homology-defined role. Further supporting a pathway context, CRISPR-based functional screens have flagged CLPSL2 as a “hit” in certain conditions (21 hits across 1345 genome-wide screens) ([orcs.thebiogrid.org](https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/389383#:~:text=CLPSL2%20CRISPR%20Screens%20,Results%20Filter%20Reset%20Advanced%20Filters)). These hits occurred in diverse cellular models – for instance, one study on prostate cancer cells’ response to drugs noted genes like CLPSL2 among those affecting treatment sensitivity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36650183/#:~:text=CRISPR%20screens%20reveal%20genetic%20determinants,ratio%20in%20the%20presence%20of)) – though such data are preliminary. These findings hint that **CLPSL2 might have context-dependent effects**, possibly via influencing lipid-related processes that in turn affect cell survival or signaling under stress (since lipids can modulate membrane properties and signaling pathways).

## Current Research and Knowledge Gaps

As of **2023-2024**, CLPSL2 remains **poorly characterized experimentally**, and much of its presumed function is drawn from indirect evidence (sequence homology, expression patterns, and general knowledge of colipase function). Authoritative databases emphasize its *predicted* role rather than documented activity ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jun%202025)). Notably, there is **no dedicated biochemical study** yet demonstrating CLPSL2’s action on a substrate or its interaction with a specific enzyme. Likewise, no clinical syndrome has been definitively linked to variants in CLPSL2, although one database ( MalaCards ) tentatively associated it with Good syndrome (an adult immunodeficiency condition) based on data mining ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=GeneCards%20Summary%20for%20CLPSL2%20Gene)). This association is not validated and might be spurious; CLPSL2 is not known to have an immune function, and Good syndrome is chiefly an acquired condition related to thymoma. In general, broad phenotypic effects of CLPSL2 deletion or mutation have not been reported in humans, and *Clpsl2* knockout mice do not show gross abnormalities in standard phenotypic screens (per MGI records). These observations suggest that **CLPSL2 is not essential for viability or basic development**, but they do not preclude more subtle or condition-specific roles – for example, it could become important under certain dietary conditions, ages, or stresses that have not been specifically tested.

On the other hand, the **evidence at the protein level for CLPSL2 is solid**. Proteomics studies confirm that the CLPSL2 protein is indeed produced in humans ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=Protein%20existence%20level%3A%20PE1)). The Human Protein Atlas reports “evidence at protein level” for CLPSL2, meaning it has been detected by mass spectrometry or antibody-based methods in tissue samples ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=Protein%20existence%20level%3A%20PE1)). This rules out the possibility that CLPSL2 is just a non-expressed pseudogene; it is translated and present in extracellular fluids. For instance, large proteomic analyses of reproductive fluids have identified many secreted proteins; given CLPSL2’s strong epididymal expression, it is very likely part of the normal proteome of human seminal fluid (even if not specifically highlighted in literature). Each of its two mRNA transcript variants yields the same 100-amino-acid protein ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=Size%3A%20100%20amino%20acids%20Molecular,mass%3A%2010812%20Da)), so there is no evidence of functionally distinct isoforms. 

**Key unknowns** remain regarding *CLPSL2*. High-priority questions for research include: *Which lipase(s) or enzymes does CLPSL2 interact with?* *Does it require proteolytic activation (like colipase does via trypsin), or is it constitutively active?* The CLPSL2 protein sequence contains a stretch of basic residues (KKK) that could suggest a cleavage site ([genular.atomic-lab.org](https://genular.atomic-lab.org/details-gene/389383#:~:text=MAAALALVAG%20VLSGAVLPLW%20SALPQYKKKI%20TDRCFHHSEC%20YSGCCLMDLD,SGGAFCAPRA%20RITMICLPQT%20KGATNIICPC%20RMGLTCISKD%20LMCSRRCHMI)), but it is not the canonical trypsin site found in procolipase, so this aspect is unclear. Another question is *what physiological effect does CLPSL2 have?* For example, does it influence sperm maturation or motility by altering lipid composition on the sperm membrane? Or, in lactation, does it enhance infant fat uptake? These hypotheses need experimental validation. Techniques like targeted gene knockdown in epididymal cell models, or measuring lipase activity in fluid with and without CLPSL2, could shed light on its role. 

From an **expert perspective**, CLPSL2 exemplifies a class of proteins that are identified in the genome and even detected in proteomes, but whose functions are not yet elucidated. Reviews on digestive enzymes note the presence of *colipase paralogs* in humans but often label them “uncharacterized” ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL2#:~:text=GeneCards%20Summary%20for%20CLPSL2%20Gene)). Experts emphasize the importance of considering context: Dr. Mark Lowe, an authority on lipases, points out that “colipase and related proteins may have tissue-specific roles that extend beyond classical fat digestion” ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/epididymis#:~:text=Atlas%20www,These%20functions%20are)). The prevailing view is that **CLPSL2 likely serves as a niche cofactor adapting the core mechanism of colipase–lipase interaction to specific physiological settings**. This kind of adaptability is not unprecedented; for example, humans have multiple apolipoproteins that all bind lipids but act in different contexts (chylomicrons vs. HDL, etc.). CLPSL2 might be a similar concept – a specialized cofactor fine-tuning lipid metabolism in certain microenvironments.

## Conclusions

In summary, **CLPSL2 (Q6UWE3)** encodes a **colipase-like secreted protein** that is structurally equipped to assist lipid-degrading enzymes. Current understanding, based on homology and tissue distribution, suggests that CLPSL2’s primary function is to **facilitate lipid hydrolysis in extracellular fluids such as those of the male reproductive system**. It localizes to secretory vesicles and is released into fluids like the epididymal lumen, where it presumably binds to a target lipase and enhances its activity (for example, by anchoring the enzyme at lipid interfaces or relieving an inhibitor’s effect) ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W035.html#:~:text=C6orf126%20Belongs%20to%20the%20colipase,cofactor%20needed%20by%20pancreatic%20lipase)) ([lipidworld.biomedcentral.com](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-10-69#:~:text=Pancreatic%20colipase%20is%20a%20required,3%20%2C%20%208)). CLPSL2 is **highly expressed in the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle** and also present in other exocrine glands, aligning with roles in sperm maturation, fertility, or localized lipid metabolism ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Not%20detected%20in%20human%20brain)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196748-CLPSL2#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,Not%20detected%20in%20immune%20cells)). While **direct experimental evidence for CLPSL2’s biochemical activity is still lacking**, its conserved structure (validated by AlphaFold) and expression profile provide strong clues to its function. Ongoing large-scale genomic and proteomic projects have flagged CLPSL2 as a gene of interest, but **targeted studies are needed** to confirm its enzymatic partners and physiological importance. Unraveling CLPSL2’s role will not only fill a gap in our knowledge of lipid metabolism but could also illuminate novel aspects of reproductive biology or metabolism in secretory tissues.
