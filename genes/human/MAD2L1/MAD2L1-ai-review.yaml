description: >-
  MAD2L1 (Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2-Like 1) encodes a HORMA domain-containing protein
  that is a core effector of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). MAD2 exists in two
  interconvertible conformations: an open form (O-MAD2) that predominates in the cytosol
  and a closed form (C-MAD2) that binds its key targets. At unattached kinetochores during
  prometaphase, MAD1:C-MAD2 core complexes recruit cytosolic O-MAD2 and catalyze its
  conversion to C-MAD2, enabling binding to CDC20. The resulting CDC20:MAD2 complex
  associates with BUB3 and BUBR1 to form the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which
  inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C-CDC20), thereby preventing
  premature anaphase until all chromosomes achieve proper bipolar attachment. Checkpoint
  silencing is mediated by p31comet (MAD2L1BP) and the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13, which
  remodel C-MAD2 back to O-MAD2 and disassemble the MCC. MAD2 also localizes to the
  nuclear pore complex via TPR during interphase, potentially facilitating early MCC
  assembly.

    summary: >-
      MAD2 localization to kinetochores is well-established and central to its checkpoint
      function. The original discovery paper (PMID:8824189) showed MAD2 localizes to
      kinetochores after chromosome condensation but is absent from kinetochores at
      metaphase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Kinetochore localization is a core aspect of MAD2 function. IBA inference from

      MAD2 is a core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The deep research confirms
