## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O76003
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Glutaredoxin-3; AltName: Full=PKC-interacting cousin of thioredoxin {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10636891}; Short=PICOT {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10636891}; AltName: Full=PKC-theta-interacting protein; Short=PKCq-interacting protein; AltName: Full=Thioredoxin-like protein 2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GLRX3; Synonyms=PICOT {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10636891}, TXNL2; ORFNames=HUSSY-22;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Glutaredoxin. (IPR002109); GRX_PICOT-like. (IPR033658); Monothiol_GRX-rel. (IPR004480); Thioredoxin-like_sf. (IPR036249); Thioredoxin_domain. (IPR013766)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GLRX3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GLRX3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GLRX3** (gene ID: GLRX3, UniProt: O76003) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein verification
- Identity: The target is human GLRX3 (also known as PICOT/TXNL2), a cytosolic multidomain monothiol glutaredoxin. Recent structural and native mass spectrometry work on human GLRX3 confirms two Grx domains and cytosolic function, with specific complex formation with BOLA2; domain organization aligns with CGFS-type monothiol glutaredoxins having thioredoxin-like and Grx domains (supporting the UniProt domain annotations and synonym PICOT) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, silva2023newperspectiveson pages 9-10).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Monothiol glutaredoxin: GLRX3 is a CGFS-type monothiol glutaredoxin with two Grx domains that bind and traffic iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters in the cytosol, often in complexes with BOLA family proteins (BOLA2 in humans) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, silva2023newperspectiveson pages 9-10). In human cells, apo-GLRX3 associates with two BOLA2 molecules; upon Fe–S loading, GLRX3–BOLA2 can carry [2Fe–2S] clusters, and GLRX3 can also form [2Fe–2S]-bridged GLRX3 homodimers (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132).
- Cytosolic Fe–S biogenesis vs. CIA: Eukaryotic Fe–S biogenesis uses mitochondrial ISC machinery and the cytosolic CIA system. Recent in vivo work (yeast and human) shows cytosolic [2Fe–2S] protein maturation requires the mitochondrial ISC system, ABCB7/Atm1 exporter, and glutathione (GSH), but proceeds independently of the CIA machinery and of cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins; in contrast, [4Fe–4S] maturation in the cytosol/nucleus requires ISC, ABCB7, GSH, and CIA (PNAS 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400740121; May 2024) (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10).

2) Biochemical function and pathway placement
- Cluster binding states and partners: Human GLRX3 assembles into two principal holo-states: (i) a [2Fe–2S]2–GLRX3 homodimer (two clusters, dimeric GLRX3 with GSH ligation) and (ii) a GLRX3–BOLA2 heterocomplex carrying [2Fe–2S] clusters (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124). Native MS and spectroscopic studies directly observed these states and their stoichiometries (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124).
- Cluster transfer to client proteins: The [2Fe–2S]-loaded GLRX3 homocomplex donates clusters to the P-loop NTPase scaffold NUBP1, supporting assembly of a [4Fe–4S] on NUBP1 by reductive coupling of two [2Fe–2S] clusters. This transfer is faster and more efficient from the GLRX3 homocomplex than from the GLRX3–BOLA2 complex, which appears more oxidatively stable and a poorer donor to NUBP1 under tested conditions (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132). Both GLRX3 holo-states can transfer [2Fe–2S] to CIAPIN1/anamorsin, a CIA electron carrier, indicating client- and context-dependent donor behavior (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).
- Position relative to ISC/ABCB7/GSH and CIA: In vivo mechanistic mapping shows cytosolic [2Fe–2S] maturation depends on mitochondrial ISC output and ABCB7/Atm1-dependent export, with a role for GSH at or before export, but occurs without CIA components or cGrxs being essential. Conversely, cytosolic/nuclear [4Fe–4S] clients require CIA. This clarifies that GLRX3 is not essential for all [2Fe–2S] delivery in vivo, despite its robust biochemical capacity to bind and transfer [2Fe–2S] in vitro (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400740121; May 2024) (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10).
- Mechanistic nuance: Recent synthesis emphasizes that GLRX3–BOLA2 may function as a relatively stable [2Fe–2S] reservoir/chaperone, whereas the GLRX3 homocomplex is a more kinetically competent donor to NUBP1; conditions (redox, reductants, pH) influence the observed transfer efficiencies and remain an active area of investigation (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 137-137, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).

3) Cellular localization and site of action
- Localization: Experimental studies and reviews place GLRX3 and the GLRX3–BOLA2 complex in the cytosol, participating in cytosolic Fe–S trafficking and in interfacing with CIA components via transfers to CIAPIN1/anamorsin and NUBP1 (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, silva2023newperspectiveson pages 9-10). While many Fe–S client enzymes reside in the nucleus, the current 2024 in vivo mapping indicates GLRX3 is not required for general [2Fe–2S] maturation of cytosolic clients and that [4Fe–4S] delivery to nuclear targets is CIA-dependent (PNAS 2024) (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10).

4) Current understanding of enzymatic/substrate specificity
- Reaction/substrate: GLRX3 is not a classical oxidoreductase in these contexts but a cluster-binding/transfer protein. The relevant “substrates” are [2Fe–2S] clusters (assembled upstream by ISC-derived export) that are bound by GLRX3 (and GLRX3–BOLA2) with GSH acting as a co-ligand; GLRX3 then transfers clusters to cytosolic assembly factors/clients such as NUBP1 and CIAPIN1/anamorsin (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).

5) Expert opinions and mechanistic controversies (2023–2024)
- Essentiality vs. reservoir function: A key 2024 advance shows that cytosolic [2Fe–2S] maturation does not require cGrxs (including GLRX3) in vivo, reframing GLRX3 from an obligatory donor to a context-dependent chaperone/reservoir that can transfer clusters to specific partners under certain conditions (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400740121; May 2024) (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10). Complementary biochemical work in 2024 underscores that GLRX3’s different holo-states have distinct stabilities and transfer kinetics, supporting a nuanced, client- and redox-dependent role (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).
- Domain architecture consensus: Reviews of CGFS-type Grxs confirm the cytosolic multidomain architecture for GLRX3 and conserved Grx–BOLA physical interactions across kingdoms, supporting the GLRX3–BOLA2 paradigm in humans (Microorganisms 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11030632; Mar 2023) (silva2023newperspectiveson pages 9-10).

6) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Structural/biophysical definition of GLRX3 states and transfers: 2024 native MS/IM-MS and spectroscopy define GLRX3 homocomplex vs GLRX3–BOLA2 assemblies and demonstrate differential transfer of [2Fe–2S] to NUBP1, with both states able to deliver to CIAPIN1/anamorsin (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).
- In vivo pathway mapping: 2024 PNAS study delineates the ABCB7/GSH-dependent export feeding [2Fe–2S] maturation independently of CIA and cGrxs, whereas [4Fe–4S] maturation is CIA-dependent; this places GLRX3 as nonessential for bulk [2Fe–2S] biogenesis but compatible with specialized roles (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400740121; May 2024) (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10).

7) Disease relevance, applications, and real-world implementations (2023–2024)
- Ewing sarcoma (EwS) dependency and therapeutic stratification (preprint): A 2024 bioRxiv study identifies GLRX3 as an EWSR1::FLI1-dependent vulnerability in EwS. Conditional GLRX3 knockdown reduced proliferation and xenograft growth, increased oxidative stress, and altered iron homeostasis. Drug response profiling suggested GLRX3-high EwS cells are more sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors, while GLRX3-low cells are more sensitive to navitoclax (BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor) and ferroptosis inducers (erastin). Specific IC50 shifts were reported: palbociclib IC50 increased from 7.9→18.1 µM (A-673) and 3.8→11.3 µM (MHH-ES-1) after GLRX3 knockdown; ribociclib 12.2→41.1 µM (A-673) and 6.7→34.5 µM (MHH-ES-1); navitoclax decreased ~19.5→0.4 µM (A-673) and 8.4→0.3 µM (MHH-ES-1), indicating enhanced sensitivity when GLRX3 is low (bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.24.590877; Apr 2024). These data propose GLRX3 as a predictive biomarker for therapy selection; note status as preprint (vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 9-12, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 3-6, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 6-9, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 12-16, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 1-3).
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): A 2024 Frontiers in Immunology paper integrates single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with in vitro assays to show GLRX3 is upregulated in HCC, correlates with advanced stage/grade and worse prognosis, and promotes proliferation/invasion via iron metabolism pathways. GLRX3 knockdown reduced proliferation and invasion in vitro (Frontiers in Immunology; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1496886; Nov 2024) (li2024integratingmultiomicstechniques pages 14-15, li2024integratingmultiomicstechniques pages 21-21).
- AML cuproptosis vulnerability context: A 2024 Science Advances study (cuproptosis via copper ionophore UM4118) found that defects in the Fe–S assembly pathway sensitize AML cells; GLRX3 was among Fe–S-related genes differentially expressed in sensitive vs resistant tiers, linking GLRX3/CIA modules (e.g., MMS19) to vulnerability created by ABCB7 missplicing in SF3B1-mutant AML (Science Advances; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018; Mar 2024) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132).
- Environmental epigenetics and lung disease: A 2024 Respiratory Research study of COPD patients associated mid-term PM2.5 exposure with DNA methylation changes at GLRX3 among others and discussed GLRX3 as a glutathione-dependent redox buffer increased in lung cancer tissues, linking environmental exposure, redox/iron metabolism, and disease pathways (Respiratory Research; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02955-3; Sep 2024) (ji2024theassociationbetween pages 8-9).

8) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Biochemical transfer kinetics (qualitative): GLRX3 homocomplex donates [2Fe–2S] to NUBP1 faster and more efficiently than GLRX3–BOLA2 under tested conditions; both donors can metallate CIAPIN1/anamorsin (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).
- EwS pharmacology (preprint): IC50 changes with GLRX3 knockdown—palbociclib (A-673 7.9→18.1 µM; MHH-ES-1 3.8→11.3 µM), ribociclib (A-673 12.2→41.1 µM; MHH-ES-1 6.7→34.5 µM), navitoclax (A-673 19.5→0.4 µM; MHH-ES-1 8.4→0.3 µM), and erastin (~4-fold lower IC50s when GLRX3 is low), supporting biomarker-guided strategies (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.24.590877; Apr 2024) (vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 9-12, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 6-9, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 12-16).
- EwS dependency datasets (preprint): Dependency score thresholds were cited (e.g., < −0.5 “depletion,” ~−1 pan-essential median) and GLRX3 ranked among EwS-specific dependencies; in vivo xenografts (n=8/group) confirmed growth suppression with inducible GLRX3 knockdown (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.24.590877; Apr 2024) (vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 26-30, vinca2024glutaredoxin3(glrx3) pages 3-6).

9) Synthesis and pathway model
- Working model: GLRX3 resides in the cytosol as a multidomain CGFS-type glutaredoxin forming: (i) a [2Fe–2S]-bridged GLRX3 homodimer that is an efficient donor to NUBP1 and (ii) a GLRX3–BOLA2 [2Fe–2S] complex that is more stable but a slower donor to NUBP1; both can metallate CIAPIN1/anamorsin. Upstream, mitochondrial ISC output and ABCB7/GSH-dependent export supply the cytosol with the precursor required for [2Fe–2S] maturation; CIA then builds [4Fe–4S] proteins. In vivo, bulk [2Fe–2S] maturation is GLRX3-independent, positioning GLRX3 as a specialized chaperone/reservoir with context-specific roles and disease-relevant consequences when GLRX3 levels shift (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 120-124, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).

Limitations and open questions
- Essentiality and client scope: PNAS 2024 argues cGrxs are not essential for cytosolic [2Fe–2S] maturation, but biochemical data show robust GLRX3 transfer in vitro; reconciling in vivo nonessentiality with specialized client delivery (e.g., NUBP1 vs CIAPIN1) and redox-state dependence remains an open focus (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 128-132, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 128-132).
- Nuclear delivery: Many final nuclear client proteins are [4Fe–4S] and CIA-dependent; direct roles for GLRX3 in nuclear delivery remain to be clarified under physiological conditions in human cells (braymer2024requirementsforthe pages 9-10).
