description: Glutaredoxin-3 (GLRX3) is a cytosolic [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster chaperone that coordinates,
  transports, and delivers iron-sulfur clusters to target proteins in the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster
  assembly (CIA) pathway. Despite having thioredoxin-like and glutaredoxin domains, GLRX3 lacks classical
  oxidoreductase activity. The protein contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain (scaffolding function)
  and two C-terminal monothiol glutaredoxin domains with CGFS motifs that coordinate [2Fe-2S] clusters.
  GLRX3 forms homodimeric complexes bridged by [2Fe-2S] clusters, with glutathione serving as an essential
  cofactor. Key functions include transferring clusters to NUBP1 and other CIA machinery components, forming
  iron-responsive [2Fe-2S]-bridged complexes with BolA2, and regulating IRP1 iron-sulfur cluster maturation.
  Under oxidative stress, GLRX3 translocates to the nucleus where it participates in DNA damage response
  via ATR pathway and epigenetic regulation via PRC2/EED interaction. Essential for embryonic development
  - knockout is embryonic lethal.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:22309771 demonstrated that human GLRX3 forms [2Fe-2S]-bridged complexes with BolA2, functioning
      as part of CIA machinery.

  review:
    summary: Direct role in [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly for CIA pathway.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function. GLRX3 coordinates and delivers [2Fe-2S] clusters to target proteins
      in the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway.

  review:
    summary: Study on HCV core protein interactions - uninformative generic annotation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Per curation guidelines, generic "protein binding" is uninformative. Study focused on viral
      protein interactions without specific mechanistic insight for GLRX3 function.

    - reference_id: PMID:15846844

        of cellular proteins interacting with the core protein, we employed a proteomic approach.

  review:
    summary: RNA binding from mRNA-binding protein atlas study.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: High-throughput study identified GLRX3 as mRNA-binding protein. Unclear if this reflects true
      function or technical artifact. Not consistent with known iron-sulfur cluster chaperone function.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:22658674

  review:
    summary: Cardiac function regulation inferred from orthologs.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: GLRX3/PICOT has documented roles in cardiac function (attenuating hypertrophy). This represents
      tissue-specific function rather than core molecular activity.

      rather than core molecular activity.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:18258855
      supporting_text: PICOT (protein kinase C-interacting cousin of thioredoxin) was previously shown
        to inhibit pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant with an increase in ventricular
        function and cardiomyocyte contractility.

    reason: Well-documented tissue-specific function of GLRX3/PICOT in cardiac muscle. Not core molecular
      function but represents important physiological role.
