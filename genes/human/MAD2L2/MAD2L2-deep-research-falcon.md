## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UI95
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2B; AltName: Full=Mitotic arrest deficient 2-like protein 2; Short=MAD2-like protein 2; AltName: Full=REV7 homolog; Short=hREV7;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MAD2L2; Synonyms=MAD2B, REV7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** HORMA_dom. (IPR003511); HORMA_dom_sf. (IPR036570); Mad2-like. (IPR045091); HORMA (PF02301)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MAD2L2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MAD2L2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MAD2L2** (gene ID: MAD2L2, UniProt: Q9UI95) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification summary
- Objective 1 (identity/domain verification): Completed. Human MAD2L2 encodes REV7/MAD2B (UniProt Q9UI95), a 211-aa HORMA-domain protein whose C-terminus forms a conformational “safety-belt” that entraps partner peptides; it can homo- and hetero-dimerize. These defining features align with UniProt annotations and recent literature on human REV7/MAD2L2 (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165, Jan 2025) (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report: MAD2L2 (REV7/MAD2B; UniProt Q9UI95)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and domain architecture: MAD2L2 (REV7/MAD2B; also FANCV) is a human HORMA-domain protein (~211 aa) with a C-terminal “safety-belt” region that shifts between open/closed states to encircle short partner motifs (consensus φφxPxxxpP). REV7 forms homo- and hetero-dimers; dimerization underlies several functions (TLS and DSB repair), whereas some mitotic roles are partly dimerization-independent. URLs: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227; Frontiers in Oncology (Jan 2025) https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 2-4).
- Canonical complexes: (i) DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ): REV7 is an accessory subunit of human Pol ζ together with the catalytic subunit REV3L and replicative subunits POLD2/POLD3; Pol ζ functions as the “extender” polymerase in translesion synthesis (TLS). (ii) Shieldin: REV7 is core to the SHLD1/SHLD2/SHLD3 complex that acts downstream of 53BP1 to limit 5′ end resection, favoring classical NHEJ over HR at double-strand breaks (DSBs). URLs: Cell Cycle 2024 https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227; IJMS 2023 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- Structural mechanism: The HORMA “safety-belt” creates high-affinity, topologically entrapped complexes with partner RBMs (e.g., in REV3L and SHLD3). Remodeling by the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13 (with p31comet) can open the seat-belt to disassemble REV7 complexes (Pol ζ or shieldin). URL: Frontiers in Oncology 2025 https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (maggs2025rev7asmall pages 2-4, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 25-26).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Dimerization-dependent functions and repair pathway activities (2023): A non-dimerizing Rev7 mutant (K44A/R124A/A135D) is unable to support gap-filling TLS, cannot reconstitute resistance to ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, fails to restore olaparib response, and loses shieldin interactions (e.g., SHLD2 binding); however, it retains partial mitotic functions via RAN interaction. Published Oct 31, 2023 (IJMS). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- New DDR signaling role via p53 (2024): REV7 directly binds p53 and inhibits ATM-mediated p53 Ser15 phosphorylation, adding a signaling-layer role independent of 53BP1. REV7 loss increased etoposide-induced p53 S15 phosphorylation roughly two-fold; reconstitution experiments and localization assays support direct REV7–p53 regulation. Published Feb 9, 2024 (Cell Cycle). URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13).
- Contemporary synthesis of REV7 biology (2025 review, summarizing 2018–2024 advances): Highlights REV7’s centrality in TLS (REV1–Pol ζ “mutasome”), DSB pathway choice via shieldin, and cell-cycle control; details safety-belt entrapment, RBM consensus, TRIP13/p31comet remodeling, and emerging translational strategies (e.g., small-molecule targeting of REV1–REV7 assembly to suppress mutagenic TLS). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 20-21, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 25-26).

3) Primary molecular functions, complexes, localization, and pathway context
- Translesion synthesis (TLS): REV7 is an accessory subunit of Pol ζ and functionally couples with REV1 to extend from nucleotides inserted opposite lesions by Y-family polymerases. Dimerization of REV7 is required for Rev1–Pol ζ assembly and TLS gap filling; REV7 loss or dimerization-defective variants abrogate TLS activity in cellular assays. URLs: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799; Frontiers in Oncology (Jan 2025) https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2).
- DSB repair pathway choice (NHEJ vs HR) and shieldin: REV7 in shieldin constrains 5′ end resection, promoting 53BP1-dependent classical NHEJ and antagonizing HR. Loss of REV7/shieldin increases HR, impacts class switch recombination, and modulates responses to PARP inhibition. URLs: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227; IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- Replication fork protection and replication stress responses: REV7 contributes to fork stability and genome maintenance; shieldin-dependent and -independent activities have been reported. Dimerization is required for several of these functions. URL: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- Cell-cycle/checkpoint roles: Beyond DNA repair, REV7 modulates mitosis by interacting with RAN and restraining APC/C activation via CDH1 sequestration; the non-dimerizing mutant partially rescues micronuclei formation and G2/M accumulation, indicating separable mitotic functions. URL: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- DNA damage signaling integration via p53: REV7 is now shown to directly suppress ATM→p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, linking REV7 to checkpoint signal modulation. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13).
- Subcellular localization: REV7 accumulates at DNA damage sites and colocalizes with 53BP1; nuclear functions are evident in TLS foci and DSB repair compartments. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3).

4) Interactions and regulatory network
- Core interactors: REV3L (two RBMs on REV3L bind REV7), REV1 (mutasome assembly), SHLD3/SHLD2/SHLD1 (shieldin), 53BP1 (pathway context), RAN (mitotic role), and CDH1 (APC/C regulation). URLs: Cell Cycle 2024 https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227; IJMS 2023 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799; Frontiers in Oncology 2025 https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 2-4).
- New/expanded interactions (2024): Direct REV7–p53 binding inhibits ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15), showing REV7 as a negative regulator of p53 activation under DSB-inducing stress. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13).
- Remodeling and disassembly: TRIP13 with p31comet can open the REV7 safety-belt to remodel complexes (Pol ζ, shieldin), influencing TLS and NHEJ choice. URL: Frontiers in Oncology (Jan 2025) https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (maggs2025rev7asmall pages 2-4, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 25-26).

5) Pathway integration (FA/BRCA, TLS, NHEJ/HR)
- FA pathway link: REV7 has been referred to as FANCV and participates in interstrand crosslink repair in concert with FA/BRCA factors; mechanistic links include its TLS role (Pol ζ) and shieldin-mediated pathway choice. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3).
- TLS coordination: REV1–Pol ζ mutasome assembly and function depend on REV7’s dimerization and seat-belt-mediated RBM recognition. URL: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799; Frontiers in Oncology (Jan 2025) https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2).
- DSB pathway choice: By restraining 5′ end resection, shieldin/REV7 promotes classical NHEJ and antagonizes HR; this axis underlies responses to PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-defective contexts and broader DSB repair outcomes. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13).

6) Disease relevance, applications, and quantitative data
- Cancer biology and therapeutic modulation: REV7 expression is associated with adverse outcomes across multiple malignancies and contributes to therapy resistance by supporting TLS and NHEJ. Suppressing REV7/Pol ζ or disrupting REV1–REV7 can sensitize cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin) and modulate PARP inhibitor responses; a small-molecule (JH-RE-06) that blocks REV1–REV7 assembly suppresses mutagenic TLS and sensitizes cells to cisplatin in preclinical studies. URL: Frontiers in Oncology (Jan 2025) https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (maggs2025rev7asmall pages 20-21, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2).
- PARP inhibitor (PARPi) response phenotypes: REV7 loss increases HR and can confer PARPi resistance in some contexts; conversely, proper shieldin/REV7 function supports NHEJ and PARPi sensitivity in BRCA1-defective settings. Functionally, REV7−/− cells display altered responses to olaparib that are reversed by wild-type REV7 but not by a non-dimerizing mutant, linking REV7 dimerization to therapeutic response. URLs: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799; Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3).
- DDR signaling quantitative example (2024): In REV7−/− cells, etoposide-induced p53 Ser15 phosphorylation was increased approximately two-fold relative to controls; re-expression of REV7 suppressed this signal, indicating a direct regulatory effect. Published Feb 9, 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3).

7) Subcellular context and localization
- Nuclear DNA repair foci: REV7 localizes to DNA damage sites, colocalizing with 53BP1 in DSB repair foci; in TLS, it associates with replication-associated lesions via the REV1–Pol ζ mutasome at chromatin/replication compartments. URL: Cell Cycle (Feb 2024) https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3).
- Mitosis: REV7 contributes to spindle assembly and APC/C regulation through RAN and CDH1 interactions; some mitotic functions persist even when dimerization/TLS functions are impaired, indicating separable structural requirements. URL: IJMS (Oct 2023) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).

8) Expert opinions and synthesis from recent authoritative sources
- 2024 primary study (Cell Cycle): Establishes a direct, mechanistically supported signaling role for REV7 in inhibiting ATM→p53 activation, with quantitative evidence and genetic separation from 53BP1, refining REV7’s position at the intersection of repair and checkpoint signaling (Feb 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384101.2024.2333227 (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13).
- 2023 primary study (IJMS): Demonstrates that HORMA-mediated dimerization is essential for REV7’s TLS and DSB repair roles but not for all mitotic functions, clarifying how structural states partition REV7’s pleiotropic activities (Oct 2023). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115799 (vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 1-2, vassel2023rev7monomeris pages 2-4).
- 2025 synthesis (Frontiers review): Integrates 2018–2024 evidence across TLS, shieldin/NHEJ, safety-belt/RBM biophysics, and translational targeting (e.g., REV1–REV7 inhibitors), providing comprehensive, current context (Jan 2025). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1516165 (maggs2025rev7asmall pages 1-2, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 20-21, maggs2025rev7asmall pages 25-26).

Limitations and notes
- The report emphasizes 2023–2024 primary sources and a 2025 integrative review. Earlier foundational shieldin/NHEJ papers (e.g., 2015 Nature) are referenced within the 2024 study and review; the Cell Cycle 2024 article provides the most direct, recent citations and mechanistic updates (biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 1-3, biller2024rev7p53interactioninhibits pages 12-13). Where specific quantitative statistics are available (e.g., ~2× increase in p53 Ser15 phosphorylation upon REV7 loss), they are included.

Conclusion
MAD2L2 (REV7/MAD2B; Q9UI95) is a human HORMA-domain adaptor whose safety-belt/dimerization mechanics underlie assembly of Pol ζ for TLS and the shieldin complex for DSB pathway choice. Recent work adds a direct role in checkpoint signaling via p53, and functional dissection shows dimerization is essential for repair/TLS but not all mitotic functions. These properties position REV7 as a key integrator of lesion bypass, DSB repair choice (NHEJ vs HR), replication stress tolerance, and DDR signaling, with growing translational interest in modulating REV7/REV1–Pol ζ to influence therapy responses.
