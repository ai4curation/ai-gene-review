  MAD2L2 (also known as REV7 or MAD2B) is a HORMA domain-containing adapter protein
  with dual essential roles in DNA damage response. It functions as: (1) an accessory
  subunit of DNA polymerase zeta (Pol zeta), mediating translesion DNA synthesis by
  bridging the catalytic REV3L subunit with REV1 to bypass DNA lesions; and (2) a
  core component of the shieldin complex (SHLD1/SHLD2/SHLD3/REV7), which acts downstream
  of 53BP1-RIF1 to suppress DNA end resection, thereby promoting NHEJ over homologous
  recombination. The HORMA domain adopts open and closed conformations that enable
  high-affinity binding to partner proteins via a "safety-belt" mechanism. MAD2L2
  also regulates cell cycle progression by inhibiting the APC/C through binding to
  CDH1 and CDC20. Biallelic loss causes Fanconi anemia complementation group V.

      REV7/MAD2L2 is an essential accessory subunit of DNA polymerase zeta that mediates
      translesion DNA synthesis. It bridges REV3L (the catalytic subunit) with REV1,
      enabling bypass of DNA lesions during replication. This adapter function requires
      REV7 dimerization and the HORMA domain safety-belt mechanism.

      As a core component of the shieldin complex, REV7 promotes NHEJ by suppressing DNA
      end resection at double-strand breaks. The shieldin complex (SHLD1/SHLD2/SHLD3/REV7)
      acts downstream of 53BP1-RIF1 to shield DSB ends from nucleolytic processing, thereby
      favoring NHEJ over homologous recombination.

      - statement: REV7 dimerization is required for TLS and shieldin functions
        supporting_text: "REV7 is an accessory subunit of human Pol zeta together with the catalytic subunit REV3L and replicative subunits POLD2/POLD3; Pol zeta functions as the extender polymerase in translesion synthesis"

proposed_new_terms: []

suggested_questions:
  - question: How is REV7 partitioned between its roles in Pol zeta versus the shieldin complex?
  - question: What determines whether REV7 functions in TLS versus DSB repair pathway choice?
  - question: How does TRIP13/p31comet regulate REV7 complex disassembly?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: Structure-function analysis of REV7 mutants that selectively disrupt TLS versus shieldin functions
    hypothesis: Separation-of-function mutations can be identified that distinguish REV7's dual roles
  - description: Live-cell imaging to track REV7 dynamics at DNA damage sites
    hypothesis: REV7 shows distinct recruitment kinetics to replication-associated versus DSB damage
  - description: Characterization of REV7 post-translational modifications that regulate complex assembly
    hypothesis: Specific PTMs control whether REV7 assembles with Pol zeta or shieldin components
