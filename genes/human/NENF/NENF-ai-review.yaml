description: >-
  Neudesin (NENF) is a secreted neurotrophic factor belonging to the cytochrome b5/MAPR
  (membrane-associated progesterone receptor) protein family. The protein contains a
  cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain that binds Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX
  (hemin), which enhances its neurotrophic activity. Neudesin is secreted from neurons
  and promotes neuronal survival and differentiation through activation of G-protein-coupled
  receptors, triggering MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Beyond neural functions,
  neudesin acts as an anorexigenic factor suppressing appetite through hypothalamic
  melanocortin signaling, and modulates energy expenditure by suppressing sympathetic
  nervous system activity. The protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria
  (via interaction with PINK1 and PARK7/DJ-1), and is secreted to the extracellular space.
  NENF is overexpressed in multiple cancers.
