## Question

Research the CD247 (P20963) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **CD247 gene (UniProt P20963)** encodes the **T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain**, a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex in humans. This protein is essential for T-cell activation, signal transduction, and immune response[1][3][5][9].

**Key Concepts and Definitions**

- **Molecular Function:**  
  CD247 exhibits **transmembrane signaling receptor activity**, **protein homodimerization activity**, and **identical protein binding**[5][14]. Its cytoplasmic domain contains **immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)**, which are phosphorylated upon TCR engagement, initiating downstream signaling cascades[3][5][9].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  CD247 is central to the **T cell receptor signaling pathway**, **adaptive immune response**, and **alpha-beta T cell activation**[2][3][12]. It is also involved in **intrathymic T-cell differentiation** and, by similarity, in **activity-dependent synapse formation of retinal ganglion cells**[3][5][7].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  The protein is primarily localized to the **cell membrane** as part of the **TCR-CD3 complex** on the surface of T-lymphocytes[2][5][9]. It is also found in the **cytoplasm** and within the **alpha-beta T cell receptor complex**[5][12].

**Protein Domains**

- **Signal Region:** Amino acids 1–21[2][5].
- **Transmembrane Region:** Amino acids 31–51[2][5].
- **Cytoplasmic Domain:** Contains multiple **ITAMs** critical for signal transduction[3][5][9].

**Known Interactions**

- **Protein-Protein Interactions:**  
  - Interacts with **Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)** and **Protein unc-119 homolog**[1].
  - At the immunological synapse, interacts with **CD81**, **ICAM1**, and **CD9**[3].
  - ITAMs in CD247 recruit and activate **ZAP70 kinase** following phosphorylation by **LCK** and **FYN** (Src family kinases)[3][5][9].

**Disease Associations**

- **Immunodeficiency 25:** Mutations or low expression of CD247 are linked to this condition, characterized by impaired T-cell function[3].
- **T-B+ Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID):** Defects in CD3δ, CD3ε, or CD3ζ (CD247) can cause this severe immunodeficiency[3].
- **General Immune Dysfunction:** Low CD247 expression impairs immune response, making individuals susceptible to infections and possibly affecting autoimmunity[1][3].

**Recent Developments and Latest Research (2023–2024)**

- While the search results do not provide specific 2023–2024 studies, current databases (GeneCards, UniProt, DrugBank) confirm ongoing interest in CD247’s role in immunodeficiency and T-cell signaling[3][5][9].
- The Human Protein Atlas and Ensembl report multiple transcript variants and associations with immune phenotypes, indicating active research into alternative splicing and functional diversity[10][13].

**Current Applications and Real-World Implementations**

- **Clinical Diagnostics:** CD247 expression is used as a biomarker for T-cell function in immunodeficiency disorders[3].
- **Therapeutic Targeting:** Modulation of CD247 or its signaling pathways is under investigation for immunotherapy and treatment of autoimmune diseases[3][5].

**Expert Opinions and Authoritative Analysis**

- CD247 is universally recognized as essential for **T-cell receptor signaling** and **adaptive immunity**[3][5][9].
- Its ITAM-rich cytoplasmic domain is a focal point for therapeutic intervention and research into T-cell activation mechanisms[3][5].

**Relevant Statistics and Data**

- **Protein Length:** 164 amino acids[1][5].
- **Molecular Weight:** ~18.7 kDa[1][5].
- **Gene Location:** Chromosome 1q22-q25, negative strand[1][13].
- **Transcript Variants:** At least two major isoforms; Ensembl reports 43 transcript variants[13].
