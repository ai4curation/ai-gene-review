## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene CD247 (P20963) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Introduction  
CD247, also known as the T-cell receptor **ζ chain** (CD3ζ), is a critical component of the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex on T lymphocytes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/919#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,provided%20by)). This gene encodes a 16 kDa transmembrane protein that, together with the TCR α/β or γ/δ heterodimer and the CD3γ, CD3δ, and CD3ε subunits, assembles into the eight-chain TCR-CD3 complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=The%20%CE%B1%2F%CE%B2%20T%20cell%20receptor,proteins%2C%20such%20as%20tyrosine%20protein)). In the assembled receptor, CD247 is present as a disulfide-linked **homodimer (ζζ)**, associating non-covalently with the other CD3 chains to form a complete receptor complex ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=capable%20of%20binding%20to%20an,are%20capable%20of%20being%20phosphorylated)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=one%20family%20%28Samelson%20et%20al,positioned%20in%20the%20short%20ectodomains)). Importantly, CD247 (CD3ζ) does not itself bind antigen; instead, it serves as a **signal-transducing subunit**, coupling antigen recognition by the TCR to intracellular signaling pathways ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/919#:~:text=The%20protein%20encoded%20by%20this,Expression)). Low or absent expression of CD247 impairs surface TCR complex expression and T-cell activation, underscoring its essential role in immune function ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). Indeed, a 2006 clinical report of a homozygous **CD247 mutation** in a child with immunodeficiency demonstrated that CD3ζ is absolutely necessary for normal T-cell development and function ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)).  

**Structure:** CD247 is a **single-pass type I membrane protein** with a very short extracellular region, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a long cytoplasmic tail ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20,2%3B%20Sequence%3DNot%20described)). The extracellular portion (~9 amino acids) is too short to bind ligands and mainly helps anchor the protein, while the transmembrane (TM) region is crucial for assembly of the TCR complex. The TM region of CD3ζ contains a conserved **aspartic acid residue** and a cysteine that are vital for TCR assembly: the two CD3ζ chains form a ζ–ζ homodimer via a TM cysteine bond, and their acidic TM residues pair with basic residues in the TCRα chain to stabilize the multi-subunit receptor complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=one%20basic%20TCR%CE%B1%20and%20two,modules%20involved%20in%20TCR%20signaling)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=similar%20to%20salt%20bridges%20,2002%20%2C%20%2021)). Structural studies (Call *et al.*, Cell 2006) revealed the ζζ dimer TM domain forms a left-handed coiled coil with polar contacts; mutating the critical polar residues disrupts ζζ dimerization and prevents proper TCR assembly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=one%20basic%20TCR%CE%B1%20and%20two,modules%20involved%20in%20TCR%20signaling)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=suggested%20that%20basic%20and%20acidic,18)). These interactions ensure that CD247 is incorporated into the TCR complex and expressed at the T cell surface. Consistently, T cells lacking functional CD247 have greatly reduced TCR-CD3 surface levels ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). CD247 is predominantly expressed in T cells (thymus and peripheral lymphocytes) and also in NK cells and some other immune cells as a signaling module ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20,ECO%3A0000269%7CPubMed%3A2470098)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=Subsequent%20studies%20demonstrated%20that%20a,10%3B%20%2025%20Kuster%20et)). Notably, certain activating receptors on **natural killer (NK)** cells can utilize CD3ζ as an adaptor; for example, the NK cell receptor **NKp46** and some other immunoreceptors pair with ζ homodimers (or the homologous FcRγ dimer) to transduce signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=Subsequent%20studies%20demonstrated%20that%20a,10%3B%20%2025%20Kuster%20et)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=stabilized%20%CE%B6%CE%B6%20dimer%20specifically%20interacts,and%20the%20osteoclast%20receptor%20OSCAR)). This reflects an evolutionarily conserved mechanism where CD247/ζ-family proteins serve as common signaling subunits for multiple leukocyte receptors.  

# Localization and Domain Features  
Within the cell, CD247 localizes to the **plasma membrane**, where it is an integral part of the TCR complex on the T-cell surface ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20,2%3B%20Sequence%3DNot%20described)). Its N-terminus lies outside the cell (but is extremely short), and the C-terminal tail resides in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic tail of each CD3ζ chain is unusually long (~113 amino acids) and contains **three Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs)** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L97%20including%20CD3%CE%B3%2C,Figure%C2%A01A)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=including%20CD3%CE%B3%2C%20CD3%CE%B4%20and%20CD3%CE%B5,Figure%C2%A01A)). Each ITAM is a conserved sequence with two tyrosine residues (consensus YxxL/I…YxxL/I) that becomes phosphorylated upon receptor activation. While the other CD3 proteins (γ, δ, ε) contain only a single ITAM each, CD3ζ uniquely carries **three ITAM motifs** in tandem ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=and%20the%20invariant%20CD3%CE%B3%2C%20%CE%B4%2C,receptor)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=including%20CD3%CE%B3%2C%20CD3%CE%B4%20and%20CD3%CE%B5,Figure%C2%A01A)). This makes CD247 the major signaling hub of the complex, contributing 6 of the 10 ITAM tyrosines in a TCRαβ-CD3 complex ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=and%20the%20invariant%20CD3%CE%B3%2C%20%CE%B4%2C,receptor)). The **multi-ITAM architecture** of CD247 is thought to provide both signal amplification and fine-tuning: it allows the binding of multiple signaling proteins and can modulate signal strength or even inhibitory signaling depending on how many ITAMs are engaged ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=singularity%20of%20the%20TCR,In%20this%20review%2C%20we)). Flanking the ITAMs are basic and acidic stretches that help dock cytosolic adaptors. For instance, the CD3ζ tail has poly-lysine regions and has been shown to bind to other signaling regulators (e.g. the Src-like adaptor protein, SLAP, which negatively regulates TCR signaling by binding CD3ζ ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=match%20at%20L285%20RP%20,CD3)) ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=RP%20%20%20FUNCTION%2C%20SUBCELLULAR,CD3))). CD247’s ITAM motifs also mediate interactions with SH2-domain proteins like the adapter **SHB** when phosphorylated ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20%20,ECO%3A0000269%7CPubMed%3A2470098)). In summary, the CD247 protein is designed to reside in the membrane as part of a receptor complex and use its cytosolic ITAM-rich tail as a **signaling scaffold**.  

# Signal Transduction Mechanism  
**Antigen Recognition to ITAM Phosphorylation:** When a T cell’s receptor engages antigenic peptide presented on MHC (pMHC) by an antigen-presenting cell, the CD247 chains initiate the intracellular signaling cascade. ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20,ITAMs%29%20in%20their%20cytoplasmic)) ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=domain,conversion%20into%20a%20catalytically%20active)) Because the TCR α/β heterodimer itself has virtually no cytoplasmic tail, it cannot signal on its own ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=The%20TCR,3)) ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=activation%20by%20recognizing%20antigens%20bound,3)). Instead, **CD247 and the other CD3 subunits serve as the signal-transducing subunits (“gatekeepers” of TCR signaling)** ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=%28MHC%29%20molecule.,3)) ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=complex%20the%20gatekeeper%20for%20T,3)). Upon TCR-pMHC binding, the co-receptor CD4 or CD8 associates with the complex and brings the Src-family kinase **Lck** to the vicinity of CD3ζ ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=allows%20T,containing%20proteins%20recruiting%20multiple%20downstream)). Lck (and a related kinase Fyn) phosphorylate the tyrosine residues within the ITAMs of CD3γ, δ, ε and especially the **three ITAMs of CD3ζ** ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CD3%20CC%20%20%20,PubMed%3A1384049%2C%20PubMed%3A1385158)). This phosphorylation happens on the inner side of the membrane and is one of the earliest TCR signaling events. The **phosphorylated ITAMs** on CD247 become docking sites for the tandem SH2 domains of the kinase **ZAP-70** ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=of%20CC%20%20%20,Additionally%2C%20participates%20in%20the%20activity)). In fact, the multiple phosphorylated tyrosines on a ζ–ζ dimer can recruit and activate multiple ZAP-70 molecules simultaneously ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=of%20CC%20%20%20,Additionally%2C%20participates%20in%20the%20activity)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=ITAM%20tyrosines%20recruit%20an%20inactivated,the%20TCR%20resulting%20in%20phosphorylation)). A seminal 1993 study showed that CD3ζ ITAM phosphorylation is required to recruit ZAP-70 and convert it into an active kinase ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=of%20CC%20%20%20,Additionally%2C%20participates%20in%20the%20activity)). Once ZAP-70 is docked to phospho-ζ, it is activated by Lck-mediated phosphorylation (as well as auto-phosphorylation) and triggers the next steps in the signaling cascade ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=ITAM%20tyrosines%20recruit%20an%20inactivated,the%20TCR%20resulting%20in%20phosphorylation)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=the%20dual%20SH2%20domain%20hematopoietic,and%20tyrosine%20phosphorylates%20several%20target)). Notably, because CD247 contains **three ITAMs**, it provides multiple tyrosine docking sites that can hold ZAP-70 in an optimal orientation for substrate phosphorylation ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=depending%20on%20the%20type%20of,in%20the%20activation%20of%20important)). This unique multivalent binding is thought to facilitate the efficient phosphorylation of downstream scaffold proteins immediately below the membrane. 

**Downstream Signaling Pathways:** Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates several target proteins, most critically the transmembrane adaptor **LAT** (Linker for Activated T cells) and the cytosolic scaffold SLP-76. Phospho-LAT in turn nucleates a large signalosome, recruiting PLCγ1, GRB2/SOS, Gads/SLP-76, PI3K, and other factors ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,ERK%20pathway%20and%20transcription%20factors)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=the%20dual%20SH2%20domain%20hematopoietic,and%20tyrosine%20phosphorylates%20several%20target)). Through these interactions, the TCR-CD247 signal branches into multiple well-characterized pathways. One branch involves **phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1)**, which gets activated and hydrolyzes PIP₂ to generate IP₃ and DAG. IP₃ triggers Ca^2+ release, leading to calcineurin activation and nuclear translocation of **NFAT** (a transcription factor), while DAG activates PKCθ and the **NF-κB** pathway ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,11)). Another branch signals via the GRB2/SOS complex to activate the **Ras–MAPK pathway**, culminating in activation of the ERK kinase cascade and the **AP-1** transcription factor ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,11)). Concurrently, **PI3K/Akt** signaling is engaged, promoting downstream mTOR activation and cell survival signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD3%CE%B7,T%20cell%20development%20and%20activation)). Altogether, CD247 signaling leads to the induction of transcriptional programs for T-cell proliferation, cytokine production (e.g. IL-2, IFN-γ), and effector differentiation ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,11)). These events drive the T cell from a resting state into a clonal expansion and functional state as part of the adaptive immune response. In terms of timing and assembly, CD3ζ’s multiple ITAMs allow a **multiphasic signaling response**: full engagement (phosphorylation of many ITAMs) results in robust activation, whereas partial or sequential ITAM phosphorylation can modulate the strength of signaling and even recruit negative regulators. For example, a singly phosphorylated ITAM can bind the phosphatase **SHP-1** instead of ZAP-70, potentially dampening the signal ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=of%20%CE%B6%20and%20CD3%20subunit,70)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=ITAM%20tyrosines%20recruit%20an%20inactivated,the%20TCR%20resulting%20in%20phosphorylation)). This built-in regulatory mechanism may help tune TCR responses to different antigen affinities. Current models suggest that the **quantity and pattern of CD3ζ ITAM phosphorylation** inform the T cell about stimulus strength, thereby affecting the decision between full activation, partial activation/anergy, or termination of the signal ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=singularity%20of%20the%20TCR,In%20this%20review%2C%20we)).  

# Biological Roles in T Cells  
**T-cell Development:** CD247 plays an indispensable role in thymus development of T cells. Experiments and clinical observations have shown that without functional CD3ζ chains, thymocytes cannot properly mature. In mice, CD247 is **required for successful thymocyte development**, particularly for transmitting signals from the pre-TCR and TCR that drive positive selection ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD247%2C%20also%20known%20as%20CD3%CE%B6%2C,isoforms%20individually%20and%20examined%20the)). Early thymic selection steps (β-selection at the double-negative stage and positive selection at the double-positive stage) rely on signals from the TCR–CD3 complex; thus a loss of CD3ζ impairs these critical developmental checkpoints. A 2024 study by Jin *et al.* introduced alternatively spliced variants of murine CD247 (called CD3ι, CD3θ, CD3η) to dissect the ζ-chain’s role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD247%2C%20also%20known%20as%20CD3%CE%B6%2C,isoforms%20individually%20and%20examined%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=for%20successful%20thymocyte%20development,to%20develop%20mature%20T%20cells)). These isoforms lack the full complement of ITAMs (the most extreme, CD3η, has the third ITAM truncated) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD247%2C%20also%20known%20as%20CD3%CE%B6%2C,isoforms%20individually%20and%20examined%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=for%20successful%20thymocyte%20development,to%20develop%20mature%20T%20cells)). Mice reconstituted with the CD3θ variant (missing part of the ζ tail) failed to produce mature T cells entirely ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=signaling%20pathways%20affected%20by%20CD3%CE%B7,expression%20and%20CD5%20expression%20was)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=transfer%20technique%20to%20express%20these,Peripheral)). The CD3η variant, with only two ITAMs, allowed some T cell development but caused severe impairments: thymocytes had reduced TCR levels and defective positive selection, evidenced by low CD5 expression and failure to mature from double-positive to single-positive T cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=reconstituted%20with%20CD3%CE%B8,significantly%20reduced%20activation%20of%20both)). These CD3η T cells that did reach the periphery showed abnormal activation states – with elevated markers of exhaustion and blunted signaling (PLCγ1 and Akt activation were significantly reduced) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD3%CE%B7,T%20cell%20development%20and%20activation)). In contrast, T cells with the normal full-length CD3ζ (three ITAMs) or the CD3ι variant (which apparently preserved signaling similarly to ζ) developed and activated normally ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=CD247%2C%20also%20known%20as%20CD3%CE%B6%2C,isoforms%20individually%20and%20examined%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10872740/#:~:text=transfer%20technique%20to%20express%20these,Peripheral)). This compelling evidence indicates that the **full-length CD247 cytoplasmic tail (with all three ITAMs)** is critical for proper thymic selection and for endowing T cells with full signaling capacity. Consistently, humans with CD247 mutations present with immunodeficiency: the 2006 case of a boy with a null CD3ζ mutation showed profoundly reduced T cell counts and TCR expression, confirming that **CD247 is necessary for human T-cell development** in vivo ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)) ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=homozygous%20germ,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). In summary, through its ITAM-mediated signals, CD247 ensures that only thymocytes with appropriate TCR signals survive selection and mature, shaping a functional T-cell repertoire. 

**T-cell Activation and Function:** In mature T lymphocytes, CD247 is fundamentally required for **TCR signal transduction** during an immune response. Upon antigen recognition, CD3ζ-mediated signaling triggers T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector cells (e.g. cytotoxic T cells or helper T subsets). The importance of CD247 is evident from loss-of-function scenarios: T cells that lack CD3ζ (or express drastically lower levels of it) exhibit **impaired activation** and cytokine responses ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/919#:~:text=with%20T,Expression)) ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). Even partial reduction of CD3ζ can dampen T-cell responsiveness. In patients with conditions of chronic immune stimulation, a peculiar phenomenon is observed where **CD247 expression is selectively downregulated** in T cells, while other CD3 subunits remain unchanged ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,and%20disease%20severity%20where%20traditional)). Studies in the early 2000s by Baniyash and colleagues showed that in chronic infections or inflammation (e.g. in persistent bacterial infections or cancer), T cells often lose CD3ζ protein, correlating with T-cell dysfunction ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,as%20a%20potential%20biomarker%20for)) ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=10.%20Bronstein,156)). The loss of CD3ζ leads to fewer ITAMs available and weaker signaling despite TCR engagement, contributing to a state of T-cell **anergy or exhaustion**. Notably, this effect is reversible: effective treatment of the underlying disease or inflammation can restore CD247 levels and T-cell responsiveness ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,as%20a%20potential%20biomarker%20for)). Because of this, CD247 has been proposed as a sensitive **biomarker of immune status** – a low CD3ζ level in peripheral T cells can indicate suppressed T-cell activity in chronic inflammatory diseases ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,as%20a%20potential%20biomarker%20for)). For example, CD247 mRNA or protein levels in T cells were reported as a prognostic immune marker in conditions like chronic infections, type 2 diabetes, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where they reflect the degree of T-cell suppression or disease severity ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,and%20disease%20severity%20where%20traditional)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880861/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,cell%20surface%20glycoprotein%20CD3%20zeta)). Mechanistically, CD3ζ downregulation in such contexts may result from continuous antigen exposure driving IFN-γ–dependent suppression of CD247 transcription and protein stability ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=10.%20Bronstein,156)). This highlights the central role of CD247 in T-cell effector function: when it is missing or modulated, T cells cannot properly transmit activation signals, which can lead to immunodeficiency or immune evasion by tumors/pathogens. 

Beyond T cells, as mentioned, CD247 contributes to the function of other immune cells like NK cells. NK cells do not express TCRs, but they use CD3ζ (and the related FcεRγ chain) as adapters for their own activating receptors. For instance, NK cells from mice lacking CD3ζ have defects in signaling through NKp46 and related receptors, affecting NK cell cytotoxicity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=Subsequent%20studies%20demonstrated%20that%20a,10%3B%20%2025%20Kuster%20et)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466601/#:~:text=stabilized%20%CE%B6%CE%B6%20dimer%20specifically%20interacts,and%20the%20osteoclast%20receptor%20OSCAR)). Moreover, CD247 has an intriguing role in the nervous system: studies in mice suggest that CD3ζ is expressed by retinal neurons and may be involved in activity-dependent synapse formation in the retina and brain (dLGN) ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=enzyme%20CC%20%20%20,By%20similarity)). This was unexpected and is an active area of investigation (the evidence comes from expression by similarity and functional studies in neuronal development). While the immunological function of CD247 is its primary role, such findings hint that **CD247 might have pleiotropic roles** beyond the immune system; however, these roles likely involve similar protein-protein signaling interactions and are under continued study. The predominant consensus is that CD247’s core function is as a **T-cell signal transducer**, and any additional roles still relate to its ability to mediate protein interaction cascades in cells. 

# Clinical Significance and Applications  
Given its essential role in T-cell activation, CD247 has significant clinical relevance. **Genetic defects** in CD247 cause severe immunodeficiency. The condition **Immunodeficiency 25 (IMD25)** is a rare autosomal recessive T-cell immunodeficiency caused by CD247 mutations ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CC%20%20%20%20,ECO%3A0000305)). Patients with IMD25 present with life-threatening infections due to T-cell dysfunction. In the reported CD247-deficient patient (with a CD3ζ truncation mutation), T cells were present but had **very low TCR expression and were unresponsive to stimulation**, leading to an inability to mount normal immune responses ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)) ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=homozygous%20germ,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). Interestingly, that patient’s blood contained two populations of T cells – one carrying the mutation with no TCR on the surface, and another population that had spontaneously “reverted” the mutation in somatic cells and regained TCR expression ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=homozygous%20germ,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)). The reverted T cells with restored CD3ζ provided partial immune function, highlighting how restoring CD247 rescues T-cell activity. This case not only underscores CD3ζ’s importance but also illustrates a unique rescue by somatic mosaicism. Apart from rare monogenic cases, **polymorphisms in CD247** have been investigated for links to immune-related diseases. Notably, a large multi-ethnic study in 2010s confirmed that certain genetic variants in CD247 associate with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20400699/#:~:text=activation%20and%20is%20associated%20with,that%20the%20allele%20of%20the)). Altered CD247 function or expression may thus contribute to the dysregulation of immune tolerance in autoimmunity. Such genetic studies reinforce that even subtle changes in CD3ζ-mediated signaling can tilt the balance between normal immunity and autoimmune disease.  

In **therapeutic applications**, CD247’s signaling domain has been leveraged in the design of T cell-based immunotherapies. The best example is **Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy** for cancer. CARs are synthetic receptors usually comprising an extracellular antibody-derived domain (for tumor antigen binding) fused to intracellular signaling domains from T-cell receptors. The CD3ζ chain’s **cytoplasmic tail (with its ITAMs)** is almost invariably used as the primary signaling module in CARs to trigger T-cell activation when the CAR binds a target ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=ITAM%20tyrosines%20recruit%20an%20inactivated,the%20TCR%20resulting%20in%20phosphorylation)). First-generation CARs included CD3ζ alone as the endodomain; modern CARs (second and third-generation) add co-stimulatory domains (like CD28 or 4-1BB) fused upstream of CD3ζ’s tail to enhance T-cell responses. The CD247 (ζ) chain is so central that tweaking its ITAM sequences can dramatically alter CAR T cell behavior. A recent 2024 study by Sadelain’s group systematically mutated the three ITAM tyrosines in CD3ζ to create CAR T cells with only proximal, intermediate, or distal ITAMs functional (termed ζ^111, ζ^222, ζ^333, respectively, denoting which tyrosines remain active) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=,abundant%20after%20tumor%20killing%2C%20indicating)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L336%20signaling%2C%20while,differences%20in%20signaling%20are%20due)). Strikingly, **CAR T cells with only the first ITAM (ζ^111)** showed **hyper-activation** – they degranulated faster and produced higher levels of cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α) upon encountering tumor cells ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=,abundant%20after%20tumor%20killing%2C%20indicating)). However, these ζ^111 CAR T cells also tended to proliferate less and became less abundant after killing targets, suggesting they were prone to overstimulation or exhaustion ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=,abundant%20after%20tumor%20killing%2C%20indicating)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=effector%20cytokines%20%28IFN%CE%B3%20and%20TNF%CE%B1%29,abundant%20after%20tumor%20killing%2C%20indicating)). In contrast, CAR T cells with only the third/distal ITAM active (ζ^333) had a **weaker activation profile** (lower immediate effector response) but maintained lower expression of exhaustion markers and better persistence in the long term ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=strength,proximal)). Meanwhile, the wild-type configuration (ζ^123 with all ITAMs) balanced these effects. This work demonstrates how the **ITAM multiplicity and sequence of CD3ζ can tune T-cell signaling strength, persistence, and fate**. It not only provides insights into TCR signaling thresholds but also guides CAR T therapeutic design – engineers can modify the CD247 intracellular domain to optimize CAR T cell potency versus longevity ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=signaling%2C%20while%20%CE%B6333%20CAR%20T,differences%20in%20signaling%20are%20due)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L336%20signaling%2C%20while,differences%20in%20signaling%20are%20due)). Other innovative approaches include genome editing of the CD247 locus: a 2023 study inserted costimulatory motifs (like TRAF2/3-binding motifs from 4-1BB) into the endogenous CD3ζ gene in T cells, so that natural TCR signals would deliver a built-in costimulatory signal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10083865/#:~:text=TRAF,into%20CD247%20locus%2C%20as%20it)). This enhanced T-cell activation and cytotoxicity, illustrating the potential of **CD247 as a chassis for improving immune cell therapies** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10083865/#:~:text=TRAF,into%20CD247%20locus%2C%20as%20it)).  

Finally, CD247 is being explored as a **pharmacodynamic biomarker** in immunotherapy and chronic disease management. For instance, in cancer patients or those on immune-modulating treatments, the level of CD3ζ in T cells (or NK cells) can indicate immune competence. Some studies suggest monitoring CD247 expression could help gauge T-cell recovery or exhaustion during treatments like checkpoint blockade or chronic infection therapy ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=Given%20the%20role%20of%20CD247%2FCD3Z,as%20a%20potential%20biomarker%20for)). In summary, CD247’s central role in TCR signaling has made it a target of interest both for understanding immunopathology (e.g. T-cell anergy in chronic disease) and for bioengineering new treatments (CAR T cells, TCR-engineered cells). Ongoing research in 2023–2024 continues to dissect how variations in CD3ζ signaling affect T-cell biology and how we can harness this knowledge in medicine ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L344%20fine,TCR%2C%20if%20any%2C%20remains%20unclear)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=fine,TCR%2C%20if%20any%2C%20remains%20unclear)). 

# Conclusion and Expert Perspectives  
**CD247 (TCR ζ chain)** is a cornerstone of T-cell receptor function, acting as the key signal-transducing subunit that links antigen recognition to T-cell activation. Its location on the T-cell surface as part of the TCR-CD3 complex and its tri-ITAM cytoplasmic tail enable it to recruit crucial tyrosine kinases and orchestrate downstream signaling pathways that culminate in T-cell proliferation and differentiation ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=CD3%20CC%20%20%20,PubMed%3A1384049%2C%20PubMed%3A1385158)) ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,11)). In essence, CD247 is the **molecular switch** that turns an extracellular TCR–peptide/MHC interaction into an intracellular activation program. Current understanding emphasizes that the multiple redundant-looking motifs in CD3ζ actually provide quantitative and qualitative tuning of T-cell responses ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=singularity%20of%20the%20TCR,In%20this%20review%2C%20we)). As reviewed by Love *et al.* (Front. Immunol. 2025), the TCR is unique in nature for containing ten ITAMs in its CD3 chains, and this structural singularity likely evolved to confer enhanced sensitivity and specificity to T-cell antigen recognition ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=The%20T%20cell%20antigen%20receptor,conducted%20over%20the%20past%20twenty)). Multiple models have been proposed wherein the CD3ζ ITAMs allow **signal discrimination, amplification, and even negative feedback** depending on the context ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=singularity%20of%20the%20TCR,In%20this%20review%2C%20we)). This nuanced control helps T cells respond appropriately to weak versus strong stimuli and avoid aberrant activation. Expert immunologists note that while the core pathways initiated by CD247 are known, the **fine regulation** (such as how partial ITAM phosphorylation might modulate outcomes) is still being elucidated ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=complexes%20consisting%20of%20the%20CD3,70%2F%CE%B6)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=effectors%20%28ZAP,only%20assessed%20recruitment%20of%20potential)). Cutting-edge research (2023–2024) is addressing these questions by combining structural biology, single-cell analysis, and synthetic biology (e.g. CAR T modifications) to map CD3ζ’s contributions more precisely ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=strength%20and%20to%20CAR%20T,1%2C2%2C3%29%2C%20the%20study%20revealed)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1563049/full#:~:text=,abundant%20after%20tumor%20killing%2C%20indicating)). 

In conclusion, CD247’s primary function is as a **transmembrane signaling adaptor** that is absolutely required for TCR signal initiation and T-cell-mediated immunity. It localizes to the immunological synapse upon T-cell activation and transmits signals that result in cellular activation, cytokine production, and target cell killing. Through its ITAM motifs, CD247 connects the TCR to pivotal signaling cascades (Lck/ZAP-70 → LAT → PLCγ1, Ras/MAPK, Akt, etc.), effectively making it the **focal point for T-cell activation** ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot:P20963#:~:text=of%20CC%20%20%20,Additionally%2C%20participates%20in%20the%20activity)) ([www.fortislife.com](https://www.fortislife.com/resources/antibody-resources/cd247-cd3z-the-gatekeeper-of-t-cell-activation#:~:text=site%20for%20protein%20kinase%20ZAP,11)). The importance of CD247 is highlighted by the severe immunodeficiency that occurs if it is absent ([www.institutimagine.org](https://www.institutimagine.org/fr/inherited-and-somatic-cd3zeta-mutations-patient-t-cell-deficiency-615#:~:text=A%20four,complex%20and%20bore%20the%20Q70X)), and by the fact that nature uses similar ζ-family chains to signal in other immune cells (NK cells, macrophages, etc.). From an applied standpoint, CD3ζ is not only a **marker of T-cell health** (often assessed in chronic infections, cancer, or autoimmune conditions) but also a **tool in immunotherapy** (as the signaling engine of CAR T cells and other engineered receptors). Continued research and clinical observations keep CD247 in focus, whether it’s understanding T-cell tolerance (where CD3ζ might be selectively down-modulated) or improving therapeutic T cells for better cancer treatment. As our understanding grows, CD247 remains a prime example of how a single gene product can have outsized influence on immune signaling and how manipulating its function can have broad therapeutic implications.
