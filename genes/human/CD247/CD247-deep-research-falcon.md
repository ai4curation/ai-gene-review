## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P20963
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain; AltName: Full=T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain; AltName: CD_antigen=CD247; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CD247; Synonyms=CD3Z, T3Z, TCRZ;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the CD3Z/FCER1G family. .
- **Key Domains:** CD3_zeta/IgE_Fc_rcpt_gamma. (IPR021663); Phos_immunorcpt_sig_ITAM. (IPR003110); T-cell_CD3_zeta. (IPR024128); ITAM (PF02189); TCR_zetazeta (PF11628)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CD247" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CD247' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CD247** (gene ID: CD247, UniProt: P20963) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human CD247 (CD3 zeta; UniProt P20963)

Verification of target identity and scope
- Identity: CD247 encodes the T‑cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD3ζ, also called TCRζ), an invariant ITAM‑bearing signaling subunit of the TCR–CD3 complex. Multiple recent sources explicitly treat CD3ζ as the canonical T‑cell activation chain and as the intracellular activation module used in CARs, aligning with UniProt P20963 annotations (ITAM motifs; CD3Z/FCER1G family). The organism is human in the referenced clinical/structural literature, and mechanistic principles are conserved across mammals (mouse structural data are compared to human cryo‑EM). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found. (brudno2024cartcells pages 1-3, brudno2024cartcells pages 18-22, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 15-16)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Complex and composition. The αβ TCR associates with CD3γε and CD3δε heterodimers and a CD3ζζ homodimer to form the signaling‑competent TCR–CD3 complex. CD3ζ is a short extracellular/transmembrane subunit with a long cytoplasmic tail containing three ITAMs that initiate signaling upon phosphorylation. (Natarajan 2024 EMBO Reports, Nov 7, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00314-3; Briones 2024 JACI, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2024.06.019) (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 1-2, briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 4-7)
- Localization. CD3ζ resides in the plasma membrane as a ζζ homodimer within the TCR–CD3 transmembrane bundle; its juxtamembrane/cytoplasmic regions bear ITAMs that are substrates for Src‑family kinases. Cholesterol helps maintain the resting arrangement of the ectodomains; mechanical coupling to CD3ζ juxtamembrane regions has been implicated in activation. (EMBO Reports, 2024) (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 15-16, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 21-22)
- Signaling role. Upon antigen engagement, Lck phosphorylates CD3 ITAM tyrosines. Phospho‑ITAMs recruit ZAP‑70 via tandem SH2 domains, propagating downstream signaling (calcium influx, MAPK, etc.). This canonical initiation step is consistently described across recent analyses. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; ArXiv dissertation, 2025) (majumdar2025theimpactof pages 9-9, mullerkirschbaum2025mechanismsoftcell pages 20-23)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- In situ extracellular arrangement. Natarajan et al. used genetically encoded photo‑crosslinkers and docking to define an in situ TCR–CD3 ectodomain arrangement at the cell surface that largely mirrors recent cryo‑EM structures. A one‑sided organization places CD3γε and CD3δε on the same face of the TCR, proposing an ordered CD3ε′–CD3γ–CD3ε–CD3δ arrangement around the TCR. The study reports minimal extracellular rearrangement upon activation by pMHC/activating antibodies and emphasizes cholesterol dependence. Publication: EMBO Reports, Nov 7, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00314-3. (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 7-8, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 8-11, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 13-15, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 4-5)
- CD3ζ juxtamembrane behavior. The same work compiles evidence that pMHC tetramers can loosen αβTCR association with CD3ζ and discusses open/closed conformations of CD3ζζ juxtamembrane regions, highlighting potential mechanical coupling to intracellular activation. (EMBO Reports, 2024) (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 15-16, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 1-2, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 21-22)
- Human genotype–phenotype. Briones et al. (JACI, Oct 2024) identified heterozygous nonsense CD247 mutations truncating ITAM‑containing regions (e.g., p.Q101X, p.Y152X). Using CRISPR CD247‑knockout and WT Jurkat models, they showed ITAM‑truncating variants reduce surface TCR in an ITAM‑number‑dependent manner (reconstitution to ~60% with 1 ITAM, ~22% with 0–1, ~10% with 0 vs WT in KO cells) and act dominant‑negatively in WT cells, with ~25–50% reductions in CD69 induction. Clinically, carriers showed immune dysregulation with incomplete penetrance. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2024.06.019 (published Oct 2024). (briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 1-4, briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 10-12, briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 12-14)
- CAR signaling calibration via ITAM identity. Majumdar et al. (Frontiers in Immunology, Jan 16, 2025; doi:10.3389/fimmu.2024.1509980) engineered CARs with three copies of individual CD3ζ ITAMs (zAAA, zBBB, zCCC) and found graded signaling strength (AAA > BBB > CCC). zCCC configurations yielded weaker signaling, reduced exhaustion, and favored persistence‑linked phenotypes in vitro, supporting that ITAM sequence identity—not just count—modulates CAR signal strength. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1509980. (majumdar2025theimpactof pages 1-2, majumdar2025theimpactof pages 9-9)
- CAR tonic signaling and costimulation. A 2024 review synthesizes how the CD3ζ module within second‑generation CARs can associate with additional CD3ζ‑containing proteins and become spontaneously phosphorylated, contributing to tonic signaling; CD28.ζ CARs exhibit more conventional exhaustion signatures relative to 4‑1BB.ζ CARs, with implications for persistence. Frontiers in Immunology, Feb 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1335424. (smirnov2024recentadvanceson pages 6-7)

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- CAR‑T architecture and clinical landscape. JAMA (Dec 2024) reports six FDA‑approved CAR‑T products for hematologic malignancies (B‑ALL, large B‑cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, multiple myeloma). The intracellular activation domain is typically CD3ζ, with CD28 or 4‑1BB as costimulatory domains. URL: https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.19462 (Dec 2024). Quantitative outcomes reported include: 4‑year OS improvement in large B‑cell lymphoma (54.6% vs 46.0% vs standard chemo+transplant); pediatric ALL durable remissions with 48% alive and relapse‑free at 3 years; in multiple myeloma, PFS 13.3 vs 4.4 months vs standard therapy. Adverse event ranges across products: CRS in ~40–95%; neurologic toxicity (ICANS) in ~15–65%. (brudno2024cartcells pages 1-3, brudno2024cartcells pages 18-22, brudno2024cartcells pages 22-23)
- Design implications of CD3ζ. The predominance of CD3ζ as the activation module in approved/clinical CARs reflects its robust ITAM‑mediated initiation of signaling. Ongoing engineering efforts tune ITAM multiplicity/sequence (e.g., “1XX” or ITAM‑restricted variants) to modulate signal strength, aiming to balance efficacy, exhaustion, and persistence. (JAMA 2024; Frontiers in Immunology 2024/2025) (brudno2024cartcells pages 1-3, smirnov2024recentadvanceson pages 6-7, majumdar2025theimpactof pages 1-2)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural immunology perspective. The EMBO Reports 2024 in situ mapping argues that extracellular TCR–CD3 subunit rearrangements upon engagement are limited, with membrane context (cholesterol) stabilizing a one‑sided arrangement; this stresses that activation likely couples mechanical/biophysical changes across the membrane to CD3ζ juxtamembrane/ITAM accessibility, rather than large ectodomain re‑orientations. (EMBO Reports, 2024) (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 13-15, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 15-16)
- Translational immunoengineering. Reviews emphasize that CD3ζ’s ITAMs are central nodes for calibrating CAR signaling; CD28.ζ designs yield stronger acute signaling but higher exhaustion risk, whereas 4‑1BB.ζ designs tend to favor persistence. The identification of spontaneously phosphorylated ζ‑associated species in some CAR contexts underscores the need to manage tonic signaling via binder stability, surface charge, and ζ‑module configuration. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024) (smirnov2024recentadvanceson pages 6-7)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Human mutation functional data. In vitro reconstitution with ITAM‑truncated CD247 variants showed surface TCR rescue to ~60% (1 ITAM), ~22% (fewer), and ~10% (none) in CD247‑KO Jurkat cells, and dominant‑negative reductions to ~39%, ~19%, and ~9% in WT Jurkat; CD69 induction fell by ~25–50% vs WT. (JACI, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2024.06.019) (briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 1-4)
- CAR‑T clinical metrics. Six FDA‑approved CAR‑T products; 4‑year OS 54.6% vs 46.0% for large B‑cell lymphoma; pediatric ALL 3‑year relapse‑free survival 48%; multiple myeloma PFS 13.3 vs 4.4 months vs standard; CRS ~40–95%, ICANS ~15–65% (ranges across products). (JAMA, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.19462) (brudno2024cartcells pages 1-3, brudno2024cartcells pages 22-23)
- ITAM identity effects in CARs. ITAM‑restricted CARs (zAAA/zBBB/zCCC) showed graded signaling strength and exhaustion propensities, with zCCC weaker signaling and less exhaustion in vitro, supporting “signal attenuation for persistence” strategies. (Frontiers in Immunology, Jan 16, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1509980) (majumdar2025theimpactof pages 1-2)

Functional mechanism of CD247 in TCR signaling (concise pathway)
- Engagement of peptide–MHC by αβTCR occurs in the context of a one‑sided CD3 ectodomain arrangement stabilized by membrane cholesterol. Lck phosphorylates CD3ζ ITAMs (and other CD3 ITAMs), generating tandem‑SH2 docking sites for ZAP‑70. Activated ZAP‑70 triggers LAT/SLP‑76 complexes, leading to Ca2+ influx and downstream transcriptional programs. Changes at the CD3ζ juxtamembrane regions (open/closed states) and potential loosening of αβTCR–ζ association upon multimeric pMHC engagement integrate mechanical and biochemical cues for activation. (EMBO Reports, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; ArXiv dissertation, 2025) (natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 15-16, natarajan2024insitucellsurface pages 1-2, majumdar2025theimpactof pages 9-9, mullerkirschbaum2025mechanismsoftcell pages 20-23)

Clinical and translational significance
- CD247 deficiency and immune dysregulation. Null CD247 alleles can cause severe T‑cell immunodeficiency; recent human data show that heterozygous nonsense variants truncating ITAMs exert dominant‑negative effects on TCR expression/function, with incomplete penetrance but measurable signaling defects in primary T‑cell assays. These findings reinforce the essentiality of CD3ζ ITAMs for TCR signaling and have implications for genetic diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies. (JACI, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2024.06.019) (briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 4-7, briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 1-4, briones2024nonsensecd247mutations pages 12-14)
- CAR‑T engineering. The near‑universal use of CD3ζ as the activation domain in approved CAR‑T products reflects its efficacy; however, engineering of ITAM number/sequence (e.g., 1XX‑like attenuation or ITAM identity swaps) is a promising lever to reduce tonic signaling/exhaustion while preserving cytotoxicity and persistence. (JAMA, Dec 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2024/2025) (brudno2024cartcells pages 1-3, smirnov2024recentadvanceson pages 6-7, majumdar2025theimpactof pages 1-2)

Conclusion
Human CD247 (CD3ζ) is the principal ITAM‑bearing activation module of the TCR–CD3 complex and the dominant activation domain in clinical CAR‑T architectures. Recent in situ structural mapping consolidates a one‑sided extracellular arrangement for CD3 subunits and emphasizes membrane context and CD3ζ juxtamembrane mechanics in activation. Human genetic evidence underscores the nonredundant importance of CD3ζ ITAMs for TCR expression and signaling, with dominant‑negative effects of truncating variants. Translationally, tuning CD3ζ ITAM content/sequence is a key strategy for balancing CAR‑T potency and persistence, while clinical data reaffirm the substantial efficacy—and recognized toxicities—of CD3ζ‑based CAR‑T therapies in hematologic cancers.
