description: CD247 encodes the zeta chain (CD3ζ) of the T cell receptor complex, a 164-amino acid type I transmembrane protein that serves as the principal signaling component of the TCR-CD3 complex. CD3ζ forms disulfide-linked homodimers and contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in its cytoplasmic domain - more than any other TCR component. Upon TCR engagement with peptide-MHC, Lck phosphorylates the six ITAM tyrosines, creating docking sites for ZAP-70 kinase tandem SH2 domains. Activated ZAP-70 then phosphorylates LAT adaptor, initiating downstream Ras-ERK, PLCγ1-calcium, PKC-NF-κB, and NFAT pathways. The cytoplasmic tail contains a basic-rich stretch (BRS) that binds membrane phosphoinositides, sequestering ITAMs until ligand-induced conformational change releases them for phosphorylation. CD3ζ also participates in Fc-gamma receptor III (CD16) signaling in NK cells. Mutations cause severe combined immunodeficiency; downregulation in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes contributes to cancer immune evasion.
