description: >-
  VBP1 (von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1, also known as PFDN3) encodes an
  alpha-type subunit of the heterohexameric prefoldin complex. The prefoldin complex
  is a jellyfish-shaped molecular chaperone composed of two alpha subunits (PFDN3/VBP1
  and PFDN5) and four beta subunits (PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN4, PFDN6). Prefoldin functions
  as a co-chaperone/holdase that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides -- primarily
  actin and tubulin -- and delivers them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin for ATP-dependent
  folding. VBP1 was originally identified through its binding to pVHL (the von
  Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor), and as part of the prefoldin complex it helps
  prevent pVHL aggregation and supports its maturation, thereby contributing to
  HIF-alpha degradation. Beyond its canonical cytoplasmic role, prefoldin has nuclear
  functions influencing transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing.
  VBP1 is ubiquitously expressed and located on the X chromosome.

      evidence from Drosophila (FB:FBgn0264694), yeast (SGD:S000003310), Arabidopsis,
      C. elegans, and human VBP1 itself. The prefoldin complex is a cytoplasmic
      chaperone that operates in the cytosol to capture unfolded nascent polypeptides
      and deliver them to the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT (PMID:9630229). Liang
      et al. 2020 (PMID:32699605) describe prefoldin as "a cytoplasmic chaperone
      protein." The term "cytoplasm" is appropriately broad, as a more specific CC
      annotation to "prefoldin complex" (GO:0016272) is already present. Having both

      2022). However, "protein stabilization" typically implies maintaining a folded

    complex that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin) and

    jellyfish-shaped prefoldin architecture. Cryo-EM structural data show VBP1 as chain 3
    in the PFD-TRiC supra-chaperone complex. The prefoldin-TRiC interaction enhances
    protein folding rates and suppresses non-productive reaction cycles. Disrupting this
    interaction in vivo leads to accumulation of toxic amyloid aggregates.
