description: >-
  ACAD9 (Complex I assembly factor ACAD9, mitochondrial) is a dual-function protein that
  serves as both a mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I (CI) assembly factor and an
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme. Its primary physiological role is as a core component of
  the mitochondrial complex I intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex, where it partners with
  ECSIT and NDUFAF1 to mediate assembly of the ND2 membrane-arm module of CI. ECSIT binding
  triggers a conformational change and deflavination of ACAD9, switching it from an FAO enzyme
  to a CI assembly factor. As a secondary/moonlighting function, ACAD9 retains FAD-dependent
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity toward long-chain (and some medium-chain) fatty acyl-CoA
  substrates (EC 1.3.8.7, 1.3.8.8), catalyzing the first step of mitochondrial fatty acid
  beta-oxidation. Disease-causing mutations in ACAD9 result in isolated CI deficiency (MC1DN20),
  not primary fatty acid oxidation defects, underscoring the primacy of its assembly role.
  ACAD9 is a homodimer localized to the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

      ACAD9 is a bona fide acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, belonging to the ACAD family and retaining
      catalytic activity for the alpha,beta-dehydrogenation of fatty acyl-CoA substrates. The IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically inferred and well-supported by direct biochemical data from
      multiple publications (PMID:16020546, PMID:34646991, PMID:38086790). This is an appropriate
      level of specificity for the IBA evidence code.

      ACAD9 has experimentally demonstrated acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Purified ACAD9 shows
      dehydrogenation activity of 83 min-1 with palmitoyl-CoA as substrate (PMID:34646991). The
      IBA annotation at the general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase level is appropriate given phylogenetic

    label: fatty acid beta-oxidation
  evidence_type: IDA

  review:
    summary: >-
      ACAD9 catalyzes the first step of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, the
      alpha,beta-dehydrogenation of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates. This specific
      biological process term is not currently annotated but is more precise than the existing
      GO:0006631 (fatty acid metabolic process) and GO:0001676 (long-chain fatty acid metabolic
      process) annotations.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      ACAD9 directly catalyzes the first step of the beta-oxidation cycle. The existing BP
      annotations (GO:0006631 fatty acid metabolic process, GO:0001676 long-chain fatty acid
      metabolic process) are correct but the more specific fatty acid beta-oxidation term is
      warranted given the direct experimental evidence. This is ACAD9's secondary core function.

    Primary function. ACAD9 is a core component of the MCIA complex, functioning as a
    protein-macromolecule adaptor that bridges ECSIT (and through ECSIT, NDUFAF1) to CI assembly
    intermediates. ECSIT binding triggers deflavination and a conformational switch from FAO enzyme
    to assembly factor. Disease mutations causing CI deficiency (MC1DN20) underscore this as the
    essential role.

    Secondary/moonlighting function. ACAD9 retains FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity
    (EC 1.3.8.8) toward long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates, catalyzing the first step of
    mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Its activity is approximately 18% that of VLCAD. This
    function is mutually exclusive with the CI assembly role (ECSIT binding causes deflavination).
    ACAD9's FAO role is particularly relevant in tissues where it is the main long-chain ACAD, such
    as the CNS.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the relative abundance of ACAD9 in its FAO (holo, FAD-bound) vs. CI assembly
    (apo, ECSIT-bound) states in different human tissues? Current understanding is based
    primarily on in vitro reconstitution, and the relative partitioning between FAO and
    assembly functions in vivo remains poorly quantified.

- question: >-
    Is there evidence that ACAD9 FAO function contributes to disease severity in ACAD9
    deficiency, beyond the CI assembly defect? Schiff et al. 2015 suggested both CI assembly
    and FAO enzyme activity contribute to disease severity, but the relative contribution
    remains debated.

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Quantitative proteomics to measure the fraction of ACAD9 in ECSIT-bound (assembly) vs.
    free (FAO-competent) states across human tissues, especially brain regions. This would
    clarify the in vivo partitioning of ACAD9 between its two mutually exclusive functions.

        3.0 A cryo-EM structure of ACAD9-ECSIT complex revealed a 15-residue ECSIT peptide
        (res 320-334) that inserts at the junction of ACAD9 dehydrogenase and vestigial domains.
        ECSIT binding induces a 10 A gatekeeper loop movement in ACAD9, releasing FAD. ECSIT
        phosphorylation downregulates its association with ACAD9 and is reduced upon amyloid-beta
        exposure.
