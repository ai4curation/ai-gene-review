### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O43181
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=Complex I-18 kDa; Short=CI-18 kDa; AltName: Full=Complex I-AQDQ; Short=CI-AQDQ; AltName: Full=NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 18 kDa subunit; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NDUFS4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the complex I NDUFS4 subunit family.
- **Key Domains:** NADH_UbQ_FeS_4_mit-like. (IPR006885); NDUFS4-like_sf. (IPR038532); NDUS4 (PF04800)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NDUFS4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NDUFS4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NDUFS4** (gene ID: NDUFS4, UniProt: O43181) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human NDUFS4 (UniProt O43181)

Plan overview
- We verified the identity of the target (NDUFS4, UniProt O43181) in Homo sapiens and aligned nomenclature, structure, family placement, and localization with recent structural literature. We then prioritized 2023–2024 primary papers and authoritative reviews to detail function, pathways, localization, recent advances (cryo-EM, immune and organ-specific findings), and translational developments. Finally, we consolidated quantitative data and embedded a summary artifact for rapid reference (URLs and dates included where available).

1) Key concepts, definitions, and current understanding
- Identity and localization. NDUFS4 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron–sulfur protein 4) is an ~18 kDa supernumerary subunit of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) localized on the matrix-facing side at the interface between the NADH dehydrogenase module (N-module) and the quinone reduction module (Q-module). Human NDUFS4 contains a canonical PKA site at Ser131, and its structural elements act as a rivet that helps anchor the N-module to the rest of the enzyme while lying within ~8–12 Å of multiple Fe–S clusters (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4). These placements explain how NDUFS4 can influence stability and catalysis despite not being a catalytic core subunit (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)
- Primary function within Complex I. As an accessory subunit, NDUFS4 contributes to Complex I stability, assembly maturation, and proper positioning/dynamics of the N-module relative to the membrane domain; by bridging N- and Q-modules and interacting near Fe–S sites, it helps sustain efficient NADH-to-ubiquinone electron transfer and overall enzyme stability rather than catalyzing a distinct reaction itself (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)
- Cellular compartment. NDUFS4 functions in the mitochondrial inner membrane as part of Complex I, with the polypeptide oriented toward the matrix-facing hydrophilic arm (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Cryo-EM structural and assembly insights. High-resolution analyses in the Ndufs4−/− mouse reveal that loss of NDUFS4 destabilizes attachment of the N-module and prevents normal maturation: knockout complexes lack NDUFA12 in all visualized classes and adopt distinct assembly states where either the assembly factor NDUFAF2 remains bound or NDUFS6 is incompletely associated—consistent with NDUFAF2 recruiting the N-module late in assembly and being displaced during maturation by NDUFS4/NDUFS6/NDUFA12 (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint version, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). Quantitatively, intact Complex I abundance was reduced by ~50% in Ndufs4−/− tissues, with BN-PAGE consistently showing ~1 MDa (WT) and, in knockout, ~800 kDa “QP” and ~200 kDa N-module species, and with substantially reduced NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in the knockout preparations (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 22-25, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 11-12, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-16, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 16-19)
- Blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Contrary to expectations from acute pharmacological Complex I inhibition models, 1-month-old Ndufs4−/− mice exhibit preserved BBB structure and function: systemic AAV9-GFP (5.0×10^13 vg/kg) poorly transduced the brain in both genotypes, and Evans blue extravasation and endogenous albumin assays showed no increased permeability (Evans blue absorbance 0.049 ± 0.002 in Ndufs4−/− vs 0.053 ± 0.003 in controls; p>0.05). Vascular architecture (3D clearing, histology) and junctional protein levels were comparable to controls (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828). The authors note these conclusions apply to early disease and do not exclude later-stage changes (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828). (reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 2-4, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 4-7, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 1-2, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 10-12)
- Cardiac electrophysiology and oxidative stress. In germline Ndufs4−/− mice, mitochondrial/total ROS rose markedly during ex vivo hypoxia–reoxygenation and correlated with progression to high-degree AV block and sinus node dysfunction. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTempo abolished MitoSOX/DCFDA signals, restored sinus rhythm, and—together with SS-31 (elamipretide)—significantly extended lifespan with chronic treatment (Antioxidants, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051001). Mechanistic proposals include ROS-mediated or NAD+/Sirt1-dependent modulation of Nav1.5 (INa) affecting conduction (Antioxidants, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051001). (chen2023mitochondrialoxidativestress pages 8-10)
- Kidney and cristae remodeling. In diabetic mouse models, podocyte-specific overexpression of Ndufs4 improved cristae morphology, mitochondrial dynamics, and albuminuria, and proximity labeling connected NDUFS4 to the cristae-shaping factor STOML2, nominating NDUFS4 as a regulator of cristae status in this context (Nature Communications, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46366-w). (serranolorenzo2023developmentofa pages 14-15)
- Mitochondria transfer-based therapies. Intercellular/exogenous mitochondria transfer reduced morbidity and mortality in Ndufs4−/− models, supporting organelle replacement as a candidate therapeutic approach for Leigh syndrome (Nature Metabolism, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-024-01125-5). (nakai2024mitochondriatransferbasedtherapies pages 24-25)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- CNS gene therapy context. AAV-mediated CNS gene replacement in OXPHOS-deficient mouse models (e.g., Complex I subunit Ndufs3 or Complex IV Cox10 conditional knockouts) extended survival from ~5–6 months to >15 months, with extensive phenotypic rescue despite transducing ~30% of neurons. These results illustrate that partial neuronal correction can yield outsized benefit and frame feasibility for gene therapy strategies in mitochondrial encephalopathies (EMBO Molecular Medicine, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00111-4). Although not an Ndufs4 therapy per se, they contextualize AAV-based approaches for Complex I deficiencies including NDUFS4-related disease (EMBO Molecular Medicine, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00111-4). (reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 2-4)
- Small-molecule and physiological interventions. In Complex I–deficient/Leigh models, several strategies have shown benefit in preclinical settings, including chronic hypoxia and mTOR inhibition; both have been reported to ameliorate features of Ndufs4−/− disease (reported in structural and cardiac studies that reference these interventions) (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; Antioxidants, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051001). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, chen2023mitochondrialoxidativestress pages 8-10)
- BBB targeting implications. Because the BBB appears intact at early disease stages in Ndufs4−/− mice, gene and drug delivery to the CNS may require vectors or routes that bypass the barrier (e.g., serotypes or direct administration), rather than relying on disease-related permeability (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828). (reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 1-2, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 2-4, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 4-7)

4) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Consensus gene–disease curation. An expert panel curated 113 primary mitochondrial disease genes for the Leigh syndrome spectrum, underscoring the robustness of gene–disease assertions that include NDUFS4 among established nuclear Complex I causes (Annals of Neurology, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26716). (serranolorenzo2023developmentofa pages 4-5)
- Structural biology perspective on assembly. Recent cryo-EM–based analyses propose a late-stage maturation mechanism in which NDUFAF2 initially recruits and stabilizes the N-module; subsequent incorporation of NDUFS4, NDUFS6, and NDUFA12 displaces NDUFAF2 to yield the mature, fully assembled Complex I. The NDUFS4 β-hairpin and contacts with NDUFS6/NDUFA12 appear to be critical for this transition (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 16-19)
- Immunology and metabolism (models). Work in Ndufs4−/− macrophage cell lines shows that Complex I deficiency skews effector functions toward pro-inflammatory responses and increases phagocytic capacity, supporting tissue- and cell-type–specific consequences of NDUFS4 loss that may contribute to systemic disease (PLOS ONE, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291442). (serranolorenzo2023developmentofa pages 14-15, serranolorenzo2023developmentofa pages 4-5)

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent studies)
- Complex I abundance and activity in Ndufs4−/− tissues: ~50% reduction of intact Complex I, with BN-PAGE revealing ~1 MDa (wild type) versus ~800 kDa (QP subcomplex) and ~200 kDa (N-module) species in the knockout, and substantially lower NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in purified knockout Complex I (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 11-12, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-16, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 16-19)
- BBB permeability in 1-month-old Ndufs4−/− mice: Evans blue absorbance 0.049 ± 0.002 (Ndufs4−/−) vs 0.053 ± 0.003 (controls), p>0.05; systemic AAV9 (5.0×10^13 vg/kg) yielded rare brain GFP+ cells in both genotypes, consistent with intact BBB and limited vector access at this dose (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828). (reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 4-7, reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 2-4)
- Cardiac electrophysiology rescue by mitochondrial antioxidants (model): Ex vivo MitoTempo abolished MitoSOX/DCFDA signals and restored normal sinus rhythm; continuous treatment with MitoTempo or SS-31 significantly extended lifespan in Leigh syndrome mice (Antioxidants, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051001). (chen2023mitochondrialoxidativestress pages 8-10)

Mechanistic consequences of NDUFS4 loss and pathway placement
- Assembly, stability, and electron transfer. NDUFS4 anchors the N-module at the N–Q interface and is essential for transitioning from an assembly-factor–stabilized intermediate (with NDUFAF2 bound) to a mature enzyme containing NDUFS4/NDUFS6/NDUFA12. Loss of NDUFS4 leads to insufficient retention/incorporation of NDUFA12, compositional heterogeneity with retained assembly factor (NDUFAF2) or altered NDUFS6, loosening of the N-module, and markedly decreased NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity—all consistent with a primary role in complex I assembly and stability rather than direct catalytic chemistry (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 22-25, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 11-12, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 16-19)
- Tissue- and cell-type–specific phenotypes. In hearts, Ndufs4 loss perturbs conduction under stress via mitochondrial ROS, with antioxidant therapies restoring rhythm and improving survival; in podocytes, Ndufs4 overexpression enhances cristae structure and function in diabetic kidney disease; in macrophages, Ndufs4 knockout decreases respiration and shifts inflammatory responses—together highlighting that NDUFS4 impacts both bioenergetics and organelle ultrastructure with context-dependent outcomes (Antioxidants, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12051001; Nature Communications, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46366-w; PLOS ONE, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291442). (chen2023mitochondrialoxidativestress pages 8-10, serranolorenzo2023developmentofa pages 14-15)
- CNS pathology and BBB. Early-stage BBB integrity appears preserved in Ndufs4−/− mice, implying that neurodegeneration and lesions in this model (a hallmark of Leigh syndrome) may not require overt BBB breakdown and that delivery of therapeutics to the brain is likely to demand BBB-aware strategies (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828).

Verification of gene/protein identity and domain/family alignment
- The reviewed literature consistently matches the UniProt-specified target: human NDUFS4 (O43181), a supernumerary 18 kDa Complex I subunit (CI-18 kDa/AQDQ), matrix-facing at the N–Q interface, with a PKA site (Ser131) and proximal to Fe–S clusters, belonging to the Complex I NDUFS4 subunit family (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; preprint, Jul 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284). No conflicting gene-symbol usage was identified for Homo sapiens in these sources, and the structural/functional assignments align with known NDUFS4 family features (supernumerary complex I subunit) (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4).

- ROS phenotypes may be tissue/context dependent: while some preclinical tissues/cells show increased ROS with Ndufs4 loss, direct respiratory-membrane/Complex I measurements in certain preparations did not show large ROS increases even as turnover decreased—highlighting the importance of model and assay conditions (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-16, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 11-12).
- BBB findings currently apply to young Ndufs4−/− mice; later disease stages and other LS genotypes require evaluation before generalizing preserved barrier integrity (IJMS, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094828) (reynauddulaurier2024theblood–brainbarrier pages 9-10).
