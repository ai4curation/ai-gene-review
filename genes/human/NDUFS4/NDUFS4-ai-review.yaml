description: NDUFS4 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4) is an
  18 kDa accessory (supernumerary) subunit of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone
  oxidoreductase). It is not a catalytic core subunit but plays a critical structural
  and regulatory role, acting as a rivet that anchors the N-module to the Q-module
  at the matrix-facing side of the enzyme. NDUFS4 is essential for the late-stage
  maturation of Complex I, where its incorporation (together with NDUFS6 and NDUFA12)
  displaces the assembly factor NDUFAF2 to yield the fully assembled, catalytically
  competent enzyme. Loss of NDUFS4 leads to destabilization and partial loss of
  the N-module, substantially reduced NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, and
  is the most common nuclear-encoded Complex I gene cause of Leigh syndrome (MC1DN1).
  NDUFS4 also contains a PKA phosphorylation site at Ser-173 (Ser-131 in the mature
  form), through which cAMP signaling can regulate Complex I activity. The protein
  is a component of the iron-sulfur fragment of Complex I, localized to the mitochondrial
  inner membrane on the matrix side.

      is essential for assembly and stability of a functional Complex I that carries

      reduced NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (PMID:11181577, PMID:16478720)

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation inferred from logical inference based on GO:0008137 (NADH
      dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity). Complex I couples electron transfer from
      NADH to ubiquinone with proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial
      membrane. While NDUFS4 is in the N-module (hydrophilic arm) rather than the
      proton-pumping membrane arm, the complex as a whole carries out proton transmembrane
      transport. As an accessory subunit essential for Complex I function, NDUFS4
      contributes to this activity indirectly.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is acceptable as a broader process annotation for a Complex I
      subunit. While NDUFS4 is not directly in the proton-pumping domain, the complex
      as a whole performs proton transmembrane transport, and NDUFS4 is essential for
      a functional complex. The IEA inference from the complex-level MF is reasonable.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning models for ROS metabolic process.
      Complex I is a major source of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. However,
      NDUFS4 loss (which abolishes Complex I activity) actually prevented ROS production
      in one study (PMID:16478720), contrasting with the NDUFS1 mutant which showed
      increased ROS. The relationship between NDUFS4 and ROS is complex and context-dependent.
      The deep research report also notes that ROS phenotypes may be tissue/context
      dependent.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While Complex I is a well-established source of ROS, the relationship
      between NDUFS4 specifically and ROS is indirect and context-dependent. NDUFS4 loss
      can either increase or decrease ROS depending on conditions (PMID:16478720). ROS
      metabolism is a secondary consequence of Complex I dysfunction, not a core function
      of NDUFS4. Consistent with the IMP annotation to the same term.

      motive force by pumping protons across the inner membrane, which drives ATP
      synthase (Complex V). NDUFS4 is not directly involved in proton pumping or ATP
      synthesis but is essential for Complex I function. This annotation is somewhat
      indirect for an accessory subunit that resides in the hydrophilic arm rather
      than the proton-pumping membrane domain.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While technically accurate that loss of NDUFS4 impairs proton motive force
      generation (because it collapses Complex I), this annotation is more of a downstream
      consequence than a direct function of NDUFS4. The primary role of NDUFS4 is
      in Complex I assembly and stability, not directly in ATP synthesis. Keeping as
      non-core reflects that this is an indirect contribution.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation based on Piccoli et al. (2006). This study found that a
      missense genetic defect in the NDUFS4 subunit suppressed Complex I activity
      and prevented ROS production, while cAMP-dependent activation of Complex I was
      associated with reduced ROS accumulation. Notably, the NDUFS4 mutation decreased
      ROS rather than increasing it, in contrast to the NDUFS1 mutant. This shows
      NDUFS4 mutations alter ROS metabolism, but the direction of effect depends on
      context.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While NDUFS4 mutations do affect ROS metabolism, this appears to be a
      secondary consequence of Complex I dysfunction rather than a direct function
      of NDUFS4. The relationship is complex since NDUFS4 loss can either increase
      or decrease ROS depending on the tissue and conditions. This is not a core function
      but a downstream phenotypic consequence.

    summary: IMP annotation with contributes_to qualifier based on Papa et al. (2004).
      The study showed that NDUFS4 mutations impair Complex I assembly and thus NADH
      dehydrogenase activity. The contributes_to qualifier is appropriate because
      NDUFS4 is an accessory subunit that does not directly catalyze the reaction

      NDUFS4 does not directly catalyze NADH oxidation but is essential for the assembly

    summary: IMP annotation based on Papa et al. (2001), who showed that mutation in
