## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P38646
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stress-70 protein, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.6.4.10 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18632665, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25615450, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30933555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31177526}; AltName: Full=75 kDa glucose-regulated protein; Short=GRP-75; AltName: Full=Heat shock 70 kDa protein 9; AltName: Full=Heat shock protein family A member 9; AltName: Full=Mortalin; Short=MOT; AltName: Full=Peptide-binding protein 74; Short=PBP74; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HSPA9 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:5244}; Synonyms=GRP75, HSPA9B, mt-HSP70 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:18632665};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Chaperone_DnaK. (IPR012725); Heat_shock_70_CS. (IPR018181); HSP70_C_sf. (IPR029048); HSP70_peptide-bd_sf. (IPR029047)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HSPA9" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HSPA9' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HSPA9** (gene ID: HSPA9, UniProt: P38646) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification summary
- Verified identity: The target is human HSPA9 (aliases: GRP75, mortalin, mtHsp70, PBP74, HSP75), a mitochondrial Hsp70-family chaperone encoded in Homo sapiens. Reviews explicitly describe these aliases, a mitochondrial targeting sequence, and mitochondrial localization, with reported extra‑mitochondrial pools under specific conditions (e.g., stress/complement) (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 1-2, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-11).

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and family: HSPA9 encodes the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone known as mortalin/GRP75/mtHsp70. It belongs to the Hsp70 family, with canonical N-terminal ATPase and C‑terminal substrate-binding domains typical of Hsp70s. A review details its aliases, mitochondrial targeting sequence, and role in mitochondrial protein quality control (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 1-2, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10). Functionally, mortalin cooperates with mitochondrial J‑proteins and NEFs analogous to other Hsp70 systems (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10). Mortalin can redistribute beyond mitochondria (including plasma membrane accumulation) under certain stresses such as complement attack, indicating regulated extra‑mitochondrial pools (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-11).
- Catalytic activity: As an Hsp70, HSPA9 is an ATP‑dependent chaperone (EC 3.6.4.10), cycling between ATP- and ADP-bound states to capture/release unfolded polypeptides; kinetic/structural characterizations of human mortalin support this chaperone mechanism (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- PAM import motor and mitochondrial protein import: A 2024 mini‑review on disease-causing mutations in the TIM23/PAM system emphasizes that mitochondrial Hsp70 (mortalin/HSPA9) is “the heart of the PAM complex,” providing the import motor function. It highlights regulation of mtHsp70 ATPase activity by PAM J‑protein regulators Tim14 (Pam18/DNAJC15/19) and Tim16 (Pam16/Magmas), and connects these components to human disease (Genes, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121534) (jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 7-8).
- Iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster biogenesis: A 2024 review focusing on viral Fe–S proteins summarizes the mammalian ISC pathway, explicitly stating that HSPA9 (mitochondrial Hsp70) with its J‑domain cochaperone HSC20/HSCB facilitates transfer of Fe–S clusters from the ISCU scaffold to recipient proteins; HSC20 recognizes LYR‑motif clients and directly interacts with ISCU (Inorganics, Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).
- Translational pharmacology updates around Hsp70/mortalin inhibition: Reviews spanning 2023–2024 catalog mortalin‑targeting strategies and preclinical agents, noting the historical mitochondrial-targeted Hsp70 inhibitor MKT‑077 (Phase I in the 1990s) and newer analogs, while underscoring remaining gaps in specificity and toxicity (Cancers, Oct 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16203470) (kaushal2024syntheticandnatural pages 16-17, hong2022analogsofthe pages 13-13).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Clinical translation of Hsp70/mortalin inhibitors: The cationic rhodacyanine MKT‑077, which accumulates in mitochondria and binds Hsp70 family proteins, reached a Phase I trial in chemo‑resistant solid tumors (Annals of Oncology, 1999; cited within Hong et al. 2022, Int J Mol Sci; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031063). Medicinal chemistry efforts produced next‑generation analogs (e.g., JG‑98/JG‑231) with preclinical efficacy in tumor models (Int J Mol Sci, 2022; URL above) (hong2022analogsofthe pages 13-13). Contemporary reviews summarize broader mortalin‑targeting agents (natural and synthetic) and emphasize the need for improved selectivity and delivery before widespread clinical use (Cancers, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16203470) (kaushal2024syntheticandnatural pages 16-17).
- Functional cancer applications: Reviews synthesize evidence that mortalin is upregulated in several cancers and linked to EMT, stemness, and poor prognosis in certain contexts, supporting its use as a biomarker and a therapeutic target in oncology pipelines (Front. Cell Dev. Biol., Feb 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1028519) (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-10, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Expert perspective on PAM and disease: The Genes (2024) analysis frames mtHsp70 as central to the mitochondrial presequence import motor and catalogs disease mutations across PAM/TIM23, highlighting how perturbations of mHsp70 regulation by DNAJC family co‑chaperones contribute to pathology—an expert synthesis aligning mechanistic biochemistry with human genetics (jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 7-8).
- Expert synthesis on Fe–S assembly: The Inorganics (2024) review by Fe–S specialists details the mammalian ISC machinery and specifically assigns HSPA9/HSCB the role of cluster delivery from ISCU to clients, offering authoritative mechanistic context applicable to human physiology and disease (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).
- Broad chaperone/mortalin role in disease: Recent reviews collate multi‑organism and multi‑system data linking mortalin to cancer biology, neurodegeneration, stress responses, and extracellular vesicle biology, underscoring its pleiotropic yet mechanistically grounded roles (Front. Cell Dev. Biol., 2023; Cancers, 2024) (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-10, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-11, kaushal2024syntheticandnatural pages 16-17).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Genetic disease links and phenotypes: The PAM/TIM23-focused report synthesizes multiple patient cohorts with HSPA9 mutations. It notes distinct pathogenic variants in HSPA9 linked to congenital sideroblastic anemia and EVEN‑PLUS syndrome, including truncating insertion and in‑frame deletions that lower mRNA/protein levels and target the ATPase domain (residues 1–360), with clinical findings such as anemia, iron overload, and developmental malformations (Genes, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121534) (jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 12-13, jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 7-8). While the article is a mini‑review that compiles case-level statistics, it provides concrete mutation examples and associated phenotypes that illustrate disease burden.
- Cancer pharmacology data: The 2022 preclinical study reports that JG‑series analogs of MKT‑077 suppress medullary thyroid carcinoma cells in vitro and in xenografts; these data illustrate measurable anti‑tumor effects and support mechanism‑guided inhibitor optimization (Int J Mol Sci., 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031063) (hong2022analogsofthe pages 13-13).

Biological mechanism and pathway integration
- Mitochondrial protein import via PAM: HSPA9 (mtHsp70/mortalin) performs the ATP‑driven pulling/unfolding action that drives translocation of presequence‑containing proteins across the inner membrane, functioning as the core of the presequence translocase‑associated motor (PAM). Its ATPase cycle is regulated by J‑domain proteins Tim14 (Pam18/DNAJC15/19) together with Tim16 (Pam16/Magmas), aligning mtHsp70 activity with import demands (Genes, 2024) (jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 7-8).
- Fe–S cluster biogenesis (ISC pathway): Within the mitochondrial ISC system, nascent clusters assembled on ISCU are delivered to client apoproteins by a dedicated chaperone/co‑chaperone pair—HSPA9 with HSCB/HSC20—where HSCB binds LYR‑motif clients and ISCU and, together with HSPA9, transfers clusters in an ATP‑dependent manner. This function mechanistically places HSPA9 at a critical intersection of mitochondrial metabolism and genome maintenance pathways (Inorganics, 2024) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).

Subcellular localization
- Primary localization: HSPA9 predominantly resides in the mitochondrial matrix where it supports protein import and proteostasis; reviews describe an N‑terminal targeting sequence and extensive mitochondrial roles (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 1-2).
- Extra‑mitochondrial redistribution: Under complement attack, mortalin can relocalize from mitochondria to the plasma membrane; mortalin also participates in extracellular processes including modulation of complement‑mediated cytotoxicity, illustrating context‑dependent trafficking beyond the matrix (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-11).

Disease associations and mechanisms
- Inherited disease: HSPA9 pathogenic variants cause congenital sideroblastic anemia and EVEN‑PLUS syndrome; mechanistically, these mutations impair the ATPase domain or reduce protein abundance, consistent with loss of mitochondrial chaperone function (Genes, 2024) (jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 12-13, jain2024hotspotsfordiseasecausing pages 7-8).
- Cancer: Mortalin overexpression is associated with pro‑tumor phenotypes (EMT, stemness, resistance), and is proposed as a prognostic biomarker in multiple cancers. Mechanistically, mitochondrial chaperone functions and extra‑mitochondrial interactions (e.g., p53 binding and complement interactions) contribute to oncogenic programs (Front. Cell Dev. Biol., 2023) (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-10, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 10-11).

Translational landscape: inhibitors, trials, and implementations
- Historical clinical experience: MKT‑077, a mitochondria‑accumulating Hsp70‑family ligand, advanced to Phase I in solid tumors, establishing feasibility but revealing safety limitations (cited within Hong et al., 2022; Int J Mol Sci.; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031063) (hong2022analogsofthe pages 13-13).
- Next‑generation Hsp70/mortalin modulators: JG‑series MKT‑077 analogs show preclinical potency in thyroid cancer models, and contemporary reviews catalog additional natural/synthetic mortalin inhibitors under investigation, while emphasizing unresolved issues of specificity, off‑target toxicity, and delivery (Int J Mol Sci., 2022; Cancers, 2024; URLs above) (hong2022analogsofthe pages 13-13, kaushal2024syntheticandnatural pages 16-17).

Notes on gene/protein identification and domain/family alignment
- The literature consistently refers to mortalin as the mitochondrial Hsp70 encoded by HSPA9, with aliases GRP75, mtHsp70, and PBP74 consistent with the UniProt entry provided. Its classification in the Hsp70 family and role as an ATP‑dependent chaperone strongly aligns with the ATPase NBD and peptide‑binding domain architecture typical for Hsp70s (esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 1-2, esfahanian2023mortalinproteinpartners pages 9-10).

Limitations and open questions
- While multiple reviews and preclinical studies robustly place HSPA9 at the center of mitochondrial import and Fe–S biogenesis, specific structural details for human HSPA9 complexes and comprehensive clinical datasets for HSPA9‑selective inhibitors remain limited in the cited 2023–2024 literature. Further primary studies clarifying regulation by GRPEL1/2 in human systems and advancing clinical programs for mortalin‑directed agents are needed.
