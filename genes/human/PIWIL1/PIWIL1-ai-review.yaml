description: 'PIWIL1 (Piwi-like protein 1/HIWI) is a germline-specific Argonaute family protein that binds piRNAs (24-32nt) to form effector ribonucleoprotein complexes mediating transposon silencing and gene regulation in male germ cells. Essential for spermatogenesis, PIWIL1 possesses RNA endonuclease activity through its PIWI domain, localizes to cytoplasmic granules including chromatoid bodies, and is aberrantly expressed in various cancers as a cancer-testis antigen.'
