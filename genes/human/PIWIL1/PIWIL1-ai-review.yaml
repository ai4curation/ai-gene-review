description: PIWIL1 (Piwi-like protein 1/HIWI) is a germline-specific Argonaute family
  protein that binds piRNAs (24-32nt) to form effector ribonucleoprotein complexes
  mediating transposon silencing and gene regulation in male germ cells. Essential
  for spermatogenesis, PIWIL1 possesses RNA endonuclease activity through its PIWI
  domain, localizes to cytoplasmic granules including chromatoid bodies, and is aberrantly
  expressed in various cancers as a cancer-testis antigen.

  review:
    summary: PIWIL1 is predominantly cytoplasmic, localizing to chromatoid bodies
      and other cytoplasmic granules. While some nuclear presence cannot be excluded,
      the overwhelming evidence shows cytoplasmic localization, particularly in germ
      cell-specific granules. UniProt and multiple studies confirm cytoplasmic localization.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PIWIL1 is a cytoplasmic protein, not nuclear. UniProt states "Cytoplasm"
      (ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JMB7) and the deep research confirms it localizes to
      cytoplasmic structures like chromatoid bodies and intermitochondrial cement.
      Unlike PIWIL4 which has nuclear functions, PIWIL1 remains cytoplasmic to execute
      its piRNA-guided functions.

  review:
    summary: PIWIL1 binds piRNAs to mediate gene silencing, particularly of transposable
      elements. This is a core function supported by extensive literature showing
      PIWIL1-piRNA complexes silence transposons through post-transcriptional cleavage
      and directing DNA methylation. The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic
      evidence.

    reason: This represents a core function of PIWIL1. The protein forms piRNA-guided
      effector complexes that mediate transposon silencing through both post-transcriptional

    summary: While PIWIL1 is part of RISC-like complexes that can mediate translational

    reason: Peripheral function. While PIWIL1 may contribute to translational regulation
      of some mRNAs in germ cells and is a component of RISC complexes that mediate

      provides no functional information. PIWIL1 has many specific, functionally important
      protein interactions that should be captured with more precise terms or in interaction
      databases, not with this generic GO term.

core_functions:
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0034584
    label: piRNA binding
  description: PIWIL1 directly binds 24-32nt piRNAs through PAZ and MID domains, forming
    effector ribonucleoprotein complexes essential for transposon silencing and gene
    regulation in male germ cells.
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0004521
    label: RNA endonuclease activity
  description: PIWIL1 possesses slicer activity through its conserved PIWI domain
    with DDH catalytic motif, cleaving target RNAs complementary to bound piRNAs for
    post-transcriptional gene silencing.
proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: regulation of histone-to-protamine replacement
  proposed_definition: Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of
    the replacement of histones with protamines during spermiogenesis.
- proposed_name: RNF8 sequestration
  proposed_definition: The process of binding and retaining RNF8 ubiquitin ligase
    in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear translocation.
suggested_questions:
- question: What determines the timing of PIWIL1 degradation during spermiogenesis?
  experts:
  - reproductive biologists
  - ubiquitin system experts
- question: Does human PIWIL1 participate in ping-pong amplification of piRNAs?
  experts:
  - piRNA pathway experts
  - small RNA biologists
- question: What is the functional significance of PIWIL1 expression in cancer cells?
  experts:
  - cancer biologists
  - cancer-testis antigen experts
suggested_experiments:
- experiment_type: Proximity labeling proteomics
  hypothesis: PIWIL1 interacts with additional proteins involved in chromatin remodeling
    during spermiogenesis
  description: Use BioID or APEX2 to identify PIWIL1 interactors specifically during
    late spermatid stages
- experiment_type: piRNA sequencing
  hypothesis: Human PIWIL1-bound piRNAs have distinct sequence features compared to
    other PIWI proteins
  description: IP-seq of PIWIL1 from human testis to characterize bound piRNA populations
- experiment_type: Degradation timing analysis
  hypothesis: PIWIL1 D-box mutations affect protein half-life in specific spermatogenic
    stages
  description: Use pulse-chase labeling or cycloheximide chase in spermatogenic cell
    cultures to measure PIWIL1 stability
