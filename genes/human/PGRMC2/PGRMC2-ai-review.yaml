description: >-
  PGRMC2 (Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 2) is an intracellular heme
  chaperone belonging to the cytochrome b5 family MAPR subfamily. Despite its
  historical name suggesting progesterone receptor function, PGRMC2 primarily
  functions as a reversible heme-binding protein that delivers labile heme from
  the ER to the nucleus, where it regulates heme-responsive transcription factors
  such as Rev-Erba and BACH1. PGRMC2 localizes to the ER and nuclear envelope,
  interacts with nucleoporin ALADIN (AAAS), and plays roles in adipose tissue
  development, thermogenesis, and reproductive physiology.
