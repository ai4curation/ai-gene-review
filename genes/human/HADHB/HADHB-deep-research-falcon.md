## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P55084
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Trifunctional enzyme subunit beta, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=TP-beta; Includes: RecName: Full=3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; EC=2.3.1.155 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7958339, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8135828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8163672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8651282}; EC=2.3.1.16 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:1550553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7958339, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8135828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8163672, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8651282}; AltName: Full=Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase; AltName: Full=Beta-ketothiolase; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HADHB; ORFNames=MSTP029;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thiolase-like superfamily. Thiolase family.
- **Key Domains:** Thiolase. (IPR002155); Thiolase-like. (IPR016039); Thiolase_acyl_enz_int_AS. (IPR020615); Thiolase_AS. (IPR020610); Thiolase_C. (IPR020617)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HADHB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HADHB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HADHB** (gene ID: HADHB, UniProt: P55084) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target identity before analysis. HADHB (UniProt P55084) encodes the beta subunit of mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) in Homo sapiens. TFP catalyzes the last three reactions of long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation; the HADHB-encoded subunit carries the long-chain 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA thiolase activity and belongs to the thiolase family. Recent work explicitly describes human TFP as an α/β multienzyme complex with HADHB providing thiolase activity, aligning with the UniProt record and thiolase-domain family membership (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report
Title: Human HADHB (P55084) — mitochondrial trifunctional protein beta subunit: function, pathways, localization, and recent advances (2023–2024)

1. Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and complex: HADHB encodes the β-subunit of mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP), the long-chain 3-ketoacyl‑CoA thiolase component of the long-chain fatty acid β‑oxidation pathway. TFP is an α/β multimer; contemporary structural/functional reports commonly depict a 2α:2β heterotetramer, with interdependence of α (HADHA) and β (HADHB) subunits for stability and activity (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5).
- Enzymatic activities and specificity: The β-subunit mediates thiolytic cleavage of long‑chain 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA to produce acyl‑CoA shortened by two carbons plus acetyl‑CoA, i.e., the terminal step of one β‑oxidation cycle. This is the long-chain 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA thiolase activity (LKAT; EC thiolase annotations), acting on long-chain 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA substrates within the TFP complex (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887; Oct 2019, Nat Commun; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12482-1) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2, miklas2019tfpahadhaisrequired pages 3-3).
- Cellular localization: TFP functions on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane, where long‑chain FAO proteins associate with and influence respiratory-chain supercomplexes; the LCHAD moiety of HADHA interacts with the matrix-arm NADH‑binding domain of complex I, situating the complex at the inner membrane–matrix interface (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12).
- Pathway context: HADHB participates in the long-chain fatty acid β‑oxidation spiral and, through TFP’s α-subunit and MLCLAT‑1 splice variant, connects FAO to cardiolipin (CL) remodeling of the inner mitochondrial membrane, influencing OXPHOS supercomplex organization and bioenergetics (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887; Oct 2019, Nat Commun; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12482-1) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 2-3, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2, miklas2019tfpahadhaisrequired pages 3-3).

2. Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Cardiolipin remodeling and bioenergetics in TFP deficiency: A 2024 JCI Insight study of patient fibroblasts and a βTFP mouse model reported universal reductions in total cardiolipin (CL), genotype- and sex-dependent increases in monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), and a negative correlation between oxidized CL species and mitochondrial respiration. MLCL/CL ratios were modestly elevated in human fibroblasts (~1.4-fold in females; ~3.8-fold in males), whereas male βTFP mice showed ~16-fold MLCL/CL and high cardiac fibrosis incidence, linking altered CL homeostasis to bioenergetic dysfunction and cardiomyopathy risk (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 15-16, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 5-7, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12).
- Genotype effects on complex stability and FAO: Truncating HADHA/HADHB alleles reduce α/β subunit abundance and MLCLAT-1, while some missense variants retain near-normal protein levels but impair FAO flux and respiration. Structural modeling indicates several HADHB missense changes (e.g., p.P294R, p.N389D, p.F430S) perturb thiolase catalytic geometry or substrate pockets, explaining reduced LKAT activity (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5).
- Protein interactors/regulators: In human liver cells, the mitochondrial chaperone CLPX physically associates with HADHA/HADHB and negatively regulates FAO; CLPX knockdown increases β‑oxidation, and co‑immunoprecipitation of TFP subunits with CLPX changes upon glucagon treatment (Oct 2023, J. Biol. Chem.; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105210) (suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 11-14, suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 7-11). A 2024 preprint reports that the mitochondrial selenoprotein SelO hydrolyzes NAD+/NADH to NMN/NMNH and AMP, interacts with the TFP complex, and inhibits lipid β‑oxidation as a feedback mechanism coupling matrix pH/NAD status to FAO (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5137152/v1) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 20-21).
- Clinical spectrum updates: Adult-onset HADHB-related TFP deficiency presenting with higher brain dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy with gadolinium-enhancing white matter lesions has been described, expanding the phenotype beyond classic infantile presentations (Jun 2023, Frontiers in Neurology; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2023.1187822) (ishikawa2023casereportmitochondrial pages 5-5).
- Diet monitoring and implementation: A 2024 report summarized dietary intake and plasma acylcarnitine data among LCHADD/TFPD participants, illustrating real-world monitoring for metabolic control and therapy adjustment (2024; https://doi.org/10.6083/bpxhc43711) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5).

3. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic profiling: Newborn screening and follow-up acylcarnitine profiling detect long-chain FAO disorders, including TFP deficiency. In TFP/LCHAD deficiency, characteristic profiles include reduced C16-OH and altered long‑/medium‑chain species; functional FAO assays in fibroblasts quantify reduced long‑chain oxidation flux (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 5-7). 
- Disease management: Dietary therapy—restriction of long-chain fats, provision of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), and carnitine as indicated—is standard care; real-world cohort monitoring of diet and plasma acylcarnitines supports individualized management (2024; https://doi.org/10.6083/bpxhc43711) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5). 
- Mechanistic targeting of mitochondrial lipids: The emerging link between TFP and cardiolipin remodeling motivates evaluation of cardiolipin-stabilizing agents; oxidized CL elevations correlate with reduced respiration, suggesting lipid‑protective strategies may rescue bioenergetics (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 15-16, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12).
- Research tools and biomarker development: Coimmunoprecipitation and perturbation of CLPX or SelO provide experimental levers to modulate FAO and study TFP regulation in hepatocytes and other cell types (Oct 2023, JBC; Oct 2024 preprint) (suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 11-14, suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 7-11, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 20-21).

4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- TFP as a nexus between FAO and OXPHOS: Integrative evidence indicates TFP sits at the inner membrane–matrix interface, physically and functionally coupling long-chain FAO to respiratory supercomplexes via cardiolipin remodeling and direct interactions with complex I. This provides a mechanistic basis for secondary OXPHOS defects in primary FAO disorders and explains tissue‑specific vulnerability (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 20-21). 
- Cardiolipin abnormalities as disease modifiers: Genotype- and sex‑dependent changes in MLCL/CL and oxidized CL species likely modulate clinical severity and organ involvement; male βTFP mice show dramatic MLCL/CL increases and cardiac fibrosis, highlighting potential sex hormones or lipid remodeling enzymes as modifiers (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 15-16). 
- Regulation by mitochondrial proteostasis and NAD metabolism: CLPX appears to organize FAO multi‑protein assemblies and restrain β-oxidation in hepatocytes, whereas SelO’s NAD hydrolysis may provide a pH/NAD‑linked brake on FAO. Together, these findings suggest that beyond genetic lesions, mitochondrial chaperones and redox enzymes acutely tune TFP activity in physiology and disease (Oct 2023, JBC; Oct 2024 preprint) (suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 11-14, suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 7-11, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 20-21).

5. Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- FAOD epidemiology: Long-chain FAO disorders collectively affect on the order of 1:9,000 births (~400/year in the United States), underscoring the public health relevance of accurate screening and management (Sep 2024, JCI Insight; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2).
- Quantitative lipid remodeling and bioenergetics: In patient fibroblasts with TFP/LCHAD deficiency, MLCL/CL ratios increase modestly (~1.4× females; ~3.8× males), and oxidized CL species increase with negative correlation to respiration; in βTFP male mice, MLCL/CL rises ~16× with frequent cardiac fibrosis (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 15-16).
- Functional deficits: FAO flux can be severely reduced (examples down to ~9% of control in specific genotypes), alongside decreases in maximal respiration and spare capacity, especially under glucose‑limited conditions (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.176887) (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5).

Conclusions
HADHB encodes the thiolase subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, a matrix‑side inner‑membrane–associated multienzyme complex essential for long-chain β‑oxidation. Recent work links TFP dysfunction to cardiolipin remodeling defects, oxidized phospholipid accumulation, and secondary bioenergetic compromise. 2023–2024 studies identify regulatory proteins (CLPX, SelO) that physically associate with TFP and modulate FAO, expanding therapeutic hypotheses beyond diet alone. Clinical observations emphasize a broad spectrum from infantile metabolic crises to adult‑onset neuropathy with CNS imaging abnormalities; contemporary cohort monitoring demonstrates ongoing, real‑world dietary management anchored by plasma acylcarnitine analytics. Together, these data refine our mechanistic and translational understanding of HADHB in human physiology and disease (neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 1-2, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 15-16, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 5-7, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 10-12, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 3-5, suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 11-14, suzuki2023clpxregulatesmitochondrial pages 7-11, neto2024mitochondrialbioenergeticsand pages 20-21, ishikawa2023casereportmitochondrial pages 5-5).
