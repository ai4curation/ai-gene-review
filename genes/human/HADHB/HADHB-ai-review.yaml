description: >-
  HADHB encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP/TFP),
  a heterotetrameric complex (alpha2-beta2) that catalyzes the last three steps of
  long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. The beta subunit specifically possesses ONLY
  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity (EC 2.3.1.155, 2.3.1.16), while the alpha subunit
  (HADHA) carries the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities.
  The complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it processes
  long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates (C10-C16). Mutations in HADHB cause mitochondrial
  trifunctional protein deficiency type 2 (MTPD2), an autosomal recessive disorder
  characterized by cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.

      This IBA annotation correctly assigns acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase activity to HADHB.
      The beta subunit possesses 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity, which includes this
      acetyltransferase function. PMID:8135828 demonstrated that "Expression of this cDNA

      Should the Reactome annotations for hydratase and dehydrogenase reactions be

  - question: >-
      What is the functional significance of HADHB's RNA binding activity detected
      in interactome capture studies (PMID:22658674)?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Confirm that isolated recombinant HADHB (beta subunit alone) lacks hydratase
      and dehydrogenase activities to definitively rule out any residual activity.
    hypothesis: >-
      Recombinant HADHB expressed alone will have no detectable enoyl-CoA hydratase
      or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, confirming these are HADHA-specific.
  - description: >-
      Investigate whether the RNA binding by HADHB detected in PMID:22658674 has
      any regulatory significance for fatty acid metabolism.
    hypothesis: >-
      RNA binding by HADHB may represent a moonlighting function that links
      metabolic state to post-transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism genes.
