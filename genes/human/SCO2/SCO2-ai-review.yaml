  SCO2 (Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2) is a copper metallochaperone essential for
  the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV). It is an inner mitochondrial membrane
  protein with a thioredoxin-like fold and a conserved CXXXC copper-binding motif. SCO2
  functions within a redox-sensitive copper relay module together with SCO1 and COA6 to
  deliver copper to the CuA site of the mtDNA-encoded COX2 subunit. SCO2 also acts as a
  thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase that regulates the redox state of cysteines in SCO1 during
  COX2 maturation. Importantly, SCO2 is an assembly factor for Complex IV, NOT a structural
  subunit of the complex. Mutations cause fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy with
  Complex IV deficiency (MC4DN2), and variants are also associated with autosomal-dominant
  high-grade myopia (MYP6). SCO2 is a transcriptional target of TP53 (p53), linking
  mitochondrial respiration to tumor suppression.

    summary: >-
      SCO2 is a well-established assembly factor for mitochondrial Complex IV
      (cytochrome c oxidase). The IBA phylogenetic inference is strongly supported
      by the conserved function of SCO proteins from yeast to human. SCO2 participates
      in the CuA-site assembly of COX2, a core step of CIV biogenesis (PMID:15229189,
      PMID:19336478, PMID:25959673). The founding disease paper (PMID:10545952)
      identified SCO2 as a COX assembly gene through mutations causing COX deficiency.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly is the core biological process
      of SCO2. This IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive experimental evidence
      from multiple organisms and is at the correct level of specificity. SCO2 functions
      specifically in the CuA-site assembly step of COX2 maturation within the broader
      CIV assembly pathway.

      that SCO proteins have regulatory roles in the maintenance of cellular copper
      homeostasis, providing some support for this annotation. However, SCO2's primary

      homeostasis. The copper homeostasis role is secondary and context-dependent.

      This IDA annotation from Leary et al. (2009) reports that SCO2 acts as a
      thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase for SCO1. Specifically, the paper demonstrates
      that SCO2 regulates the redox state of the copper-coordinating cysteines in
      SCO1, and that overexpression or knockdown of SCO2 alters the ratio of oxidized
      to reduced cysteines in SCO1. However, the paper specifically states that SCO2
      acts to OXIDIZE the copper-coordinating cysteines in SCO1 (thiol-disulfide
      oxidoreductase), whereas GO:0015035 (protein-disulfide reductase activity) is
      defined as reduction of disulfide bonds. The directionality of the redox
      reaction may be more nuanced than the GO term captures. More recent reviews

      The myofibril localization is surprising for a mitochondrial inner membrane
