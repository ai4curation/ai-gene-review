description: >-
  ERVMER34-1 encodes HEMO (Human Endogenous MER34 ORF), an ancient endogenous retroviral
  envelope protein that entered mammalian genomes over 100 million years ago. Unlike
  functional retroviral envelope proteins, HEMO has lost fusogenic capacity due to
  absence of the canonical furin cleavage site and hydrophobic fusion peptide. The
  protein exists as both a membrane-bound type I transmembrane protein and a secreted
  form (48 kDa) released by metalloproteinase cleavage. HEMO is expressed primarily
  in placental trophoblasts, pluripotent stem cells, and various tumors (particularly
  squamous cell carcinomas). The secreted form circulates in blood at highest levels
  during early pregnancy (1-10 nM in first trimester). HEMO retains a putative
  immunosuppressive domain (ISD) characteristic of gamma-type retroviral envelope
  proteins and interacts with BACE2, an interaction acquired specifically in the
  primate lineage through mutations that also eliminated fusogenic capacity.
  Expression in tumors is associated with Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation,
  particularly CTNNB1 mutations in endometrial cancers.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: >-
      The secreted form of HEMO (48 kDa) is released into the extracellular space
      following cleavage upstream of the transmembrane domain (PMID:28739914). This
      secreted form has been detected in the blood of pregnant women. The annotation
      is appropriate for the secreted form of the protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt subcellular location indicates the protein has a secreted form
      that is released following proteolytic cleavage. The deep research confirms
      HEMO is actively shed in the blood circulation in humans via specific cleavage
      of the precursor envelope protein upstream of the transmembrane domain
      (PMID:28739914). While GO:0005615 (extracellular space) might be more
      specific for a secreted protein found in blood, GO:0005576 is acceptable
      as a parent term.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: >-
      HEMO is a type I transmembrane protein. The protein contains a
      signal peptide (aa 1-26), an extracellular domain (aa 27-488), a transmembrane
      helix (aa 489-509), and a cytoplasmic tail (aa 510-563). The uncleaved form
      at the cell surface represents the major form.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt annotation clearly indicates HEMO is a single-pass type I membrane
      protein localized to the cell membrane. The protein is found at the cell
      surface, with evidence from the deep research confirming plasma membrane
      localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The secreted form of HEMO is detected in blood circulation, particularly
      during pregnancy. This is more specific than GO:0005576 for a protein found in
      blood/interstitial fluid.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Based on identification of HEMO shed in the blood of pregnant women
      (PMID:28739914), GO:0005615 (extracellular space) is a more appropriate
      annotation for the secreted form than the broader GO:0005576. Per GO
      documentation, extracellular space is specifically for gene products
      "secreted from a cell into the interstitial fluid or blood."

  review:
    summary: >-
      HEMO is secreted into the blood and may function as a signaling molecule,
      though the specific receptor is unknown. The protein circulates at nanomolar
      concentrations during pregnancy suggesting a potential signaling role.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The deep research suggests HEMO may function as a secreted signaling protein
      based on its circulation in blood during pregnancy and expression in stem cells.
      However, the specific receptor has not been identified, so this is speculative.

      HEMO specifically interacts with the transmembrane aspartic protease BACE2.
      This interaction is primate-specific, having evolved ~30-45 million years ago.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The deep research reports that BACE2 has been identified as a specific binding
      partner for HEMO. This interaction was acquired in the primate lineage through
      mutations that also eliminated fusogenic capacity. While protein binding is
      a general term, the specific BACE2 interaction is documented.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    Secreted signaling protein - HEMO is shed from the cell surface as a soluble
    protein via cleavage upstream of the transmembrane domain and circulates in blood,
    particularly during pregnancy. The specific receptor or downstream signaling
    pathway remains unknown. Unlike syncytins which retain fusogenic activity,
    HEMO has lost membrane fusion capability but evolved secretion as its primary
    mode of action.
