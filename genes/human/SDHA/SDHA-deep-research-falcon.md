# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P31040
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein subunit, mitochondrial; EC=1.3.5.1 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10746566, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24781757}; AltName: Full=Flavoprotein subunit of complex II; Short=Fp; AltName: Full=Malate dehydrogenase [quinone] flavoprotein subunit; EC=1.1.5.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31039}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SDHA; Synonyms=SDH2, SDHF;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase 2 family.
- **Key Domains:** FAD-dep_OxRdtase_2_FAD-bd. (IPR003953); FAD/NAD-bd_sf. (IPR036188); FRD_SDH_FAD_BS. (IPR003952); Fum_R/Succ_DH_flav-like_C_sf. (IPR037099); Fum_Rdtase/Succ_DH_flav-like_C. (IPR015939)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SDHA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SDHA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SDHA** (gene ID: SDHA, UniProt: P31040) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: We verified the target identity (Objective 1) and gathered recent, authoritative sources addressing SDHA biology, complex II organization, disease associations, and diagnostic applications (Objectives 2–6). Below is a comprehensive research report. Because only a subset of requested 2023–2024 literature was retrievable in the current context, some details (e.g., specific imaging protocols) are summarized based on available recent reviews; where evidence is limited, we indicate this.

Comprehensive research report: Human SDHA (UniProt P31040)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and biochemical role: SDHA encodes the flavoprotein (Fp) subunit of mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, SDH). SDHA contains a covalently bound FAD cofactor that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, while transferring electrons into the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) reduction. This places SDHA at the direct intersection of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Complex II organization: Complex II is a heterotetramer of SDHA and SDHB (matrix-facing catalytic dimer) with SDHC and SDHD forming the membrane-embedded anchor that binds ubiquinone. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Assembly factors and FADylation: Dedicated SDH assembly factors (SDHAF1–4) are required. SDHAF2 is specifically implicated in maturation of SDHA by mediating flavin (FAD) acylation/covalent attachment, while SDHAF1/3 support Fe–S center insertion into SDHB, and SDHAF4 stabilizes the SDHA–SDHB dimer. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- SDH deficiency and oncometabolite signaling: Contemporary reviews synthesize advances showing that succinate accumulation from SDH dysfunction inhibits α-ketoglutarate–dependent enzymes (e.g., HIF prolyl hydroxylases, histone/DNA demethylases), driving pseudohypoxia and epigenetic reprogramming that contribute to tumorigenesis. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 16-17)
- Post-translational regulation of SDHA: Recent work cataloged tumor-relevant PTMs on SDHA (e.g., phosphorylation Tyr215, acetylation Lys335, succinylation Lys547) and linked mitochondrial protein acylation to metabolic and epigenetic phenotypes in SDH-defective contexts. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 18-19)
- Broad 2024 perspective on mitochondrial metabolism in cancer: A 2024 review summarizes how alterations in OXPHOS complexes (including complex II/SDHA) interface with cancer biology and therapeutic strategies. (bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)

3) Primary function, substrate specificity, and cellular localization
- Catalyzed reaction and cofactors: SDHA catalyzes succinate oxidation to fumarate using a covalently bound FAD that accepts electrons from succinate; these are relayed through SDHB Fe–S centers to ubiquinone bound in SDHC/SDHD, reducing it to ubiquinol. Substrate specificity in humans is succinate (physiologic substrate); fumarate is the reverse substrate under certain conditions, but the physiologic direction in the TCA is succinate → fumarate. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Structural organization and interfaces: The SDHA catalytic domain is matrix-facing and associates tightly with SDHB to form the soluble head of complex II; SDHC/SDHD span the inner membrane and provide the ubiquinone-binding pocket and electron exit path. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Localization: Complex II resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The SDHA active site is exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, consistent with its TCA-cycle role. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Assembly and maturation: SDHAF2 supports covalent FAD attachment (FADylation) to SDHA; SDHAF1/3/4 coordinate maturation of the catalytic dimer and Fe–S cluster incorporation into SDHB, ensuring competent electron transfer to ubiquinone. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)

4) Disease associations, variant spectrum, and recent cohort statistics
- Tumor predisposition: Germline pathogenic variants in SDHx genes (including SDHA) cause hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) and are also found in SDH-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and occasional pituitary adenomas. Succinate-driven inhibition of α-KG–dependent dioxygenases links SDH deficiency to pseudohypoxia and a CpG island hypermethylator phenotype. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 16-17, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4)
- SDH-deficient GIST statistics: SDH-deficient GISTs account for about 10–15% of all GISTs, typically gastric and enriched in pediatric/AYA patients with a female predominance and high distant metastasis rates (reported up to ~82%). Approximately 30% of SDH-deficient GISTs harbor SDHA germline variants; about 50% of the remaining cases are associated with SDHC promoter hypermethylation (SDHC epimutation). (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4)
- PPGL genetics: Around 40% of PPGLs are hereditary, commonly due to germline SDHx variants. Distinct clinical presentations and risks have been documented across SDHB, SDHD, and SDHA mutation carriers. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4, bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)
- SDH-deficient RCC: Most often associated with SDHB germline mutations (~83% in reported series), with SDHA and SDHD alterations rarer; presents in younger adults (~late 30s to ~40) with characteristic morphology. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4)
- Primary mitochondrial disease: Pathogenic SDHA variants can cause OXPHOS deficiency and Leigh syndrome spectrum, cardiomyopathy, and leukodystrophies, consistent with SDH’s role in energy metabolism. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3, bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic immunohistochemistry (IHC): Loss of SDHB protein by IHC is a robust tumor marker of SDH complex dysfunction and helps triage hereditary testing for SDHB/SDHC/SDHD; patterns of SDHA loss can indicate SDHA-altered tumors. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 16-17)
- Metabolomic profiling: Succinate accumulation and related metabolomic signatures, including machine-learning–assisted metabolomics, can predict SDH mutational status in tumors, aiding classification and management. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20)
- Therapeutic implications: Mechanistic insights (succinate-HIF axis; epigenetic consequences) inform emerging strategies such as targeting redox metabolism, α-KG–dependent dioxygenases, or modulating NAD+ biology in specific SDH-deficient tumor subsets; some preclinical and early clinical observations are summarized in recent reviews. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 18-19, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 15-16)

6) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Integrative 2025 review: A comprehensive review synthesizes complex II structure-function, assembly biology (including SDHAF2’s role in FADylation of SDHA), and the clinical spectrum of SDH deficiency across primary mitochondrial disease and neoplasia; it emphasizes succinate’s role as an oncometabolite and the diagnostic utility of IHC and metabolomics. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 16-17, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 18-19, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 15-16, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4)
- Contemporary 2024 perspective: A 2024 review highlights SDH/SDHA within the broader OXPHOS–glycolysis axis in cancer and discusses how mitochondrial alterations inform therapeutic strategies. (bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- SDH-deficient GIST: 10–15% of all GIST; ~30% carry SDHA germline variants; ~50% of non-SDHA SDH-deficient cases attributable to SDHC promoter hypermethylation; frequent gastric location, pediatric/AYA skew, female predominance, and high metastasis rates (up to ~82%). (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4)
- PPGL heritability: Approximately 40% of PPGLs are hereditary, frequently due to SDHx variants. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 3-4, bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)

Expert synthesis and gaps
- The identity checks pass: SDHA (UniProt P31040) in Homo sapiens is the FAD-dependent catalytic flavoprotein subunit of complex II, consistent with FAD-dependent oxidoreductase family/domain annotations and the literature summarized above. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3)
- Recent (2023–2024) literature emphasizes SDH deficiency as a driver of tumorigenesis through oncometabolite signaling, epigenetic remodeling, and metabolic rewiring; diagnostic practice increasingly integrates IHC and metabolomics to infer SDH status. While specific cryo-EM updates and detailed imaging protocol data (e.g., 18F-FDG vs 68Ga-DOTATATE performance in SDH-deficient PPGL) were not available in the retrieved context, the cited recent reviews support the overarching mechanistic and clinical framework. (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 19-20, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 16-17, bosso2024targetingthemetabolic pages 32-33)

Limitations of current context
- Despite targeted searches, we did not retrieve primary 2023–2024 cryo-EM structural papers for human complex II nor detailed cohort guidelines with imaging test characteristics within the current evidence set. The report therefore emphasizes high-confidence, recent reviews and aggregated cohort statistics available in the provided context. Where precise modality performance metrics (e.g., FDG vs DOTATATE) are required, additional targeted sourcing is recommended.

Conclusion
Human SDHA (UniProt P31040) is the mitochondrial matrix-facing, FAD-dependent flavoprotein subunit of complex II that oxidizes succinate to fumarate and feeds electrons to ubiquinone. Its maturation depends on SDHAF2-mediated FADylation and assembly with SDHB/SDHC/SDHD. Germline and somatic alterations in SDHx, including SDHA, underlie primary mitochondrial disease and a spectrum of tumors such as PPGL and SDH-deficient GIST, with recognizable diagnostic patterns via IHC and metabolomics. Recent analyses (2024–2025) refine mechanistic links between succinate accumulation, hypoxia signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming, and point to emerging diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
