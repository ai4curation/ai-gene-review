description: >-
  SDHA encodes the flavoprotein (Fp) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, Complex II),
  a heterotetrameric enzyme (SDHA/SDHB/SDHC/SDHD) embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
  SDHA contains a covalently bound FAD cofactor (attached at His99) and catalyzes the oxidation
  of succinate to fumarate as part of the TCA cycle. The electrons from succinate oxidation are
  transferred via FAD to the iron-sulfur clusters in SDHB and ultimately to ubiquinone bound
  at the SDHC/SDHD membrane interface, coupling the TCA cycle to the electron transport chain.
  Complex II is unique among OXPHOS complexes in that it does NOT pump protons across the inner
  membrane. SDHA also functions as a tumor suppressor; loss-of-function mutations cause
  paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (PPGL5) via succinate accumulation and pseudohypoxic HIF1a
  stabilization. Biallelic mutations cause Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial complex II deficiency,
  and dilated cardiomyopathy.

    label: succinate dehydrogenase (quinone) activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for the overall SDH quinone reductase activity. GO:0008177 is defined as
      "the overall reaction of the entire SDH complex" (succinate + quinone -> fumarate + quinol).
      The IBA uses the qualifier 'enables' which is debatable for a single subunit of a complex enzyme.
      However, SDHA alone can catalyze the succinate -> fumarate half-reaction (the succinate
      dehydrogenase activity per se), and it is the catalytic subunit where the substrate binding
      and FAD-mediated oxidation occurs. The full quinone reduction requires all four subunits.
      The IMP annotation from PMID:7550341 uses 'contributes_to' which is arguably more precise
      for the full quinone-dependent reaction. Nevertheless, IBA annotations are well-curated
      phylogenetic inferences and the 'enables' qualifier is defensible since SDHA provides the
      primary catalytic function of the complex. The deep research review (SDHA-deep-research-falcon.md)
      confirms that the FAD cofactor is covalently linked in the SDHA subunit via a conserved histidine,
      essential for catalysis in characterized complex II enzymes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      SDHA is the catalytic subunit of SDH complex containing the FAD cofactor and active site
      for succinate oxidation. While the full quinone reduction requires the entire complex,
      SDHA's role is central and catalytic. The IBA is phylogenetically sound. Both 'enables'
      and 'contributes_to' are defensible for GO:0008177 given SDHA is the primary catalytic
      subunit. Accept as-is.

  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:30030361
  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation from ComplexPortal suggesting SDHA is involved in proton motive
      force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis. This annotation is problematic because
      Complex II does NOT pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Unlike
      Complexes I, III, and IV which translocate protons to generate the proton motive force,
      Complex II transfers electrons from succinate to ubiquinone without any proton pumping.
      Complex II contributes to ATP synthesis only indirectly by feeding reduced ubiquinol
      into the Q pool, which is then oxidized by Complex III (which does pump protons).
      Annotating SDHA with this term conflates electron donation to the Q pool with proton
      translocation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Complex II is the only OXPHOS complex that does NOT pump protons. The proton motive
      force is generated by Complexes I, III, and IV. Complex II feeds electrons into the
      ubiquinone pool but does not directly contribute to the proton gradient. This annotation
      is misleading and should be removed. The correct process annotation for SDHA is
      GO:0006121 (mitochondrial electron transport, succinate to ubiquinone).

      TAS annotation from Reactome for FAD binding. The Reactome entry R-HSA-9854672
      describes the covalent attachment of FAD to SDHA. GO:0071949 (FAD binding) specifically

  qualifier: contributes_to
  review:
    summary: >-
      IMP annotation with 'contributes_to' qualifier from the landmark Bourgeron et al. (1995)
      study. This study identified the first nuclear gene mutation causing mitochondrial
      respiratory chain deficiency -- an Arg554Trp mutation in SDHA causing Leigh syndrome
      with complex II deficiency. The 'contributes_to' qualifier is appropriate for GO:0008177
      since the GO term definition states "This term represents the overall reaction of the
      entire SDH complex." The full quinone reduction reaction requires all four subunits
      (SDHA provides succinate oxidation/FAD reduction, SDHB provides Fe-S electron relay,
      and SDHC/SDHD provide the quinone binding site). SDHA alone cannot complete the quinone
      reduction half of the reaction.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The 'contributes_to' qualifier is arguably more precise than 'enables' for GO:0008177
      since the GO definition explicitly states it represents the overall reaction of the
      entire complex. SDHA provides the succinate dehydrogenase half-reaction (via FAD) but
      quinone reduction requires the membrane-anchored subunits. Both qualifiers are defensible
      but 'contributes_to' is more conservative and accurate for this complex-level activity.

  original_reference_id: PMID:16361598
  review:
    summary: >-
      IMP annotation for nervous system development from Horvath et al. (2006). This study
      described a child with Leigh syndrome caused by compound heterozygous SDHA mutations
      (W119X and A83V), presenting with severe progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing
      epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, and tetraspasticity starting at age five months.
      The IMP logic is that SDHA mutations cause a neurodevelopmental phenotype, therefore
      SDHA is involved in nervous system development. However, this is a classic case of
      over-annotation. SDHA is a housekeeping metabolic enzyme. The nervous system is particularly
      sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction due to its high energy demands, but SDHA is not
      specifically involved in nervous system development. The neurological phenotype is a
      secondary consequence of impaired cellular energy production, not a direct developmental
      role for SDHA in neural patterning or differentiation.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      This is a clear over-annotation. SDHA mutations cause Leigh syndrome with neurological
      features because the nervous system is especially vulnerable to mitochondrial energy
      deficits, not because SDHA has a specific role in neural development. The nervous system
      phenotype is a secondary consequence of impaired oxidative phosphorylation. By this logic,
      any essential metabolic gene causing disease with neurological symptoms would be annotated

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0000104 (succinate dehydrogenase activity) is defined as "Catalysis of the reaction:
      succinate + acceptor = fumarate + reduced acceptor." This is a more appropriate molecular
      function term for SDHA than GO:0008177 (quinone-specific) when annotating the subunit
      alone, because SDHA catalyzes the succinate to fumarate reaction via its FAD cofactor
      regardless of the downstream electron acceptor. The Bourgeron et al. study demonstrated
      that mutation of SDHA impairs succinate dehydrogenase activity. This annotation should
      use the 'enables' qualifier since SDHA alone (with its FAD cofactor) is sufficient to
      catalyze succinate oxidation.
    action: NEW

      quinone-dependent overall complex reaction. SDHA alone can oxidize succinate to

  description: >-
    SDHA is the catalytic flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II).
    It contains a covalently bound FAD cofactor at His99 and catalyzes the oxidation of
    succinate to fumarate as part of the TCA cycle (GO:0006099). The electrons are transferred
    via FAD through SDHB iron-sulfur centers to ubiquinone, coupling the TCA cycle to the
    electron transport chain (GO:0006121). SDHA enables electron transfer activity (GO:0009055)
    and contributes to the overall succinate dehydrogenase quinone activity (GO:0008177) of
    the Complex II heterotetramer. The complex resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane
    with SDHA facing the matrix.
