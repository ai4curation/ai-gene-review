## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P16444
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dipeptidase 1; EC=3.4.13.19 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:2303490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32325220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6334084}; AltName: Full=Beta-lactamase {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.5.2.6 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:6334084}; AltName: Full=Dehydropeptidase-I; AltName: Full=Microsomal dipeptidase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2303490}; AltName: Full=Renal dipeptidase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8097406}; Short=hRDP {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8097406}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DPEP1; Synonyms=MDP {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2303490}, RDP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the metallo-dependent hydrolases superfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Dipep_AS. (IPR000180); Metal_Hydrolase. (IPR032466); Pept_M19. (IPR008257); Peptidase_M19 (PF01244)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DPEP1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DPEP1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DPEP1** (gene ID: DPEP1, UniProt: P16444) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Plan and verification
- Identity check: DPEP1 (UniProt P16444) encodes human dipeptidase-1, also known as renal/membrane dipeptidase (MDP/RDP), a GPI-anchored, zinc-dependent peptidase of the M19 metallo-dependent hydrolase family. Literature reviewed below matches the UniProt description, organism (Homo sapiens), superfamily, and domain/fold annotations; no conflicting gene symbol usage was found. (wang2024insightintodipeptidase pages 2-4, hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 8-8)

Comprehensive research report

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and fold: DPEP1 is a disulfide-linked homodimer whose extracellular domain adopts an (α/β)8-barrel fold typical of membrane-bound dipeptidases; the active site harbors a dinuclear Zn2+ center required for catalysis. Structural, mutational, and computational studies establish zinc dependence and key residues (e.g., Glu125/Glu141, essential histidines) in catalysis. J Struct Biol 2020 summarizes and cites the human renal dipeptidase crystal structure (J Mol Biol 2002) and mutational analyses demonstrating zinc-peptidase mechanism (Biochem J 1997; Biochim Biophys Acta 1993). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107512 (published July 2020). (hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 8-8)
- Enzyme class and EC: Functionally, DPEP1 is a dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) and has β-lactamase activity against penem/carbapenem substrates (EC 3.5.2.6), consistent with its historical identification as renal dehydropeptidase-I/beta-lactamase. A 2024 review consolidates these assignments. URL: https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-2024-2436 (published Dec 27, 2024). (wang2024insightintodipeptidase pages 2-4)
- Substrate scope and inhibitors: DPEP1 hydrolyzes dipeptides including glutathione catabolites (e.g., Cys–Gly), converts leukotriene D4 (LTD4) to LTE4, and hydrolyzes β-lactam antibiotics such as thienamycin/imipenem; it is potently inhibited by cilastatin (a substrate-variant inhibitor that perturbs the binuclear Zn2+ geometry). Structural/biochemical literature summarized in 2020 highlights cilastatin binding and β-lactam hydrolysis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107512 (July 2020). (hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 8-8, hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 5-7)
- Subcellular localization: DPEP1 is a GPI-anchored protein expressed on the luminal (apical) surface of proximal tubular brush border; it is glycosylated and functions as a plasma-membrane zinc peptidase controlling renal glutathione turnover. Sci Adv 2022 provides functional localization context in kidney tubules. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl8920 (published Feb 2022). (massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 7-8)

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024 where available)
- Structural/mechanistic consolidation and cancer-focused synthesis (2024): A 2024 review synthesizes DPEP1 structure, processing (signal peptide, GPI-anchor propeptide), glycosylation, and roles in leukotriene and β-lactam metabolism, and compiles emerging evidence across gastrointestinal cancers (context-dependent oncogenic vs. tumor-suppressive roles). URL: https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-2024-2436 (Dec 27, 2024). (wang2024insightintodipeptidase pages 2-4, wang2024insightintodipeptidase pages 1-2)
- Adhesion receptor function on endothelium (ongoing impact): Although first reported in 2019, the non-enzymatic role of DPEP1 as an adhesion receptor for neutrophil recruitment to lung and liver endothelium remains a major recent conceptual advance shaping therapeutic exploration. The Cell study demonstrated that an in vivo–selected peptide (LSALT) binds DPEP1 and blocks neutrophil adhesion without affecting enzymatic activity; a catalytically inactive E141D mutant still supports adhesion, confirming separation of functions. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.017 (published Aug 22, 2019). (choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 1-4, choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 8-9, choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 25-26)
- Ferroptosis linkage and steroid signaling (2022 update informing current work): Dexamethasone upregulates DPEP1 via the glucocorticoid receptor, reduces glutathione, and sensitizes renal tubules to ferroptosis; cilastatin or genetic Dpep1 inactivation reverses the dexamethasone-induced necrosis phenotype ex vivo. This mechanistic axis continues to influence current nephrology research on oxidative injury. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl8920 (Feb 2022). (massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 7-8, massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 11-12)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Antibiotic co-therapy: Imipenem is co-formulated clinically with cilastatin to prevent DPEP1-mediated renal hydrolysis of the carbapenem, preserving antibiotic exposure; this use-case and mechanism are reiterated in the 2022 Science Advances work linking DPEP1 to glutathione metabolism and ferroptosis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl8920 (Feb 2022). (massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 7-8)
- Anti-inflammatory targeting concept: The LSALT peptide identified by in vivo selection binds DPEP1 and reduces neutrophil adhesion to lung/liver endothelium in models of inflammation/sepsis, suggesting a non-enzymatic anti-adhesive therapeutic strategy distinct from catalytic inhibition. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.017 (Aug 2019). (choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 1-4, choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 25-26)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural enzymology perspective: Integrating crystallography and mutagenesis indicates DPEP1’s catalysis arises from a dinuclear Zn2+ center at the base of the (α/β)8 barrel with glutamate and histidines coordinating catalysis and metal; cilastatin’s inhibition derives from coordinating this binuclear center. This convergence across structural and biochemical sources supports the UniProt domain/family annotations and validates inhibitor mechanisms used clinically. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107512 (July 2020). (hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 8-8, hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 5-7)
- Immunology and vascular biology perspective: The Cell work establishes DPEP1 as a bona fide adhesion receptor on inflamed endothelium that is functionally and mechanistically separable from peptidase activity, shifting DPEP1 from a purely metabolic enzyme to a dual-function molecule with direct roles in leukocyte recruitment. Therapeutic inhibition of adhesion (LSALT) is more relevant in this context than catalytic inhibition (cilastatin), which did not reduce neutrophil adhesion in the in vivo liver model used. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.017 (Aug 2019). (choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 7-8)
- Nephrology and redox biology perspective: DPEP1’s regulation of glutathione catabolism at the apical brush border links transporter/extracellular peptide metabolism to ferroptotic sensitivity, particularly under glucocorticoid exposure. This provides a mechanistic rationale for context-specific nephroprotection strategies (e.g., DPEP1 inhibition) being explored in preclinical systems. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl8920 (Feb 2022). (massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 7-8)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Adhesion function is catalytic-activity independent: A catalytically inert E141D DPEP1 mutant maintained neutrophil adhesion comparable to wild-type in cellular assays, while LSALT peptide binding to DPEP1 inhibited adhesion; in vivo, cilastatin did not significantly reduce neutrophil adhesion in inflamed liver sinusoids in the Cell study. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.017 (Aug 2019). (choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 8-9, choudhury2019dipeptidase1isan pages 7-8)
- Structural/biochemical specifics: Active-site glutamates/histidines are essential (e.g., Glu125/Glu141; His residues) and the enzyme is a disulfide-linked homodimer; DPEP1 and DPEP2, but not DPEP3, show dipeptidase activity against cystinyl-bis-glycine in assays summarized in 2020 structural work. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107512 (July 2020). (hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 5-7, hayashi2020structureofhuman pages 8-8)
- Ferroptosis modulation: In ex vivo renal tubules, ferroptosis inhibitors, cilastatin, or Dpep1 genetic inactivation reversed dexamethasone-induced tubular necrosis, tying DPEP1 expression to glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation susceptibility. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abl8920 (Feb 2022). (massenhausen2022dexamethasonesensitizesto pages 7-8)

Focused functional annotation (reaction, specificity, localization, pathways)
- Catalyzed reaction and specificity: DPEP1 hydrolyzes dipeptides (e.g., Cys–Gly from glutathione turnover) and processes eicosanoid leukotriene D4 to LTE4; it also hydrolyzes β-lactam rings of carbapenems/penems (e.g., imipenem/thienamycin), underpinning the clinical need for cilastatin co-administration. These activities arise from a dinuclear Zn2+ active site in the M19 metallohydrolase family.
