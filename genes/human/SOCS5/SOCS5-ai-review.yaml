description: 'SOCS5 (Suppressor of cytokine signaling 5) is a negative feedback regulator
  of cytokine and growth factor signaling. It functions as a substrate recognition
  component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, mediating ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation of target receptors including EGFR and IL-4 receptor. SOCS5 plays key
  roles in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling, regulating T-helper cell differentiation
  (promoting Th1 while inhibiting Th2), and controlling EGFR homeostasis.'

  review:
    summary: 'Third instance of GO:0019221 annotation, this time with ISS (sequence
      similarity) evidence. Convergent support for core function.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is a third annotation of the same term with ISS evidence based on
      manual transfer to orthologs. The convergence of IBA, IEA, and ISS evidence
      all supporting the same annotation strengthens confidence that cytokine-mediated
      signaling is a core conserved function of SOCS5 across species.'

    label: positive regulation of T-helper 1 cell differentiation
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'Duplicate of earlier Th1 differentiation annotation, this time with
      ISS evidence from orthology.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is a duplicate annotation with ISS evidence based on manual orthology
      transfer. Both IEA and ISS annotations supporting the same function provide
      convergent evidence for this conserved immunological role across species.'

  review:
    summary: 'Duplicate of earlier Th2 differentiation annotation with ISS evidence.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Duplicate annotation with ISS evidence from orthology transfer. Convergent
      with IEA annotation, supporting conserved function in regulating T-helper cell
      fate.'

    label: negative regulation of signal transduction
  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:10773671
  review:
    summary: 'Fourth instance of this overly broad term, this time with NAS evidence
      from the original SOCS5 cloning paper. Same issues as earlier instances.'
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: 'This is another instance of the overly general "negative regulation of
      signal transduction" term, this time with NAS evidence from PMID:10773671 (the
      original cloning paper describing SOCS5/CIS6). While the statement in that
      paper that SOCS5 could act as a negative regulator is accurate, this broad
      term is not informative compared to the specific pathway annotations already
      present.'
