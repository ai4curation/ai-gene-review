# Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
GDPD2 (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain-containing protein 2), also known as **GDE3**, encodes an enzyme with glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase activity (EC 3.1.4.43) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Function%20%20,1%3B%20Type%3DFrameshift%3B%20Positions%3D397%3B%20Evidence%3D)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)). This enzyme specifically hydrolyzes **glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns)** into glycerol and inositol 1-phosphate, and notably *does not* act on related glycerophosphodiesters such as glycerophosphoinositol-4-phosphate, glycerophosphocholine, -ethanolamine, or -serine ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Function%20%20,By%20similarity)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=analyses%20show%20that%20wild,an%20arginine%20residue%20crucial%20for)). GDPD2 functions as an **ecto-enzyme**, requiring millimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor, and its catalytic domain is oriented extracellularly ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Caution%20%20,role%20in%20remodeling%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=GDE3%20activity,activity%2C%20this%20predicts%20an%20enzyme)). As a result, it hydrolyzes **extracellular** GroPIns without altering the intracellular pool ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Caution%20%20,role%20in%20remodeling%20of%20the)). A critical **arginine residue (Arg-231)** in the catalytic GP-PDE domain is required for activity, as mutation of this residue abolishes enzymatic function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=analyses%20show%20that%20wild,an%20arginine%20residue%20crucial%20for)). Through its enzymatic action, GDPD2 is thought to modulate signaling pathways involving GroPIns, which has been implicated in cell growth and differentiation signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=topology%20with%20an%20extracellular%20catalytic,type%20GDE3%20in%20osteoblasts%20promotes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiesterases%20GDE1%20and%20GDE3%2C,coupled)). Consistently, GDPD2 activity has been linked to changes in cell morphology, suggesting downstream effects on cytoskeletal or membrane dynamics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)).  

# Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
GDPD2 is a **multi-pass membrane protein** predominantly localized at the **plasma membrane** ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Similarity%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). Topology studies indicate that it spans the membrane multiple times, anchoring the protein at the cell surface ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Similarity%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). The catalytic domain resides on the **extracellular side** of the membrane, consistent with the finding that glycerophosphoinositol is hydrolyzed in the extracellular medium by overexpressed GDPD2 ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Caution%20%20,role%20in%20remodeling%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=GDE3%20activity,activity%2C%20this%20predicts%20an%20enzyme)). In addition to the cell surface, GDPD2 has been observed in the **cytoplasm associated with the cytoskeleton**, co-localizing with **actin filaments** ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Similarity%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). This suggests that GDPD2 may concentrate at sites of actin-rich membrane structures (e.g. ruffles or protrusions), potentially linking its enzymatic activity to cytoskeletal remodeling. Indeed, experiments noted GDPD2’s influence on cell shape and morphology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)), supporting a role at the interface of the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Key Gene Ontology (GO) cellular component terms for GDPD2 include **“integral component of membrane”** (plasma membrane) and **“actin cytoskeleton”**, reflecting these localizations ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/proteins/HMDBP11530#:~:text=lipid%20metabolic%20process%20Cellular%20Component,activity%2C%20acting%20on%20ester%20bonds)).  

# Biological Processes Involvement  
GDPD2 is strongly implicated in **bone formation and osteoblast differentiation**. Its expression and activity are up-regulated during the maturation of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), and it is considered a **marker of osteoblast differentiation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)). Overexpression of GDPD2 (GDE3) in osteoblastic cells has been shown to **promote osteoblast differentiation**, evidenced by increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized calcium deposition ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=topology%20with%20an%20extracellular%20catalytic,type%20GDE3%20in%20osteoblasts%20promotes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20alkaline%20phosphatase,proliferation%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)). This suggests GDPD2 accelerates the osteogenic program and the growth of bone tissue, aligning with its UniProt annotation that it “**accelerates the program of osteoblast differentiation and growth**” ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2/summary/gene#:~:text=inositolphosphodiesterase%20activity%20and%20specifically%20hydrolyzes,show%20less)). Conversely, GDPD2 activity appears to **modulate cell proliferation**; as osteoblasts differentiate, proliferation slows, indicating GDPD2 may help switch cells from a proliferative state to a mature, mineralizing state ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20alkaline%20phosphatase,proliferation%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)). Beyond skeletogenesis, GDPD2’s unique lipid substrate specificity ties it to **lipid metabolic processes**, particularly the catabolism of glycerophosphoinositol lipids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiesterases%20GDE1%20and%20GDE3%2C,coupled)). By hydrolyzing GroPIns, GDPD2 could influence signaling pathways (GroPIns is known to partake in cell signaling and growth control ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7960645/#:~:text=Direct%20LC,containing%20molecules%2C%20may%20prevent%20in))), thus impacting processes like cell growth, differentiation, and possibly apoptosis in certain contexts. Additionally, GDPD2 has been associated with **actin cytoskeleton organization**, as changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement were observed upon altering GDPD2 levels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)). This supports a proposed role in actin filament remodeling, which could affect cell migration or shape. Relevant GO terms for processes include **“lipid catabolic process”**, **“osteoblast differentiation”**, and **“actin cytoskeleton organization”**, consistent with current evidence ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/proteins/HMDBP11530#:~:text=lipid%20metabolic%20process%20Cellular%20Component,activity%2C%20acting%20on%20ester%20bonds)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2/summary/gene#:~:text=inositolphosphodiesterase%20activity%20and%20specifically%20hydrolyzes,show%20less)).  

# Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
To date, there are no well-established hereditary diseases directly caused by mutations in **GDPD2** in humans. GDPD2 is located on the X chromosome (Xq13.1), but no X-linked disorder has been definitively tied to this gene. However, given its role in bone differentiation, researchers have considered that GDPD2 dysfunction might impact bone density or skeletal development. In mice, Gde3 (GDPD2) is highly expressed in osteocytes and late-stage osteoblasts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)), suggesting that loss of this enzyme could potentially affect bone formation or turnover; nevertheless, published mouse knockout phenotypes for Gdpd2 have not been prominently reported, implying either a subtle effect or functional compensation by related enzymes. There are some intriguing correlative findings in human data: **The Human Protein Atlas** reports that GDPD2 RNA is **enhanced in certain cancers**, such as glioblastoma multiforme, and elevated in some cancer cell lines (e.g. bladder carcinoma cell lines) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2#:~:text=Cancer%20specificity,i%7D%20No)). This cancer-enhanced expression hints at a possible role in tumor biology (perhaps through altering cellular growth or motility), but currently there is no direct evidence linking GDPD2 to oncogenesis or specific cancer phenotypes. Similarly, large-scale genomic studies have not highlighted GDPD2 in common disease contexts, aside from occasional text-mined associations that are not yet experimentally confirmed. In summary, while **GDPD2’s importance in bone differentiation is clear, its involvement in human disease remains to be fully determined**, and it is a subject for future investigation.  

# Protein Domains and Structural Features  
GDPD2 is a member of the **glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GP-PDE) family** of enzymes ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Similarity%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). It contains a single **GP-PDE catalytic domain** that confers its enzymatic activity of cleaving glycerophosphodiester bonds ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Similarity%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). Characteristic of this family, GDPD2 has several **hydrophobic transmembrane segments** near its N-terminus that anchor the protein in the membrane, with computational predictions and experimental data indicating **multiple transmembrane passes** (multi-pass membrane protein architecture) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Subcellular%20Location%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). The N-terminus likely includes a signal peptide or leader sequence targeting the protein to the secretory pathway, ensuring the catalytic domain is presented in the luminal/extracellular space ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Caution%20%20,role%20in%20remodeling%20of%20the)). The **active site** of the GP-PDE domain requires divalent cations for catalysis – notably Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts as a cofactor to facilitate bond cleavage ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Caution%20%20,role%20in%20remodeling%20of%20the)). An invariant arginine (Arg-231 in human GDPD2) within the domain is critical for catalysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=analyses%20show%20that%20wild,an%20arginine%20residue%20crucial%20for)), reflecting a conserved active-site motif important for substrate binding or phosphodiester bond breakage. Three isoforms of GDPD2 have been reported due to **alternative splicing** (590 amino acids in isoform 1; 539 aa in isoform 2; 460 aa in isoform 3) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=284055242%20%20,glycerophosphoinositol%20inositolphosphodiesterase%20GDPD2%20isoform%203)). Isoform 1 (590 aa) is the full-length, primary form, while isoforms 2 and 3 lack certain internal segments (their existence is predicted from transcript data and not experimentally confirmed) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Alternative%20Products%20%20,the%20medium%20of%20cells%20overexpressing)) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=284055242%20%20,glycerophosphoinositol%20inositolphosphodiesterase%20GDPD2%20isoform%203)). These shorter isoforms may lack some transmembrane regions or functional elements, potentially altering localization or activity, although their biological significance remains unclear. **Metal-binding** sites (for Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and conserved catalytic residues within the GP-PDE domain define the molecular function of GDPD2 ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Gdpd2%2C%20whereas%20intracellular%20levels%20of,By%20similarity)). No full crystallographic structure is yet available, but an AlphaFold predicted structure exists (based on homology modeling), which confirms the globular ectodomain and transmembrane helices consistent with the proposed topology. In summary, GDPD2’s structure comprises a membrane-anchored ecto-enzyme domain belonging to a highly conserved phosphodiesterase family, with features supporting its role in lipid substrate recognition and hydrolysis.  

# Expression Patterns and Regulation  
**GDPD2** shows a tissue-specific expression pattern that aligns with its functional role in bone. It is most prominently expressed in **osteogenic lineage cells** – studies in mice have shown Gde3 (GDPD2) mRNA is low in undifferentiated osteoblasts but significantly **up-regulated in mature osteoblasts and osteocytes** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=function%20of%20GDE3%2C%20one%20of,A)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)). This developmental regulation suggests that transcription of GDPD2 is controlled by osteogenic differentiation programs (potentially downstream of bone-specific transcription factors or signaling pathways that drive late-stage differentiation). In humans, RNA profiling indicates that GDPD2 is expressed in a variety of tissues at moderate levels, with the highest expression noted in **bone marrow, osteoblasts, and possibly certain epithelial tissues** (one analysis clusters GDPD2 with genes in squamous epithelial/keratinization programs) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2#:~:text=Cancer%20specificity,i%7D%20No)). The Human Protein Atlas classifies GDPD2 as **“tissue enhanced” in bone-related tissues**, and interestingly also reports elevated expression in **skin/keratinocytes and cervix** (which might relate to the squamous differentiation cluster) – though these data are primarily transcript-based. At the cellular level, GDPD2 protein has been detected in the cytoplasm and membrane of osteoblastic cells. Regulation of GDPD2 expression is not fully elucidated, but given its upregulation with differentiation, it may be controlled by factors like **bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)** or other osteogenic signals. Bioinformatic promoter analyses (if any) have not been highlighted in literature, but **Runx2**, a master osteoblast transcription factor, could be a candidate regulator. Additionally, GDPD2 has multiple mRNA splice variants ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2/summary/gene#:~:text=Gene%20summary%20%28Entrez%29,show%20less)), hinting at post-transcriptional regulation or tissue-specific isoform expression. There is no evidence that GDPD2 is inducible by acute stimuli (e.g., calcium, hormones) in the short term, but its expression pattern suggests **regulation is tied to developmental and differentiation cues**. In summary, GDPD2 is expressed broadly at low-to-moderate levels, with **notable enrichment in bone-forming cells**, and its gene expression is tightly linked to the differentiation status of cells. This pattern underscores its role in specialized biological contexts (bone maturation and possibly epithelial differentiation).  

# Evolutionary Conservation  
GDPD2 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates and is a part of an ancient enzyme family present even in bacteria. The **GP-PDE enzyme family** (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases) was first characterized in bacteria and later identified in mammals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiester%20phosphodiesterase%20enzyme%20family,Substrate%20specificity)), indicating that organisms from prokaryotes to humans utilize related mechanisms to catabolize glycerophosphodiesters. Human GDPD2 shares significant sequence homology with its mammalian orthologs: for example, the mouse *Gdpd2* (Gde3) protein is highly similar in sequence and function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=topology%20with%20an%20extracellular%20catalytic,type%20GDE3%20in%20osteoblasts%20promotes)). GDPD2 orthologs are found in all placental mammals examined, as well as in marsupials and likely other vertebrates (e.g., birds and reptiles have GDPD2-like genes, given the presence of a *GDPD2* gene in turtle genome data ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/142020017#:~:text=GDPD2%20glycerophosphodiester%20phosphodiesterase%20domain%20containing,%7C))). Within primates, GDPD2 is well conserved (chimpanzee GDPD2 is ~99% identical to human, as expected from its essential functional role). The conservation extends to amino acids critical for catalytic activity – for instance, the Arg residue essential for activity and metal-binding motifs in the GP-PDE domain are conserved across species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=analyses%20show%20that%20wild,an%20arginine%20residue%20crucial%20for)). This high degree of conservation suggests strong **purifying selection**, implying GDPD2’s function in glycerophosphoinositol metabolism is biologically important across species. In contrast, lower eukaryotes like yeast have analogous glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (e.g., yeast *Git1* and others) but these are structurally distinct glycerol-3-phosphate transporters or enzymes, not one-to-one orthologs. Among the seven mammalian GDE family members (GDE1–GDE7), GDPD2 (GDE3) has a specific niche in bone tissue, whereas other family members have diverged to fulfill roles in nervous system development (GDE2), ubiquitous signaling (GDE1), etc. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiesterases%20GDE1%20and%20GDE3%2C,coupled)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20GDE3%20has%20been,been%20correlated%20to%20its%20expression)). The presence of this enzyme family in diverse organisms underlines its fundamental role in lipid metabolism. Thus, **GDPD2 is an evolutionarily conserved gene**, particularly within vertebrates, reflecting the conserved nature of glycerophosphoinositol metabolism and its importance in cellular physiology.  

# Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
Multiple studies have established GDPD2’s functions and characteristics. A cornerstone study by Corda *et al.* (2009) characterized **mouse GDE3 (GDPD2)** as a glycerophosphoinositol-specific phosphodiesterase and demonstrated its role in osteoblast differentiation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=topology%20with%20an%20extracellular%20catalytic,type%20GDE3%20in%20osteoblasts%20promotes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20alkaline%20phosphatase,proliferation%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)). This study provided direct evidence of GDPD2’s substrate specificity (cleaving GroPIns but not related lipids) and showed that overexpressing GDE3 in osteoblasts increased differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase, mineralization) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=match%20at%20L45%20alkaline%20phosphatase,proliferation%2C%20in%20line%20with%20the)). It also revealed the requirement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for activity and an extracellular orientation of the catalytic domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=GDE3%20activity,activity%2C%20this%20predicts%20an%20enzyme)). Another key piece of evidence from the same work was the identification of Arg-231 as critical for catalysis via site-directed mutagenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=analyses%20show%20that%20wild,an%20arginine%20residue%20crucial%20for)). Following this, a review by Yanaka (2007) surveyed the **mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase family**, noting GDE3’s high expression in osteocytes and suggesting its role as a differentiation marker ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)). A 2013 **Frontiers in Immunology** review by Patrussi *et al.* further highlighted that GDE1 and GDE3 are ecto-enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular GroPIns, and specifically described GDE3 as predominantly expressed in bone cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiesterases%20GDE1%20and%20GDE3%2C,coupled)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=further%20level%20of%20modulation%20of,10)). This review also underscored the idea that GroPIns can act as a signaling molecule in cell proliferation and that GDE3’s activity (producing inositol-1-phosphate and glycerol) might modulate such signals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2757188/#:~:text=topology%20with%20an%20extracellular%20catalytic,type%20GDE3%20in%20osteoblasts%20promotes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3725514/#:~:text=The%20glycerophosphodiesterases%20GDE1%20and%20GDE3%2C,coupled)). The Human Protein Atlas provides expression data, showing GDPD2’s enrichment in osteoblastic cells and certain cancers ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2#:~:text=Cancer%20specificity,i%7D%20No)). Lastly, the UniProt database (Q9HCC8) and NCBI RefSeq provide curated summaries corroborating these findings, noting GDPD2’s enzymatic function, localization, and “by similarity” inferred roles in actin cytoskeleton remodeling ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2/summary/gene#:~:text=inositolphosphodiesterase%20activity%20and%20specifically%20hydrolyzes,encodes%20a%20member%20of%20the)) ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmpd/LMP003184#:~:text=Function%20%20,Note%3DColocalizes%20with%20the%20actin%20cytoskeleton)). Together, these literature sources form a coherent picture: **GDPD2 (GDE3)** is an ecto-phosphodiesterase with a specialized role in bone cell differentiation and a unique substrate specificity, supported by both experimental enzymology and cell biology evidence. Key GO annotations drawn from this body of work include **glycerophosphoinositol glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity**, **integral component of plasma membrane**, **actin cytoskeleton**, **osteoblast differentiation**, and **lipid metabolic process**, each backed by experimental findings ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/proteins/HMDBP11530#:~:text=lipid%20metabolic%20process%20Cellular%20Component,on%20ester%20bonds%20catalytic%20activity)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130055-GDPD2/summary/gene#:~:text=inositolphosphodiesterase%20activity%20and%20specifically%20hydrolyzes,show%20less)). The accumulating research thus provides a solid foundation for Gene Ontology curation of GDPD2, linking its molecular function to cellular context and biological outcomes.
