description: 'GDPD2 (Glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase GDPD2) is a membrane-bound enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) into glycerol and inositol 1-phosphate. It functions as an ecto-enzyme with its catalytic domain oriented extracellularly, requiring millimolar Ca2+ as a cofactor. GDPD2 plays a critical role in promoting osteoblast differentiation and serves as a marker of osteoblast maturation. The protein localizes to the plasma membrane as a multi-pass membrane protein and colocalizes with actin filaments, suggesting involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling during cell differentiation.'

    label: plasma membrane
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'Plasma membrane localization is well-supported by experimental evidence. GDPD2 is a multi-pass membrane protein with transmembrane segments that anchor it in the membrane, with its catalytic domain oriented extracellularly. UniProt and literature confirm this membrane localization is essential for its ecto-enzyme function.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'Strong experimental evidence from biochemical and cell biology studies confirms GDPD2 as a plasma membrane protein with multiple transmembrane passes. The extracellular orientation of the catalytic domain and requirement for membrane anchoring to process extracellular glycerophosphoinositol support this core cellular component annotation.'

  review:
    summary: 'This term is correct but less specific than the actual enzymatic activity. GDPD2 has been experimentally characterized as having glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase activity (GO:0047394), which is a more specific child term that precisely describes its substrate specificity for glycerophosphoinositol.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While GDPD2 does possess glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, experimental evidence demonstrates it specifically acts on glycerophosphoinositol and not on other glycerophosphodiesters like glycerophosphocholine or glycerophosphoethanolamine.

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is misleading as GDPD2 is primarily a plasma membrane protein with its catalytic domain oriented extracellularly. While there may be some cytoplasmic association via its transmembrane segments or interaction with cytoskeletal elements, the primary and functionally relevant localization is the plasma membrane, not the cytoplasm.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'GDPD2 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with its functional catalytic domain on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane.
