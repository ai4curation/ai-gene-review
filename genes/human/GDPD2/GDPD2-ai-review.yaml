description: GDPD2 (Glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase GDPD2) is a membrane-bound
  enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) into glycerol
  and inositol 1-phosphate. It functions as an ecto-enzyme with its catalytic domain
  oriented extracellularly, requiring millimolar Ca2+ as a cofactor. GDPD2 plays a
  critical role in promoting osteoblast differentiation and serves as a marker of
  osteoblast maturation. The protein localizes to the plasma membrane as a multi-pass
  membrane protein and colocalizes with actin filaments, suggesting involvement in
  cytoskeletal remodeling during cell differentiation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Plasma membrane localization is well-supported by experimental evidence.
      GDPD2 is a multi-pass membrane protein with transmembrane segments that anchor
      it in the membrane, with its catalytic domain oriented extracellularly. UniProt
      and literature confirm this membrane localization is essential for its ecto-enzyme
      function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Strong experimental evidence from biochemical and cell biology studies
      confirms GDPD2 as a plasma membrane protein with multiple transmembrane passes.
      The extracellular orientation of the catalytic domain and requirement for membrane
      anchoring to process extracellular glycerophosphoinositol support this core
      cellular component annotation.

    label: glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This term is correct but less specific than the actual enzymatic activity.
      GDPD2 has been experimentally characterized as having glycerophosphoinositol
      inositolphosphodiesterase activity (GO:0047394), which is a more specific child
      term that precisely describes its substrate specificity for glycerophosphoinositol.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While GDPD2 does possess glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity,
      experimental evidence demonstrates it specifically acts on glycerophosphoinositol
      and not on other glycerophosphodiesters like glycerophosphocholine or glycerophosphoethanolamine.
      The more specific term GO:0047394 better captures this substrate specificity.

    label: cytoplasm
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: This annotation is misleading as GDPD2 is primarily a plasma membrane
      protein with its catalytic domain oriented extracellularly. While there may
      be some cytoplasmic association via its transmembrane segments or interaction
      with cytoskeletal elements, the primary and functionally relevant localization
      is the plasma membrane, not the cytoplasm.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: GDPD2 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with its functional catalytic
      domain on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. The cytoplasm annotation
      likely comes from automatic mapping but does not reflect the actual topology
      and functional localization of the protein. The plasma membrane annotation already
      captures the correct localization.

  review:
    summary: While GDPD2 colocalizes with actin filaments and may associate with the
      cytoskeleton, the more specific term GO:0005884 (actin filament) better captures
      this interaction. The broad cytoskeleton term is too general.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Evidence indicates GDPD2 specifically colocalizes with actin filaments
      rather than the cytoskeleton in general. The protein appears to concentrate
      at sites of actin-rich membrane structures and influences cell morphology, suggesting
      a specific association with the actin cytoskeleton rather than other cytoskeletal
      components.

      methods.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: This broad term is correct but vague. GDPD2 specifically catalyzes the
      hydrolysis of glycerophosphoinositol, a glycerophospholipid metabolite. More
      specific terms like glycerophospholipid metabolic process (GO:0006650) or phospholipid
      catabolic process would be more informative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While GDPD2 is involved in lipid metabolism, its specific function is
      the catabolism of glycerophosphoinositol, a glycerophospholipid derivative.
      A more specific biological process term would better represent its actual metabolic
      role.

      general. The more specific glycerophosphoinositol inositolphosphodiesterase
      activity (GO:0047394) should be used as it precisely describes the substrate
      specificity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GDPD2 does have phosphoric diester hydrolase activity, but experimental
      characterization has shown it specifically acts on glycerophosphoinositol. Using

    action: MODIFY

    summary: This annotation precisely captures the experimentally determined enzymatic
      activity of GDPD2. Multiple studies have confirmed that GDPD2 specifically hydrolyzes
      glycerophosphoinositol to produce glycerol and inositol 1-phosphate, with no
      activity on other glycerophosphodiesters.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most specific and accurate molecular function annotation for
      GDPD2. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates this specific enzymatic activity
      (EC 3.1.4.43) with strict substrate specificity for glycerophosphoinositol.

  review:
    summary: GDPD2 colocalizes with actin filaments according to literature and database
      annotations. This association may be related to its role in cell morphology
      changes during osteoblast differentiation, though this represents a secondary
      localization compared to its primary plasma membrane residence.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While GDPD2 does colocalize with actin filaments, this is not its primary
      localization or core function. The protein is primarily a plasma membrane ecto-enzyme,
      and the actin association may be relevant for its effects on cell morphology
      during differentiation but is not essential for its enzymatic function.

    label: actin filament organization
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: There is some evidence that GDPD2 influences cell morphology and cytoskeletal
      arrangement, particularly during osteoblast differentiation. However, this appears
      to be an indirect effect of its enzymatic activity rather than a direct role
      in actin organization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Changes in cell morphology were observed upon altering GDPD2 levels, suggesting
      involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling. However, this is likely a downstream
      effect of its lipid metabolic activity and role in differentiation rather than
      a direct function in actin organization. This represents a peripheral rather
      than core function.

      specific lamellipodium localization has not been demonstrated experimentally.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation appears to be an over-interpretation based on actin colocalization.
      While GDPD2 may be present at actin-rich membrane structures, there is no direct
      evidence for specific lamellipodium localization. The plasma membrane and actin

      is upregulated during osteoblast maturation and overexpression promotes osteoblast

      This represents a core biological function of GDPD2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Multiple experimental studies demonstrate that GDPD2 promotes osteoblast
