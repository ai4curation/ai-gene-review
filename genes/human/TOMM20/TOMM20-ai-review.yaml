description: >-
  TOMM20 (Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20 homolog) is a central receptor
  component of the translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOM complex).
  It is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane via a single-pass transmembrane
  domain and exposes its cytosolic TPR-containing domain to recognize N-terminal
  presequences (mitochondrial targeting sequences) of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
  preproteins. Together with TOMM22, TOMM20 facilitates transfer of preproteins into
  the TOM40 translocation pore. TOMM20 is also a substrate of PRKN-mediated
  ubiquitination during mitophagy and plays a role in PINK1 stabilization at
  depolarized mitochondria (PMID:40080546, PMID:38848361). The protein recognizes
  the hydrophobic face of amphiphilic helical presequences via its binding groove
  (PMID:14557246, PMID:35733257).

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation of TOMM20 to GO:0008320 "protein transmembrane transporter
      activity" is somewhat imprecise. TOMM20 itself is a receptor that recognizes
      presequences and hands substrates off to the TOMM40 pore. It does not form
      the translocation channel. TOMM40 is the actual pore-forming subunit. However,
      the TOM complex as a whole does function as a protein transmembrane transporter,
      and TOMM20 is an essential component of that activity. The IBA annotation
      likely reflects the holistic function of the complex. This is acceptable at
      the broader level since TOMM20 contributes to the overall transporter activity,
      though it is the receptor subunit rather than the channel.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation to GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" for TOMM20 is
      misleading and represents an over-annotation. The cited paper (Yano et al.
      2003, PMID:14557246) is primarily about AIP (arylhydrocarbon
      receptor-interacting protein), not Tom20. The paper demonstrates that AIP
      is the protein with chaperone-like activity that suppresses thermal
      aggregation of substrate proteins and binds unfolded proteins. Tom20 is
      shown to bind mitochondrial preproteins via their N-terminal presequences
      (targeting signals), not based on their folding state. The binding groove
      of Tom20 recognizes the hydrophobic face of amphiphilic helical
      presequences through hydrophobic interactions, which is a signal
      sequence recognition function, not an unfolded protein sensing function.
      The paper explicitly states that Tom20 binds preproteins and non-mitochondrial
      proteins were not bound, demonstrating specificity for mitochondrial targeting
      signals rather than unfolded protein states per se. Furthermore, TOMM20
      already has the correct and more specific annotation to GO:0030943
      "mitochondrion targeting sequence binding" (IDA from PMID:35733257 and
      IBA from GO_REF:0000033). The GO:0051082 term is being obsoleted
      (go-ontology issue 30962) precisely because it conflates signal recognition
      with chaperone activity. TOMM20 is a protein import receptor, not a
      chaperone.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      TOMM20 does not function as an unfolded protein binding chaperone. The
      evidence in PMID:14557246 shows Tom20 recognizes mitochondrial
      presequences via hydrophobic interactions with the amphiphilic helical
      targeting signal. The paper states: "The binding groove of Tom20 mainly
      consists of a TPR and a glutamine-rich segment, and hydrophobic residues
      in the groove interact with the hydrophobic face of the amphiphilic
      helical presequence" and "AIP as well as Tom20 binds specifically to
      mitochondrial preproteins" while "no or little binding of AIP and Tom20
      to proteins destined for other organelles" was observed. This
      demonstrates signal-specific recognition, not general unfolded protein
      binding. The chaperone-like aggregation suppression activity described in
      the paper belongs to AIP, not Tom20. TOMM20 already has the correct
      annotation GO:0030943 "mitochondrion targeting sequence binding" which
      accurately captures its molecular function. GO:0051082 is being

          AIP was found to function as a chaperone to suppress thermal
          aggregation of rhodanese and citrate synthase (Fig. 6). AIP may
          function as a chaperone to maintain mitochondria-targeted
          preproteins unfolded and to suppress their aggregation.

          Preproteins with NH2-terminal presequences are initially
          recognized by the receptor Tom20, although preproteins with
          internal targeting signals such as carrier proteins are
          recognized preferentially by Tom70.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation from PMID:14557246 (Yano et al. 2003). The paper
      demonstrates that Tom20 recognizes preproteins via their mitochondrial
      targeting sequences and is part of the TOM complex that facilitates
      protein import. GO:0070585 "protein localization to mitochondrion" is a
      broad process term that accurately describes the outcome of TOMM20
      activity. While more specific terms like GO:0006626 "protein targeting
      to mitochondrion" or GO:0030150 "protein import into mitochondrial
      matrix" are also appropriate, this broader term is not incorrect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct. TOMM20 facilitates protein localization to the mitochondrion
      by recognizing mitochondrial targeting sequences. This is a core
      biological process for TOMM20.

  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation from PMID:7498524 (Seki et al. 1995), one of the original
      papers identifying human TOMM20 (then called Mom19 homolog). The paper
      showed that the human Mom19 homolog is targeted to yeast mitochondria and
      specifically associates with the outer membrane receptor complex. This
      was the original identification of human TOMM20 as a TOM complex component.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct. This is the foundational paper identifying human TOMM20 as a
      component of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase complex.

- description: >-
    TOMM20 is the primary presequence receptor of the TOM complex. Its cytosolic
    TPR-containing domain recognizes the hydrophobic face of amphiphilic helical
    N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences on nuclear-encoded preproteins,
    facilitating their transfer to TOMM22 and into the TOMM40 translocation pore
    for import into the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane.

        both Tom20 and Tom22 were pulled down by the DHFR-EGFP protein fused
        with the presequence of subunit 9 of F0-ATPase (Su9) (42), but not by
        DHFR-EGFP protein without Su9, suggesting that Tom22 indeed forms a
