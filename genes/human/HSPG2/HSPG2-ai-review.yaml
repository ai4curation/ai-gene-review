description: Perlecan is a massive heparan sulfate proteoglycan (468 kDa, 4391 amino acids) that functions as a critical structural organizer and signaling hub of basement membranes throughout the body. The protein contains five structurally distinct domains that enable diverse functions through interactions with extracellular matrix components (laminin, type IV collagen, nidogens, fibrillin-1) and cell surface receptors. Heparan sulfate chains attached primarily to domain I (at serines 65, 71, 76) and domain V create high negative charge density essential for basement membrane hydration and charge-based filtration, particularly in the glomerular basement membrane. These heparan sulfate chains sequester and present growth factors (FGF-2, FGF-18, VEGF, BMP, PDGF) to their cognate receptors, forming ternary complexes that activate downstream signaling cascades regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Domain III binds FGF-18 and PDGF through its core protein. Perlecan plays essential roles in growth plate development and endochondral ossification by modulating FGF receptor signaling and enabling vascular invasion required for bone formation. At neuromuscular junctions, perlecan localizes acetylcholinesterase and maintains synaptic stability. Proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin L and BMP1-tolloid metalloproteinases generates endorepellin (domain V fragment) and LG3 peptide, which exhibit anti-angiogenic activity opposing the pro-angiogenic function of full-length perlecan through dual antagonism of VEGFR2 and α2β1 integrin. Loss-of-function mutations cause dyssegmental dysplasia (Silverman-Handmaker type, typically perinatally lethal), while hypomorphic mutations cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome characterized by chondrodysplasia and myotonia.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping. Perlecan has dual pro- and anti-angiogenic roles. Full-length perlecan promotes angiogenesis through its heparan sulfate chains that bind and present VEGF and FGF-2 to their receptors. Proteolytically cleaved endorepellin (domain V) exhibits potent anti-angiogenic activity through dual antagonism of VEGFR2 and α2β1 integrin. Deep research extensively documents both activities.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core function of perlecan. Despite the dual nature (both pro- and anti-angiogenic depending on proteolytic state), perlecan is fundamentally involved in angiogenesis regulation. The term captures the biological process without specifying direction, which is appropriate given perlecan's context-dependent activities.

    summary: IEA annotation from InterPro domain IPR001881 (EGF-like calcium-binding domain). Perlecan domain V contains multiple EGF-like repeats that may have calcium-binding capacity. However, calcium binding is not a characterized or functionally important activity for perlecan. UniProt does not list calcium as a cofactor.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While perlecan contains EGF-like domains that structurally may bind calcium, this is not a characterized molecular function of perlecan and does not contribute to its known biological activities.

  review:
    summary: ISS annotation based on sequence similarity to mouse orthologs. This term suggests perlecan negatively regulates cholinergic transmission. Perlecan localizes acetylcholinesterase which terminates cholinergic signaling, but this is enabling proper termination rather than negative regulation of transmission itself.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The relationship between perlecan and cholinergic transmission regulation is complex. Perlecan anchors AChE which breaks down acetylcholine, but whether this constitutes "negative regulation" of transmission or proper homeostatic control is unclear. Would need access to the mouse orthologue studies to evaluate this annotation properly.

  review:
    summary: IC annotation from PMID:21289173 demonstrating that perlecan (as HSPG) binds amyloid-beta peptide. The paper shows that heparan sulfate chains of perlecan mediate Aβ binding to cell surfaces, with HSPG being more important for Aβ binding than LRP1. Heparan sulfate binds the HHQK (amino acids 13-16) region of Aβ.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-characterized molecular function relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Perlecan's heparan sulfate chains bind amyloid-beta with functional consequences for Aβ aggregation, plaque formation, and neuronal uptake. This is a specific and important molecular function, though not a core developmental/structural function.

    summary: TAS annotation from PMID:21126803 on endorepellin. Endorepellin (perlecan domain V) exhibits potent anti-angiogenic activity through dual antagonism of VEGFR2 and α2β1 integrin, opposing the pro-angiogenic function of full-length perlecan.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-characterized function of endorepellin. While full-length perlecan promotes angiogenesis, proteolytic cleavage generates endorepellin which negatively regulates angiogenesis. This represents an important biological switch in perlecan function and is a core activity of the endorepellin fragment.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Non-core localization. While heparanase 2 binds perlecan's heparan sulfate chains, this interaction occurs wherever perlecan is localized (primarily ECM/basement membranes).

    reason: Non-core localization. This documents a degradative trafficking pathway.
