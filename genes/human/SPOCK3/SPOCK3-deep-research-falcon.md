### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BQ16
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Testican-3; AltName: Full=SPARC/osteonectin, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan 3; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SPOCK3; Synonyms=TICN3; ORFNames=UNQ409/PRO771;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** EF-hand-dom_pair. (IPR011992); Kazal_dom. (IPR002350); Kazal_dom_sf. (IPR036058); SPARC/Testican_Ca-bd-dom. (IPR019577); Thyroglobulin_1. (IPR000716)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SPOCK3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SPOCK3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SPOCK3** (gene ID: SPOCK3, UniProt: Q9BQ16) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: SPOCK3 (Testican‑3; UniProt Q9BQ16) in human

Identity verification and domain architecture
SPOCK3 encodes the secreted proteoglycan Testican‑3, a member of the SPOCK (testican) family of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins (SPOCK1–3). It contains a SPARC/osteonectin extracellular module (SPARC_EC), a conserved CWCV motif, a Kazal‑like domain, and a thyroglobulin type‑1 (TY) domain; it is synthesized with an N‑terminal signal peptide, consistent with secretion. Literature places human SPOCK3 at 4q32.3 and highlights alternative splice forms, including N‑Tes (a functionally distinct isoform). These features agree with the UniProt Q9BQ16 description and confirm correct entity selection (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 6-9).

Key concepts and functions (current understanding)
- Primary biochemical role: SPOCK3/Testican‑3 is a secreted ECM proteoglycan that modulates pericellular proteolysis by inhibiting membrane‑type MMP–mediated activation of pro‑MMP‑2 (notably MT1‑MMP and MT3‑MMP). The N‑Tes splice variant carries an inhibitory sequence that suppresses MT‑MMP–driven MMP‑2 activation, thereby limiting ECM degradation and invasion. Testican‑family cross‑talk has been reported in which testican‑2 can negate MT‑MMP inhibition by other testicans. These mechanisms position SPOCK3 as a regulator of ECM remodeling with potential anti‑invasive effects (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 12-12, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 9-10, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 6-9).
- Pathways: In human prostate cancer transcriptomic cohorts, SPOCK3‑associated genes are enriched in collagen‑containing ECM organization and PI3K‑Akt and MAPK signaling, implicating SPOCK3 in ECM–signaling crosstalk relevant to tumor biology (luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).

Subcellular/extracellular localization and tissue expression
- Localization: SPOCK3 is secreted to the extracellular space/ECM. In human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, proteomics and immunohistochemistry localize SPOCK3 to plaque microenvironments, with staining of dystrophic neurites and co‑localization with tau aggregates, indicating perineuritic/periplaque ECM association (levites2024integrativeproteomicsidentifies, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101669) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15). Additional human postmortem analyses report regional enrichment (highest in hippocampus) and overlap with 50–60% of Aβ plaques, supporting a robust extracellular, plaque‑adjacent localization (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation, Jul 2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05231-7) (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation pages 11-13).
- Tissue expression: SPOCK3 expression is high in brain and is detectable in prostate (epithelial—especially basal—and stromal compartments including smooth muscle, vascular cells, and mast cells), with reports of expression in adrenal and ovary. Adult brain regional expression includes olfactory bulb, cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Prostate cancer prognosis and tumor microenvironment: A 2023 BMC Cancer analysis of TCGA/GEO datasets identified SPOCK3 as a protective factor for disease‑free survival (DFS). Patients with lower SPOCK3 expression had worse prognosis; SPOCK3 remained an independent prognostic factor alongside T stage and Gleason score in multivariate Cox models. SPOCK3 expression correlated positively with stromal/immune scores and higher infiltration of mast cells, NK cells, and B cells; enrichment analyses highlighted ECM and PI3K‑Akt/MAPK pathways (luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).
- CNS disease proteomics: Integrative proteomics in 2024 localized SPOCK3 to AD neuritic plaques and dystrophic neurites, placing it among plaque‑associated ECM proteins that may participate in amyloid/tau pathology microenvironments (levites2024integrativeproteomicsidentifies, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101669) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15). Region‑specific human postmortem data (published 2025, but relevant) showed hippocampal enrichment, colocalization with tau, and overlap with 50–60% of plaques, supporting a role in AD lesion ECM remodeling (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation, Jul 2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05231-7) (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation pages 11-13).
- Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions: An MS lesion transcriptomic survey in 2024 identified widespread ECM changes and highlighted SPARC family proteins among highly altered ECM members, supporting a role for SPOCK family in neuroinflammation‑associated ECM remodeling (stephenson2024uncoveringnovelextracellular, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25021240) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15).
- Mechanistic reviews and ECM context: A 2024 review summarized the SPOCK family’s modular domains and their capacity to regulate MT‑MMP/MMP‑2 activity, and a 2024 Nature Reviews MCB article contextualized SPOCK/testicans within ECM assembly and remodeling frameworks (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; naba2024mechanismsofassembly, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00767-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 12-12).

Applications and real‑world implementations
- Oncology biomarker (prostate cancer): The 2023 BMC Cancer study constructed a nomogram incorporating SPOCK3 expression, T stage, and Gleason score to predict DFS, reporting favorable calibration and ROC performance across 2–5‑year horizons. While SPOCK3 is not yet a clinical test, these results support its potential as a prognostic biomarker and as a correlate of immune/stromal features in the tumor microenvironment (luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).
- Neurodegeneration research: In 2024 proteomic workflows for AD human samples, SPOCK3 was part of an experimental panel of plaque‑enriched proteins detected by mass spectrometry and validated by immunostaining, demonstrating feasibility of detecting SPOCK3 in neuropathological contexts (levites2024integrativeproteomicsidentifies, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101669) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- The 2024 SPOCK family review synthesizes structural domains, tissue distribution, and mechanistic links to MMP regulation, underscoring SPOCK3’s likely role as an extracellular regulator of pericellular proteolysis; it also notes lesser characterization relative to SPOCK1/2 and highlights N‑Tes as a key inhibitory isoform (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 9-10, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 6-9).
- The 2024 Nature Reviews MCB article situates SPOCK/testican proteoglycans in ECM assembly/remodeling, emphasizing their contribution to matrix organization and cell–matrix signaling (naba2024mechanismsofassembly, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00767-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 12-12).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Prostate cancer DFS: Low SPOCK3 expression associated with inferior DFS; SPOCK3 remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox analysis. The study reports construction of a nomogram and ROC AUCs for 2/3/5‑year DFS prediction; enrichment linked SPOCK3 to ECM and PI3K‑Akt/MAPK pathways. SPOCK3 expression correlated positively with stromal and immune scores and with higher infiltration of mast, NK, and B cells (luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).
- AD plaque localization: SPOCK3 overlapped with approximately 50–60% of Aβ plaques in human postmortem tissue, with highest burden in hippocampus, and co‑localized with tau aggregates and dystrophic neurites (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation, Jul 2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05231-7) (tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation pages 11-13). In 2024 Cell Reports Medicine, immunostaining showed SPOCK3/SPOCK1 within dystrophic neurites in AD, corroborating plaque‑associated localization (levites2024integrativeproteomicsidentifies, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101669) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15).

Functional synthesis: primary role, substrates/partners, and pathways
- Primary function: Non‑enzymatic, structural/modulatory ECM proteoglycan that regulates pericellular proteolysis by inhibiting MT‑MMP‑dependent activation of MMP‑2, thereby stabilizing ECM/basement membrane integrity and constraining invasion/migration in pathologic contexts. The N‑Tes isoform contains the critical inhibitory sequence. Partners include MT1‑MMP/MT3‑MMP and downstream MMP‑2. Through ECM modulation, SPOCK3 associates with signaling pathways (PI3K‑Akt, MAPK) in cancer transcriptomes (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; luo2023mechanismofprognostic, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-11151-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 9-10, luo2023mechanismofprognostic pages 1-2).
- Site of action: Extracellular space/ECM, including pericellular basement membrane regions; in brain, enriched around plaques and dystrophic neurites (levites2024integrativeproteomicsidentifies, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101669; tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation, Jul 2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05231-7) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 11-15, tsering2025brainregionspecificaccumulation pages 11-13).

Limitations and open questions
- Compared with SPOCK1/2, SPOCK3 remains less extensively characterized; many pathway attributions derive from bioinformatic enrichment or from closely related family members. Further biochemical dissection of domain contributions (SPARC_EC, Kazal, TY) and in vivo human studies are needed to confirm the breadth of MT‑MMP/MMP‑2 regulation across tissues (xiao2024spockmasterregulator, Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 6-9).

Conclusion
Human SPOCK3/Testican‑3 (Q9BQ16) is a secreted ECM proteoglycan with SPARC_EC, Kazal‑like, and TY domains that regulates matrix remodeling by inhibiting MT‑MMP–mediated activation of MMP‑2. It localizes extracellularly, with prominent expression in brain and prostate; in AD it accumulates in plaque microenvironments and dystrophic neurites. In prostate cancer, higher SPOCK3 expression associates with better DFS and a more stromal/immune‑rich microenvironment. Recent 2023–2024 studies consolidate SPOCK3’s role at the intersection of ECM proteolysis and disease microenvironments, and support continued exploration of SPOCK3 as a biomarker and mechanistic node in ECM‑linked signaling.
