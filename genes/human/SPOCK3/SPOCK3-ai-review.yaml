description: 'SPOCK3 (testican-3) is a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan that functions as a tumor-suppressive metalloendopeptidase inhibitor. It inhibits membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP), thereby preventing pro-MMP-2 activation and blocking tumor invasion. The protein contains a modular architecture including follistatin-like domain, acidic region, EC calcium-binding domains, Kazal-like protease inhibitor domain, and thyroglobulin type-1 domain. SPOCK3 carries chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and is highly expressed in normal brain, with expression decreasing in gliomas. A splice variant (N-Tes, isoform 2) lacks the thyroglobulin domain but retains MMP inhibitory activity. Unlike testican-2 (SPOCK2), which counteracts MMP inhibition, SPOCK3 shares with testican-1 (SPOCK1) the key function of suppressing MT-MMP-mediated tumor invasion and cell motility through direct interaction with MT-MMPs.'

    summary: SPOCK3 is a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan. UniProt states "Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular matrix" and this is consistent with its function as an ECM-localized MMP inhibitor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core cellular component annotation for SPOCK3. The protein is secreted into the ECM where it carries out its primary function of inhibiting membrane-type MMPs. This localization is essential for its tumor-suppressive role and is supported by phylogenetic inference (IBA) as well as experimental evidence from PMID:11751414 showing SPOCK3/N-Tes is deposited on collagen and from PMID:12810672 demonstrating ECM deposition. The annotation is further supported by high-throughput proteomics studies (PMID:32055794, PMID:33266304) identifying SPOCK3 in ECM fractions.

  review:
    summary: This is THE core molecular function of SPOCK3. Experimentally demonstrated to inhibit MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP, preventing pro-MMP-2 activation. This is the key tumor-suppressive function of SPOCK3.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is absolutely a core function annotation that must be retained. SPOCK3 was originally characterized as an inhibitor of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (PMID:11751414). The paper demonstrates direct interaction of SPOCK3/N-Tes with MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP, inhibiting their ability to activate pro-MMP-2. PMID:12810672 confirms this function is common among testican family members except testican-2. UniProt states "Inhibits the processing of pro-matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) by MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP." This metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity is the mechanistic basis for SPOCK3's tumor suppression and represents its primary molecular function. The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence.

  review:
    summary: SPOCK3 regulates cell-substrate adhesion through its interactions with ECM components and its MMP inhibitory activity. The IBA annotation appears to be based on SPOCK1/testican-1 data.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is reasonable and supported by the biology of SPOCK3. While the direct experimental evidence for SPOCK3 focuses more on cell motility (see GO:2000146), cell-substrate adhesion and cell motility are mechanistically linked processes. PMID:12810672 shows that "Migration of U251 cells on collagen, which was dependent on MT1-MMP activity under serum-free condition, was inhibited by N-Tes or N-Tes-Delta 122 deposited on collagen." This demonstrates SPOCK3 affects cell-substrate interactions on collagen. The IBA annotation likely reflects conserved function across testican family members, particularly with SPOCK1 (testican-1), which has similar ECM and MMP-regulatory functions. Given SPOCK3's role as an ECM proteoglycan that binds collagen and regulates MT-MMP activity, it is reasonable that it regulates cell-substrate adhesion as part of its biological role.

  review:
    summary: SPOCK3 is a secreted protein located in the extracellular space. UniProt annotation confirms "Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular matrix."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an accurate cellular component annotation. SPOCK3 has a signal peptide (residues 1-21) and is secreted into the extracellular space where it localizes to the extracellular matrix. This annotation (GO:0005615 extracellular space) is the parent term of GO:0031012 (extracellular matrix), so both annotations are correct and complementary. The IBA annotation is supported by phylogenetic inference across testican family members, all of which are secreted ECM proteins.

    summary: SPOCK3 contains EC (extracellular) calcium-binding domains. The protein is described in PMID:11751414 as a "calcium-binding proteoglycan" and the N-Tes variant includes the Ca2+-binding domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-supported molecular function annotation. SPOCK3 is explicitly described as a "calcium-binding proteoglycan" in PMID:11751414. The UniProt entry indicates SPOCK3 contains EC calcium-binding domains (InterPro:IPR019577), which are characteristic of the SPARC/testican family. The protein structure includes EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. PMID:12810672 demonstrates that testican-2 inactivates N-Tes "by binding to the COOH-terminal extracellular calcium-binding domain of N-Tes," confirming this domain is present and functionally important. The IBA annotation reflects the conserved calcium-binding capability across all testican family members.

  review:
    summary: This is a broad parent term of the more specific GO:0008191 (metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity). SPOCK3 does have enzyme inhibitor activity via its MMP inhibition.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping is correct but very general. GO:0004857 (enzyme inhibitor activity) is a broad molecular function term that encompasses GO:0008191 (metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity) and GO:0030414 (peptidase inhibitor activity). Since SPOCK3 is experimentally confirmed to inhibit metalloendopeptidases (MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP), this parent term is accurate. The annotation is less informative than the more specific child terms, but it is not incorrect. It's acceptable to retain both general and specific terms in GO annotation to capture the full hierarchy.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a duplicate GO ID annotation but from a different evidence pipeline (IEA from InterPro vs IBA from phylogenetic inference). Both are correct. The IEA annotation is based on the presence of InterPro domain IPR019577 (SPARC/Testican_Ca-bd-dom), which maps to calcium ion binding function. Having multiple evidence codes for the same function from independent sources (domain-based inference and phylogenetic inference) strengthens confidence in the annotation. This is standard practice in GO annotation - duplicates with different evidence codes are acceptable and informative.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a duplicate annotation of GO:0008191 (metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity) but from ARBA (Association Rule-Based Annotator) machine learning models. The same GO term appears with IBA evidence code (phylogenetic) reviewed earlier. Having multiple independent evidence sources (IBA phylogenetic inference, IEA from ARBA machine learning, and TAS experimental from PMID:12810672) all converging on the same core function provides very strong support for this annotation. This metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity is THE defining molecular function of SPOCK3. Multiple evidence codes for the same critical function are valuable and appropriate.

    summary: Parent term of metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity. SPOCK3 contains Kazal-like and thyroglobulin type-1 domains which are protease inhibitor domains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an accurate annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping to "Protease inhibitor" and "Metalloprotease inhibitor" keywords. GO:0030414 (peptidase inhibitor activity) is the parent term of GO:0008191 (metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity), which is more specific. Since SPOCK3 inhibits metallopeptidases (a subclass of peptidases), the broader peptidase inhibitor activity term is also correct. Additionally, SPOCK3 contains a Kazal-like domain (residues 133-185) and a thyroglobulin type-1 domain (residues 314-380), both of which are protease inhibitor domains found in the MEROPS database (I01.980 and I31.007). This structural evidence supports the general peptidase inhibitor activity annotation.

  review:
    summary: SPOCK3 is a proteoglycan that carries chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate GAG chains. The annotation is inferred from mouse ortholog.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct based on SPOCK3's nature as a proteoglycan. UniProt states "Contains chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate O-linked oligosaccharides" and indicates putative GAG attachment sites at Ser387 and Ser392. As a proteoglycan, SPOCK3 has glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains covalently attached to its protein core. These GAG chains can interact with other molecules, giving the protein glycosaminoglycan binding capability. The IEA annotation is transferred from the mouse ortholog (Spock3, UniProtKB:Q8BKV0) via Ensembl Compara. While this is computational inference, it is well-supported by SPOCK3's biochemical nature as a heparan/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, which is consistent across species.

SPOCK3's identification in this independent high-throughput matrisome study provides additional experimental validation of its ECM localization. Multiple HDA annotations from different proteomics studies (PMID:32055794 and PMID:33266304) plus phylogenetic inference (IBA) provide very strong, convergent evidence for SPOCK3's ECM localization.

This is one of the key experimental papers characterizing SPOCK3's MMP inhibitory function. The paper states "The inhibitory function is common among testican family members except for testican 2" and demonstrates that SPOCK3 (along with testican-1 and N-Tes) inhibits MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP mediated pro-MMP-2 activation. Having TAS experimental evidence in addition to IBA (phylogenetic) and IEA (computational) annotations provides the strongest possible support for this core molecular function. This is THE defining activity of SPOCK3 and is crucial for its tumor-suppressive role.

    summary: SPOCK3 negatively regulates cell motility through its MMP inhibitory activity. This is a key tumor-suppressive biological process.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an important biological process annotation with TAS experimental evidence from PMID:12810672. The paper demonstrates that "Migration of U251 cells on collagen, which was dependent on MT1-MMP activity under serum-free condition, was inhibited by N-Tes or N-Tes-Delta 122 deposited on collagen." PMID:11751414 also shows that "Transfection of either the N-Tes or testican 3 gene into U251 glioma cells or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transformed by erbB2 suppressed their invasive growth in collagen gel." These data clearly demonstrate SPOCK3's role in negatively regulating cell motility, which is mechanistically linked to its metalloendopeptidase inhibitor activity. By inhibiting MT-MMPs, SPOCK3 prevents cells from degrading ECM components necessary for migration, thereby blocking cell motility and tumor invasion. This is a core biological process function.
