description: >-
  RAB9A encodes a small GTPase of the Rab family that functions as a molecular switch
  cycling between
  GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive states. RAB9A is primarily localized to
  late endosomes and
  the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where it regulates retrograde transport of mannose-6-phosphate
  receptors
  (MPRs) from late endosomes to the TGN. This recycling pathway is essential for lysosome
  biogenesis
  as it returns MPRs to the TGN where they can capture newly synthesized lysosomal
  hydrolases.
  RAB9A uses multiple effectors including TIP47/PLIN3 for cargo selection, GCC185/GCC2
  for vesicle
  tethering at the TGN, p40/RABEPK for transport regulation, and NDE1/NDEL1 for linking
  late endosomes
  to the dynein motor complex for microtubule-based retrograde transport. RAB9A also
  plays roles in
  melanosome biogenesis, phagosome maturation, and is exploited by various pathogens
  including HIV-1,
  filoviruses, and human papillomavirus during their replication cycles.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      The primary function of RAB9A is to regulate retrograde transport from late
      endosomes
      to the trans-Golgi network. This is essential for recycling mannose-6-phosphate
      receptors (MPRs) that deliver lysosomal hydrolases. RAB9A recruits effectors
      including
      TIP47/PLIN3 for cargo selection, GCC185/GCC2 for vesicle tethering at the TGN,
      and
      NDE1/NDEL1 for linking vesicles to the dynein motor for microtubule-based transport.

      GTP binding converts RAB9A to its active state, enabling recruitment of effector
      proteins. The GTP-bound form specifically interacts with effectors including
      NDE1,
      RUTBC1, RUTBC2, HPS4, and GCC185 to carry out its trafficking functions.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What are the specific GEFs and GAPs that regulate RAB9A activity in mammalian
      cells?
      While the RAB9A regulatory cycle is understood conceptually, the specific GEFs
      and
      GAPs have not been as well characterized as for other Rab GTPases like Rab7.
  - question: >-
      How do RAB9A and retromer (VPS35/VPS26/VPS29) coordinate to ensure efficient
      MPR recycling?
      Both RAB9A and retromer have been implicated in endosome-to-TGN transport but
      they
      show limited colocalization. Understanding their functional relationship would
      clarify the retrograde transport machinery.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      CRISPR knockout of RAB9A in human cell lines followed by quantitative proteomics
      to identify changes in lysosomal enzyme delivery and MPR stability. This would
      provide
      definitive evidence for RAB9A function in human cells and identify additional
      cargo
      proteins affected by RAB9A loss.
  - description: >-
      Live-cell imaging of RAB9A dynamics on late endosome-derived transport vesicles
      to characterize the temporal relationship with effector recruitment and fusion
      at TGN.
      This would provide mechanistic insight into the sequence of events during RAB9A-mediated
      retrograde transport.
