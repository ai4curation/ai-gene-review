description: >-
  SDHC encodes the large cytochrome b560 transmembrane subunit of succinate dehydrogenase
  (SDH, Complex II), a heterotetrameric enzyme (SDHA/SDHB/SDHC/SDHD) embedded in the
  mitochondrial inner membrane. Together with SDHD, SDHC forms the membrane anchor domain
  of Complex II, contributing to the ubiquinone (CoQ) binding site and harboring the heme b
  (cytochrome b560) prosthetic group shared between the two membrane subunits. SDHC has
  three transmembrane helices and provides key residues (Ile56, Trp61, Met65, Ile69) that
  directly contact ubiquinone at the Q-site. The heme b is axially coordinated by His127 of
  SDHC and the corresponding histidine of SDHD. SDHC has no independent catalytic activity;
  its role is structural (membrane anchoring, heme environment, Q-site formation). Complex II
  uniquely links the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain by catalyzing succinate
  oxidation to fumarate (at SDHA) and transferring electrons to ubiquinone at the SDHC/SDHD
  membrane interface, but does NOT pump protons. SDHC functions as a tumor suppressor;
  germline loss-of-function mutations and promoter hypermethylation cause paraganglioma/
  pheochromocytoma (PPGL3), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and Carney triad, via
  succinate accumulation and pseudohypoxic signaling.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for the biological process of electron transport from succinate to
      ubiquinone. This is the defining biological process for Complex II/SDH in the
      mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHC, together with SDHD, forms the membrane
      arm where ubiquinone is ultimately reduced to ubiquinol. SDHC provides key residues
      (Ile56, Trp61, Met65, Ile69) that directly contact ubiquinone at the Q-site
      (PMID:37098072). The heme b coordinated by His127 of SDHC may serve as an electron
      sink during the two-electron reduction of ubiquinone (PMID:37098072). The IBA is
      phylogenetically supported with evidence from orthologous SDH cytochrome b560 subunits.
    action: ACCEPT

      This is a core biological process for SDHC. SDHC is essential for the terminal step

      SDHC contributes to electron transfer within Complex II by harboring the heme b
      prosthetic group (axially coordinated by His127 of SDHC) and providing residues that
      form the ubiquinone binding pocket. The heme b serves as an electron sink that
      stabilizes the semiquinone radical during the two-electron reduction of ubiquinone

      in a high-throughput screen focused on neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins. SDHC
      is a small transmembrane mitochondrial protein with limited cytoplasmic exposure; direct
      physical interactions with nuclear/cytoplasmic proteins like PRKCA, YWHAG, KAT5, SETDB1,

      (residues 30-65) faces the matrix, the majority of the protein consists of three
      transmembrane helices spanning the membrane. Describing SDHC as 'is_active_in' the

      atom. The heme b is shared between SDHC and SDHD, with each subunit providing one
      histidine as an axial ligand. The cryo-EM structure (PMID:37098072, PDB:8GS8) directly
      confirmed the heme b binding site in the SDHC/SDHD interface. UniProt annotates the
      binding site at residue 127 with evidence ECO:0000269|PubMed:37098072. The heme b is
      important for protein stability and may serve as an electron sink during ubiquinone

  description: >-
    SDHC is the large cytochrome b560 transmembrane subunit of succinate dehydrogenase
    (Complex II). Together with SDHD, it forms the membrane anchor domain that anchors the
    catalytic SDHA:SDHB subcomplex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. SDHC provides the
    His127 axial ligand to the heme b (cytochrome b560) iron atom shared between SDHC and
    SDHD, making heme binding (GO:0020037) its primary subunit-specific molecular function.
    SDHC also contributes to ubiquinone binding at the Q-site (residues Ile56, Trp61, Met65,
    Ile69 directly contact ubiquinone) and to the overall succinate dehydrogenase (quinone)
    activity (GO:0008177) of the Complex II heterotetramer. The heme b is proposed to serve
    as an electron sink during the two-electron reduction of ubiquinone. Through Complex II,
    SDHC participates in mitochondrial electron transport from succinate to ubiquinone
    (GO:0006121) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (GO:0006099).
