## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q99643
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b560 subunit, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=Integral membrane protein CII-3; AltName: Full=Malate dehydrogenase [quinone] cytochrome b560 subunit; AltName: Full=QPs-1; Short=QPs1; AltName: Full=Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C; AltName: Full=Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase cytochrome B large subunit; Short=CYBL; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SDHC; Synonyms=CYB560, SDH3;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the cytochrome b560 family. .
- **Key Domains:** SQR/QFR_C/D. (IPR034804); Succ_DH_cyt_bsu_CS. (IPR018495); Succ_DH_cytb556. (IPR014314); SuccDH_FuR_B_TM-su. (IPR000701); Sdh_cyt (PF01127)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SDHC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SDHC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SDHC** (gene ID: SDHC, UniProt: Q99643) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: SDHC (Human; UniProt Q99643)

Identity verification and basic definition
- Correct gene/protein: SDHC encodes the membrane-embedded cytochrome b560 subunit of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II), forming the membrane arm with SDHD. It houses the heme b (cytochrome b560) and contributes to the ubiquinone-binding pocket (the Q-pool site). SDHC’s role as a lipophilic anchoring subunit and cytochrome b560 carrier is explicitly described in recent peer‑reviewed sources, confirming alignment with the UniProt description and cytochrome b560 family membership (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Primary enzymatic function (Complex II): Succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) uniquely links the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC) by catalyzing succinate oxidation to fumarate (at SDHA, with covalently bound FAD) and transferring electrons via SDHB’s three Fe–S clusters to reduce ubiquinone (CoQ) to ubiquinol in the membrane arm (SDHC/SDHD). Complex II does not directly pump protons but supports the proton motive force via the reduced CoQ pool (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6).
- SDHC’s specific mechanistic role: SDHC, together with SDHD, anchors the enzyme to the inner mitochondrial membrane and provides the heme b (cytochrome b560) environment and quinone-binding site needed for ubiquinone reduction. Multiple recent reviews affirm SDHC’s membrane anchoring and cytochrome b560 identity and involvement in the quinone site (Antioxidants, 2025-01; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox14010076; Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (osz2025mutationsofthe pages 2-4, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization: Complex II is an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) complex; SDHC and SDHD are the transmembrane subunits of the IMM arm (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6).
- Pathways: SDHC functions in both the TCA cycle (through SDH activity linking succinate→fumarate) and the ETC (electron transfer to the CoQ pool), thus integrating central carbon metabolism with oxidative phosphorylation (Cell Biology & Toxicology, 2025-04; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-025-10022-w) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).

Structural and mechanistic insights (Q sites, heme, subunit interplay)
- Quinone sites: The ubiquinone-binding pocket of Complex II resides in the membrane arm formed by SDHC and SDHD; this “Q-pool active site” accommodates ubiquinone/ubiquinol interconversion during catalysis (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3).
- Heme b (cytochrome b560): SDHC is recognized as the cytochrome b560 subunit, and alternative splicing that removes an SDHC heme-binding region reduces SDH activity, emphasizing the functional importance of cytochrome b/heme in electron transfer within the membrane arm (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 3-4).
- SDHC–SDHD interaction and electron flow: Electrons from FADH2 (SDHA) traverse SDHB’s Fe–S clusters to the quinone-binding pocket where SDHC/SDHD stabilize and reduce CoQ, forming ubiquinol that fuels Complex III; recent comparative cell-model work confirms membrane-arm participation in ubiquinone handling and that loss of SDHC disrupts SDH activity with succinate accumulation (Cancer & Metabolism, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40170-024-00369-9) (khazal2024similardeficienciesdifferent pages 12-14).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Disease associations and mechanisms: Contemporary reviews and models reaffirm that germline or somatic SDHx defects—including in SDHC—drive PPGL, GIST, pituitary tumors, and rare RCC, via succinate accumulation that inhibits α‑ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases, stabilizing HIFα (pseudohypoxia) and inducing broad histone/DNA hypermethylation programs (Cancer & Metabolism, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40170-024-00369-9) (khazal2024similardeficienciesdifferent pages 12-14), and (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 8-9).
- SDHC promoter hypermethylation (“epimutations”): Recognized as a recurrent cause of SDH-deficient GIST and PPGL; modern reviews and scoping papers cite SDHC promoter hypermethylation in Carney triad and related contexts, with decreased SDHC mRNA expression (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-03; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1093974; Human Molecular Genetics, 2020-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa201) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6). Recent synthesis also highlights SDHC “epimutant” cases and alternative splicing impacting the heme region (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 3-4, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3).
- PPGL guidelines and consensus in the SDHx era: Recent expert statements prioritize gene-guided surveillance and multidisciplinary care. While a 2024 international consensus focuses on SDHB carriers, it situates practices within broader SDHx management frameworks used by Endocrine Society and allied groups (Nature Reviews Endocrinology, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-023-00926-0) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3). Additional 2024 reviews emphasize high yield of multigene panels for PPGL predisposition genes including SDHC and the need for longitudinal penetrance data (Endocrine Oncology, 2024-01; URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/eo-24-0029) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).
- SDH-deficient GIST and clinical genomics: 2024 analyses document practical value of next-generation sequencing and highlight the diversity of non‑KIT/PDGFRA drivers; SDH-deficient subsets remain a key molecular category with distinct management implications (Cancers, 2024-04; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091707) (no direct mechanistic SDHC data but supports clinical implementation) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Immunohistochemistry (IHC): Bi-allelic inactivation of any SDH subunit (including SDHC) typically results in loss of SDHB protein detectable by IHC, which is widely used as a screening marker to identify SDH-deficient tumors across sites; this practical diagnostic principle is reiterated in recent literature syntheses (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 3-4).
- Genetic testing and sequencing panels: Routine multigene testing for PPGL/GIST now includes SDHC alongside other SDHx genes; 2024 clinical exome panel reports and reviews illustrate real-world pipelines for patient work‑up and family management (Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2024.12784; Endocrine Oncology, 2024-01; URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/eo-24-0029) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).
- Methylation profiling and metabolomics: Recognition of SDHC promoter hypermethylation supports methylation-based assays; metabolomics confirms succinate accumulation and is used to classify SDH-deficient PPGLs and to support variant interpretation (Hormone and Metabolic Research, 2019-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0926-3790) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).
- Imaging and targeted therapies: SDH-deficient tumors often overexpress angiogenic programs; anti-angiogenic agents such as sunitinib demonstrate activity in SDH-deficient settings; contemporary reviews and models link pseudohypoxia to these responses (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 8-9).

Expert opinions and analyses
- Consensus and guideline perspectives favor gene-informed surveillance schedules and modalities, with emphasis on high-risk SDHx carriers. While SDHB carries higher metastatic risk overall, SDHC carriers remain clinically important and require structured surveillance programs advised by expert groups (Nature Reviews Endocrinology, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-023-00926-0; Endocrine Oncology, 2024-01; URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/eo-24-0029) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).
- Mechanistic consensus: Contemporary overviews converge that SDHC’s disruption compromises the membrane arm’s quinone chemistry and redox routing, causing succinate accumulation and αKG-dioxygenase inhibition (pseudohypoxia and hypermethylation), central to SDH-deficient tumorigenesis (Cancer & Metabolism, 2024-12; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40170-024-00369-9; Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (khazal2024similardeficienciesdifferent pages 12-14, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 8-9).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data from recent studies
- SDH-deficient GIST proportion: Approximately 7–8% of GIST diagnoses are SDH-deficient; within these, SDHA is most frequently mutated, followed by SDHB, with additional cases due to SDHC mechanisms including promoter hypermethylation; a strong female and pediatric enrichment is noted in SDH‑deficient GIST (Journal of Cellular Physiology, 2025-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.70066) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 3-4).
- Epidemiology of PPGL: Modern systematic review estimates overall PPGL incidence ~0.6 per 100,000 per year in studies after 2010, reflecting increased detection and screening—contextualizing the growing yield of SDHx testing in practice (Journal of the Endocrine Society, 2022-07; URL: https://doi.org/10.1210/jendso/bvac105) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).
- Diagnostic genomics yield in PPGL: 2024 multi‑institution experiences show substantial identification of SDHx pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants using multigene panels and incidental findings in hereditary clinics, supporting widespread adoption in clinical workflows (Endocrine Oncology, 2024-01; URL: https://doi.org/10.1530/eo-24-0029) (wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3).

Notes on ambiguity check
- The gene symbol SDHC is sometimes used in non‑human contexts, but the sources evaluated here explicitly reference mammalian/human Complex II subunits and SDHC’s role as cytochrome b560. No contradictory gene/protein with the same symbol was identified in 2023–2024 sources consulted. The functional/structural attributes match the UniProt Q99643 entry (cytochrome b560 family; IMM localization; quinone site participation) (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6).

Conclusion
Human SDHC (UniProt Q99643) is the cytochrome b560 transmembrane subunit of mitochondrial Complex II that anchors the complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, harbors heme b, and contributes to the ubiquinone (Q) site where CoQ is reduced to CoQH2. Through Complex II activity, SDHC participates in succinate oxidation (succinate→fumarate) and electron transfer to the CoQ pool, integrating the TCA cycle with the ETC. Recent clinical/translational literature (2023–2024) underscores SDHC’s role in SDH‑deficient tumor biology (PPGL, GIST), including well‑documented SDHC promoter hypermethylation; real‑world implementations include SDHB‑IHC screening, multigene NGS panels that include SDHC, and emerging methylation/metabolomic assays. These practices are reinforced by current expert reviews and consensus statements advocating gene‑informed surveillance and management for SDHx‑related neoplasia (chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 1-3, wang2025sdhdefectivecancers pages 1-3, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 4-6, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 3-4, osz2025mutationsofthe pages 2-4, chatoff2025metaboliceffectsof pages 8-9, khazal2024similardeficienciesdifferent pages 12-14).
