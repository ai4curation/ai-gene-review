description: 'ISM2 encodes isthmin-2, a secreted glycoprotein (571 AA) belonging to
  the isthmin family. The protein contains two characteristic domains: a TSP type-1
  repeat (thrombospondin type-1, residues 327-371) and an AMOP domain (adhesion-associated
  domain shared by MUC4 and other proteins, residues 396-559). ISM2 is synthesized
  as a precursor with a signal peptide (residues 1-26) that is cleaved to produce
  the mature secreted protein (residues 27-571). The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation
  at three sites (Asn-117, Asn-300, Asn-392) and contains three conserved disulfide
  bonds in the TSP-1 domain. ISM2 shows high expression in placenta and moderate expression
  in multiple tissues including pancreas, kidney, heart, liver, lung, brain, and skeletal
  muscle. The TSP-1 domain is known in other proteins to mediate protein-protein and
  protein-carbohydrate interactions, while the AMOP domain is found in adhesion proteins
  and mucins. ISM2 interacts with SCN3B (sodium channel beta-3 subunit). While the
  precise molecular function of ISM2 remains to be fully elucidated, its domain structure
  and secreted nature suggest roles in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix interactions,
  or signaling.'

  review:
    summary: 'ISM2 is a secreted protein, as indicated by the presence of a signal
      peptide (residues 1-26) that targets the protein for secretion. The mature protein
      (residues 27-571) functions in the extracellular region. [file:human/ISM2/ISM2-uniprot.txt,

  review:
    summary: ISM2 physically interacts with SCN3B (sodium channel beta-3 subunit)
      as documented in UniProt and supported by a large-scale human binary protein
      interactome study. The TSP-1 domain in ISM2 is known to mediate protein-protein
      interactions. However, "protein binding" is a very general term that doesn't
      provide informative functional annotation about what ISM2 actually does. More
      specific molecular function terms would be preferable once the binding function
      is better characterized.

core_functions:
- description: ISM2 is a secreted glycoprotein containing a TSP type-1 repeat and
    an AMOP domain, both of which are found in adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins.
    The protein is secreted into the extracellular region where it likely participates
    in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. ISM2 interacts with SCN3B (sodium channel
    beta-3 subunit), suggesting a potential role in modulating sodium channel function
    or localization. The TSP-1 domain typically mediates protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate
    interactions, while the AMOP domain is characteristic of adhesion proteins and
    mucins. ISM2 shows high placental expression and broad tissue distribution, suggesting
    roles in tissue development, cell adhesion, or extracellular signaling. However,
    the precise molecular mechanisms and biological processes involving ISM2 remain
    to be fully characterized. The protein belongs to the isthmin family, which includes
    proteins involved in angiogenesis and neural development.
