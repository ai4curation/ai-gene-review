description: 'FGFRL1 is the fifth member of the FGFR family that acts as a non-signaling decoy receptor. It has three extracellular Ig-like domains for binding FGF ligands and heparin, but lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. FGFRL1 functions primarily in ligand sequestration, cell adhesion via constitutive homodimers, and cell-cell fusion. It is essential for kidney development, diaphragm muscle formation, and skeletal development.'

  review:
    summary: FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands through its extracellular Ig-like domains but lacks the intracellular kinase domain for signal transduction. It acts as a decoy receptor that sequesters FGFs without transducing signals.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands, calling it a "receptor activity" is misleading because it does not transduce signals. A more accurate term would focus on its binding activity.

  title: FGFRL1 dimer binds FGFs
  findings:
  - statement: FGFRL1 forms constitutive dimers and binds multiple FGF ligands including FGF3, FGF4, FGF8, FGF10, FGF22
    supporting_text: "FGFRL1 forms constitutive dimers and has been shown to bind to a wide range of FGF ligands, including FGF3,4,8,10, 22"
  - statement: FGFRL1 has lower affinity binding to FGF2, FGF5, FGF17, FGF18, and FGF23
    supporting_text: "and with lower affinity to FGF2,5,17,18 and 23"
  - statement: FGFRL1 lacks the internal kinase domain required for typical downstream FGFR signaling
    supporting_text: "FGFRL1 lacks the internal kinase domain required for typical downstream FGFR signaling"
  - statement: FGFRL1 acts as a decoy receptor that sequesters FGF ligands away from canonical signaling receptors

  title: FGFRL1 Structure, Primary Function, and Evolutionary Perspective
  findings:
  - statement: FGFRL1 is evolutionarily ancient and present across metazoans from cnidarians to vertebrates
    supporting_text: "FGFRL1 is an evolutionarily ancient gene present across a broad range of metazoans. Orthologs have been identified in species from cnidarians (e.g. Nematostella sea anemone) to vertebrates"
  - statement: FGFRL1 has three extracellular Ig-like domains for binding FGFs and heparin, with a short intracellular tail lacking kinase activity
    supporting_text: "Its extracellular portion consists of three Ig-like domains (D1, D2, D3), arranged similarly to FGFR1–4... Crucially, FGFRL1 lacks any kinase or other conventional signaling domain intracellularly"
  - statement: FGFRL1 acts as a decoy receptor, cell adhesion molecule, and fusogen depending on context
    supporting_text: "FGFRL1 can thus be viewed as a multifunctional surface protein: part decoy receptor (binding and neutralizing FGFs), part adhesion molecule (connecting cells via Ig domain interactions), and part fusogen (in specific contexts causing membrane merging)"
  - statement: FGFRL1 is essential for kidney development, diaphragm muscle formation, and skeletal development in mice
    supporting_text: "The most striking phenotypes are absence of kidneys, a malformed diaphragm, and a dome-shaped skull"
  - statement: FGFRL1 promotes cell-cell adhesion and fusion through its Ig3 domain hydrophobic patch
    supporting_text: "A set of four hydrophobic residues in Ig3 (e.g. L281, F303, L339, V304 in human FGFRL1) form a pocket that likely interacts with a 'target protein' on adjacent cells"
  - statement: FGFRL1 undergoes rapid trafficking and can be shed as a soluble ectodomain
    supporting_text: "In normal FGFRL1, these signals mediate rapid trafficking of the receptor from the plasma membrane into endosomes and lysosomes... Like many membrane receptors, FGFRL1 can be proteolytically shed from the cell surface"
