description: FGFRL1 is the fifth member of the FGFR family that acts as a 
  non-signaling decoy receptor. It has three extracellular Ig-like domains for 
  binding FGF ligands and heparin, but lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
  domain. FGFRL1 functions primarily in ligand sequestration, cell adhesion via 
  constitutive homodimers, and cell-cell fusion. It is essential for kidney 
  development, diaphragm muscle formation, and skeletal development.

    review:
      summary: FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands through its extracellular Ig-like 
        domains but lacks the intracellular kinase domain for signal 
        transduction. It acts as a decoy receptor that sequesters FGFs without 
        transducing signals.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands, calling it a "receptor activity" 
        is misleading because it does not transduce signals. A more accurate 
        term would focus on its binding activity.

            sometimes called FGFR5 – is the fifth member of the FGFR family. It 
            shares the general architecture of classical FGFRs, with three 
            extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and a single-pass 
            transmembrane helix, but crucially **lacks the intracellular

            Instead, FGFRL1 ends in a short \~100-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail 
            containing unique sequence motifs. Below, we detail FGFRL1’s 
            structural features, its role in cell signaling and development, and
            an evolutionary view of this atypical receptor. We focus on FGFRL1’s
            **primary molecular functions** – how it interacts with ligands and 
            cells – rather than downstream phenotypic effects (though key 
            developmental phenotypes that illuminate function are included). 
            Finally, we highlight open questions one might pose to experts and 
            suggest experiments (in various model organisms) to further 
            elucidate FGFRL1’s function.

      summary: Essential for metanephric kidney development through regulation 
        of ureteric branching and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
      action: NEW
      reason: FGFRL1 is absolutely essential for kidney development, as 
        demonstrated by the complete absence of metanephric kidneys in knockout 
        mice. FGFRL1 regulates critical processes including ureteric branching 
        morphogenesis and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the 
        nephrogenic mesenchyme. The protein is expressed throughout kidney 
        development in multiple nephron structures and acts by modulating FGF 
        signaling gradients that are essential for nephrogenesis.

    review:
      summary: Core function of FGFRL1 as negative regulator of FGF signaling
      action: NEW
      reason: FGFRL1 acts as a decoy receptor that negatively regulates FGF 
        signaling by sequestering FGF ligands. This specific regulatory function
        is core to its biological role but was missing from existing 
        annotations.

      receptor preferentially expressed in skeletal tissues.
    findings:
      - statement: FGFRL1 is a transmembrane receptor with three extracellular 
          Ig-like domains but lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain 
          required for signal transduction
        supporting_text: The novel protein contained three extracellular Ig-like
          domains that were related to the members of the fibroblast growth 
          factor (FGF) receptor family. However, it lacked the intracellular 
          protein tyrosine kinase domain required for signal transduction by 
          transphosphorylation.
      - statement: FGFRL1 binds heparin and FGF2 specifically, similar to 
          classical FGF receptors

          cultured cells
        supporting_text: When expressed in cultured cells as a fusion protein 
          with green fluorescent protein, FGFRL1 was specifically localized to 
          the plasma membrane where it might interact with FGF ligands.
      - statement: Overexpression of FGFRL1 has a negative effect on cell 
          proliferation, consistent with its role as a decoy receptor
        supporting_text: When overexpressed in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, the 
          novel receptor had a negative effect on cell proliferation. Taken 
          together our data are consistent with the view that FGFRL1 acts as a 
          decoy receptor for FGF ligands.

          demonstrated by FRET and co-precipitation experiments
        supporting_text: Utilizing the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy 
          transfer) technique, we demonstrate that FGFRL1 forms constitutive 
          homodimers at cell surfaces. The formation of homodimers was verified 
          by co-precipitation of differentially tagged FGFRL1 polypeptides from 
          solution.

          surfaces.
      - statement: Cell adhesion is mediated by heparan sulfate 
          glycosaminoglycans and can be blocked by soluble heparin
        supporting_text: Adhesion was mediated by heparan sulfate 
          glycosaminoglycans located at the cell surface. It could specifically 
          be blocked by addition of soluble heparin but not by addition of other
          glycosaminoglycans.
      - statement: FGFRL1 resembles nectins in its adhesion properties and 
          dimeric structure
        supporting_text: With its dimeric structure and its adhesion promoting 
          properties, FGFRL1 resembles the nectins, a family of cell adhesion 
          molecules found at cell-cell junctions.
      - statement: FGFRL1 has heparin-binding activity that is required for its 
          adhesion function
        supporting_text: When the amino acid sequence of the putative 
          heparin-binding site was modified by in vitro mutagenesis, the 
          resulting protein exhibited decreased affinity for heparin and reduced

        supporting_text: Its extracellular domain is very similar to FGFR1-4 and
          binds FGFs, such as FGF-2 and FGF-8, with high affinity. In contrast 
          to FGFR1-4, the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of FGFRL1 is 
          replaced by a short histidine-rich C-terminal tail, which is unable to
          convey canonical signal transduction through receptor 
          auto-phosphorylation
      - statement: FGFRL1 functions as a decoy receptor that attenuates FGFR 
          signaling

          cells increases FGFR signaling, whereas FGFRL1 overexpression 
          attenuates it, supporting decoy receptor actions of membrane-localized
          FGFRL1

          functional significance
        supporting_text: In non-malignant tissues (BPH and AdjPr), luminal 
          epithelial cells showed clear membrane-associated FGFRL1 staining, 
          often in combination with weak cytoplasmic staining (Figure 1A,B). In 
          HGPIN and primary PCa, membranous staining was less clear, but 
          increased cytoplasmic and positive nuclear staining were often 
          observed (Figure 1C,D)
      - statement: FGFRL1 intracellular domain binds to SHP-1 phosphatase and 
          Spred1 proteins
        supporting_text: It also binds to SHP-1 phosphatase in pancreatic islet 
          beta cells, which may affect cellular signaling [17] and negatively

      - statement: FGFRL1 deficiency affects expression of genes in multiple 
          developmental signaling pathways
        supporting_text: We identified more than 50 genes that are expressed at 
          significantly reduced levels in our mutant mice. Many of these genes 
          are involved in the Fgf/Fgfr, Wnt/ß-catenin, Bmp, Notch, and

      required for development
    experiment_type: Gene targeting
    hypothesis: FGFRL1's fusogenic activity is essential for its developmental 
      functions in muscle and bone
  - description: Perform co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to 
      identify FGFRL1-interacting proteins on adjacent cell surfaces
    experiment_type: Protein interaction mapping
    hypothesis: FGFRL1 interacts with specific cell surface proteins to mediate 
      cell-cell adhesion and fusion
  - description: Use fluorescent FGF ligands in organ culture to examine how 
      FGFRL1 affects FGF gradient formation and persistence
    experiment_type: Live imaging
    hypothesis: FGFRL1 shapes FGF morphogen gradients by sequestering ligands 
      and affects their spatial distribution
status: COMPLETE
