## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O15392
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5; AltName: Full=Apoptosis inhibitor 4; AltName: Full=Apoptosis inhibitor survivin;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BIRC5; Synonyms=API4, IAP4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IAP family. .
- **Key Domains:** Baculoviral_IAP. (IPR051190); BIR_rpt. (IPR001370); BIR (PF00653)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BIRC5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BIRC5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BIRC5** (gene ID: BIRC5, UniProt: O15392) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target identity: BIRC5 (UniProt O15392) encodes survivin (also called apoptosis inhibitor 4), a human inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family protein with a single BIR domain; identity and domain architecture match the UniProt description and current reviews (Apr 2024 Cancers review; Feb 2024 Translational Lung Cancer Research narrative review). URLs and dates: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621 (Feb 2024) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

Comprehensive research report: BIRC5 (survivin) in human
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Definition and structure: Survivin is a 142–amino acid, ~16.5 kDa IAP-family protein with a single N‑terminal BIR domain and a C‑terminal helical tail that mediates interactions with the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) components (Aurora B/AURKB, INCENP, and borealin/CDCA8) (Cancers 2024 review; TLCR 2024 review). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621 (Feb 2024) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).
- Primary cellular role: Although originally identified as an IAP, survivin’s best-established function is as an essential CPC component regulating mitotic progression, including centromere targeting, kinetochore–microtubule attachment, chromosome alignment, spindle midzone localization, and cytokinesis; survivin loss yields mitotic catastrophe and aneuploidy (Cancers 2024 review; 2018 background summary) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21).
- Apoptosis-related activities: Survivin contributes to apoptosis resistance in cancer, often via network interactions (e.g., with XIAP and SMAC/DIABLO) rather than direct caspase inhibition; mitochondrial survivin is linked to anti-apoptotic activity (Cancers 2024 review; TLCR 2024 review). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621 (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

2) Subcellular localization and dynamics
- Cell cycle regulation: BIRC5 expression peaks at G2/M and declines after mitosis; survivin localizes to centromeres in metaphase, the spindle midzone in anaphase, and the midbody during cytokinesis as part of the CPC (2018 summary; Cancers 2024 review) (publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21, wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2).
- Nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling: Survivin contains a Crm1/Exportin 1–dependent nuclear export signal (NES) that controls nucleocytoplasmic distribution; NES mutations alter localization and cytoprotective activity (Cancers 2024 review; Apr 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5).
- Mitochondrial pool: An N‑terminal targeting sequence is reported to direct a survivin pool to mitochondria in cancer cells, where it is associated with apoptosis suppression and potentially metastasis (Cancers 2024 review; Apr 2024; TLCR 2024 review; Feb 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

3) Domains, complexes, and mechanistic features
- BIR domain and CPC anchoring: The BIR domain presents the epigenetic-histone-binding surface that anchors the CPC to chromatin (e.g., recognition of H3T3ph by CPC); survivin’s C‑terminus participates in CPC assembly with borealin and INCENP, enabling Aurora B kinase localization and function (2018 summary; Apr 2024 review) (publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21, wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5).
- Post-translational regulation: Ubiquitination within the BIR domain affects centromere localization; multiple phosphorylations (e.g., by Aurora B, CDK1/PLK1) modulate CPC function; acetylation and other PTMs may influence dimerization and stability (Apr 2024 review; 2018 background) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract) (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21).
- Splice variants: Several survivin splice variants (e.g., ΔEx3, 2B, 3B) have been described, which may diversify localization and function; detailed variant biology remains an active area (Apr 2024 review; Feb 2024 TLCR) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

4) Pathways and regulation
- Transcriptional control: The BIRC5 promoter is TATA-less with Sp1 sites, CDE/CHR elements, and a CpG island; oncogenic signaling (EGFR→PI3K/AKT, MAPK, NF‑κB, mTOR; Wnt/β‑catenin; Notch; YAP/Hippo; Hedgehog) upregulates BIRC5, whereas TP53, PTEN, RB, BRCA1 constrain expression (Apr 2024 Cancers review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2).
- Cell-cycle coupling: CDE/CHR promoter elements couple BIRC5 to late cell cycle, with maximal expression in G2/M and reduction after cytokinesis (2018 background; Apr 2024 review) (publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21, wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2).
- Post-transcriptional regulation: Numerous microRNAs (e.g., miR‑34a, miR‑203) and signaling-dependent ubiquitination/phosphorylation modify survivin levels and localization (Feb 2024 TLCR review; Apr 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4, wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5).
- Autophagy cross-talk: Survivin is implicated in autophagy–apoptosis switching, interacting with components such as Beclin1 and ATG5/12 and participating in mitophagy/ROS responses (2024 overview) (publication year 2024 source without DOI in the extract) (brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 13-16, brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 16-19).

5) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Reframing apoptosis function: Contemporary reviews emphasize that survivin’s central, non-redundant role is mitotic regulation via the CPC; anti-apoptotic effects are context-dependent and likely mediated by networks (XIAP, SMAC) and subcellular pools rather than direct caspase inhibition (Cancers 2024 review; Apr 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, wang2024survivinasa pages 8-9).
- Mitochondrial survivin and therapy resistance: 2024 analyses consolidate evidence linking mitochondrial survivin enrichment in tumors to drug/radiation resistance and invasion; nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization may carry differing prognostic implications across tumor types (TLCR 2024 review; Apr 2024 Cancers review) (https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4, wang2024survivinasa pages 8-9).
- Autophagy/mitophagy interface: 2024 work highlights survivin’s role in modulating autophagic flux and mitophagy under stress, further linking it to metabolic survival strategies in cancer (2024 autophagy-focused overview) (publication year 2024 source without DOI in the extract) (brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 13-16, brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 16-19).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker: Survivin is broadly overexpressed across cancers and largely absent from most normal adult tissues (with some expression in stem/progenitor compartments), supporting its use as a cancer-associated biomarker and prognostic indicator (Apr 2024 review; Feb 2024 TLCR review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 7-8, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).
- Therapeutic targeting strategies under investigation:
  • Small molecules that destabilize or inhibit survivin: structure- or screen-derived compounds including S12 (targets the dimer interface) and LQZ-7F/7I (induce proteasomal degradation) show preclinical activity (Apr 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 7-8).
  • Immunotherapies and vaccines: survivin-derived peptide vaccines (e.g., SurVaxM) and dendritic-cell approaches have generated immunogenicity and early clinical signals in selected settings (summarized in Apr 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 7-8).
  • Pathway-targeted modulation: because BIRC5 is transcriptionally regulated by EGFR/PI3K/AKT, MAPK, NF‑κB, and mTOR, inhibitors in these pathways can indirectly reduce survivin expression to enhance chemo/radiotherapy (Apr 2024 review; TLCR 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 8-9, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative 2024 sources
- Consensus view: Survivin’s essential mitotic function via the CPC is the dominant, non-redundant role; its apoptosis-modulating capacity is likely indirect and compartment-specific. Therapeutically, survivin remains attractive due to the tumor-versus-normal expression differential; however, on-target, clinically effective, and specific survivin inhibitors are still an unmet need (Cancers 2024 review; TLCR 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, wang2024survivinasa pages 7-8, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

8) Relevant statistics and quantitative data from recent and foundational studies
- Cell-cycle regulation magnitude: BIRC5/survivin mRNA and protein increase markedly at G2/M; foundational work summarized a ~40-fold increase at mitosis relative to G1, consistent with CPC function in late cell cycle (2018 background summary) (publication year 2018 source without DOI in the extract) (humphry2018theroleof pages 16-21).
- Clinical association breadth: Multiple tumor types report survivin overexpression correlating with poor outcomes and therapy resistance; the 2024 reviews compile multi-cancer evidence and emphasize its prevalent overexpression and limited normal-tissue expression (Apr 2024 review; Feb 2024 TLCR review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 8-9, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).

9) Summary of function, localization, and pathways (concise)
- Function: Essential CPC component for mitosis (centromere targeting, spindle midzone/midbody localization, chromosome segregation, cytokinesis); contributes to apoptosis resistance indirectly via network effects and mitochondrial localization (Apr 2024 and Feb 2024 reviews) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).
- Localization: Dynamic CPC localization through mitosis; nucleocytoplasmic shuttling via Crm1-dependent NES; a cancer-associated mitochondrial pool (Apr 2024 Cancers; Feb 2024 TLCR) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705; https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-23-621) (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5, pachimatla2024survivininlung pages 2-4).
- Pathways: Upregulated by EGFR/PI3K/AKT, MAPK, NF‑κB, mTOR, Wnt/β‑catenin, Notch, YAP/Hippo; suppressed by TP53/PTEN/RB/BRCA1; integrated into autophagy/mitophagy responses (Apr 2024 Cancers; 2024 autophagy review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 1-2, brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 13-16, brederbonk2024roleofsurvivin pages 16-19).

Limitations and open questions
- Direct caspase inhibition by survivin remains unproven; compartment-specific roles (mitochondrial versus nuclear) and splice-variant contributions require further mechanistic clarification. Many published effects derive from overexpression or non-selective knockdowns; refined genetic/biophysical methods are needed to define endogenous functions (Apr 2024 review) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16091705) (wang2024survivinasa pages 4-5).
