description: >-
  BIRC5 (survivin) is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family that functions
  primarily
  as an essential component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). Despite its
  historical name
  "apoptosis inhibitor survivin," contemporary evidence establishes that survivin's
  best-characterized
  and evolutionarily conserved function is in mitotic regulation, not apoptosis inhibition.
  As a CPC
  component, survivin associates with Aurora B kinase, INCENP, and borealin to regulate
  chromosome
  alignment, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, spindle midzone assembly, and cytokinesis.
  The protein
  localizes dynamically during mitosis: to centromeres during prometaphase/metaphase,
  to the spindle
  midzone during anaphase, and to the midbody during cytokinesis. While survivin has
  been implicated
  in anti-apoptotic activity, this appears to be indirect and context-dependent, likely
  mediated through
  interactions with XIAP and sequestration of SMAC/DIABLO, rather than direct caspase
  inhibition.
  Unlike other IAP family members, survivin lacks the full RING domain required for
  direct caspase
  ubiquitination. Expression peaks at G2/M phase and is largely absent from most normal
  adult tissues
  but highly overexpressed in cancers.

      Survivin is an essential structural component of the chromosomal passenger complex
      (CPC),
      forming a triple-helix bundle with INCENP and borealin that anchors and regulates
      the
      Aurora B kinase. As a CPC component, survivin is essential for proper chromosome
      segregation
      during mitosis and mediates CPC targeting to the midbody for cytokinesis completion.

      What is the precise mechanism by which survivin contributes to anti-apoptotic

      additional
      direct mechanisms?
  - question: >-

      function
