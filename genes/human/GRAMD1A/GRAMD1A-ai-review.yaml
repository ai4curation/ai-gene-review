description: >-
  GRAMD1A (also known as Aster-A) encodes an ER-anchored sterol transfer protein that
  mediates
  nonvesicular transport of accessible cholesterol from the plasma membrane (PM) to
  the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) at ER-PM membrane contact sites. The protein contains an N-terminal
  GRAM domain
  that functions as a coincidence detector for accessible PM cholesterol and anionic
  phospholipids
  (particularly phosphatidylserine), a central VASt/StART-like (ASTER) sterol-binding
  domain that
  binds and transfers cholesterol, and a C-terminal single-pass ER transmembrane helix
  for ER
  anchoring. GRAMD1A is recruited to ER-PM contact sites upon increases in accessible
  PM
  cholesterol and transfers this cholesterol to the ER, thereby supplying the ER with
  cholesterol
  for SREBP-2 feedback suppression and esterification by ACAT. Recent work also demonstrates
  GRAMD1A functions at ER-Golgi contacts to export excess Golgi cholesterol to the
  ER. GRAMD1A
  forms homo- and heteromeric complexes with paralogs GRAMD1B and GRAMD1C. It is broadly
  expressed
  with notable brain expression.

        However, GRAMD1A is not an autophagosome-resident protein; rather its cholesterol

        PMID:31222192 shows GRAMD1A affects autophagosome biogenesis through its cholesterol
        transfer function, but this does not mean GRAMD1A is a constituent of autophagosomes.
        The core function of GRAMD1A is nonvesicular cholesterol transport at membrane
        contact
        sites, and any autophagy effects are downstream consequences of cholesterol

        While that

        consequence

        GRAMD1A's primary function is nonvesicular cholesterol transport at ER-PM

        biogenesis, rather than a direct role in autophagy machinery. This annotation
