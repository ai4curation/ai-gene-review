description: 'BCL2L1 encodes Bcl-2-like protein 1 (also called Bcl-x), a member of
  the Bcl-2 family that regulates apoptosis. CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative
  splicing produces two functionally ANTAGONISTIC isoforms: (1) Bcl-xL (Q07817-1,
  233 AA) is anti-apoptotic and inhibits BAX/BAK-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization; (2) Bcl-xS (Q07817-2, 166 AA) is pro-apoptotic, lacks BH1/BH2
  domains, and can heterodimerize with Bcl-xL to inhibit its function. Most GO annotations
  refer to Bcl-xL, the dominant isoform. The annotation GO:0043065 "positive regulation
  of apoptotic process" likely reflects Bcl-xS function or IBA inference error. Beyond
  apoptosis, Bcl-xL regulates ATP synthase efficiency, calcium signaling, and autophagy.'

    review:
      summary: ISOFORM-CONFLATED ANNOTATION. This annotation is misleading when 
        applied to the gene as a whole. The canonical isoform Bcl-xL (Q07817-1) 
        is ANTI-apoptotic, not pro-apoptotic. Only the short isoform Bcl-xS 
        (Q07817-2) promotes apoptosis. The IBA evidence (phylogenetic inference)
        does not distinguish between isoforms and may reflect Bcl-xS function or
        misannotation of paralogs in the Bcl-2 family. The original paper 
        PMID:8358789 clearly shows "bcl-xL inhibits cell death" while "bcl-xS 
        encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of bcl-2 to enhance 
        survival."
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: This annotation conflates the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-xS 
        with the gene as a whole. The dominant Bcl-xL isoform is anti-apoptotic.
        If retained, this should be isoform-specific to Q07817-2 (Bcl-xS). The 
        IBA evidence does not provide isoform resolution.

    review:
      summary: Bcl-xL participates in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway,
        particularly in absence of ligand (growth factor withdrawal). 
        PMID:8358789 demonstrated that Bcl-xL inhibits cell death upon growth 
        factor withdrawal. PMID:7650367 showed that "Stable transfection of 
        either bcl-2 or bcl-x expression plasmids promotes the survival of 
        CTLL-2 cells in the setting of IL-2 withdrawal." This IBA annotation 
        appropriately captures Bcl-xL's role in this pathway, though the term 
        could be more specific about the direction of regulation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation correctly places BCL2L1 in the extrinsic 
        apoptotic pathway context. The foundational paper PMID:8358789 shows 
        Bcl-xL inhibits cell death upon growth factor withdrawal. However, this 
        is a process annotation rather than a regulatory term, which is 
        acceptable as Bcl-xL is indeed involved in this pathway as an inhibitor.
        The function is core to Bcl-xL biology.

        selective targeting of Bcl-xL to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) 
        is mediated by the positively charged residues flanking its hydrophobic 
        transmembrane domain." The C-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 
        210-226) functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal. At the MOM, 
        Bcl-xL resides near VDACs and regulates MOMP.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Well-established core localization. The transmembrane domain 
        directs Bcl-xL specifically to the MOM where it performs its

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Bcl-xL is a key negative regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic

        BH3-only proteins like PUMA that are induced by p53 in response to DNA

      summary: Bcl-xL regulates ion channel activity at mitochondrial membranes.
        UniProt notes Bcl-xL "blocking the voltage-dependent anion channel 
        (VDAC) by binding to it." The deep research states "Bcl-xL decreases ion
        leak conductance within the F1F0 ATPase complex" and "Bcl-xL binding to 
        VDAC1 and VDAC3 promotes mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ accumulation." 
        However, this is a regulatory activity on channels, not direct channel 
        activity by Bcl-xL itself.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Bcl-xL regulates channel activity but is not itself a channel. It 
        interacts with VDAC and modulates ion leak through ATP synthase, but 
        these are regulatory functions. A more accurate term would be related to

        permeability transition and cytochrome c release" and "Bax-induced 
        mitochondrial changes were inhibited by recombinant Bcl-xL." UniProt 
        states Bcl-xL functions by "preventing the release of the caspase 
        activator, CYC1, from the mitochondrial membrane." This annotation is 
        problematic as written - Bcl-xL is involved in this process but as a 
        NEGATIVE regulator.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: The term "release of cytochrome c from mitochondria" implies the 
        protein promotes this release. Bcl-xL actually INHIBITS this release.

        beta-subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase." This inner membrane localization
        is associated with the non-apoptotic metabolic function of Bcl-xL.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Secondary localization supported by evidence. While the MOM is the
        primary location, Bcl-xL has been detected at the inner membrane where 
        it regulates ATP synthase efficiency. This is a legitimate secondary

      reason: The mitochondrial matrix localization is reported but represents a

      action: ACCEPT

      reason: Endocytosis regulation is a specialized neuronal function of 
        Bcl-xL, separate from its core anti-apoptotic role. It involves

    review:
      summary: Core cellular component. Bcl-xL forms heterodimers with 
        pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. PMID:9388232 describes "the 
        interactions of BAD with wild type and mutant BCL-2 and BCL-XL proteins"
        and demonstrates "human Bad interacted with BCL-2 and BCL-XL." Bcl-xL 
        binds BAX, BAK, BAD, BIM, and other BH3-only proteins.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Accurate annotation. Bcl-xL functions by forming complexes with 
        other Bcl-2 family proteins. This complex formation is central to its 
        molecular mechanism of action in regulating apoptosis.

    review:
      summary: Broad term. Bcl-xL does regulate signaling by controlling 
        apoptotic signal transduction. It prevents caspase activation and 
        cytochrome c release which are key signaling events.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: This term is too broad and non-specific. More precise annotations 
        about apoptotic signaling pathway regulation are already present and 
        provide better information about the actual function.

      label: regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway
    evidence_type: IEA

    review:
      summary: Core function. Bcl-xL regulates apoptotic signaling through its 
        interactions with pro-apoptotic proteins. This is an appropriate level 
        of annotation though more specific terms exist.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Accurate and appropriately specific annotation for Bcl-xL 
        function. While "negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway" 
        would be more precise for Bcl-xL, this term is acceptable as a parent 
        term.

        homodimerization of Bcl-xL. The deep research notes "Bcl-xL can form 
        homodimers under specific conditions" and domain-swapped dimers have 
        been observed crystallographically.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: Homodimerization is a secondary activity. The primary molecular 
        function involves heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family 
        members (BAX, BAK, BH3-only proteins). Homodimerization may be relevant 
        but is not the core functional interaction.

        viral manipulation, not an active defender. The virus 7a protein

      action: REMOVE
      reason: This annotation is incorrect. Bcl-xL does not mount a defense 
        response to virus; rather, it is targeted BY the virus (SARS-CoV 7a) to 
        subvert host cell survival. The paper shows 7a "triggers apoptosis by 
        interfering directly with the prosurvival function of Bcl-XL." Being 
        targeted by a pathogen is not the same as participating in defense

    description: 'The CORE molecular function of Bcl-xL (canonical isoform Q07817-1).
      Bcl-xL contains a BH3-binding groove that binds the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic
      proteins including BAX, BAK, BAD, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA. This binding sequesters
      pro-apoptotic proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane and prevents their
      activation of the apoptotic cascade. Structural studies have characterized the
      BH3-binding groove at atomic resolution (PMID:21199865, PMID:21639858). As established
      in the foundational paper PMID:8358789, bcl-xL inhibits cell death upon growth
      factor withdrawal. By preventing BAX/BAK pore formation at the MOM, Bcl-xL inhibits
      cytochrome c release and blocks apoptosis. CRITICAL ISOFORM NOTE: BCL2L1 produces
      two antagonistic isoforms through alternative splicing. Bcl-xL (Q07817-1, 233
      AA) is ANTI-apoptotic (this core function). Bcl-xS (Q07817-2, 166 AA) lacks
      the BH1 and BH2 domains and is PRO-apoptotic.'

    id: Q07817-1
    description: >-
      The dominant anti-apoptotic isoform (233 AA). Contains all four BH domains (BH1-4)
      and inhibits apoptosis by sequestering pro-apoptotic BAX/BAK, preventing mitochondrial
      outer membrane permeabilization. Also regulates ATP synthase efficiency, calcium
      signaling, and autophagy. Most GO annotations for BCL2L1 refer to this isoform.
  - name: Bcl-X(S) (Bcl-xS)
    id: Q07817-2
    sequence_note: VSP_000515
    description: >-
      The pro-apoptotic short isoform (166 AA). Lacks BH1 and BH2 domains due to alternative
      5' splice site selection in exon 2. Promotes apoptosis by heterodimerizing with
      Bcl-xL
      and antagonizing its anti-apoptotic function. The Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS ratio determines
      cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Annotations for "positive regulation
      of
      apoptotic process" likely reflect this isoform's function.
  - name: Bcl-X(beta)
    id: Q07817-3
    sequence_note: VSP_000516
    description: >-
      A less characterized isoform. Contains an alternative C-terminus compared to
      Bcl-xL.
      Functional studies are limited compared to Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS.
