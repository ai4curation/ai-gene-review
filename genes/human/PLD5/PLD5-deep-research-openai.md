## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene PLD5 (Q8N7P1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# PLD5 (Phospholipase D Family Member 5) – Overview and Function

## Family and Structural Features  
PLD5 (UniProt Q8N7P1) is a member of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, which are enzymes characterized by a common **H(X)K(X₄)D** (HKD) catalytic motif and activity on phosphodiester bonds ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=biochemical%20mechanism%20and%20an%20H,phosphatidylcholine%20and%20producing%20phosphatidic%20acid)). In humans, the PLD family comprises six genes (PLD1–PLD6) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=instead%20of%20aspartate%20%28HKE%29%20%2822%29,phosphatidylcholine%20and%20producing%20phosphatidic%20acid)). PLD5 is often referred to as an “**inactive phospholipase D5**” in databases ([www.antibodies.com](https://www.antibodies.com/products/primary-antibodies/pld5-antibodies#:~:text=PLD5%20Antibodies%20Explore%20our%20catalog,Inactive)), reflecting key differences from the classical PLDs (PLD1 and PLD2). Unlike PLD1/2, which are large cytosolic enzymes with regulatory PX and PH domains, PLD5 is a transmembrane-type PLD lacking those N-terminal PX/PH domains ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). Instead, PLD5 contains a short N-terminal segment, a single-pass transmembrane region, and a large C-terminal region comprising two PLD phosphodiesterase domains (sometimes called PLD-PDE1 and PLD-PDE2) that harbor the HKD motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). The human PLD5 protein is ~536 amino acids in length (~61 kDa) and contains one predicted transmembrane helix with no cleavable signal peptide, consistent with a type-II membrane protein topology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=now%20officially%20designated%20%E2%80%9CPLD%20family,putative%20TM%20domain%20instead%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)). This topology is similar to PLD3 and PLD4, which are synthesized as single-pass membrane glycoproteins and then proteolytically processed in the endolysosomal system ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=5%E2%80%B2%20exonucleases%20PLD3%20or%20PLD4,the%20hydrolysis%20of%20phosphodiester%20bonds)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). 

Despite sharing the signature HKD motifs, **PLD5’s catalytic motifs are degenerate** compared to active PLDs. Notably, sequence analysis indicates that PLD5’s HKD sequences are **less conserved**, carrying substitutions in critical residues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)). For example, related family member PLD3 has a mutation in the second HKD motif (H→E substitution) and was found to lack classical PLD enzymatic activity ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=biochemical%20mechanism%20and%20an%20H,phosphatidylcholine%20and%20producing%20phosphatidic%20acid)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). Similarly, PLD4 was shown to have **no phospholipase D activity** in biochemical assays ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698063/#:~:text=,in%20spleen%20and%20early%20postnatal)). PLD5 is predicted to follow this pattern – it belongs to the “non-classical” or “HKD-superfamily” PLDs that likely do not function as typical phospholipid hydrolases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). In summary, PLD5 is structurally a PLD family protein with the conserved domain architecture, but **it diverges in key catalytic residues**, suggesting a fundamentally different or inactive enzymatic function.

## Catalytic Activity and Substrate Specificity  
**No definitive enzymatic activity or substrate has been confirmed for PLD5 to date.** The classical PLD enzymes (PLD1/2) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, generating phosphatidic acid and choline ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=instead%20of%20aspartate%20%28HKE%29%20%2822%29,phosphatidylcholine%20and%20producing%20phosphatidic%20acid)). In contrast, **PLD5 has not been observed to catalyze this reaction** and is considered catalytically inactive with respect to phospholipid hydrolysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=family%20member%205%20,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). Early bioinformatic and mutational analyses led to the prediction that PLD5 (originally called PLDC1 in some studies) might be an **inactive phosphatidylcholine phospholipase** due to substitutions in the HKD motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)). Indeed, database annotations list PLD5 as “inactive phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D5” or “inactive choline phosphatase 5” ([www.antibodies.com](https://www.antibodies.com/products/primary-antibodies/pld5-antibodies#:~:text=PLD5%20Antibodies%20Explore%20our%20catalog,Inactive)). This nomenclature implies that **PLD5 does not effectively hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine or related lipids** under normal conditions. Experimental support for this comes by analogy: Yoshikawa et al. (2010) demonstrated that the closely related PLD4 lacked any phospholipase activity in vitro despite containing the HKD sequences ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698063/#:~:text=,in%20spleen%20and%20early%20postnatal)), and they noted PLD5 had even less conservation in those catalytic motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)). As of 2023, **no known lipid substrate has been assigned to PLD5**, and standard PLD assays have not shown activity. 

Interestingly, other “inactive” PLD family members have repurposed their catalytic domain for different substrates. For instance, **PLD3 and PLD4 function as 5′ exonucleases** that degrade single-stranded DNA and RNA in acidic endosomes/lysosomes (rather than acting on phospholipids) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=While%20crystal%20structures%20for%20RNaseT2,the%20PLD3%20sequence%20contains%20glutamate)). PLD6, on the other hand, is a **mitochondrial cardiolipin hydrolase** (“MitoPLD”) involved in generating phosphatidic acid on the mitochondrial surface ([eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr](https://eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr/hProteome-7.L-R.html#:~:text=Q8N7P1%20%20,link)). In these cases, the core PLD-like domain is used in unconventional chemistry – nucleic acid cleavage for PLD3/4 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)), or a unique lipid (cardiolipin) for PLD6 ([eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr](https://eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr/hProteome-7.L-R.html#:~:text=Q8N7P1%20%20,link)). It has been hypothesized that **PLD5 might likewise have a non-classical activity or a pseudoenzyme role**, but this remains unproven ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). As a 2023 structural analysis of PLD3 stated, “**Little is known about PLD5, and it is even unclear if it is active as an enzyme**” ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). No enzyme assays or substrates for PLD5 have been reported in the literature, and thus its primary biochemical activity (if any) is still undefined. In summary, the current understanding is that **PLD5 likely does *not*** act as a phospholipase on common membrane lipids, and if it has any catalytic function it may target an unknown substrate or be vestigial.

## Biological Role and Pathways  
Because a bona fide enzymatic function for PLD5 has not been identified, its **biological role is largely speculative**. Unlike PLD1 and PLD2, which are key players in receptor signaling (through their product phosphatidic acid) and have been implicated in diverse pathways (such as mTOR signaling, vesicle trafficking, and cell proliferation) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698063/#:~:text=transmembrane%20domain%20instead%20of%20PX,influenza%20viruses%29%2C%20and%20neurodegenerative)), PLD5’s contributions remain elusive. By sequence and domain organization, PLD5 clusters with the **“non-classical” PLDs that lack lipid-hydrolyzing activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20.%20Human%20Hu,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). In this regard, it is instructive to consider PLD3 and PLD4: these paralogs were eventually found to function in the endolysosomal compartment, **regulating innate immunity by degrading nucleic acids** and thereby preventing inappropriate activation of DNA/RNA sensors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)). Notably, PLD3/4 deficiency leads to accumulation of nucleic acid in endosomes and hyperactivation of Toll-like receptors and other sensors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)). **PLD5 might have a distinct but analogous role**, potentially in processing an unknown molecule or in a signaling pathway, but concrete evidence is lacking. There is **no well-defined signaling or metabolic pathway** that includes PLD5 as a component as of now. 

Some clues have emerged from gene expression and phenotypic studies. PLD5 is predominantly expressed in the **central nervous system**, which hints at a possible neurological function. Transcript profiling indicates **group-enriched expression of PLD5 in the brain, especially in the choroid plexus** epithelium ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%20Evidence%20at%20protein%20level)). This means PLD5 mRNA is detected at higher levels in brain/choroid plexus compared to most other tissues, although it is “detected in some” peripheral tissues at lower levels ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%20Evidence%20at%20protein%20level)). Such an expression pattern suggests PLD5 could be involved in brain-specific processes or development. Consistent with this, an earlier genome-wide study flagged the **PLD5 locus (1q43)** in the context of autism risk ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=200150#:~:text=Bioengineered%2C%202021%20Dec,association%20to%20chromosome%201q43%20in)), although the findings were not conclusive and no direct causative role was proven. It remains possible that PLD5 influences neurological pathways or brain cell physiology – perhaps in glial cells or cerebrospinal fluid production (given choroid plexus expression) – but further research is needed.

Another context where PLD5 has drawn attention is **cancer biology**. A recent study by Liu *et al.* (2021) identified PLD5 as a potential oncogenic factor in prostate cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)). In that work, PLD5 was found to be overexpressed in human prostate tumor samples, and overexpression of PLD5 in cell models **promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)). The authors showed that **microRNA-145-5p directly targets the 3′UTR of PLD5 mRNA**, reducing PLD5 levels and thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=3,145%20in%20prostate%20cancer)). Notably, restoring PLD5 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of miR-145, confirming that PLD5 mediates this microRNA’s tumor-suppressive action ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)). Although the **molecular mechanism by which PLD5 drives proliferation** is unclear, the study reported that PLD5 overexpression correlated with up-regulation of pro-metastatic markers (such as Snail and vimentin) and activation of the Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=incubated%20with%20anti,The%20bands%20were)). This implies that PLD5 may interface with **cell signaling pathways** controlling epithelial–mesenchymal transition and survival signaling (e.g. PI3K/Akt), even if indirectly. Importantly, these findings position PLD5 as a candidate **oncogene** in at least some cancers, making it of interest for further exploration. However, it is worth stressing that these effects were observed in cell culture models; the **precise role of PLD5 in vivo and in normal physiology remains to be determined**. No specific biochemical pathway has been conclusively tied to PLD5 function yet – current evidence is circumstantial or based on overexpression/knockdown phenotypes.

## Subcellular Localization and Mechanistic Insights  
Given its single transmembrane domain, PLD5 is an **integral membrane protein** that operates within cellular compartments rather than being secreted ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/summary/gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20FLJ40773%20Gene%20description,i%7D%204)). Both sequence-based predictions and high-throughput localization studies concur that PLD5 resides in intracellular membranes ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/summary/gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20FLJ40773%20Gene%20description,i%7D%204)). Data from the Human Protein Atlas indicate PLD5 is **primarily localized to mitochondria** in cultured human cells ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/subcellular#:~:text=Main%20location,cycle)). Immunofluorescence microscopy using a PLD5-specific antibody showed a mitochondrial pattern in cell lines like U-2 OS (osteosarcoma) and A-549 (lung carcinoma) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/subcellular#:~:text=HPA028389%20A,i)). This observation was “approved” in the HPA, suggesting the result was validated (for example, by multiple antibodies or consistency with RNA expression) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/subcellular#:~:text=Main%20location,cycle)). The mitochondrial localization of PLD5 is intriguing and may hint at a function related to this organelle. It raises the possibility that PLD5 could localize to the **outer mitochondrial membrane**, analogous to the tail-anchored PLD6 (MitoPLD) which also resides on mitochondria ([eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr](https://eprotworkbench.apps.cloud.kbds.re.kr/hProteome-7.L-R.html#:~:text=Q8N7P1%20%20,link)). If PLD5 is indeed a mitochondrial protein, its large C-terminal domain would likely face the cytosol or the intermembrane space (depending on the exact membrane insertion), positioning it to interact with cytosolic factors or mitochondrial proteins. So far, however, no **mitochondria-specific role** (such as in mitophagy, apoptosis, or mitochondrial lipid metabolism) has been ascribed to PLD5 in the literature. It is also possible that the HPA mitochondrial signal represents a subset of PLD5’s localization — for instance, PLD5 might traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum or endosomes en route to degradation, and some fraction resides on mitochondria. Additional biochemical fractionation studies or colocalization analyses would be needed to confirm the **subcellular compartment(s)** where PLD5 normally functions.

Aside from the mitochondrial hint, by homology one might expect PLD5 to localize to the **endolysosomal system**. PLD3 and PLD4 are known to be sorted to lysosomes (they are type II membrane proteins that undergo lumenal cleavage in lysosomes) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=While%20crystal%20structures%20for%20RNaseT2,the%20PLD3%20sequence%20contains%20glutamate)). They function within endosomal/lysosomal lumen to degrade nucleic acids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)). PLD5 could conceivably follow a similar trafficking route (e.g., from the ER to Golgi and then to endosomes/lysosomes). In fact, early descriptions of PLD3/4/5 referred to them collectively as “**TM-type PLDs**” – transmembrane PLDs that lack PX/PH domains and instead have a TM region and a lumenal catalytic domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=to%20as%20TM,PDE2%20domains%2C%20which)). The same 2010 study noted that **“little is known”** about PLD4, PLD5, and PLD6 at the time ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2978679/#:~:text=now%20officially%20designated%20%E2%80%9CPLD%20family,of%20PX%20and%20PH%20domains)). Over a decade later, PLD4 and PLD6 have had roles uncovered, but PLD5 still eludes clear characterization ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). 

From an evolutionary perspective, the presence of PLD5 in mammals (and vertebrates) suggests it has been retained for a reason, even if its classical enzymatic function was lost. **It may act as a catalytically “dead” enzyme that still binds substrate or regulators**, thereby modulating cellular processes. For example, some inactive enzyme relatives function as scaffold proteins or competitive inhibitors of related enzymes. PLD5 might bind phosphatidic acid or other lipids and sequester them, or it might interact with nucleic acids or proteins in a way that influences signaling. This is speculative, but it aligns with the emerging theme that several PLD-family proteins have **non-traditional roles** in cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105523/#:~:text=nucleic%20acid%20sensing%20,acid%20exonucleases%20that%20regulate%20endosomal)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=While%20crystal%20structures%20for%20RNaseT2,the%20PLD3%20sequence%20contains%20glutamate)). Further experiments – such as identifying binding partners of PLD5, solving its structure, or creating PLD5-knockout models – will be needed to unravel its function. As of 2024, PLD5 remains **the least understood member** of the human PLD family.

## Current Research and Emerging Insights  
Research specifically on PLD5 has been limited, but interest is growing as its family members’ importance is recognized. No high-resolution structure or dedicated functional study of PLD5 has been published yet. However, the **latest PLD family reviews** and analyses continue to mention PLD5 as an intriguing “orphan” in terms of function. A 2018 commentary on PLD enzymes highlighted that PLD5 is one of the **incompletely understood isoforms**, noting the uncertainty around its activity ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). In 2023, a structural biology study of PLD3 reiterated the point that PLD5’s enzymatic status is unknown and little information is available ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). These expert opinions underscore that **PLD5 is an open research question** – potentially important, given its conserved presence in mammals, but not yet deciphered. 

Experimentally, the most significant recent findings involving PLD5 have come indirectly (e.g. the prostate cancer miR-145 study). Those results suggest PLD5 could be biologically active in certain contexts (promoting cell growth and migration) even if we do not know the mechanism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)). It raises the possibility that **PLD5 might influence cell signaling pathways**. For instance, PLD5 overexpression was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation in cancer cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)), hinting at a link to the PI3K–AKT pathway (a central pro-survival and growth pathway). Whether PLD5 affects this pathway by producing a lipid second messenger or by another means is unclear. It’s worth noting that classical PLD1/2, when activated, generate phosphatidic acid that can activate mTOR and PKC signaling, driving proliferation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698063/#:~:text=transmembrane%20domain%20instead%20of%20PX,influenza%20viruses%29%2C%20and%20neurodegenerative)). PLD5, lacking that enzymatic output, might influence signaling in a more indirect way – perhaps by binding lipids or signaling proteins. 

Another avenue of investigation is **genetic studies**. There are currently no known Mendelian diseases caused by PLD5 mutations, but given its high expression in brain, researchers have looked for links to neurological conditions. As mentioned, one genome-wide study (Anney *et al.*, 2010) identified a region near *PLD5* associated with autism spectrum disorder ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=200150#:~:text=Bioengineered%2C%202021%20Dec,association%20to%20chromosome%201q43%20in)), and another report noted *PLD5* in a schizophrenia genomic study (though as one of many candidates). These are population-level correlations and do not establish causality, but they make PLD5 a gene of interest for neurodevelopmental function. The **Human Protein Atlas RNA data** showing enrichment in choroid plexus ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%20Evidence%20at%20protein%20level)) also opens questions about whether PLD5 could relate to cerebrospinal fluid regulation or blood–brain barrier processes. 

Overall, the current research consensus is that **PLD5 is a catalytically inactive PLD-homolog whose precise role remains to be discovered** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). Authoritative reviews emphasize prioritizing PLD5 for future study to fill the knowledge gap in the PLD family ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/1/370/7442542#:~:text=intracellular%20signaling%20pathways,also%20contains%20a%20transmembrane%20segment)). As techniques such as CRISPR knockouts, proteomics, and advanced imaging are applied, we expect to learn if PLD5 has a unique substrate (be it a lipid, nucleic acid, or protein) or if it acts as a regulatory scaffold. Its **confirmed presence in membranes and potentially mitochondria** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180287-PLD5/subcellular#:~:text=Summary,i)), and its **influence on cellular behaviors** in at least some systems ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8806496/#:~:text=tissues%20in%20comparison%20to%20the,proliferation%2C%20migration%2C%20invasion%2C%20and%20metastasis)), indicate that PLD5 is not simply nonfunctional. Instead, it likely has a **subtle role in cellular homeostasis or signaling** that has yet to be characterized. Unraveling PLD5’s function will not only clarify the biology of this particular gene but also enrich our understanding of the diverse strategies that PLD-superfamily proteins use in cell regulation.
