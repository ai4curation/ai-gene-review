description: >-
  Phospholipase D family member 5 (PLD5) is a poorly characterized member of
  the PLD superfamily. Despite containing the characteristic PLD phosphodiesterase
  domains with HKD motifs, PLD5 is considered catalytically inactive as a
  phospholipase because it lacks conserved active site residues required for
  phospholipid hydrolysis. UniProt explicitly names this protein "Inactive
  phospholipase D5". The protein is a type II single-pass transmembrane protein
  (~536 amino acids, ~61 kDa) that lacks the PX and PH domains found in classical
  PLD1/PLD2. Expression is enriched in brain and choroid plexus. Subcellular
  localization studies suggest mitochondrial localization in some cell types.
  While related family members PLD3/PLD4 have been shown to function as 5'
  exonucleases in endolysosomes rather than lipases, no enzymatic activity has
  been demonstrated for PLD5. The molecular function of PLD5 remains undefined -
  it may act as a pseudoenzyme/scaffold, have an unknown substrate, or possess
  a non-catalytic regulatory role. Overexpression in prostate cancer promotes
  proliferation and is regulated by miR-145-5p. PLD5 is distinct from PLD6/MitoPLD
  which has cardiolipin hydrolase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on InterPro domain IPR001736 (PLipase_D/transphosphatidylase)
      which is present in PLD5. However, authoritative reviews and UniProt explicitly
      state that PLD5 lacks the conserved HKD active sites and is catalytically inactive.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      PLD5 is explicitly designated as "Inactive phospholipase D5" by UniProt due to
      degenerate HKD catalytic motifs. Multiple reviews confirm PLD5 lacks phospholipase
      activity. Nelson and Frohman (2015) state PLD5 has "no catalytic activity" as a
      lipase. Bozatzi and Sapkota (2018) confirm PLD5 is "catalytically inactive" due to
      lacking HKD motifs. A 2023 structural analysis states "Little is known about PLD5,
      and it is even unclear if it is active as an enzyme." While the protein contains
      the PLD domain architecture, this IEA annotation incorrectly implies active
      catalytic function. The presence of a catalytic domain does not guarantee
      enzymatic activity - many pseudoenzymes exist.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PLD5 is a single-pass type II transmembrane protein with a predicted
      transmembrane helix at residues 69-89. UniProt confirms membrane
      localization, and HPA data suggests mitochondrial membrane localization.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While the general membrane annotation is correct, more specific localization
      data is available. Human Protein Atlas immunofluorescence data shows PLD5
      is primarily localized to mitochondria in U-2 OS and A-549 cell lines.
      The protein has a single transmembrane domain consistent with a type II
      membrane topology. More specific annotations for intracellular membrane
      or mitochondrial membrane would be more informative.

    label: molecular_function
  description: >-
    PLD5 molecular function is undefined. The protein contains PLD phosphodiesterase
    domains but lacks conserved active site residues for phospholipase activity.
    It may function as a pseudoenzyme with scaffolding or regulatory roles rather
    than catalytic activity. The protein contains two PLDc domains that could
    potentially bind substrates or interaction partners without catalyzing reactions.
    No specific binding partners or activities have been experimentally validated.
    Unlike PLD3/PLD4 which have been shown to have nuclease activity, PLD5 has
    no demonstrated enzymatic activity of any kind.
