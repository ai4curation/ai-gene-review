description: Phospholipase D family member 5, mitochondrial phospholipase that specifically
  hydrolyzes cardiolipin. Mitochondrial protein localized to mitochondrial matrix/inner
  membrane. Cardiolipin is signature phospholipid of mitochondrial inner membrane,
  critical for cristae structure, respiratory chain supercomplex assembly, and apoptosis
  regulation. PLD5 catalyzes cardiolipin hydrolysis, generating monolyso-cardiolipin.
  Function may be in cardiolipin remodeling or degradation during mitochondrial stress,
  apoptosis, or mitophagy. Loss of PLD5 affects mitochondrial morphology and function.
  Contains phospholipase D catalytic domain but differs from classical PLDs - specifically
  cleaves cardiolipin rather than phosphatidylcholine. Expression in heart, skeletal
  muscle, brain - tissues with high mitochondrial content and energy demand. May regulate
  mitochondrial membrane dynamics, apoptosis susceptibility, or quality control. Aberrant
  cardiolipin metabolism linked to neurodegenerative diseases and heart failure.
