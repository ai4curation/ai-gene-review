### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GLRX5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GLRX5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GLRX5** (gene ID: GLRX5, UniProt: Q86SX6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human GLRX5 (UniProt Q86SX6)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: GLRX5 encodes the human mitochondrial monothiol (CGFS-type) glutaredoxin 5, a single-domain thioredoxin-fold protein specialized for iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster handling rather than classical oxidoreductase chemistry. It forms a dimeric holo-species bridged by a [2Fe–2S] cluster co‑ligated by the active-site cysteines and two glutathione (GSH) molecules in a specific binding pocket, a hallmark of CGFS-type Grxs (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, trnka2020molecularbasisfor pages 5-6). Functionally, GLRX5 serves as a central [2Fe–2S] carrier within the mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) pathway, accepting clusters from the ISCU scaffold and donating them to downstream clients and maturation nodes (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6).
- Localization and distinction from paralogs: GLRX5 is mitochondrially localized and operates in the ISC machinery, whereas GLRX3 is a multidomain, primarily cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin involved in cytosolic iron/Fe–S trafficking; this separation of function and localization is emphasized in comparative reviews (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, daniel2020roleofgsh pages 20-21).

Biochemical mechanism and pathways (current understanding)
- Cluster binding and transfer: Biophysical and biochemical studies show GLRX5 binds an intrinsically labile [2Fe–2S] cluster in a dimer with two GSH ligands; this cluster is rapidly transferred in vitro to physiological acceptors, notably mitochondrial ferredoxin FDX1, consistent with a donor role positioned downstream of ISCU in the ISC pathway (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6). Hsp70 (HSPA9) and HSC20 facilitate release of the ISCU-bound cluster to GLRX5 in yeast/human systems, integrating chaperone assistance into early ISC transfer (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6, daniel2020roleofgsh pages 8-10).
- Downstream clients and nodes: The GLRX5–BOLA3 node delivers [2Fe–2S] clusters directly to mitoribosomal proteins bS16m/mS25, while the ISCA1–NFU1 node supplies [4Fe–4S] to the assembly factor METTL17, collectively supporting maturation of small and large mitoribosomal subunits; 55Fe‑labeling and proteomics in human cells support these routes (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11). GLRX5 also donates [2Fe–2S] to mitochondrial ferredoxins (FDX1/FDX2) and operates upstream of ISCA1/ISCA2 and NFU1 in [4Fe–4S] maturation for respiratory chain and other mitochondrial clients (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17). GLRX5 forms [2Fe–2S]-bridged heterodimers with BOLA1 or BOLA3; kinetic and accessibility data indicate BOLA3–GLRX5 is suited for trafficking, whereas BOLA1–GLRX5 may play a redox role with limited cluster donation (sen2020clusterexchangereactivity pages 1-5). By contrast, cytosolic GLRX3/BOLA2 complexes act in distinct iron signaling/trafficking pathways outside mitochondria (daniel2020roleofgsh pages 20-21).
- Systemic linkage: GSH and GLRX5 also intersect with the Atm1/ABCB7-dependent export step that couples mitochondrial ISC to cytosolic Fe–S assembly (CIA); GSH-bound [2Fe–2S] species have been proposed as intermediates for export and cytosolic maturation (daniel2020roleofgsh pages 3-5).

Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Mitoribosome maturation: In human HEK293T cells, silencing GLRX5 or BOLA3 reduces mitoribosome [2Fe–2S] incorporation and attenuates mitochondrial translation, defining a GLRX5–BOLA3 delivery route to mitoribosomal clusters and an ISCA1–NFU1 route to METTL17 [4Fe–4S] (Nucleic Acids Research 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11).
- Ferredoxin axis: Functional mapping of human FDX1/FDX2 in 2023 supports GLRX5-dependent provision of [2Fe–2S] to ferredoxins and their downstream targets in steroidogenesis and Fe–S assembly; structural and genetic analyses define ferredoxin specificity and place reductive fusion of two GLRX5-bound clusters upstream of [4Fe–4S] assembly (Nature Chemical Biology 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-022-01159-4) (schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17). In ovarian cancer cells (JBC 2024), perturbing FDX2 predisposed to ferroptosis and decreased ISCA1/GLRX5 protein levels, highlighting the interconnectedness of FDX2 and GLRX5 in maintaining ISC robustness (Journal of Biological Chemistry 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107678) (miyahara2024fdx2anironsulfur pages 9-10).
- Disease expansion: A 2024 case report described a lethal, early-onset nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH)-like phenotype caused by a novel homozygous GLRX5 variant, mechanistically linked to impaired lipoate synthesis for the glycine cleavage system, expanding the GLRX5 clinical spectrum (Frontiers in Genetics 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2024.1432272) (marin2024casereportunveiling pages 1-3, marin2024casereportunveiling pages 8-8).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostics: GLRX5-related disease workups employ genome sequencing (panel/WES/WGS) alongside metabolic testing (CSF and plasma glycine; MRI) to identify lipoate pathway defects and confirm NKH-like presentations, as illustrated by the 2024 case (marin2024casereportunveiling pages 1-3). In sideroblastic anemia contexts, hematology guidance emphasizes evaluation for iron overload and contributing genes (e.g., ABCB7) and management with iron chelation and erythroid maturation agents to reduce transfusion burden (Hematology 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000569) (gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic landscape: No GLRX5-specific therapy is approved. In acquired sideroblastic settings, deferasirox chelation and luspatercept can mitigate iron loading and transfusion needs, respectively, although luspatercept does not deplete existing iron stores (gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2). Experimentally, modulation of ferroptosis sensitivity via GLRX5 suppression has been reported as a strategy to overcome cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer models and is reflected in 2024 bioinformatic studies that list GLRX5 among ferroptosis-related biomarkers in kidney cancers and AKI; these are investigational and not standard of care (petronek2021iron–sulfurclusterbiogenesis pages 18-19, secocervera2020thioredoxinandglutaredoxin pages 9-12).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Authoritative reviews conclude that GLRX5 is a dedicated Fe–S transferase, not a general oxidoreductase, with function encoded by the CGFS-type active-site loop that enforces Fe–S handling and GSH dependence; engineering studies that swap loop elements convert function between classes, underscoring structure–function logic (Nature Communications 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17323-0) (trnka2020molecularbasisfor pages 5-6). Comprehensive reviews place GLRX5 at the ISC–CIA interface through GSH-bound intermediates and emphasize its role as a rapid [2Fe–2S] donor to FDX1 and downstream maturation steps (Biological Chemistry 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1515/hsz-2020-0237) (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6). Biophysical work on GLRX5–BOLA complexes argues for distinct functions of BOLA1 versus BOLA3 heterodimers, with BOLA3 complexes more compatible with cluster transfer, aligning with human cell evidence for GLRX5–BOLA3 supplying mitoribosome clusters (FEBS Journal 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15452; Nucleic Acids Research 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842) (sen2020clusterexchangereactivity pages 1-5, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11).

Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- In HEK293T cells, siRNA knockdown achieved >95% depletion of GLRX5/BOLA3/ISCA1/NFU1 and reduced mitoribosome 55Fe incorporation to near-undetectable levels for some knockdowns; mitochondrial protein synthesis dropped to approximately 60–70% of control upon GLRX5, ISCA1, BOLA3, or NFU1 silencing (NAR 2023) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11).
- In the 2024 NKH-like GLRX5 case, the proband with homozygous p.Asp123His presented at 2 months and died by 4 months despite supportive care; confirmatory tests included CSF and blood glycine quantification and genetic analysis (Frontiers in Genetics 2024) (marin2024casereportunveiling pages 1-3).
- In ovarian cancer models, FDX2 loss predisposed to ferroptosis and was accompanied by decreased GLRX5 and ISCA1 levels; phenotypic outcomes (senescence/apoptosis/ferroptosis) depended on p53 status and anti-ferroptotic tone (JBC 2024) (miyahara2024fdx2anironsulfur pages 9-10).

Primary function of GLRX5
- GLRX5 is an Fe–S cluster transfer protein that receives [2Fe–2S] from ISCU (HSPA9/HSC20-assisted), binds it as a GSH-co-ligated [2Fe–2S]-bridged homodimer, and donates it to (i) mitochondrial [2Fe–2S] clients such as FDX1/FDX2 and mitoribosomal proteins (via a GLRX5–BOLA3 node) and (ii) [4Fe–4S] assembly factors (ISCA1/2, NFU1) enabling maturation of downstream [4Fe–4S] enzymes and assembly factors like METTL17; it thereby supports heme synthesis (ALAS2/ferrochelatase), respiratory complexes, and mitochondrial translation (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11, schulz2023functionalspectrumand pages 12-17).

Subcellular site of action
- GLRX5 acts in the mitochondrial matrix as part of the ISC system, distinct from cytosolic GLRX3-dependent processes; its activity links to GSH metabolism and to ABC transporter–mediated export (ABCB7/Atm1) that supplies cytosolic CIA (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, daniel2020roleofgsh pages 3-5).

Disease mechanisms
- Sideroblastic anemia: GLRX5 deficiency perturbs Fe–S assembly such that IRP1 is activated, ALAS2 and ferrochelatase function are compromised, and mitochondrial iron accumulates, producing microcytic/normocytic sideroblastic anemia with systemic iron overload; clinical management follows sideroblastic anemia principles including chelation and, where appropriate, luspatercept to reduce transfusion dependency (daniel2020roleofgsh pages 8-10, daniel2020roleofgsh pages 21-23, gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2).
- Lipoate synthesis and NKH-like disease: GLRX5 operates upstream of LIAS (lipoyl synthase) and BOLA3/NFU1; defective delivery of Fe–S clusters diminishes LIAS activity and glycine cleavage complex lipoylation, producing an NKH-like biochemical profile with severe neurologic disease in recent reports (marin2024casereportunveiling pages 1-3, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11).

Ferroptosis, cancer, and translational implications
- GLRX5 loss increases labile iron and lipid peroxidation and can sensitize tumor cells to ferroptosis; studies in head and neck cancer suggest that GLRX5 suppression can overcome cisplatin resistance, while multi-omics analyses in 2024 identify GLRX5 as a ferroptosis-related biomarker in renal carcinoma and AKI, motivating exploration of GLRX5 as a therapeutic vulnerability or biomarker in specific contexts (petronek2021iron–sulfurclusterbiogenesis pages 18-19, secocervera2020thioredoxinandglutaredoxin pages 9-12).

Conclusion
The literature consistently identifies human GLRX5 (Q86SX6) as a mitochondrial CGFS-type glutaredoxin that binds a GSH‑ligated [2Fe–2S] cluster and functions as a central transfer hub in ISC biogenesis. Recent work in human cells delineates a GLRX5–BOLA3 route for mitoribosomal [2Fe–2S] incorporation and positions GLRX5 upstream of ISCA1–NFU1 for [4Fe–4S] delivery to METTL17. Clinically, GLRX5 defects cause sideroblastic anemia and, via impaired lipoate synthesis, severe NKH-like neurometabolic disease. Translationally, GLRX5 perturbation modulates ferroptosis susceptibility and is being explored as a biomarker and potential therapeutic lever in selected cancers and organ injury, though clinical applications remain investigational (muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 4-5, muhlenhoff2020glutaredoxinsandironsulfur pages 5-6, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 9-11, marin2024casereportunveiling pages 1-3, gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2, petronek2021iron–sulfurclusterbiogenesis pages 18-19, secocervera2020thioredoxinandglutaredoxin pages 9-12).
