description: Mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin that functions as an iron-sulfur
  cluster transfer protein. GLRX5 receives [2Fe-2S] clusters from the scaffold protein
  ISCU and mediates their transfer to downstream recipient apoproteins or to the [4Fe-4S]
  cluster biosynthesis machinery. Critical for heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells
  through regulation of both ALAS2 (via IRP1) and ferrochelatase.

  review:
    summary: GLRX5 is a mitochondrial matrix protein as demonstrated by immunofluorescence,
      subcellular fractionation, and subfractionation studies. The mature processed
      form lacks the N-terminal targeting sequence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotations for GLRX5 mitochondrial matrix localization are well-supported
      by extensive experimental evidence from multiple studies. This is the primary
      site where GLRX5 carries out its iron-sulfur cluster transfer function, positioned
      optimally within the ISC assembly machinery in the matrix compartment.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: GLRX5 binds [2Fe-2S] clusters through its active-site cysteine Cys67
      and glutathione ligands. This is a specific form of metal ion binding involving
      iron coordinated in an iron-sulfur cluster. The [2Fe-2S] cluster is ligated
      by Cys67 from two GLRX5 monomers plus two glutathione molecules, creating a
      bridging cluster between dimers.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct, the term "metal ion binding" (GO:0046872) is
      too general for GLRX5's specific function. The more specific child terms "iron-sulfur
      cluster binding" (GO:0051536) and "2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding" (GO:0051537)
      that are already present in the annotation set better capture GLRX5's actual
      molecular function. GLRX5 does not bind free metal ions but rather coordinates
      iron atoms within a [2Fe-2S] cluster structure.

    summary: GLRX5 is localized to mitochondria, specifically to the mitochondrial
      matrix. However, the more specific term GO:0005759 (mitochondrial matrix) is
      already present and better captures the precise localization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While accurate, this is a less specific parent term of GO:0005759 (mitochondrial

    summary: This annotation is based on orthology transfer from model organisms.
      While GLRX5 protein may be present in dendrites of neurons due to mitochondrial
      localization (dendrites contain mitochondria), there is no specific evidence
      that GLRX5 has any specialized dendritic function distinct from its general
      mitochondrial role in Fe-S cluster assembly.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This appears to be an over-annotation resulting from automated orthology
      transfer. GLRX5's presence in dendrites would simply reflect the presence of
      mitochondria in dendritic compartments, not a specific dendritic function. The
      deep research and primary literature focus on GLRX5's mitochondrial matrix localization
      and Fe-S cluster transfer function, with no mention of dendrite-specific roles.

    summary: Similar to the dendrite annotation, this is based on orthology transfer.
      GLRX5 may be present in neuronal cell bodies due to mitochondrial localization,
      but there is no evidence for a neuron-specific function. The variant nonketotic
      hyperglycinemia phenotype associated with GLRX5 mutations does involve neurological
      manifestations, but this results from general mitochondrial dysfunction affecting
      lipoate synthesis rather than a neuron-specific role.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This appears to be an over-annotation from automated orthology transfer.
      While GLRX5 mutations cause neurological disease (variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia),
      this results from its general mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly function affecting
      lipoate synthesis, not a neuron-specific cellular role.

  review:
    summary: While GLRX5 is involved in iron homeostasis through its effects on IRP1

      peripheral to its core function of iron-sulfur cluster assembly and transfer.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: GLRX5 does affect intracellular iron homeostasis through multiple mechanisms
      - IRP1 regulation, mitochondrial iron accumulation when deficient, and control
      of heme biosynthesis. However, this is a secondary consequence of its primary
      role in Fe-S cluster assembly. The term is accurate but should be marked as

      on ISCA1:ISCA2" which involves GLRX5 transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to ISCA
      proteins for subsequent [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly. The mitochondrial matrix
      localization is accurate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: TAS (Traceable Author Statement) from Reactome pathway database provides
      additional support for mitochondrial matrix localization. While redundant with
      other mitochondrial matrix annotations, Reactome pathways provide valuable functional
      context.

  review:
    summary: PMID:20364084 provides direct experimental evidence for mitochondrial
      matrix localization through immunofluorescence, subcellular fractionation, and
      colocalization with matrix proteins. This is a key reference establishing GLRX5
      localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is direct experimental evidence (IDA) from the landmark paper characterizing
      human GLRX5. The evidence is strong and specific for mitochondrial matrix localization,
      making this a high-quality annotation.

  review:
    summary: GLRX5 is highly expressed in erythroid cells and plays a critical role
      in heme biosynthesis during erythropoiesis. GLRX5 deficiency causes sideroblastic
      anemia, a disorder of erythroid development. The protein's high expression in
      erythroblasts and its role in regulating ALAS2 (the erythroid-specific heme
      biosynthesis enzyme) and ferrochelatase support involvement in hemopoiesis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While inferred from sequence similarity (ISS), this annotation is well-supported
      by experimental evidence. GLRX5 is dramatically enriched in erythroid cells,
      plays a critical role in heme biosynthesis through regulation of ALAS2 and ferrochelatase,
      and mutations cause sideroblastic anemia. The tissue-specific importance in
      hemopoiesis is a validated aspect of GLRX5 biology.

    label: iron-sulfur cluster chaperone activity
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:23615440
  review:
    summary: This molecular function term precisely describes GLRX5's core biochemical
      activity. GLRX5 functions as a metallochaperone that binds [2Fe-2S] clusters
      and delivers them to acceptor proteins. The term definition "Binding to an iron-sulfur
      cluster and delivering it to an acceptor molecule" exactly matches GLRX5's characterized
      function.
    action: NEW
    reason: This is a key missing annotation that captures GLRX5's primary molecular
      function. GLRX5 functions as a late-acting component of the ISC assembly machinery,
      receiving [2Fe-2S] clusters from the scaffold protein ISCU and facilitating
      their transfer to recipient apoproteins or to the [4Fe-4S] cluster biosynthesis
      machinery. Structural studies show GLRX5 binds clusters and undergoes conformational
      transitions that enable cluster-mediated protein-protein recognition and transfer.
      This term is more functionally specific than the existing "iron-sulfur cluster
      binding" annotations.

    label: iron-sulfur cluster transfer complex
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:28380382
  review:
    summary: This cellular component term explicitly includes GLRX5 in its definition
      as part of the human Fe-S cluster transfer complex. According to the GO term
      definition, "In humans, it consists of HSPA9, HSCB, GLRX5, ABCB7 and GFER."
      GLRX5 is a core component of the machinery that catalyzes transfer of Fe-S clusters
      from donors to acceptors.
    action: NEW
    reason: This is an important missing cellular component annotation that captures
      GLRX5's participation in the Fe-S cluster transfer machinery. GLRX5 participates
      in multi-protein complexes that facilitate cluster transfer, interacting with
      the chaperone system (HSPA9/HSC20), the scaffold ISCU, and late-acting factors
      like BOLA1/BOLA3. This term complements the existing GO:1990229 (iron-sulfur
      cluster assembly complex) annotation by specifically describing the transfer
      function of the complex.
