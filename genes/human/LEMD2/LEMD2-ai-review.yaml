description: 'LEM domain-containing protein 2, transmembrane protein of inner nuclear
  membrane (INM) essential for nuclear envelope integrity, chromatin organization,
  and cardiac function. Contains highly conserved LEM domain mediating interactions
  with BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor) and lamins, plus two transmembrane
  domains anchoring it to INM. Acts as transmembrane adapter for ESCRT (endosomal
  sorting complexes required for transport) machinery, recruiting proteins CHMP7,
  IST1/CHMP8, and CHMP2A to facilitate nuclear envelope closure during cell division
  and repair. Critical for detecting and repairing nuclear envelope ruptures both
  during mitotic exit and interphase by recruiting ESCRT-III components. Interacts
  with DNA-binding proteins (lamins and BAF), mediating connection between chromatin
  and nuclear envelope. Helps organize heterochromatin at NE, influencing gene expression
  and maintaining genome stability. Regulates signaling pathways MAPK/ERK and AKT,
  required for myoblast differentiation and cardiac homeostasis. Essential for embryogenesis,
  particularly proper heart development. Localized to inner nuclear membrane where
  it associates with nuclear lamina and chromatin. Known interactions: Lamins A/C
  (nuclear lamina structural proteins), BAF (DNA-binding protein for chromatin organization),
  ESCRT-III components (NE reformation and repair), signaling molecules (modulates
  ERK and AKT pathways in muscle/cardiac cells). Homozygous missense mutations (e.g.
  c.T38>G, p.L13R in LEM domain) linked to arrhythmic cardiomyopathy, cataracts, and
  sudden death. Loss of function causes severe cardiac defects, nuclear envelope deformations,
  DNA damage, and apoptosis via p53 activation. LEMD2 deficiency leads to widespread
  gene expression changes, activation of p53-dependent DNA damage response, and cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis. Mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac fibrosis, and cataract
  46. Role in nuclear envelope surveillance and ESCRT-mediated repair is central to
  maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially under mechanical stress. Gene therapy
  approaches show rescue of cardiac defects in animal models.'
