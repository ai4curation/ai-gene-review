description: 'Epsilon-sarcoglycan, transmembrane glycoprotein (~437 AA, ~43-50 kDa)
  that is component of sarcoglycan family within dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
  complex (DGC). Single-pass membrane protein with large N-terminal extracellular
  domain (heavily glycosylated, disulfide-bonded), transmembrane segment, and small
  cytoplasmic tail. Contains conserved N-linked glycosylation sites and cysteine residues.
  Maternally imprinted gene - maternal allele silenced, only paternal copy expressed
  in most tissues, resulting in autosomal-dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance
  (pathogenic variants usually cause disease only when inherited from father). Over
  40 alternative transcript isoforms including brain-specific variants. In striated/cardiac
  muscle: component of sarcoglycan subcomplex within DGC at sarcolemma, forms physical
  link between intracellular cytoskeleton (via dystrophin) and extracellular matrix
  (via dystroglycan-laminin binding), stabilizing sarcolemma and protecting muscle
  fibers from contraction damage. ~60% sequence identity to α-sarcoglycan and can
  functionally substitute for it - overexpression in α-sarcoglycan-deficient mice
  rescues muscular dystrophy. In smooth muscle: replaces α-sarcoglycan as predominant
  isoform, partners with β-, δ-, ζ-sarcoglycan forming unique tetrameric assembly,
  maintaining same adhesive function linking muscle cortex to ECM. Loss of any sarcoglycan
  destabilizes entire complex causing mislocalization and degradation of remaining
  subunits. Primary molecular function is structural - integrates into DGC to maintain
  sarcolemmal integrity and resist mechanical stress (mechanoprotective role). In
  CNS: highly expressed in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum,
  olfactory bulb. Incorporated into DGC-like complexes in brain, co-assembling with
  β-, δ-, γ-, ζ-sarcoglycan and co-purifying with dystroglycans and dystrophin/utrophin.
  Predominantly neuronal expression (also perivascular astrocytes and brain blood
  vessels). Critical role in synaptic organization, particularly at inhibitory GABAergic
  synapses - functions as scaffold stabilizing synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter
  receptors. Localized in punctate pattern at synapses, co-distributed with GABA_A
  receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Helps
  organize/anchor GABA_A receptor clusters in postsynaptic membrane. Loss disrupts
  GABAergic neurotransmission: impaired GABA_A receptor clustering, reduced tonic
  inhibitory currents, deficits in synaptic inhibition, culminating in myoclonic jerks
  and dystonia-like movements resembling myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. Links epsilon-sarcoglycan''s
  molecular role to inhibitory neural circuit function. May influence calcium homeostasis
  and signaling in neurons. Also present in retina at inner/outer limiting membranes
  with Müller glial cell endfeet, potentially contributing to glial polarity, adhesion,
  or blood-retina barrier. Enriched in brain microvasculature, possibly supporting
  neurovascular unit and blood-brain barrier integrity. Mutations cause myoclonus-dystonia
  syndrome (NOT limb-girdle muscular dystrophy like other sarcoglycans) - hyperkinetic
  movements and dystonia from imbalance in neurotransmission (deficit in inhibitory
  signaling). No skeletal muscle disease because abundant α-sarcoglycan compensates,
  whereas smooth muscle and CNS rely on epsilon-sarcoglycan as primary isoform.'
