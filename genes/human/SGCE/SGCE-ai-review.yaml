description: 'Epsilon-sarcoglycan, transmembrane glycoprotein (~437 AA, ~43-50 kDa)
  that is component of sarcoglycan family within dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
  complex (DGC). Single-pass membrane protein with large N-terminal extracellular
  domain (heavily glycosylated, disulfide-bonded), transmembrane segment, and small
  cytoplasmic tail. Contains conserved N-linked glycosylation sites and cysteine residues.
  Maternally imprinted gene - maternal allele silenced, only paternal copy expressed
  in most tissues, resulting in autosomal-dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance
  (pathogenic variants usually cause disease only when inherited from father). Over
  40 alternative transcript isoforms including brain-specific variants. In striated/cardiac
  muscle: component of sarcoglycan subcomplex within DGC at sarcolemma, forms physical
  link between intracellular cytoskeleton (via dystrophin) and extracellular matrix
  (via dystroglycan-laminin binding), stabilizing sarcolemma and protecting muscle
  fibers from contraction damage. ~60% sequence identity to α-sarcoglycan and can
  functionally substitute for it - overexpression in α-sarcoglycan-deficient mice
  rescues muscular dystrophy. In smooth muscle: replaces α-sarcoglycan as predominant
  isoform, partners with β-, δ-, ζ-sarcoglycan forming unique tetrameric assembly,
  maintaining same adhesive function linking muscle cortex to ECM. Loss of any sarcoglycan
  destabilizes entire complex causing mislocalization and degradation of remaining
  subunits. Primary molecular function is structural - integrates into DGC to maintain
  sarcolemmal integrity and resist mechanical stress (mechanoprotective role). In
  CNS: highly expressed in cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum,
  olfactory bulb. Incorporated into DGC-like complexes in brain, co-assembling with
  β-, δ-, γ-, ζ-sarcoglycan and co-purifying with dystroglycans and dystrophin/utrophin.
  Predominantly neuronal expression (also perivascular astrocytes and brain blood
  vessels). Critical role in synaptic organization, particularly at inhibitory GABAergic
  synapses - functions as scaffold stabilizing synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter
  receptors. Localized in punctate pattern at synapses, co-distributed with GABA_A
  receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Helps
  organize/anchor GABA_A receptor clusters in postsynaptic membrane. Loss disrupts
  GABAergic neurotransmission: impaired GABA_A receptor clustering, reduced tonic
  inhibitory currents, deficits in synaptic inhibition, culminating in myoclonic jerks
  and dystonia-like movements resembling myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. Links epsilon-sarcoglycan''s
  molecular role to inhibitory neural circuit function. May influence calcium homeostasis
  and signaling in neurons. Also present in retina at inner/outer limiting membranes
  with Müller glial cell endfeet, potentially contributing to glial polarity, adhesion,
  or blood-retina barrier. Enriched in brain microvasculature, possibly supporting
  neurovascular unit and blood-brain barrier integrity. Mutations cause myoclonus-dystonia
  syndrome (NOT limb-girdle muscular dystrophy like other sarcoglycans) - hyperkinetic
  movements and dystonia from imbalance in neurotransmission (deficit in inhibitory
  signaling). No skeletal muscle disease because abundant α-sarcoglycan compensates,
  whereas smooth muscle and CNS rely on epsilon-sarcoglycan as primary isoform.'

    review:
      summary: SGCE is a bona fide component of the sarcoglycan subcomplex 
        within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Assembly occurs stepwise in 
        ER with beta-/delta-sarcoglycans forming core to which 
        epsilon-sarcoglycan binds. Confirmed by biochemical studies in muscle 
        and smooth muscle tissues where SGCE assembles with other sarcoglycans.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Core molecular complex assignment. IBA annotation phylogenetically
        sound. Direct experimental evidence from multiple studies confirms SGCE 
        as integral sarcoglycan complex component in multiple tissue types. Deep
        research confirms SGCE functions within tetra/pentameric sarcoglycan 
        assemblies.

    review:
      summary: SGCE does not directly localize to cytoskeleton but connects to 
        it indirectly through DGC. The DGC links F-actin cytoskeleton (via 
        dystrophin binding) to extracellular matrix. SGCE is membrane-spanning 
        component that bridges this connection but is not itself a cytoskeletal 
        protein.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: Too imprecise - SGCE is transmembrane protein in DGC that 
        indirectly associates with cytoskeleton, not a cytoskeletal protein per 
        se. The term 'cytoskeleton' suggests SGCE is part of cytoskeletal 
        structure itself. Better annotation would be its role in DGC complex or 
        as structural molecule linking membrane to cytoskeleton.
