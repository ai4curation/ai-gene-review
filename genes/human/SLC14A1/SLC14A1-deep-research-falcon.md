## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q13336
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Urea transporter 1; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 14 member 1; AltName: Full=Urea transporter, erythrocyte;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SLC14A1; Synonyms=HUT11, JK, RACH1, UT1, UTE;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the urea transporter family. .
- **Key Domains:** Ammonium/urea_transptr. (IPR029020); Urea_transporter. (IPR004937); UT (PF03253)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SLC14A1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SLC14A1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SLC14A1** (gene ID: SLC14A1, UniProt: Q13336) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: SLC14A1 (UT‑B; Kidd/JK blood group)

Identity verification and key definitions
- Gene/protein: SLC14A1 encodes the human facilitative urea transporter UT‑B, which carries the Kidd (JK) blood group antigens on red blood cells (aliases include HUT11, JK, UT1/UT‑B1). The gene lies on chr18q11–q12, with the mature protein encoded by exons 4–10. The JK system (ISBT 009) includes antithetical JK1/JK2 antigens and JK3; absence of UT‑B yields the Jk(a−b−) “JK null” phenotype. Functionally, UT‑B mediates rapid, selective urea transport across membranes. These identities and roles are foundational for both physiology and transfusion medicine (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; published Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).

- Protein family/domains and fold: Human UTs are homotrimers; each subunit forms an independent pore with 10 transmembrane helices arranged with pseudo‑C2 symmetry. Recent structural work on human UT‑B confirms conserved urea coordination features that underlie high urea flux and provides the structural basis for selective inhibition. These properties place UT‑B squarely within the classical UT family and align with the Ammonium/urea transporter superfamily annotations noted for UTs (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; published Sep 2023) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 10-11).

Molecular function and transport mechanism
- Substrate specificity and permeation: UT‑B is a facilitative channel specialized for urea. High‑resolution structures of human UT‑B and UT‑A paralogs, together with cryo‑EM across multiple states, reveal a conserved urea recognition motif and an H‑bond transfer path that guides urea through the pore, accounting for the transporter’s very high turnover for urea. Functional assays show robust urea permeability of human UT‑B that is blockable by small‑molecule inhibitors (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Inhibition modes and selectivity: Multiple inhibitor classes demonstrate distinct binding modes to UTs. Competitive (e.g., 25a, ATB3), uncompetitive (CF11), and noncompetitive (HQA2) inhibitors occupy different pockets or regions in UTs; human UT‑B has been co‑resolved with a selective inhibitor (UTBinh‑14), establishing structural determinants for selectivity and enabling structure‑guided design of UT modulators (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Cellular and tissue localization
- Erythrocytes and renal microvasculature: UT‑B is abundant on human erythrocytes, where it enables rapid equilibration of intracellular and extracellular urea. It is also expressed on endothelial cells of the renal vasa recta (descending limbs), contributing to the medullary urea handling necessary for the urine‑concentrating mechanism. These localizations underpin both its physiologic roles and its identity as the JK blood group carrier (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).

Physiological roles
- RBC urea equilibration: On red cells, UT‑B equilibrates urea rapidly, protecting RBCs from osmotic stress during circulation through the hyperosmotic renal medulla and other environments (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).
- Kidney concentrating mechanism: In the descending vasa recta endothelium, UT‑B participates in countercurrent exchange of urea, a key component of the renal medullary concentrating process. This role is supported by the established UT‑B expression pattern and the broader UT architecture and functional data from human structures (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3, chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and latest research
- Human structural biology advances (2023–2024): The first high‑resolution structures of human UT‑B and UT‑A family members delineate the conserved urea recognition motif and proton‑independent H‑bond relay for permeation, identify lipid associations, and map selective inhibitor binding sites (Sci Adv 2023; Nat Commun 2024). These studies provide a blueprint for rational design of UT‑targeted small molecules and deepen mechanistic understanding of urea permeation (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Transfusion genomics using long‑read sequencing (2024): In a routine donor cohort with paired serology and genotypes (11,972 donors), Oxford Nanopore long‑read sequencing of SLC14A1 resolved 10 unexplained JK discrepancies, uncovering two novel JK null alleles (Gly40Asp on JK*01; Gly242Glu on JK*02) and a previously undetected ~5 kb deletion spanning exons 9–10 of JK*01. The study shows long‑read sequencing’s ability to detect both SNVs and structural variants and to resolve haplotypes that standard methods may miss (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010225; Jan 2024) (gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 1-2, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 9-10).
- Tumor biology (2024): Multiple analyses link SLC14A1 to cancer phenotypes. Large GWAS and meta‑analyses have associated SLC14A1 (e.g., rs10775480, intron 6) with bladder cancer susceptibility; experimental studies report tumor‑suppressor‑like effects in urothelial tumors. In prostate cancer, SLC14A1 expression decreases with progression, attributed to promoter hypermethylation; lower expression/hypermethylation correlates with worse prognosis. Overexpression suppresses proliferation and metastasis while dampening CDK1/CCNB1 and mTOR/MMP‑9 signaling (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-66020-1; Jun 2024) (ma2024downregulationofslc14a1 pages 1-2).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Blood bank/transfusion medicine:
  • Antigen carrier: SLC14A1 (UT‑B) defines the JK system; anti‑JK antibodies can cause acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. Alloimmunization is generally rare (<1%); one center reported a combined anti‑JK1/JK2 incidence of 0.05%, underscoring that while infrequent, clinically significant anti‑JK can occur and requires compatible unit selection (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).
  • Genotyping/phenotyping: Long‑read SLC14A1 sequencing resolves genotype–phenotype discrepancies, including weak and null alleles and structural variants that evade standard assays, improving patient/donor matching and transfusion safety (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010225; Jan 2024) (gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 1-2, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 9-10, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepanciesa pages 12-13, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepanciesb pages 12-13).
- Drug discovery: Human UT structures with bound inhibitors (UT‑B selective and pan‑UT ligands) provide actionable templates for medicinal chemistry, with prospects for salt‑sparing diuretics via UT‑A inhibition and potential CNS/renal indications for UT‑B modulation (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Structural and mechanistic consensus: The 2023 Sci Adv study and the 2024 Nat Commun series are high‑quality, peer‑reviewed works establishing the modern consensus on UT architecture, urea recognition, permeation mechanics, and inhibitor binding—defining the mechanistic landscape for the UT family, including UT‑B (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Transfusion genomics practice: The 2024 Biomedicines report demonstrates how comprehensive SLC14A1 long‑read genotyping complements routine serology and short‑read assays to resolve incongruities, detect structural alleles, and guide clinical decision‑making in blood services (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010225; Jan 2024) (gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 1-2, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 9-10, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepanciesa pages 12-13, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepanciesb pages 12-13).
- Oncology perspective: The 2024 Scientific Reports study integrates public datasets and experiments to argue a tumor‑suppressive role for SLC14A1 in prostate cancer, mechanistically linked to suppressed CDK1/CCNB1 and mTOR axes and epigenetic silencing (promoter hypermethylation), consistent with prior associations of SLC14A1 with bladder cancer risk and tumor suppression in urothelial contexts (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-66020-1; Jun 2024) (ma2024downregulationofslc14a1 pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and recent quantitative data
- Transfusion immunohematology: Alloimmunization to JK antigens is rare (<1% overall), with one reported combined anti‑JK1/JK2 incidence of 0.05% at a single center, emphasizing low frequency but clinical relevance (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024) (soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).
- Long‑read donor genetics: Among 11,972 donors with both serology and genotypes, 10 unresolved JK discrepancies were fully explained by long‑read sequencing, including discovery of two novel null alleles and a ~5 kb deletion spanning exons 9–10—an SV not detected by standard methods—illustrating the yield and clinical utility of comprehensive SLC14A1 interrogation (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010225; Jan 2024) (gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 1-2, gueuning2024resolvinggenotype–phenotypediscrepancies pages 9-10).

Notes on regulation and pathways
- Epigenetic regulation: In prostate cancer, promoter hypermethylation reduces SLC14A1 expression; restoration suppresses proliferative and invasive programs via CDK1/CCNB1 and mTOR/MMP‑9 pathways, indicating pathway crosstalk consequential for tumor biology (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-66020-1; Jun 2024) (ma2024downregulationofslc14a1 pages 1-2).
- Pharmacologic modulation: UT‑B selective and multi‑UT inhibitors have structurally validated binding; their distinct modes (competitive/uncompetitive/noncompetitive) portend differential physiological effects and selectivity profiles for future translational applications (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Conclusion and verification
- Verification against provided identity: The target is human SLC14A1 (UniProt Q13336), known as UT‑B/Kidd blood group carrier. The organism and aliases match the literature. The protein belongs to the UT/urea transporter family with characteristic 10‑TM, homotrimeric architecture and conserved urea recognition/permeation motifs consistent with urea transporter domain annotations. The literature used here aligns with these domain/family expectations, and no conflicting gene symbol usage was identified (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg8229; Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54305-y; Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2023.10.004; Nov 2024) (chi2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 1-2, huang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, soleimani2024slc14a1genesequencing pages 1-3).
