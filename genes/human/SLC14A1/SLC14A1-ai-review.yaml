description: >-
  SLC14A1 encodes urea transporter 1 (UT-B), a facilitative urea transporter that forms the
  molecular basis of the Kidd (JK) blood group system. The protein functions as a homotrimer,
  with each subunit containing a membrane-spanning pore formed by 10 transmembrane helices.
  UT-B enables rapid, energy-independent equilibration of urea across cell membranes via a
  channel-like mechanism. It is abundantly expressed on erythrocytes where it protects red
  blood cells from osmotic stress during circulation through the hyperosmotic renal medulla,
  and on endothelial cells of the renal vasa recta where it contributes to the urinary
  concentrating mechanism. Recent structural studies (2023-2024) have resolved the human
  UT-B structure, revealing conserved urea recognition motifs and providing insight into
  selective inhibitor binding. Notably, at physiological expression levels, UT-B is a
  selective urea transporter and does NOT function as a water channel.

        This IBA annotation correctly identifies urea transmembrane transport as a core
        biological process for SLC14A1. The phylogenetic inference is well-supported by
        extensive experimental evidence across the urea transporter family. Multiple
        publications demonstrate that SLC14A1/HUT11 mediates facilitated urea transport
        in erythrocytes and kidney [PMID:7989337, PMID:7797558, PMID:8997401, PMID:10514515].

        This annotation is problematic and should be removed. While SLC14A1 can facilitate

        an artifact of overexpression. PMID:10514515 explicitly demonstrates that at

    review:
      summary: >-
        Similar to the channel activity annotation above, this IDA cites the bacterial
        homolog structure paper. The paper provides mechanistic insight into urea
        permeation but is not direct evidence for human SLC14A1 function.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: >-
        While the structural insights are relevant to understanding the UT family
        mechanism, this citation is for a bacterial homolog rather than direct evidence
        on human SLC14A1. However, urea transmembrane transport is well-supported by
        other IDA citations.

    review:
      summary: >-
        GO:0015840 (urea transport) is a broader term than GO:0071918 (urea transmembrane
        transport). Both are appropriate annotations for SLC14A1, with GO:0071918 being
        more specific to the transmembrane mechanism.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        Urea transport is the core biological process for SLC14A1. This broader term
        encompasses the more specific urea transmembrane transport annotations.

      SLC14A1 mediates facilitated urea transport across erythrocyte and kidney endothelial
      cell membranes. Multiple IDA studies demonstrate urea transport activity in Xenopus
      oocyte expression systems with characteristic pharmacological inhibition by phloretin.
      Genetic evidence from Jk(null) individuals shows loss of urea transport capacity when

suggested_questions:
  - question: "What is the physiological significance of the Jk(a)/Jk(b) polymorphism (D280N) for urea transport kinetics? The D280N variant defines the major Kidd blood group antigens but the functional impact on transport activity is not well characterized."
  - question: "Is there tissue-specific regulation of SLC14A1 expression and does this affect local urea handling? Expression in brain, prostate, and bladder (per HPA) suggests potential non-classical functions beyond erythrocytes and kidney."

suggested_experiments:
  - description: "Compare urea transport kinetics between Jk(a) and Jk(b) variants in controlled expression systems. This would clarify whether the common D280N polymorphism affects function or is immunologically neutral."
  - description: "Investigate the reported tumor suppressor function of SLC14A1 in bladder and prostate cancer models. Recent studies suggest epigenetic silencing correlates with cancer progression; mechanistic basis is unclear."
