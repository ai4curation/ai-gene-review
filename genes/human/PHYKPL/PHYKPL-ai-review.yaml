description: 'PHYKPL encodes 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase, a mitochondrial
  enzyme that catalyzes

  the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine into ammonia,
  inorganic

  phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. This enzyme functions as a key component
  in the

  catabolism of hydroxylysine residues derived from collagen degradation, connecting
  extracellular

  matrix turnover to lysine catabolism and energy metabolism. Despite being classified
  in the

  aminotransferase III family, PHYKPL functions as an ammoniophospholyase rather than
  a transaminase.

  Loss-of-function mutations cause phosphohydroxylysinuria, a benign metabolic condition
  characterized

  by elevated urinary 5-phosphohydroxylysine without apparent clinical symptoms.
