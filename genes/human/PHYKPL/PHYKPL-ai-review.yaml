description: 'PHYKPL encodes 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes

  the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine into ammonia, inorganic

  phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. This enzyme functions as a key component in the

  catabolism of hydroxylysine residues derived from collagen degradation, connecting extracellular

  matrix turnover to lysine catabolism and energy metabolism. Despite being classified in the

  aminotransferase III family, PHYKPL functions as an ammoniophospholyase rather than a transaminase.

  Loss-of-function mutations cause phosphohydroxylysinuria, a benign metabolic condition characterized

  by elevated urinary 5-phosphohydroxylysine without apparent clinical symptoms.
