# PHYKPL (5-Phosphohydroxylysine Phospholyase): Enzymatic Function

PHYKPL (formerly AGXT2L2) encodes a pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP)–dependent enzyme that catalyzes the **breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxylysine**. Biochemical studies show that the enzyme (EC 4.2.3.134) cleaves (5R)-5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine with water to yield 2-amino-6-oxohexanoate (2-aminoadipate semialdehyde), ammonia, and inorganic phosphate[\[1\]](https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/4.2.3.134#:~:text=Reaction%20catalysed%20%285R%29,s)[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss). In other words, PHYKPL’s product converts phosphorylated hydroxylysine into ammonia, phosphate and a semialdehyde (2-aminoadipate semialdehyde)[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)[\[3\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241472/#:~:text=AGPHD1%20was%20indeed%20found%20to,catalyzed%20a%20similar%20reaction%20on). This activity was first demonstrated by Veiga-da-Cunha *et al.* (2012), who produced recombinant human PHYKPL and showed it carried out exactly this reaction[\[3\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241472/#:~:text=AGPHD1%20was%20indeed%20found%20to,catalyzed%20a%20similar%20reaction%20on). The enzyme is known as an **ammoniophospholyase** (it breaks a C–N bond releasing NH\_4^+), despite its sequence similarity to aminotransferases. PHYKPL belongs to the class-III aminotransferase superfamily (the “alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase” family) and binds PLP as cofactor[\[4\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241472/#:~:text=linking%20AGXT2L1%20to%20schizophrenia%20and,amines)[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss). (Sequence databases list domains IPR005814 etc., consistent with aminotransferases[\[5\]](https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1920197#:~:text=IPR005814%20Aminotransferase%20class).) In line with this, UniProt/GeneCards note “pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown” of the substrate[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss). In sum, the gene product is a **mitochondrial PLP-dependent lyase** that catabolizes 5-phosphohydroxylysine. It localizes to the mitochondrial matrix (per prediction and antibody data[\[6\]](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/genes/phykpl?srsltid=AfmBOorRF7gEJNoWdGFX-SP7zfpVqvtuxiz91bgf-ivl-X3pIV6ehhC8#:~:text=,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20May%202013)[\[7\]](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000175309-PHYKPL#:~:text=Cytoplasmic%20expression%20in%20most%20tissues,i)) and is synthesized from a nuclear gene transcript.

# Role in Cellular and Biological Processes

PHYKPL serves at a novel juncture between **collagen turnover and amino acid metabolism**. Specifically, 5-hydroxylysine is an abundant collagen modification; when collagen is degraded, free 5-hydroxylysine can be phosphorylated by a dedicated kinase (HYKK, also called HYKK/AGPHD1) and then cleaved by PHYKPL[\[3\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241472/#:~:text=AGPHD1%20was%20indeed%20found%20to,catalyzed%20a%20similar%20reaction%20on)[\[8\]](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5696408#:~:text=In%20mitochondria%2C%20ethanolamine,as%20cofactor%20per%20subunit). In other words, **5-phosphohydroxylysine is a breakdown product of collagen**. In mitochondria, PHYKPL (as a homotetramer) hydrolyzes this collagen-derived metabolite to feed into the lysine catabolic pathway[\[8\]](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5696408#:~:text=In%20mitochondria%2C%20ethanolamine,as%20cofactor%20per%20subunit). The 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde product is a known intermediate in lysine degradation, ultimately leading to acetyl-CoA via the saccharopine/antiquitin route. Thus, PHYKPL connects extracellular matrix breakdown to energy metabolism: it helps dispose of hydroxylysine residues liberated from collagen, converting them into form that enters central metabolism. This link places PHYKPL activity in the broader context of **amino-acid catabolism** and **collagen degradation**[\[8\]](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5696408#:~:text=In%20mitochondria%2C%20ethanolamine,as%20cofactor%20per%20subunit). The enzyme thereby prevents accumulation of phospho-hydroxylysine and recovers nitrogen and carbon from modified lysine residues. Consistent with this metabolic role, pathologic deficiency of PHYKPL (due to loss-of-function mutations) causes **phosphohydroxylysinuria** – a condition defined by elevated urinary 5-phosphohydroxylysine[\[6\]](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/genes/phykpl?srsltid=AfmBOorRF7gEJNoWdGFX-SP7zfpVqvtuxiz91bgf-ivl-X3pIV6ehhC8#:~:text=,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20May%202013)[\[9\]](https://www.malacards.org/card/phosphohydroxylysinuria?search=PHYKPL#:~:text=OMIM%C2%AE60%28Updated%2025). Interestingly, this biochemical phenotype appears to have *no other apparent clinical manifestations*[\[9\]](https://www.malacards.org/card/phosphohydroxylysinuria?search=PHYKPL#:~:text=OMIM%C2%AE60%28Updated%2025), suggesting that the pathway is not essential for survival but is a normal part of amino acid recycling. In sum, PHYKPL’s core function is enzymatic: a PLP-dependent lyase in mitochondria that cleaves a collagen-related metabolite, linking protein (collagen) turnover to lysine/amino acid catabolism[\[8\]](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5696408#:~:text=In%20mitochondria%2C%20ethanolamine,as%20cofactor%20per%20subunit)[\[3\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22241472/#:~:text=AGPHD1%20was%20indeed%20found%20to,catalyzed%20a%20similar%20reaction%20on).

# Gaps in Current Knowledge

* **Physiological context**: It remains unclear under what conditions 5-phosphohydroxylysine is generated in vivo. While collagen degradation would release 5-hydroxylysine residues, the regulation and flux of this pathway under normal physiology or stress are poorly understood.

* **Significance of the pathway**: Given that patients lacking PHYKPL activity (phosphohydroxylysinuria) show no clinical symptoms beyond metabolite buildup[\[9\]](https://www.malacards.org/card/phosphohydroxylysinuria?search=PHYKPL#:~:text=OMIM%C2%AE60%28Updated%2025), the **biological importance of this catabolic route** is uncertain. It’s possible redundant disposal routes for hydroxylysine exist, or that any toxicity of accumulated metabolite is minimal.

* **Enzyme specifics**: The structure, substrate specificity and kinetics of human PHYKPL have not been extensively characterized. The enzyme appears related to aminotransferases, yet its lyase activity is unusual; details of its active site and mechanism are unknown.

* **Regulation and expression**: Little is known about how PHYKPL expression or activity is regulated. Tissue-specific and developmental expression patterns have not been fully mapped. (Some expression data hint at modest expression in brain and endocrine tissues, but no clear “tissue of interest” is established.)

* **Mitochondrial targeting**: The mechanism of mitochondrial import of PHYKPL (e.g. targeting sequence) has not been studied.

* **Evolutionary aspects**: Homologs of PHYKPL exist across vertebrates (and even in organisms like Drosophila[\[10\]](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5696408#:~:text=PXLP,elegans)), but the evolutionary origin of this enzyme and its pathway is not well explored. It’s unclear how conserved hydroxylysine catabolism is across species.

* **Interacting partners**: There is no information on whether PHYKPL forms complexes or is regulated by protein–protein interactions in mitochondria.

# Questions for an Expert

* **Substrate origin**: *What is the main source of 5-phosphohydroxylysine in human metabolism?* Is it derived solely from collagen breakdown, or might there be other pathways generating free hydroxylysine that needs disposal?

* **Redundancy**: *Are there alternative enzymes or pathways that can metabolize 5-phosphohydroxylysine if PHYKPL is absent?* (The benign nature of phosphohydroxylysinuria hints at possible redundancy.)

* **Structure/function**: *What is known about the three-dimensional structure or key catalytic residues of PHYKPL?* Has any structure been solved, or are there informative homology models?

* **Regulation**: *How is PHYKPL expression controlled?* Are there known transcription factors or signaling pathways that up/downregulate this gene under specific conditions (e.g. tissue remodeling, vitamin B6 status)?

* **Tissue specificity**: *In which cell types or tissues is PHYKPL most active or abundant?* Does it vary with development or metabolism?

* **Physiological role**: *Despite no overt disease, could PHYKPL have subtle roles (e.g. in nitrogen balance, redox state, or disease susceptibility)?* Could there be unrecognized phenotypes in knockout models or under stress?

* **Evolution**: *What do comparative genomics and phylogeny tell us about PHYKPL’s origins?* Are bacterial ancestors of vertebrates known to have related enzymes, and what function do they serve?

* **Potential interactions**: *Does PHYKPL associate with other mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. lysine catabolic enzymes) in a complex?* Could it be coordinated with upstream (kinase) or downstream (dehydrogenase) steps?

# Experimental Approaches to Elucidate Function

* **Biochemical assays**: Express and purify human PHYKPL for *in vitro* enzymology. Measure its activity with synthetic 5-phosphohydroxylysine (and analogs) to determine kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax) and cofactor requirements (confirm PLP dependence)[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)[\[1\]](https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/4.2.3.134#:~:text=Reaction%20catalysed%20%285R%29,s). Test whether it can act on related substrates (e.g. different phosphoamino acids) to define specificity.

* **Cellular knockdown/knockout**: Use CRISPR or siRNA in cultured human cells to disrupt PHYKPL. Then use targeted metabolomics (mass spectrometry) to detect accumulation of 5-phosphohydroxylysine or its metabolites. Compare to wild-type cells under normal and stress conditions (e.g. with added collagen fragments or excess lysine).

* **Animal models**: Generate a PHYKPL-deficient mouse or zebrafish. Analyze urine and tissues for phosphohydroxylysine accumulation. Monitor for subtle phenotypes (growth, metabolism, response to high-protein diet, etc.). This could reveal in vivo roles or compensation by other pathways.

* **Metabolic tracing**: Feed cells or model organisms isotopically labeled 5-hydroxylysine or collagen. Trace labeled atoms through phosphorylation by HYKK and cleavage by PHYKPL. This would confirm flux through this pathway and quantify its contribution to overall lysine catabolism.

* **Structural biology**: Crystallize PHYKPL (or cryo-EM) to solve its structure. Identify active-site residues and compare to classical aminotransferases. Mutagenesis of key residues (e.g. PLP-binding lysine) could validate mechanism.

* **Expression profiling**: Perform RNA/protein expression screens across tissues, development stages, or disease states. This could identify when and where PHYKPL is upregulated. Single-cell RNA-seq could pinpoint specific cell types expressing it.

* **Interaction studies**: Use co-immunoprecipitation or proximity labeling (BioID) to see if PHYKPL interacts with other mitochondrial proteins or metabolic enzymes. Identifying partners might reveal regulatory mechanisms.

* **Knock-in variants**: Introduce human PHYKPL mutations (e.g. those found in phosphohydroxylysinuria patients) into cell lines to study their effects on enzyme function and cell physiology.

* **Cofactor dependence**: Test how cellular pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) levels affect PHYKPL activity in cells, since it requires PLP[\[2\]](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PHYKPL#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss). Vitamin B6 deficiency might impair the enzyme and reveal latent phenotypes.

These studies together would fill gaps about PHYKPL’s substrate sources, regulation, and physiological importance. By combining biochemical, genetic, and analytical approaches, one could map the precise role of PHYKPL in amino acid and collagen metabolism and determine why its deficiency has so little clinical impact.
