## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9NPB6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha; Short=PAR-6; Short=PAR-6 alpha; Short=PAR-6A; AltName: Full=PAR6C; AltName: Full=Tax interaction protein 40; Short=TIP-40;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PARD6A; Synonyms=PAR6A;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PAR6 family. .
- **Key Domains:** PAR6_homolog. (IPR051741); PB1-like. (IPR053793); PB1_dom. (IPR000270); PB1_Par6. (IPR034868); PDZ. (IPR001478)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PARD6A" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PARD6A' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PARD6A** (gene ID: PARD6A, UniProt: Q9NPB6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target as human PARD6A (UniProt Q9NPB6), encoding Partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha (PAR‑6α), a PAR6-family scaffold with an N‑terminal PB1 domain and a C‑terminal CRIB–PDZ module; these domains and their binding partners are consistently described in recent mechanistic studies focused on human Par6/aPKC complexes (including PB1- and PDZ-mediated contacts) (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114). The organism is Homo sapiens.

Comprehensive research report on PARD6A (PAR‑6α)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains. PAR‑6α (PARD6A) is a multi-domain polarity scaffold containing: (i) an N‑terminal PB1 domain that heterodimerizes with aPKC PB1; (ii) a semi-CRIB/CRIB element that binds active CDC42 and allosterically regulates the adjacent PDZ; and (iii) a PDZ domain that recognizes polarity partners (e.g., Crumbs/PALS1 peptides, PAR‑3 motifs) and can directly bind the aPKC kinase region (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36).
- Core complex. PAR‑6α forms the core PAR complex with aPKC (PRKCI/PRKCZ) and PAR‑3 to establish apical identity and exclude basolateral determinants by aPKC-mediated phosphorylation (e.g., LGL) (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 32-36).
- Adaptor/regulator concept. PAR‑6α is both a scaffold that recruits aPKC to the apical cortex and a regulator that modulates aPKC’s autoinhibition and substrate access through multi-site contacts and ligand-controlled allostery (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40).

| Binding interfaces and partners | Two-site engagement of aPKC: canonical PB1–PB1 heterodimer plus a low-affinity PDZ–aPKC KD/PBM contact; PDZ ligands compete | aPKC (KD, PB1–C1), Par3, Crumbs/Pals1, Cdc42 | Biochemical reconstitution mapped PDZ–KD interaction (Kd ~20 μM) and negative cooperativity with PB1–C1; Cdc42/PDZ ligands displace KD–PBM | (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 36-40) |
| Biochemical role in aPKC regulation | Acts as scaffold and regulator: scaffolds aPKC via PB1 and can relieve aPKC autoinhibition via PDZ–KD contact; context-dependent activator/inhibitor | aPKC regulatory PB1–C1, substrates (e.g., Lgl), Par3 | Par-6 CRIB–PDZ can displace PB1–C1 from the kinase domain, providing a mechanistic basis for modulation of aPKC activity | (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 36-40) |

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority, with 2025 structural advances for completeness)
- Two-site Par6–aPKC engagement refined (2023). Biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that PAR‑6α engages aPKC through: (i) canonical PB1–PB1 heterodimerization; and (ii) a newly mapped, low-affinity interaction between the PAR‑6 CRIB–PDZ module and the aPKC kinase-domain/C‑terminal PBM (KD–PBM). The PDZ–KD interaction has Kd ≈ 20 µM and is negatively regulated by Cdc42 and by PDZ ligands such as Crumbs/PALS1, indicating competition/negative cooperativity among binding partners (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 36-40).
- Par6 relieves aPKC autoinhibition (2023). Purified-component assays showed that PAR‑6 CRIB–PDZ can displace the aPKC regulatory PB1–C1 segment from the kinase, relieving autoinhibition; PDZ ligands and Cdc42 attenuate this displacement, offering a mechanistic basis for context-dependent activation/inhibition of aPKC by PAR‑6 (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40).
- Structural mechanism for Par6–aPKC–substrate control (2025). A cryo-EM study captured human aPKCι–PAR‑6α bound to full-length LLGL1, revealing a tripartite complex in which LLGL1 bridges aPKC and the PAR‑6 PDZ, trapping a pS663 intermediate that both inhibits aPKC and sequesters LLGL1. The authors propose a Par6‑PDZ–regulated capture-and-release cycle, in which CDC42‑GTP and apical Crumbs binding promote complex disassembly and completion of LLGL1 multisite phosphorylation, thereby enforcing apical–basolateral domain segregation (Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01425-0) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 10-12).
- aPKC membrane engagement tuned in the Par6-bound state (2023). aPKCι–Par6 binary complexes exhibit selective binding to phosphoinositides (PI3P/PI4P/PI5P > some bisphosphates), and tyrosine phosphorylation within the aPKC PB1–C1 interdomain interface (e.g., pY136) modulates membrane association and conformation; pseudo-substrate disengagement increases catalysis. These data connect Par6 association, aPKC conformational state, and specific membrane lipid engagement (Journal of Biological Chemistry, Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104847) (cobbaut2023controlofatypical pages 7-8).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Polarity establishment in epithelia and neurons. PAR‑6α-mediated recruitment of aPKC to the apical cortex and tight junctional region is driven by CDC42 and PAR‑3; PAR‑6 PDZ ligands (e.g., Crumbs) modulate assembly, enabling junction formation and apical identity establishment in polarized tissues and neuroblasts (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).
- Substrate gating and domain segregation. The Par6–aPKC system executes spatial phosphorylation of basolateral substrates such as LGL to enforce apical exclusion; the 2025 structural “capture–mutual inhibition–release” model offers a mechanistic blueprint for tuning barrier function and morphogenesis via regulated substrate processing (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 10-12).
- Membrane recruitment and signaling integration. The Par6‑associated aPKC shows selective phosphoinositide recognition that, together with tyrosine phosphorylation and pseudo-substrate dynamics, provides levers to modulate cortical residency in cellular systems where apical integrity or front–rear polarity must be controlled (cobbaut2023controlofatypical pages 7-8).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: multisite, negatively cooperative regulation. Recent biochemical studies converge on a model in which PAR‑6α uses PB1–PB1 and PDZ–kinase contacts to position and tune aPKC activity; CDC42-GTP and PDZ ligands (Crumbs/PALS1) compete allosterically, biasing the assembly toward recruitment versus catalytic progression (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 36-40).
- Structural advance contextualizes long-standing paradoxes. The cryo-EM aPKCι–PAR‑6α–LLGL1 complex explains how aPKC can be held in an inhibited state while docked to a substrate, with PAR‑6 PDZ acting as a regulated “substrate clamp” that is released by CDC42 and apical cues, reconciling observations of Par6 as both an aPKC activator and inhibitor depending on context (Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01425-0) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 10-12).
- Localization principles reaffirmed with nuance. Recruitment of PAR‑6–aPKC is CDC42- and PAR‑3-dependent, with PDZ-ligand occupancy and competition controlling complex composition at apical junctions and cortical sites, consistent with dynamic switching among PAR assemblies (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Affinity of PDZ–kinase contact: the PAR‑6 CRIB–PDZ to aPKC kinase interaction is low affinity with Kd ≈ 20 µM, rationalizing prior detection challenges and highlighting sensitivity to competition by CDC42/PDZ ligands (2023 biochemical mapping) (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36).
- Autoinhibition displacement: in vitro, PAR‑6 CRIB–PDZ displaces aPKC PB1–C1 from the kinase domain to relieve autoinhibition; this displacement is dampened by CDC42 and PDZ ligands, indicating negative cooperativity among aPKC PB1–C1, CDC42, and PDZ binders (2023 reconstitution assays) (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40).
- Multisite LGL1 phosphorylation sites and intermediate trapping: the human LLGL1 phosphorylation cluster (S655/S659/S663) lies in a membrane-binding loop; the cryo-EM structure captured a pS663 intermediate that inhibits aPKC while sequestering LLGL1, and mutations at docking interfaces diminish complex assembly and phosphorylation throughput (Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2025; DOI above) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 10-12).
- Lipid preferences and phosphorylation control of aPKC membrane association: aPKCι–Par6 complexes prefer PI3P/PI4P/PI5P and are regulated by Src-dependent Tyr‑136 phosphorylation and pseudo-substrate engagement, which alter catalytic output and membrane residency (JBC, 2023; DOI above) (cobbaut2023controlofatypical pages 7-8).

Focused functional annotation
- Primary function. PAR‑6α is a polarity scaffold/adaptor that recruits and regulates aPKC (PRKCI/PRKCZ), integrating CDC42‑GTP and PDZ‑ligand inputs to control aPKC’s autoinhibition and substrate access; it is not an enzyme or transporter itself (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114).
- Binding specificity. PB1 heterodimerizes selectively with aPKC PB1; the CRIB engages CDC42‑GTP; the PDZ binds polarity peptides (e.g., Crumbs/PALS1 and PAR‑3 epitopes) and directly contacts the aPKC kinase region/PBM in a low-affinity, regulatable manner (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114).
- Cellular localization. PAR‑6α localizes to the apical cortex, tight junctional regions, and polarity organizing centers, with CDC42/PAR‑3-dependent recruitment and dynamic modulation by PDZ ligands; these principles extend to neuronal and epithelial contexts (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).
- Pathways. PAR‑6α functions within the PAR polarity network, controlling apical domain assembly and exclusion of basolateral factors such as LGL via aPKC phosphorylation; dynamic switching among PAR‑3- and Crumbs‑containing assemblies governs spatial aPKC activity (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2).

Disease relevance and translational notes (recent)
- Cancer/polarity dysregulation. The aPKC–PAR‑6 module is frequently implicated in oncogenic polarity remodeling; recent mechanistic work connects cancer-associated perturbations of aPKC recruitment/activation and substrate handling, providing structural rationales for targeting substrate gating or ligand competition at PAR‑6 PDZ (Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01425-0; JBC, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104847) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 10-12, cobbaut2023controlofatypical pages 7-8).
- Epithelial barrier biology. Mechanisms whereby PAR‑6α controls junctional assembly and apical identity—via CDC42- and PDZ‑regulated modulation of aPKC—provide a framework for interpreting barrier phenotypes and designing assays to modulate apical recruitment or substrate processing in human epithelia (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).

Limitations and open questions
- The PDZ–kinase contact is low affinity and strongly context-dependent; full-length structures of human PAR‑6α–aPKC with competing PDZ ligands (Crumbs/PALS1/PAR‑3) remain to be captured in physiologically relevant membranes. Dissecting quantitative competition among CDC42, PAR‑3, and apical PDZ ligands in living cells is a priority (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 36-40, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 36-40).

Conclusion
Recent work refines PAR‑6α’s role from a passive scaffold to an active regulator that samples multiple interfaces on aPKC and its substrates. A 2023 two‑site binding and autoinhibition‑relief mechanism, together with a 2025 structure of a human aPKCι–PAR‑6α–LLGL1 complex, reveal how CDC42 and apical PDZ ligands (e.g., Crumbs) exert negative cooperativity to switch the PAR complex between substrate capture and catalytic release. These insights provide actionable routes to interrogate and potentially modulate epithelial polarity and oncogenic polarity remodeling in human systems (vargas2023insightsintotheb pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, cobbaut2023controlofatypical pages 7-8).
