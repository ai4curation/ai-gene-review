description: >-
  PARD6A encodes Partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha (PAR-6A), a key adaptor protein
  in the evolutionarily conserved PAR polarity complex. The protein contains an N-terminal
  PB1 domain that heterodimerizes with atypical PKC (aPKC/PRKCI/PRKCZ), a semi-CRIB
  motif
  that binds GTP-bound CDC42/RAC1, and a C-terminal PDZ domain that recognizes polarity
  partners including CRB3/PALS1 and PAR-3. PARD6A functions as a scaffold/adaptor
  that
  recruits and regulates aPKC activity at the apical cortex to establish apical-basal
  polarity in epithelial cells. Through its multi-domain architecture, PARD6A integrates
  inputs from CDC42-GTP and PDZ ligands to modulate aPKC autoinhibition and substrate
  access, controlling phosphorylation of basolateral determinants like LGL. PARD6A
  also
  has a distinct role at centrosomes where it interacts with p150Glued to regulate
  centrosomal protein recruitment and microtubule organization.

        The IBA annotation is well-supported. PARD6A functions as an adaptor that
        regulates localization of multiple proteins. PMID:20719959 demonstrates
        "Par6alpha-mediated centrosome regulation involves the binding of Par6alpha
        to p150Glued" and shows "depletion of Par6alpha caused the mislocalization
        of p150Glued and centrosomal components." This is a core function.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      PARD6A functions as a key adaptor protein in the PAR polarity complex,
      linking activated CDC42/RAC1 GTPases to atypical PKC (aPKC) and PAR-3.
      The PB1 domain mediates aPKC binding, the CRIB motif binds GTP-bound
      CDC42/RAC1, and the PDZ domain recognizes polarity partners like CRB3/PALS1
      and PAR-3. This adaptor function is essential for recruiting and regulating
      aPKC activity at the apical cortex.
