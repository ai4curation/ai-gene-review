description: >-
  KIAA1614 is an uncharacterized human protein containing a Domain of Unknown
  Function (DUF4685) and a PAR6_homolog domain. The protein was originally
  identified through large-scale cDNA sequencing from brain tissue. The PAR6_homolog
  domain suggests possible homology to Par6-like polarity scaffold proteins, though
  this remains speculative without experimental validation. No molecular function,
  localization, or pathway assignment has been experimentally validated for KIAA1614.
  The protein has extensive disordered regions and is classified as Tdark (dark
  protein) in Pharos, indicating minimal characterization.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation transferred from phylogenetic analysis. The PANTHER family
      (PTHR14102) includes PAR-6 related proteins. However, KIAA1614 has no
      direct experimental evidence supporting a role in regulation of cellular
      localization. The deep research indicates no primary literature characterizing
      KIAA1614 function.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      This annotation is based solely on phylogenetic inference (IBA) from the
      PANTHER PAR-6 related family. KIAA1614 contains a PAR6_homolog domain
      (IPR051741), but this represents weak sequence similarity, not confirmed
      functional homology. No experimental studies validate this function for
      KIAA1614 specifically. The deep research states: "No directly citable
      2023-2024 primary studies conclusively define KIAA1614 protein function,
      localization, or interaction partners." Without experimental validation,
      this annotation remains uncertain.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation transferred from phylogenetic relationship to Par6 family
      proteins. The PAR6_homolog domain in KIAA1614 suggests possible involvement
      in cell polarity, but this is based on remote sequence homology only.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The PAR6_homolog domain annotation (IPR051741) provides the rationale for
      this IBA annotation. Par6 proteins are well-established polarity regulators
      that function in the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex. However, the deep research
      explicitly notes: "If the PAR6_homolog annotation reflects genuine homology,
      KIAA1614 may participate in cell polarity/signaling scaffolds. Testable
      predictions: (i) interaction with Par proteins or aPKC components." This
      indicates the annotation is a hypothesis, not established function. No
      experimental evidence confirms KIAA1614 interacts with Par complex components
      or functions in cell polarity.

      IBA annotation suggesting localization to the cell cortex, transferred from

    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      This localization is inferred from orthologous proteins in mouse. There is
      no direct experimental evidence for KIAA1614 subcellular localization. The
      deep research states: "Subcellular localization - Unresolved. Without
      validated antibodies and microscopy or tagged endogenous expression data,
      subcellular distribution is uncertain. If a polarity-related role exists,
      membrane-proximal/cortical or junctional localization would be plausible,
      but this is hypothetical." No antibody or localization studies have been
      performed on KIAA1614.

      IBA annotation suggesting nuclear localization, transferred from mouse and

    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is inferred from orthologous proteins. KIAA1614 has
      extensive disordered regions (UniProt annotations show multiple disordered
      regions spanning most of the protein), which can be consistent with nuclear
      localization, but this is not definitive. No experimental localization
      studies exist for KIAA1614. The CD-CODE database entry lists P-body as a
      predicted localization (DR CD-CODE; 232F8A39; P-body), which contradicts
      this nuclear annotation. Without direct experimental validation, this
      annotation remains uncertain.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation suggesting localization to the apical plasma membrane,
      transferred from mouse and zebrafish orthologs in the PANTHER PAR-6 related
      family.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      Apical plasma membrane localization would be consistent with the PAR6_homolog
      domain if KIAA1614 functions in apical-basal polarity similar to Par6 proteins.
      However, this is purely inferential. The deep research notes that "If a
      polarity-related role exists, membrane-proximal/cortical or junctional
      localization would be plausible, but this is hypothetical." The Human
      Protein Atlas indicates tissue-enhanced expression in retina but no validated
      subcellular localization data. Without experimental confirmation, this
      annotation cannot be accepted.

      IBA annotation transferred from UniProtKB:Q9NPB6 (PARD6B - Partitioning

    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      This annotation is transferred from PARD6B (Q9NPB6), which has established
      roles in centrosome function. However, KIAA1614 shares only a PAR6_homolog
      domain with uncertain functional relevance. The DUF4685 domain that dominates
      KIAA1614 structure has unknown function. The deep research indicates:
      "Pathways and interactions - Unresolved. No validated pathway membership
      can be assigned at this time." Without experimental evidence linking KIAA1614
      to centrosome biology, this annotation is speculative.

        PANTHER family PTHR14102 (PAR-6-RELATED) is used for phylogenetic inference.
        KIAA1614 is classified in subfamily SF12. The annotations transferred are
        based on shared ancestry with characterized Par6 family members, but the
        functional equivalence of KIAA1614 to true Par6 proteins is not established.

  findings:
    - statement: >-
        No primary literature directly characterizes KIAA1614 function. All functional
        inferences are based on domain architecture. The PAR6_homolog annotation
        suggests possible scaffold/adaptor role in cell polarity, but this is
        speculative. Experimental validation through AP-MS, co-IP with Par complex
        components, and CRISPR perturbation studies would be needed to confirm
        function.
