description: 'Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes complex proteolytic processing
  to generate multiple bioactive fragments with distinct biological functions. APP is a paradigm for regulated intramembrane
  proteolysis (RIP). The protein has both alternative splice isoforms (APP695/751/770 differing in presence of KPI domain)
  and undergoes proteolytic cleavage via two competing pathways: (1) non-amyloidogenic (alpha-secretase) producing neuroprotective
  sAPPalpha, and (2) amyloidogenic (beta-secretase/BACE1) producing Abeta peptides associated with Alzheimer''s disease. Full-length
  APP functions as a cell adhesion molecule, regulates neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and copper/zinc homeostasis.
  The AICD fragment functions in nuclear signaling. Key biological insight: sAPPalpha is NEUROPROTECTIVE while Abeta is NEUROTOXIC
  - antagonistic functions from the same gene product. CRITICAL: Many annotations conflate full-length APP, splice isoforms,
  and cleavage products. Human APP is directly relevant to Alzheimer''s disease pathology with familial mutations (Swedish,
  London, etc.) that increase Abeta42/40 ratio.'
