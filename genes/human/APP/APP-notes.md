# APP - Amyloid Precursor Protein (Human) Notes

## Overview

Human APP (P05067) is the ortholog of mouse App. The biology is essentially identical - a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) to produce multiple bioactive fragments.

**Key difference from mouse**: Human APP is directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology. The human Abeta sequence differs slightly from mouse, and human Abeta is more prone to aggregation. AD mouse models often use humanized APP.

## Splice Isoforms

| Isoform | UniProt | Length | Domains | Expression |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| APP770 | P05067-1 | 770 AA | KPI + OX-2 | Peripheral, microglia |
| APP751 | P05067-6 | 751 AA | KPI only | Peripheral tissues |
| APP695 | P05067-4 | 695 AA | No KPI | Neuronal (predominant in brain) |
| L-APP677 | P05067-3 | 677 AA | No KPI | Leukocytes |
| APP305 | P05067-2 | 305 AA | Truncated | Limited data |

## Cleavage Products

Same as mouse - see mouse App notes for details:
- sAPPalpha (neuroprotective)
- sAPPbeta (less neurotrophic, DR6 binding)
- Abeta40/42 (neurotoxic, AD pathogenic)
- AICD (nuclear signaling)
- N-APP (axon pruning via DR6)

## Familial AD Mutations

Human APP mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease by increasing Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio:

| Mutation | Position | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Swedish | K670N/M671L | Increases total Abeta |
| London | V717I | Increases Abeta42/40 ratio |
| Flemish | A692G | Increases Abeta aggregation |
| Arctic | E693G | Increases protofibril formation |
| Iowa | D694N | Increases cerebral amyloid angiopathy |

## Key Human-Specific Points

1. Human Abeta sequence at positions 5, 10, 13 differs from rodent - more aggregation-prone
2. Most AD mouse models use human APP transgenes
3. Down syndrome (trisomy 21) causes AD due to APP gene triplication on chromosome 21
4. Protective mutation (A673T, "Icelandic") reduces Abeta production and AD risk
