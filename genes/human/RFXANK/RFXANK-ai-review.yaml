description: >
  RFXANK (RFX-associated ankyrin-containing protein, also known as RFX-B) is a regulatory
  subunit of the RFX heterotetrametric transcription regulatory complex that controls MHC
  class II gene expression. The RFX complex consists of two RFX5 molecules (the DNA-binding
  subunit), one RFXAP molecule, and one RFXANK molecule. RFXANK contains five ankyrin repeats
  that mediate protein-protein interactions, particularly with RFX5 via recognition of a
  PxLPxI/L motif. RFXANK does NOT bind DNA directly; DNA binding is mediated by RFX5.
  RFXANK is essential for RFX complex assembly and stability, and mutations cause MHC class II
  deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome type 2, complementation group B). RFXANK functions as
  a transcription coactivator/coregulator, NOT as a DNA-binding transcription factor.

core_functions:
  - description: >
      RFXANK functions as a transcription coactivator in the RFX complex. It binds
      to RFX5 (the DNA-binding subunit) via its ankyrin repeats, enabling assembly
      of the heterotetrameric RFX complex that activates MHC class II gene transcription.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >
      Should RFXAP also be reclassified as a transcription coactivator rather than
      having DNA-binding transcription factor annotations? The same logic applies -
      RFXAP does not bind DNA directly.
  - question: >
      Are the GO annotations for RFX5 appropriately capturing its role as the DNA-binding
      subunit of the RFX complex?
  - question: >
      Should there be a specific GO term for "regulatory subunit of transcription factor complex"
      to better capture the roles of proteins like RFXANK and RFXAP?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >
      ChIP-seq comparing RFX5 binding with and without RFXANK to definitively demonstrate
      that RFXANK does not contribute to DNA binding specificity.
    hypothesis: RFXANK does not contribute directly to DNA binding specificity
  - description: >
      EMSA experiments testing purified RFXANK alone vs. RFX5 alone vs. complete RFX complex
      to demonstrate that only RFX5-containing complexes bind DNA.
    hypothesis: Only RFX5 provides DNA-binding activity to the RFX complex
