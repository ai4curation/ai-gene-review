## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O14593
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA-binding protein RFXANK; AltName: Full=Ankyrin repeat family A protein 1; AltName: Full=Regulatory factor X subunit B; Short=RFX-B; AltName: Full=Regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=RFXANK; Synonyms=ANKRA1, RFXB;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Ankyrin_rpt. (IPR002110); Ankyrin_rpt-contain_sf. (IPR036770); DNA-bd_RFXANK. (IPR017362); Ank (PF00023); Ank_2 (PF12796)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RFXANK" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RFXANK' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RFXANK** (gene ID: RFXANK, UniProt: O14593) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human RFXANK (UniProt O14593)

Verification of target identity and scope
- Gene symbol and protein identity: RFXANK (synonyms: ANKRA1, RFXB) encodes the human DNA-binding protein RFXANK, an ankyrin-repeat subunit of the Regulatory Factor X (RFX) transcriptional complex that governs major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) gene expression (UniProt O14593). Recent clinical-genetic and molecular reviews confirm ankyrin-repeat architecture and RFX complex membership for the human protein (Homo sapiens) (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 1-1, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).
- No ambiguity detected: Searches revealed literature consistently referring to human RFXANK; where other organisms were studied (e.g., swine cells), relevant findings were used only to illuminate conserved mechanisms of MHC II regulation rather than to redefine the human gene’s function (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36788-9, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 15-18).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and domains: RFXANK is an ankyrin-repeat protein; disease variants cluster in exons encoding ankyrin repeats, leading to truncated/inactive proteins. Structural summaries note each ankyrin repeat comprises two antiparallel helices and a β-hairpin; β-hairpin loops mediate binding to partner subunits (notably RFXAP) within the RFX complex (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 4-5).
- Complex membership and DNA targeting: RFXANK forms the trimeric RFX complex with RFX5 and RFXAP that binds the X-box within the conserved S–X–Y motif of MHC II promoters. RFX complex assembly nucleates the “enhanceosome,” together with NF-Y and CREB/ATF, which recruits the master coactivator CIITA to drive MHC II transcription (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).
- Functional role: RFXANK functions as an adaptor/cofactor essential for stable enhanceosome formation and transcriptional activation of HLA-DR/DQ/DP genes. Certain RFXANK mutants permit promoter binding yet fail to transactivate, underscoring an obligate coactivator role beyond mere DNA occupancy (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Founder mutation and population genetics: A 2023 Iranian multicenter cohort (n=18) confirmed a recurrent RFXANK founder mutation c.162delG (exon 3) present in six unrelated patients, with shared 2.7 Mb haplotype and time to most recent common ancestor estimated ~1,296 years (95% CI 702–2,457). Additional novel and known RFXANK variants expanded the allelic spectrum (e.g., c.338-1G>C splice-site; p.Asp121His; p.Trp130X; p.Trp188X; p.Arg212X) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 15-18, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 6-9).
- Clinical-immunologic statistics (2023 cohort): CD4+ T-cell deficiency in 72.2% (13/18); universally low CD4:CD8 ratio (100%, 16/16); lymphopenia 50% (8/16); low IgG 75% (12/16); reduced HLA-DR on monocytes 85.7% (12/14). Common infections included CMV (38.8%, 7/18). Outcomes: 4 underwent HSCT; 3 survived (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 13-15).
- Case-based 2024 updates: New RFXANK mutations linked to MHC II deficiency, with atypical/expanded phenotypes including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presentations in early infancy/childhood; these reinforce RFXANK’s centrality in BLS II diagnostics (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-024-09526-0, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-024-01674-0, Mar 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 13-15, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).
- Mechanistic signaling context update (2024): Induction of an APC-like, MHC II+ phenotype in human neutrophils depends on JAK1/2 and a p38–MSK1–CREB1 cascade feeding into CIITA and the MHC II enhanceosome; RFXANK is cited among essential enhanceosome factors, situating RFXANK downstream of IFNγ/JAK signaling axes in innate cells (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1444558, Sep 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).
- Cancer/therapeutic context (2023–2024): Reviews and experimental systems employing CIITA re-expression document sustained expression of enhanceosome genes (including RFXANK), reinforcing the intactness/necessity of RFX components for MHC II induction in tumors and therapeutic models (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2023.100631, Oct 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.22.576747, Aug 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostics: Flow-cytometric assessment of HLA-DR expression on B cells/monocytes and targeted/whole-exome sequencing for RFXANK (and CIITA/RFX5/RFXAP) are standard for suspected BLS II; recent cohorts emphasize family screening in high-consanguinity populations and early testing in infants with severe/recurrent infections (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 6-9, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 1-1).
- Curative therapy: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option. The 2023 cohort reported survival in 3/4 transplanted patients; broader literature cited within the cohort notes improved 3-year survival up to 94% since 2008 with optimized donor conditioning, albeit with risks of graft rejection and persistent CD4+ deficits (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 6-9).
- Public health and counseling: Identification of founder alleles (c.162delG in Iran; 26-bp deletion affecting exons 5–6 in North Africa) supports carrier screening and genetic counseling in at-risk populations (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 4-5).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic leadership: CIITA remains the master regulator coactivator recruiting the enhanceosome (RFX complex + NF-Y + CREB/ATF) to MHC II promoters; sustained emphasis in 2023 review underscores the indispensability of RFXANK-containing complexes for antigen presentation competency (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2023.100631, Oct 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).
- Enhanceosome integrity in disease and therapy: 2024 analyses and preclinical models underline that successful MHC II induction (e.g., in tumor cells) correlates with persistent expression of enhanceosome genes, including RFXANK, reinforcing that defects in these cofactors can limit therapeutic reprogramming (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.22.576747, Aug 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Frequency of RFXANK mutations in MHC II deficiency: Older literature collated in a peer-reviewed review indicates RFXANK accounts for >70% of reported MHC II deficiency cases worldwide (>200 total cases at the time), with geographic variation (e.g., high prevalence in North Africa) (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 1-1).
- Iranian 2023 cohort (n=18) metrics: CD4+ deficiency 72.2% (13/18), low CD4:CD8 in 100% (16/16), lymphopenia 50% (8/16), low IgG 75% (12/16), reduced monocyte HLA-DR 85.7% (12/14), CMV 38.8% (7/18); 6/13 RFXANK-mutant patients carried c.162delG founder allele; HSCT survival 3/4 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 13-15, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).

Biological function, localization, and pathway context
- Primary function: Non-enzymatic transcriptional cofactor/adaptor subunit of the RFX complex. RFXANK’s ankyrin repeats mediate protein–protein interactions within the RFX trimer, stabilizing enhanceosome assembly at MHC II promoters to enable CIITA-dependent transcription of HLA-DR/DQ/DP genes in antigen-presenting cells (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 4-5, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).
- Subcellular localization: Nuclear, at MHC II promoters as part of the DNA-bound RFX enhanceosome; promoter-binding with RFX5 and RFXAP is required for transcriptional activation (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).
- Pathway positioning: IFN-γ/JAK/STAT signaling induces CIITA, which recruits the enhanceosome (RFX complex including RFXANK, NF-Y, CREB/ATF) to S–X–Y elements at MHC II promoters, enabling transcriptional activation. 2024 experimental work in human neutrophils delineates a JAK1/2- and p38–MSK1–CREB1-dependent axis feeding into CIITA and enhanceosome function, consistent with RFXANK’s role downstream of cytokine signaling (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1444558, Sep 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

Human genetics and disease relevance
- Disease association: Autosomal recessive MHC class II deficiency (Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome type II, BLS II), complementation group B, due to biallelic loss-of-function variants in RFXANK. Hallmarks include absent/markedly reduced HLA-DR on B cells/monocytes, profound CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, defective Th-dependent antibody responses, and severe early-onset recurrent/opportunistic infections (e.g., CMV, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium) (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 1-1).
- Founder alleles and geography: North African 26-bp deletion removing exons 5–6; Iranian c.162delG (exon 3) founder mutation dated ~1.3 millennia ago; additional alleles span missense, nonsense, and splice-site changes predominantly impacting ankyrin-repeat integrity (https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, July 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 4-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).
- Clinical extensions (2024): Reports highlight HLH as a potential complication/presentation in RFXANK-associated MHC II deficiency, expanding the phenotypic spectrum and underscoring the need for early recognition and targeted management (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-024-09526-0, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-024-01674-0, Mar 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 13-15).

Cross-talk with cancer/immune evasion and noncanonical roles
- Cancer immunology: Restoring CIITA/MHC II in tumors requires an intact enhanceosome including RFXANK; sustained expression of RFX complex genes correlates with successful MHC II induction in tumor organoid models, relevant to immunotherapy strategies exploiting tumor-intrinsic MHC II (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.22.576747, Aug 2024; review: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2023.100631, Oct 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).
- Viral host dependency (cross-species insight): A 2023 CRISPR/Cas9 screen in porcine cells implicated RFXANK (with RFXAP and CIITA) among host factors essential for African swine fever virus replication; while not a human system, this points to conserved dependencies on MHC II transcriptional machinery components in pathogen–host interactions (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-36788-9, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 15-18).
- Transcriptional networks beyond MHC II: 2024 work mapping RFX7-centered tumor suppressor regulation detected RFXANK among proteins binding X-box motifs in a PDCD4 promoter context and showed that RFXANK knockdown affected a gene set largely distinct from p53–ANKRA2–RFX7 targets, suggesting RFXANK may be recruited to select X-box loci outside classical MHC II, though with distinct regulatory outcomes (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02149-2, Aug 2024) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

Limitations and open questions
- Structural resolution: High-resolution structures of human RFXANK within the full RFX trimer bound to S–X–Y DNA remain limited; most domain–interaction inferences stem from domain architecture and mutational mapping in human cohorts (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 4-5).
- Noncanonical roles: Emerging data on RFXANK at non-MHC promoters require further biochemical validation to clarify direct versus complex-mediated recruitment and functional consequences (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

Conclusion
Human RFXANK (O14593) is a nuclear ankyrin-repeat adaptor essential to the RFX transcriptional complex that assembles on S–X–Y motifs to recruit CIITA and activate MHC II genes. 2023–2024 evidence refines its clinical-genetic landscape (notably an Iranian founder mutation c.162delG and new case-linked variants) and situates RFXANK within cytokine-inducible pathways driving MHC II in innate cells. Diagnostic workflows (HLA-DR flow cytometry plus sequencing) and HSCT remain central in care, with improving outcomes. Emerging contexts in cancer immunotherapy and pathogen interaction underscore the broader relevance of maintaining an intact RFXANK-containing enhanceosome for antigen presentation.
