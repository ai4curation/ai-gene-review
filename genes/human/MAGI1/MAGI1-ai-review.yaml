description: Connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras 3 (CNKSR3) is a multi-domain
  scaffold protein that coordinates signaling complexes at the apical plasma membrane
  of epithelial cells. Its primary characterized function is regulation of the epithelial
  sodium channel (ENaC), where it acts as a central organizing platform for aldosterone-induced
  sodium transport. CNKSR3 also regulates cell migration through Arf6 activation and
  modulates MAPK signaling. NOTE - This gene was formerly called MAGI1, but that name
  is now assigned to the unrelated membrane-associated guanylate kinase Q96QZ7.

    label: enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. CNKSR3 is a scaffold
      protein involved in multiple signaling pathways including HGF-induced Arf6 activation
      and aldosterone-ENaC signaling. While the protein participates in signaling
      downstream of receptors, the specific connection to enzyme-linked receptors
      is indirect and the term is too general for this scaffold protein's core functions.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term 'enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway' is overly
      broad. CNKSR3's best-characterized role is in aldosterone signaling (which acts
      through nuclear receptors, not enzyme-linked receptors) and HGF signaling (which
      does involve receptor tyrosine kinases). A more specific term reflecting the
      scaffold/regulatory function would be more appropriate.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for adaptor/scaffold function. This is well-supported
      and represents a core molecular function of CNKSR3. The protein coordinates
      assembly of the ENaC-regulatory complex by binding multiple partners including
      SCNN1A, SCNN1B, NEDD4L, RAF1, and SGK1. It also scaffolds HGF-Arf6 signaling
      components.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This accurately captures CNKSR3's primary molecular function as a scaffold/adaptor
      protein that brings together multiple signaling components. Well-supported by
      experimental evidence.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on InterPro domains and UniProtKB subcellular location.
      CNKSR3 is indeed found in cytoplasm, though its most functionally important
      localization is at the apical plasma membrane where it regulates ENaC. Cytoplasmic
      localization is confirmed but represents a secondary or transit location.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurate but not the most informative localization. CNKSR3 is present
      in cytoplasm as stated in UniProt, though apical plasma membrane is the more
      functionally relevant location.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from InterPro domain IPR010599 (CNK2/3 domain). This
      is appropriate - CNKSR3 regulates multiple signal transduction pathways including
      MAPK/ERK signaling (negative regulation) and aldosterone-ENaC signaling (positive
      regulation of sodium transport).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurate representation of CNKSR3's biological role as a regulator of
      signaling pathways. The protein negatively regulates ERK1/2 cascade and peptidyl-serine
      phosphorylation while positively regulating ENaC-mediated sodium transport.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from InterPro. While CNKSR3 is a peripheral membrane protein
      at the apical plasma membrane, this extremely general term provides minimal
      information. More specific membrane localization terms are more appropriate.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term 'membrane' is too general. CNKSR3 specifically localizes to
      the apical plasma membrane where it functions in ENaC regulation. A more specific
      term is warranted.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: The term 'protein binding' is uninformative per curation guidelines. The

  review:
    summary: IDA evidence from immunofluorescence data (HPA project). Cytosol is a
      more specific cytoplasmic compartment and represents where CNKSR3 is found when
      not at the membrane. This is consistent with the protein's peripheral membrane
      association - it can be in cytosol and recruited to apical membrane.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Supported by direct experimental evidence from immunofluorescence. Cytosol
      localization is consistent with CNKSR3 being a peripheral (not integral) membrane
      protein that can shuttle between cytosol and membrane.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: Although PMID:22085542 is a key functional paper showing CNKSR3 interacts
      with cytohesin 2 and is required for Arf6 activation, the generic "protein binding"
      annotation is uninformative. The specific adaptor function (GO:0030674) is more

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core biological function of CNKSR3. The protein regulates aldosterone-induced

      SGK1 or other serine kinases in the ENaC regulatory complex, or broader effects
      on MAPK pathway serine phosphorylation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is consistent with CNKSR3's role as a scaffold regulating kinase
      signaling. The protein interacts with SGK1 and RAF1 kinases and modulates their
      activity in the context of ENaC regulation and MAPK signaling.

    summary: ISS annotation based on mouse ortholog. CNKSR3 negatively regulates MAPK/ERK
      signaling. CNK family proteins are known scaffold proteins in Ras/MAPK pathways,
      and CNKSR3 specifically acts as a negative regulator of the ERK1/2 cascade.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Represents an important regulatory function of CNKSR3 beyond its ENaC
      role. CNK proteins are scaffolds in Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, and CNKSR3
      negatively regulates ERK1/2. This is consistent with the protein's domain structure
      and family membership.
