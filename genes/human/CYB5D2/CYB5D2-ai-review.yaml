description: >-
  CYB5D2 (Neuferricin) is a secreted heme-binding protein belonging to the membrane-associated
  progesterone receptor (MAPR) family and the cytochrome b5 superfamily. The protein contains
  an N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved cytochrome b5-like heme-binding domain, with
  Asp86 being critical for heme coordination. CYB5D2 promotes neuronal differentiation (but not
  astrocyte differentiation) through heme-dependent mechanisms involving MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways. It localizes primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum where it co-localizes
  with cytochrome P450 reductase (CYPOR) and modulates CYP enzyme activities, including CYP51A1
  (lanosterol demethylase) and CYP3A4. CYB5D2 functions as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer
  types including breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its downregulation is
  associated with disease progression and poor prognosis.

      CYB5D2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum where it co-localizes with cytochrome P450
      reductase (CYPOR). This IBA annotation is consistent with experimental evidence showing
      ER localization, which is part of the endomembrane system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is supported by experimental evidence from Bruce and Rybak (2014) showing
      CYB5D2 localizes to the ER. The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is
      appropriate given the conservation of this localization across MAPR family members.

      CYB5D2 associates with the ER membrane where it interacts with membrane-bound proteins
      including CYPOR. Although CYB5D2 lacks a classical transmembrane domain and is secreted,
      it localizes to membrane compartments.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CYB5D2 contains a cytochrome b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain (InterPro IPR001199) that
      is characteristic of the MAPR family. While the domain architecture suggests potential
      steroid binding, direct experimental evidence for steroid binding by CYB5D2 specifically
      is limited.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is inferred from the conserved heme/steroid-binding domain. MAPR family
      members are involved in steroid metabolism and signaling. CYB5D2 affects CYP51A1 levels,
      which is involved in sterol biosynthesis, suggesting functional connections to steroid/sterol
      metabolism.
