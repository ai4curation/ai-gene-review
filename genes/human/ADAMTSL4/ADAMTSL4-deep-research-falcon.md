## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q6UY14
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ADAMTS-like protein 4; Short=ADAMTSL-4; AltName: Full=Thrombospondin repeat-containing protein 1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ADAMTSL4; Synonyms=TSRC1 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAI15499.1}; ORFNames=PP1396, UNQ2803/PRO34012;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ADAMTS_ADAMTS-like. (IPR050439); ADAMTS_CR_3. (IPR045371); ADAMTS_spacer1. (IPR010294); PLAC. (IPR010909); TSP1_rpt. (IPR000884)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ADAMTSL4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ADAMTSL4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ADAMTSL4** (gene ID: ADAMTSL4, UniProt: Q6UY14) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target identity before research. ADAMTSL4 (UniProt Q6UY14) encodes ADAMTS-like protein 4, a secreted thrombospondin type-1 repeat-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein in the ADAMTS-like (ADAMTSL) family that lacks a catalytic metalloprotease domain, consistent with a non-protease, matricellular role in Homo sapiens (Human) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13). Recent ophthalmic and ECM literature consistently treats ADAMTSL4 as a microfibril-associated protein critical for lens zonular integrity (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7, rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).

Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein and domains: ADAMTSL4 (ADAMTS-like protein 4) is an ADAMTSL family member containing thrombospondin type 1 repeats, PLAC, and spacer motifs; it lacks the protease catalytic domain present in ADAMTS proteases, indicating it functions as a non-enzymatic matricellular modulator in the ECM rather than as a protease (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7).
- Primary biological role: ADAMTSL4 localizes to the ECM of the ocular anterior segment and contributes to the assembly, organization, and anchorage of fibrillin-rich microfibrils that form the lens zonular fibers (ciliary zonule). It is proposed to bind/promote fibrillin microfibril biogenesis and/or crosslinking, thereby supporting zonular fiber stability (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7).
- Subcellular localization and site of action: Secreted, extracellular; acts in the lens zonule and adjacent anterior-segment ECM (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).
- Tissue/cell expression: Expression is enriched in ocular tissues, including lens epithelium and periocular/anterior eye structures. In zebrafish and human ocular tissue studies, ADAMTSL4 signal is observed in cornea and lens epithelium, periocular mesenchyme, and retinal plexiform layers; signals disappear in adamtsl4 knockouts, supporting specificity (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115757, May 2024) (tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11).
- Disease mechanism: Loss of ADAMTSL4 disrupts zonule assembly/anchorage, producing lens subluxation/dislocation (ectopia lentis) and sometimes ectopia pupillae, without the systemic features typical of Marfan syndrome; this reflects a structural/modulatory role in microfibril networks rather than enzymatic activity (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7, rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Clinical genetics and phenotype spectrum: A Dec 2023 case report confirmed compound heterozygous ADAMTSL4 variants in a child with isolated ectopia lentis (IEL), with no systemic Marfan features; prior founder variants (e.g., recurrent p.Arg746His in Cook Islands/New Zealand Māori; carrier frequency ~1/48 in unrelated Bukharian Jews) highlight population-specific risks (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-023-04272-7, Dec 2023) (wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4).
- Burden and functional effects in glaucoma: A May 2024 study of childhood glaucoma reported an increased burden of rare variants in matrix metalloproteinase-related genes including ADAMTSL4; functional assays showed certain ADAMTSL4 missense variants accumulate intracellularly and trigger ER stress, suggesting partial loss-of-function that may influence ocular anterior-segment development and susceptibility (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115757, May 2024) (tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11).
- ECM and cardiovascular context across the ADAMTSL family: A 2024 review highlighted the ADAMTSL proteins as ECM-localized matricellular regulators, often linked to fibrillin microfibrils and, in some family members, modulation of TGF-β signaling. It summarized that biallelic ADAMTSL4 variants primarily cause ocular phenotypes (ectopia lentis/ectopia lentis et pupillae) and discussed clinical testing relevance (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).
- Zonulopathies overview and microfibril biology: A 2024 review emphasized ADAMTSL4’s role within the ciliary zonule, proposing that ADAMTSL4 participates in microfibril packing/crosslinking with fibrillin-1 and LTBP proteins to stabilize zonular fibers, and cataloged ADAMTSL4 among autosomal recessive causes of ectopia lentis and ectopia lentis et pupillae (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 3-4).

Supplemental emerging evidence (model organisms; 2025 preprint)
- A large cohort and zebrafish CRISPR model (preprint) reported ADAMTSL4 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 23 of 702 congenital ectopia lentis probands (3.28%; 14 novel variants), with frameshift/nonsense/missense classes; adamtsl4 knockout zebrafish recapitulated ectopia lentis and ectopia pupillae, showing disrupted zonular fibers by histology and scanning EM, and phenotypes were rescued by transgenic adamtsl4 expression (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.03.686242, Nov 2025) (huang2025disruptionofadamtsl4 pages 5-7, huang2025disruptionofadamtsl4 pages 22-26). While preprint, these mechanistic data cohere with prior mouse knockout evidence summarized in 2024 review (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic testing: ADAMTSL4 is included on targeted NGS panels for pediatric ectopia lentis/zonulopathy evaluations. Identification of biallelic ADAMTSL4 variants supports an isolated ocular disorder (AR inheritance) and can refine clinical management and genetic counseling (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-023-04272-7, Dec 2023) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13, wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4).
- Functional variant assessment: In vitro overexpression studies and zebrafish modeling are being used to assess variant pathogenicity (e.g., ER retention/ER-stress phenotypes for p.Arg98Trp/p.Arg774Trp; partial loss-of-function in zebrafish), informing interpretation frameworks (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115757, May 2024) (tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- ADAMTSL4 as ECM matricellular regulator: The 2024 cardiovascular-focused review positions ADAMTSL family members, including ADAMTSL4, as secreted modulators of ECM architecture and signaling linked to fibrillin microfibrils, rather than structural elements or enzymes. It underscores clinical genetics evidence for ADAMTSL4 in ocular disease and the utility of clinical testing (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).
- Zonule biology perspective: The 2024 zonulopathy review highlights ADAMTSL4 within the structural/organizational framework of the lens zonule, supporting a model in which ADAMTSL4 cooperates with fibrillin-1 microfibrils and other ECM proteins to maintain zonular fiber strength (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 3-4).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Prevalence in a congenital ectopia lentis cohort: ADAMTSL4 variants in 23/702 probands (3.28%); variant classes included frameshift (37.9%), nonsense (24.1%), missense (20.7%) (preprint) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.03.686242, Nov 2025) (huang2025disruptionofadamtsl4 pages 5-7).
- Founder and carrier data: Reported recurrent p.Arg746His variant and notable carrier frequencies in specific populations (e.g., ~1/48 in unrelated Bukharian Jews) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-023-04272-7, Dec 2023) (wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4).
- Functional variant impact: ER stress and mislocalization for specific ADAMTSL4 missense variants (p.Arg98Trp, p.Arg774Trp) in vitro; partial loss-of-function effects in vivo (zebrafish) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115757, May 2024) (tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11).

Mechanistic pathway context
- Microfibril/ECM organization: ADAMTSL4 contributes to fibrillin-rich microfibril assembly and zonule stabilization. Reviews propose it may facilitate microfibril packing/crosslinking, an essential step for tensile integrity of the ciliary zonule (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 3-4).
- Growth-factor signaling (inference across family): While direct TGF-β modulation by ADAMTSL4 is not established, ADAMTSL family members have been implicated in regulating TGF-β signaling in cardiovascular contexts, suggesting a potential indirect pathway link via ECM organization (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).

Subcellular and tissue localization, and site of action
- Secreted, extracellular: Acts in the ECM of the ocular anterior segment, with prominent localization/function at the lens equator where zonular fibers insert on the lens capsule (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13, chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7).
- Cell-type expression (experimental): Immunolocalization shows ADAMTSL4 in cornea and lens epithelium and retinal layers in zebrafish; knockout eliminates signal, supporting specificity and ocular relevance (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115757, May 2024) (tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11).

Disease genetics and phenotypes
- Inheritance and clinical features: Biallelic (autosomal recessive) ADAMTSL4 variants cause isolated ectopia lentis and ectopia lentis et pupillae without systemic features of Marfan syndrome; craniosynostosis with ectopia lentis has also been cataloged among ADAMTSL4-related phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-023-04272-7, Dec 2023) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 3-4, rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13, wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4).
- Variant spectrum: Truncating (frameshift/nonsense) and missense variants are described; founder alleles exist in specific populations; early pediatric presentation is common (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-023-04272-7, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024) (wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4, chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7).
- Model organism evidence: Adamtsl4 knockout mice show zonular detachment and retinal pigment epithelium changes; zebrafish knockouts/preprint models recapitulate ectopia pupillae and ectopia lentis with demonstrable zonular disruption and rescue by transgene (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.03.686242, Nov 2025) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13, huang2025disruptionofadamtsl4 pages 22-26).

Implications for function and pathway placement
- Function: ADAMTSL4 acts as a non-enzymatic ECM organizer of fibrillin microfibrils required for zonule assembly and anchorage to the lens capsule. It is best classified as a matricellular modulator involved in ECM organization rather than as an enzyme, transporter, or receptor (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15121632, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7, rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).
- Pathways: ECM organization and microfibril assembly; potential indirect ties to growth factor bioavailability and TGF-β signaling via microfibril networks by analogy to other ADAMTSLs (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-024-09255-5, Feb 2024) (rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13).

Overall assessment
Convergent evidence from recent clinical genetics, functional assays, and model organisms places ADAMTSL4 as a secreted, non-protease ECM regulator that promotes fibrillin microfibril organization in the lens zonule. Biallelic loss disrupts zonular architecture, producing autosomal recessive ectopia lentis and ectopia lentis et pupillae without systemic Marfan features. These insights support routine inclusion of ADAMTSL4 in ectopia lentis gene panels and motivate continued investigation of its microfibril-binding interfaces and potential cross-talk with growth-factor signaling via the ECM (chipeta2024zonulopathiesasgenetic pages 5-7, rypdal2024emergingrolesfor pages 13-13, tevar2024theincreasedburden pages 8-11, wei2023anoveladamtsl4 pages 2-4).
