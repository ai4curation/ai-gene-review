description: >
  ADAMTSL4 (ADAMTS-like protein 4) is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein
  that
  functions as a matricellular regulator of fibrillin microfibril organization. Despite
  its
  name suggesting similarity to ADAMTS proteases, ADAMTSL4 lacks the catalytic metalloprotease
  and disintegrin-like domains characteristic of that family, indicating it is non-enzymatic.
  The protein contains thrombospondin type-1 repeats, PLAC, and spacer domains. ADAMTSL4
  localizes to the ECM of the ocular anterior segment and plays a critical role in
  the
  assembly, organization, and anchorage of fibrillin-rich microfibrils that form the
  lens
  zonular fibers (ciliary zonule). Biallelic loss-of-function variants in ADAMTSL4
  cause
  autosomal recessive isolated ectopia lentis (lens dislocation) and ectopia lentis
  et
  pupillae, without systemic Marfan-like features, reflecting its specialized role
  in
  zonular fiber stability. The protein is expressed in ocular tissues including lens
  epithelium and periocular structures, and binds directly to fibrillin-1 microfibrils,
  promoting their biogenesis.

core_functions:
  - description: >
      ADAMTSL4 binds fibrillin-1 microfibrils and promotes their biogenesis and
      organization in the ECM of the lens zonule. It functions as a matricellular
      adaptor/modulator rather than an enzyme (it lacks the catalytic metalloprotease
      domain of ADAMTS proteases).
