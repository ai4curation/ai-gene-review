description: PUS3 encodes a pseudouridine synthase that catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine specifically at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon stem-loop of cytosolic tRNAs. It functions as a stand-alone enzyme that directly binds tRNA without requiring guide RNAs. The protein forms a homodimer through a C-terminal coiled-coil domain and localizes to both nucleus and cytoplasm. PUS3 is critical for neurodevelopment, with biallelic loss-of-function mutations causing an autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome (NEDMIGS/MRT55) characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, and seizures.

  evidence_type: IBA

  review:
    summary: PUS3 catalyzes pseudouridine formation in tRNA as demonstrated experimentally (PMID:27055666). The IBA annotation is well-supported by evolutionary conservation of this function across the TruA/Pus3 family from bacteria to humans.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures PUS3's core enzymatic function. The protein has been experimentally validated to catalyze the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in tRNAs, with loss-of-function mutations abolishing this activity in patient cells.
