## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms

PUS3 (pseudouridine synthase 3) encodes an enzyme responsible for the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) by isomerizing specific uridine bases to pseudouridine ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). In particular, human PUS3 catalyzes the formation of pseudouridine at position 39 (and position 38 in some tRNAs) within the anticodon stem-loop of cytosolic tRNAs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Pseudouridine%20,and%20achieves%20site%20specificity%20remain)). Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the C5-glycoside isomer of uridine and is the most abundant RNA modification, found in tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, and even mRNA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=to%20over%20170%20different%20chemical,by%20a%20rotation%20of%20the)). The enzymatic reaction involves cleavage of the N1–C1′ glycosidic bond of uridine and rotation of the base before reattachment to form pseudouridine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=to%20over%20170%20different%20chemical,by%20a%20rotation%20of%20the)). Like other pseudouridine synthases, PUS3 acts as an **RNA isomerase** (EC 5.4.99.45) that does not require cofactors, instead using a conserved aspartate residue in the active site to catalyze the isomerization via a glycal intermediate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=exception%20of%20DKC1%20,conserved%20across%20bacteria%20and%20eukaryotes)). This reaction introduces an additional imino hydrogen (at N1) on the nucleoside, enhancing RNA stability and base-pairing capacity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=to%20over%20170%20different%20chemical,by%20a%20rotation%20of%20the)) (pseudouridine can form an extra hydrogen bond), which in tRNAs helps stabilize the anticodon loop structure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=tRNA%28Lys%2C3%29%20by%20an%20A%2B,Nucleic%20Acids)). Consistent with this molecular role, patient cells lacking functional PUS3 have significantly reduced pseudouridine levels in their tRNAs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)), underscoring the enzyme’s importance in maintaining normal tRNA structure and function.

PUS3 is a **“stand-alone” pseudouridine synthase**, meaning it autonomously binds its RNA substrate without requiring a guide RNA or larger ribonucleoprotein complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=The%20conversion%20of%20uridines%20to,autonomously%20bind%20target%20RNAs%20and)). It belongs to the **TruA family** of pseudouridine synthases (also known as the Pus3 family in eukaryotes), which generally target uridines in the anticodon arm of tRNAs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). Members of this family share a conserved catalytic mechanism and core fold across all domains of life ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=exception%20of%20DKC1%20,conserved%20across%20bacteria%20and%20eukaryotes)). Human PUS3 specifically modifies a broad subset of cytosolic tRNAs at the anticodon loop, introducing Ψ at position 38 and/or 39 depending on the tRNA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). This modification is critical for proper tRNA folding and decoding function during translation. Indeed, pseudouridylation of the anticodon loop has been shown to stabilize tRNA structure and can influence codon recognition fidelity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=tRNA%28Lys%2C3%29%20by%20an%20A%2B,Nucleic%20Acids)). Notably, PUS3 activity appears specific to tRNAs; recent high-throughput mapping found **no PUS3-dependent pseudouridine sites in mRNAs**, linking the enzyme’s function exclusively to tRNA modification and the associated disease phenotype to tRNA defects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=human%20PUS3%2C%20which%20catalyzes%20the,associated%20human%20diseases%20to%20tRNAs)).

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components

PUS3 predominantly localizes to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, consistent with its role in modifying tRNAs which are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and function in the cytosol ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=GO%20ID%20%20,TAS)). **UniProt** curators annotate PUS3 as a nuclear protein ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Subcellular%20locations%20from%20UniProtKB%2FSwiss,PUS3%20Gene)), and Gene Ontology likewise indicates PUS3 is active in the **nucleus (GO:0005634)** and **cytoplasm (GO:0005737)** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=GO%20ID%20%20,TAS)). Experimental data from the Human Protein Atlas confirm PUS3 presence in the nucleoplasm and cytosol of human cells ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Human%20Protein%20Atlas%20)). The enzyme likely acts on nascent or nuclear pre-tRNAs prior to their export, consistent with many tRNA modification processes occurring co-transcriptionally or during tRNA maturation in the nucleus. PUS3 may also remain associated with tRNAs in the cytosol, given its detection in that compartment ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Compartment%20%20%7C%20Confidence%20,1)). The COMPARTMENTS database (integrating multiple localization evidence) likewise scores PUS3 highest for the **cytosol and nucleus** (confidence scores 5 and 4, respectively) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Compartment%20%20%7C%20Confidence%20,1)). There is minimal evidence of PUS3 in other organelles (e.g. trace association with mitochondrion or ER scored as very low confidence) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=cytosol%20%20,1)), aligning with the understanding that **PUS3 acts on cytosolic (nuclear-encoded) tRNAs**, and not on mitochondrial tRNAs (mitochondrial tRNA pseudouridylation is performed by distinct enzymes such as PUS1). Overall, PUS3 is a **soluble, non-membrane protein** functioning in the nucleocytoplasmic compartment to ensure tRNAs acquire proper pseudouridine modifications.

## Biological Processes Involvement

As a tRNA pseudouridine synthase, PUS3 is directly involved in **tRNA processing** and RNA post-transcriptional modification pathways. Gene Ontology classifies PUS3 in the biological process of **“tRNA processing” (GO:0008033)**, reflecting its role in the maturation of tRNA molecules ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110060-PUS3/summary/gene#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,i%7D%20tRNA%20processing)). The specific reaction catalyzed by PUS3 – addition of pseudouridine at the anticodon loop – is a type of **tRNA base modification (tRNA pseudouridylation)**, a sub-process essential for generating functional tRNAs. By catalyzing pseudouridine formation at key positions, PUS3 contributes to the proper folding of tRNAs and stabilization of the anticodon stem-loop ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=tRNA%28Lys%2C3%29%20by%20an%20A%2B,Nucleic%20Acids)). This, in turn, impacts **translation** efficiency and fidelity, as modifications in the anticodon loop can influence codon–anticodon interactions and ribosome binding. Indeed, pseudouridine in tRNA has been shown to stabilize codon-anticodon pairing and support accurate reading of the mRNA codon ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=tRNA%28Lys%2C3%29%20by%20an%20A%2B,Nucleic%20Acids)). Thus, PUS3’s activity is tied to the broader biological process of **protein synthesis**, ensuring the translational machinery has a pool of correctly modified tRNAs.

Importantly, proper tRNA modification has emerged as critical for certain tissue functions, especially the brain. The discovery that PUS3 mutations cause neurological disease highlights the biological process of **neurodevelopment** being indirectly affected by tRNA modification ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=PUS3%20encodes%20the%20pseudouridylate%20synthase,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). The brain appears particularly sensitive to disruptions in tRNA modifications, as evidenced by severe intellectual disability resulting from PUS3 loss of function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=pseudouridine%20at%20positions%2038%20and,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). While PUS3’s immediate role is at the molecular level (tRNA maturation), the downstream biological processes influenced include **neuronal development, cognitive function**, and cellular growth. In model organisms, pseudouridine synthases of the PUS3/TruA family are important for healthy growth and viability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)), indicating that the pseudouridylation of tRNAs is fundamental for normal cell physiology. In summary, PUS3 is involved in: 

- **tRNA modification** – specifically pseudouridine formation in tRNAs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)).  
- **tRNA processing and maturation** as part of RNA post-transcriptional modification pathways (GO:0008033) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110060-PUS3/summary/gene#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,i%7D%20tRNA%20processing)).  
- **Translation** – by ensuring tRNAs are properly modified for efficient protein synthesis.  
- **Neurodevelopment and cell viability** – as an indirect consequence of its role in maintaining the translation machinery; defects lead to developmental abnormalities ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=PUS3%20encodes%20the%20pseudouridylate%20synthase,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)).

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes

**Biallelic pathogenic variants** in PUS3 cause a rare autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. This condition is designated **“Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Microcephaly and Gray Sclerae” (NEDMIGS)**, also known as **Mental Retardation, autosomal recessive 55 (MRT55)** in older nomenclature ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Intellectual%20Disability%20Syndrome%20,27055666%2028454995)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)). The syndrome is characterized by severe global developmental delays and **profound intellectual disability**, often accompanied by **hypotonia** (poor muscle tone) and markedly impaired speech or absent language development ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)). Affected children frequently present with **microcephaly** (small head/brain size) that can be mild to moderate, and many exhibit **seizures/epilepsy** starting in infancy or childhood ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=PUS3%20encodes%20the%20pseudouridylate%20synthase,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). A distinctive but variably present feature is **gray sclerae**, referring to abnormal bluish-gray coloration of the whites of the eyes due to underlying connective tissue differences ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)). This ocular finding, along with other pigmentary anomalies such as extensive dermal melanocytosis (bluish skin patches), was noted in the original cases and gives the disorder its name ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=%2A%20Severe%20Growth%20Deficiency,With%20Microcephaly%20And%20Grey%20Sclerae)).

Beyond the core neurological phenotype, **multisystem developmental abnormalities** have been reported in some patients with PUS3 mutations. Common associated features include **short stature or growth deficiency**, and variable dysmorphic facial features ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=PUS3%20encodes%20the%20pseudouridylate%20synthase,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). Some individuals have had **ocular and retinal anomalies** (e.g. retinal dystrophy or visual impairment) and **strabismus**, indicating that eye development can be affected ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=and%20stability,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=%2A%20Severe%20Growth%20Deficiency,With%20Microcephaly%20And%20Grey%20Sclerae)). Structural brain changes such as **cerebellar hypoplasia** have been observed via neuroimaging in at least one case ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=associated%20with%20severe%20intellectual%20disability%2C,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)), although many patients have unremarkable brain MRI despite severe clinical deficits ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=The%20leading%20symptoms%20of%20the,patients%20do%20not%20present%20any)). Outside the nervous system, there are occasional reports of congenital malformations: for example, a child with a truncating PUS3 mutation was described with a **congenital heart defect** and **kidney hypoplasia** in addition to microcephaly and retinal degeneration ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=associated%20with%20severe%20intellectual%20disability%2C,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). However, these visceral anomalies are less consistently seen and might represent the more severe end of the spectrum. Overall, the **consistent phenotype** of PUS3 deficiency is an *intellectual disability syndrome with microcephaly, seizures, hypotonia,* and *growth failure*, sometimes accompanied by unique features like grey/blue sclerae and skin melanocytosis ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=%2A%20Severe%20Growth%20Deficiency,With%20Microcephaly%20And%20Grey%20Sclerae)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)).

At the cellular level, patient-derived cells (such as fibroblasts) show **loss of PUS3 enzyme activity**, evidenced by reduced pseudouridine content in tRNA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). The consequences of this at the molecular level likely include destabilization of certain tRNAs and translational dysregulation, which are hypothesized to particularly impact rapidly developing tissues like the brain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=pseudouridine%20at%20positions%2038%20and,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). Consistent with this, *PUS3-related disorder* is one of several recently recognized **tRNA modification syndromes**, where perturbation of tRNA modifications leads to neurodevelopmental disease ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=pseudouridine%20at%20positions%2038%20and,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). There is no known association of PUS3 with cancer or adult-onset disorders; the phenotypes manifest early in development due to the gene’s crucial role in basic cellular processes.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features

The PUS3 protein is composed of 481 amino acids and contains a conserved pseudouridine synthase core flanked by unique extensions. **Domain architecture** analyses and structural studies indicate that human PUS3 has a central **TruA-like core domain** (the pseudouridine synthase catalytic domain) that is highly conserved among pseudouridine synthases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)). This core domain contains the active site and the signature fold of the **TruA/PseudoU synthase family** – an α/β fold with a conserved catalytic aspartate residue that performs nucleophilic attack on the uridine base ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=exception%20of%20DKC1%20,conserved%20across%20bacteria%20and%20eukaryotes)). Flanking this core, PUS3 possesses **eukaryote-specific N-terminal and C-terminal extensions** that are absent in simpler bacterial homologs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)). The N-terminal region (approximately residues 1–65) includes a segment annotated as **DUF3373** (domain of unknown function) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=pfam11853%20Location%3A10%20%E2%86%92%2050%20DUF3373%3B,DUF3373)). Although termed a DUF, this segment is thought to contribute to RNA-binding specificity or stability of the enzyme. The **C-terminal region (residues ~338–481)** is notably important for the protein’s quaternary structure: it forms a long α-helix (around amino acids 338–369) that mediates **homodimerization** of PUS3 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=match%20at%20L231%20parallel%20coiled,coil)). Two PUS3 monomers interact via this parallel coiled-coil helical motif, assembling into a **homodimeric complex** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=human%20PUS3%2C%20which%20catalyzes%20the,associated%20human%20diseases%20to%20tRNAs)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=match%20at%20L231%20parallel%20coiled,coil)). Dimerization is a conserved feature of TruA family pseudouridine synthases (for example, E. coli TruA is a dimer), and is required for full activity – likely positioning two active sites in proper orientation to modify uridines 38 and 39 on a tRNA simultaneously or to stabilize tRNA binding.

Structural analyses (including a recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of human PUS3) confirm that the **core domain** harbors the catalytic cleft and RNA-binding surfaces, while the flexible **terminal extensions enhance substrate selectivity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=flexible%20loops%2C%20helices%2C%20and%20additional,set%20of%20target%20RNAs%2C%20including)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)). The PUS3 dimer presents an extended RNA-binding interface, accommodating the L-shaped tRNA substrate. Notably, the **C-terminal coiled-coil** appears to be a unique adaptation in higher eukaryotes: sequence comparisons show this helical region is conserved in mammalian PUS3 orthologs, whereas bacterial TruA enzymes lack a comparable C-terminal helix ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=parallel%20coiled,coil)). The coiled-coil likely stabilizes the dimer or positions the C-termini for optimal tRNA interaction. In contrast, the **N-terminal extension (DUF3373)** in PUS3 might assist in recognizing specific tRNA features; for example, eukaryotic PUS3 enzymes may use their N-terminus to differentiate subsets of tRNAs, a property under investigation in recent studies. 

In summary, PUS3 is a **monomer of ~54 kDa** that forms a functional **dimer (~108 kDa)**. Each subunit contains: (1) an N-terminal region (unique to eukaryotes) of ~60 amino acids, (2) a **pseudouridine synthase core domain** (~Residues 70–330) that carries out catalysis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=DUF3373%3B%20Protein%20of%20unknown%20function,DUF3373)), and (3) a C-terminal α-helical extension (~Residues 338–481) that mediates dimerization and possibly additional RNA contacts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=match%20at%20L231%20parallel%20coiled,coil)). The protein’s **active site** includes the invariant aspartate (by homology, human PUS3’s catalytic Asp is at position 118, as evidenced by mutagenesis studies where D118A abolishes activity) – this Asp residue is necessary for forming the covalent enzyme–RNA intermediate during catalysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=,text%7BGln%7D%7DG_%7B39%7D%20%28tQ_%7BU39G%7D%29.%20Calculated%20K_%7Bd)). Together, these structural features enable PUS3 to specifically bind tRNA and catalyze pseudouridine formation with high precision. The **InterPro/Pfam classification** groups PUS3 in the **PseudoU_synth_1 family (Pfam PF01416)**, reflecting its membership in the pseudouridine synthase I family that also includes E. coli TruA ([www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/annotations/9F9Q#:~:text=Chains%20%20,Domain)).

## Expression Patterns and Regulation

**Baseline Expression:** PUS3 is expressed **ubiquitously** in human tissues, consistent with its role in a fundamental cellular process (tRNA modification). RNA expression profiling (e.g. **GTEx** data) indicates that PUS3 mRNA is present in all examined tissues, with moderate expression levels. For instance, the gene shows an RPKM of ~5 in adult liver and ~3.5 in appendix, with broadly similar expression in at least 25 other tissues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). This suggests PUS3 is a housekeeping gene, required in most cell types for normal protein synthesis. The Human Protein Atlas likewise classifies PUS3 as expressed in all surveyed tissues (RNA tissue category: “Expressed in all”), and it has evidence at the protein level ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110060-PUS3/summary/gene#:~:text=UniProt%20Q9BZE2%20%28UniProt%20,i%7D%20Isomerase%20Biological)). There may be some variation in expression levels: proteomic analyses (HIPED) reported PUS3 protein to be relatively high in **heart tissue** and adipocytes compared to other tissues ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Protein%20differential%20expression%20in%20normal,from%20HIPED%20for%20PUS3%20Gene)), though the functional significance of this is not fully clear. Generally, tissues with high rates of protein synthesis or high metabolic activity (such as brain, muscle, heart) would have a greater demand for correctly modified tRNAs, which could explain higher PUS3 expression in those contexts.

**Developmental and Cell-Type Expression:** During development, PUS3 is also widely expressed. Data from LifeMap indicate PUS3 transcripts are present in embryonic tissues including the developing **brain, pituitary gland, gastrointestinal tract (foregut)**, and **eye (retina)** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Discovery%20discovery)). This broad developmental expression aligns with the wide-ranging phenotype of PUS3 deficiency (affecting multiple organs). Notably, PUS3 expression in neural tissues (brain) during development supports the idea that sufficient PUS3 activity is critical for neurodevelopment. In cellular systems, PUS3 mRNA and protein have been detected in numerous cell lines; no cell-type specific isoforms or highly restricted expression have been reported. Immunocytochemistry confirms a nucleocytosolic distribution in diverse cell types ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=Human%20Protein%20Atlas%20)).

**Regulation:** Currently, there is limited information on specific transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of the PUS3 gene. No dedicated transcription factors or regulatory elements unique to PUS3 have been well-characterized. The **GeneHancer** database does list some candidate promoter/enhancer elements near the PUS3 locus ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=GeneHancer%20,citations)), but their functional impact is unverified. Given its ubiquitous expression, PUS3 is likely controlled by general housekeeping gene promoters. There is no evidence that PUS3 is strongly inducible or regulated by stress conditions (unlike some tRNA-modifying enzymes that respond to nutrient stress, although this has not been shown for PUS3). In patient cells, remaining wild-type allele expression (in carriers) appears sufficient for normal function, and **no dominant-negative effects** have been observed — consistent with a loss-of-function recessive disease mechanism ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=The%20leading%20symptoms%20of%20the,patients%20do%20not%20present%20any)).

Importantly, **alternative splicing** of PUS3 results in *two transcript variants* encoding different isoforms ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/83480#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Dec%202012)). The major isoform is the full-length 481-residue protein (corresponding to NM_001272, NP_001258914.1), while a minor isoform (NP_112597.4) may lack a portion of the coding sequence (the exact differences are not fully described in RefSeq but could involve N- or C-terminal truncation). Both isoforms include the core catalytic domain, and their enzymatic activity is presumed to be similar, though the shorter isoform might have altered localization or stability if it lacks part of the regulatory termini. The existence of these isoforms suggests potential regulation at the mRNA splicing level, but the functional significance remains unclear. To date, most studies of PUS3 (and all known pathogenic mutations) pertain to the full-length isoform.

In summary, **PUS3 is constitutively expressed in most human cells**, providing a steady supply of pseudouridine synthase activity for tRNA modification. Its expression pattern reflects its essential cellular role rather than tissue-specific functions. The gene’s regulation appears to be largely housekeeping in nature, and disease-causing mutations typically reduce or eliminate the functional protein rather than mis-regulate its expression.

## Evolutionary Conservation

PUS3 is **highly evolutionarily conserved** across a wide range of organisms, underscoring its fundamental role in RNA biology. Orthologs of human PUS3 can be found in all eukaryotic lineages, and functionally analogous enzymes exist in bacteria and archaea. In fact, PUS3 belongs to the ancient **TruA/Pus3 family of pseudouridine synthases**, which is present in **all domains of life** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). The E. coli *truA* gene (tRNA pseudouridine synthase I) was one of the first pseudouridine synthases identified; it modifies uridines in the anticodon loop of bacterial tRNAs and is considered the bacterial counterpart of PUS3. Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) has a PUS3 ortholog known as **Deg1** (also called Pus3 in some literature), which carries out the same pseudouridylation on cytosolic tRNAs ([www.orpha.net](https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/gene/PUS3#:~:text=Synonym%28s%29%3A%20FKSG32%2C%20tRNA,38%2F39%29%20synthase%2C%20DEG1)). These yeast and bacterial enzymes share significant sequence motifs with human PUS3, especially in the catalytic domain, indicating a common origin. The catalytic Asp residue and key sequence motifs (such as the consensus sequence around the active site) are conserved from bacteria to humans ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=exception%20of%20DKC1%20,conserved%20across%20bacteria%20and%20eukaryotes)).

Functionally, the importance of PUS3 is conserved as well. **Loss of the PUS3 ortholog in model organisms leads to growth and developmental defects**, highlighting its necessity. For example, *E. coli* truA mutants lacking pseudouridine at tRNA positions 38/39 exhibit reduced fitness, particularly at higher temperatures or stress conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). In *S. cerevisiae*, deletion of *Deg1* is viable but causes cold-sensitive growth phenotypes and defects in tRNA function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). Likewise, mouse *Pus3* is nearly identical to human PUS3 in sequence and is expressed in similar patterns, implying a conserved role in mammals (though a mouse knockout phenotype has not been widely reported in literature, one would predict neurological impairments given the human data). The **sequence identity** between human PUS3 and mouse Pus3 is high (on the order of ~96% amino acid identity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=parallel%20coiled,coil)) for the core domain, with divergence mostly in the poorly conserved tail regions), reflecting strong evolutionary pressure to maintain this enzyme’s function.

The **eukaryote-specific extensions** of PUS3 (N- and C-termini) evolved later and are conserved mainly within higher eukaryotic clades. For instance, mammals share the coiled-coil dimerization helix in the C-terminus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=parallel%20coiled,coil)), whereas in fungi and lower eukaryotes this region is shorter or divergent, yet these proteins still form dimers (possibly through an alternate interface). This suggests that while the core enzymatic function is ancient, some regulatory or structural adaptations have occurred in multicellular organisms, potentially to modulate PUS3 activity, stability, or interactions in more complex cellular contexts.

Taken together, the **PUS3 gene/protein is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria (TruA) to humans**, indicating that pseudouridine formation in tRNA anticodon loops is a universally critical process ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). The conservation in sequence and function is so high that cross-species complementation is feasible: a human PUS3 can functionally replace yeast Deg1, for example, to rescue its pseudouridylation function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=patient%20tRNA,expand%20the%20list%20of%20tRNA)). This evolutionary preservation highlights that **PUS3 performs a fundamental cellular role that has been maintained for billions of years**.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature

Multiple lines of experimental evidence have elucidated PUS3’s function and its link to disease:

- **Genetic Discovery (2016):** Shaheen *et al.* (2016) first implicated PUS3 in human disease by identifying a **homozygous truncating mutation (Arg435*)** in a consanguineous family with syndromic intellectual disability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). They demonstrated that cells from affected individuals had a significant loss of tRNA pseudouridine modifications, consistent with PUS3 loss-of-function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=mutation%20in%20PUS3%20that%20fully,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). This study established the connection between PUS3 enzymatic activity and normal cognitive development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=pseudouridine%20at%20positions%2038%20and,to%20these%20highly%20conserved%20processes)). It also highlighted the broader concept that **tRNA modification defects can cause neurodevelopmental disorders**, as the Arg435* mutation in PUS3 was shown to segregate perfectly with the intellectual disability phenotype ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5152754/#:~:text=In%20this%20study%2C%20we%20show,29%20Chen%20and%20Patton)). This foundational finding (OMIM: *617051*) defined a new autosomal recessive ID syndrome caused by PUS3 mutations.

- **Phenotypic Expansion (2016–2021):** Following the initial report, additional PUS3 variant cases were identified. Froukh *et al.* (2020) and Nøstvik *et al.* (2021) described new patients from different populations carrying **biallelic PUS3 mutations** (including missense and splice-site variants), thereby *expanding the phenotypic spectrum* ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=,107%20%7D)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=PUS3%20encodes%20the%20pseudouridylate%20synthase,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). These studies confirmed that **severe intellectual disability with microcephaly** is the consistent outcome of PUS3 loss, while also documenting variable features like seizures, pigmentary abnormalities (gray sclerae), and organ developmental defects ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=,27055666%2028454995%2031444731%2034415064)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34713961/#:~:text=and%20stability,defect%2C%20and%20right%20kidney%20hypoplasia)). For instance, Nøstvik *et al.* 2021 (Clinical Genetics) compiled clinical data on multiple individuals and helped delineate commonalities (global developmental delay, hypotonia, lack of speech) and variability in PUS3-related neurodevelopmental disorder ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PUS3#:~:text=global%20developmental%20delay%2C%20hypotonia%2C%20profoundly,gene%20represented%20in%20this%20entry)). These works firmly established PUS3 mutations as a recurrent cause of a recognizable syndromic ID condition (sometimes referred to as NEDMIGS or MRT55).

- **Biochemical and Cellular Studies (2022):** Lin *et al.* (2022, *Human Mutation*) investigated the **molecular consequences of PUS3 mutations** in patient cells and in vitro. They characterized two missense mutations (e.g. Tyr71Cys and Ile299Thr) found in patients and discovered that these mutations lead to **protein instability and degradation** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=cells%20%28Figure%C2%A02f%29,very%20similar%20to%20other%20two)). Fibroblasts from patients showed drastically reduced PUS3 protein levels despite normal mRNA levels, indicating that the mutant proteins were misfolded and turned over by the proteasome ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=cells%20%28Figure%C2%A02f%29,very%20similar%20to%20other%20two)). In vitro expression and purification experiments echoed this: the Ile299Thr mutant was less stable and prone to aggregation, explaining the *loss-of-function at the protein level* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=cells%20%28Figure%C2%A02f%29,very%20similar%20to%20other%20two)). Moreover, this study directly measured tRNA modifications in patient-derived cells, confirming the **absence of PUS3-catalyzed pseudouridines in multiple tRNAs** from those patients ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=match%20at%20L831%203,PUS3%E2%80%90specific%20%CE%A8%20in%20various%20tRNAs)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=3,in%20various%20tRNAs)). Lin *et al.* also gathered all known PUS3 variants up to that time and confirmed that all were extremely rare in the general population and segregated with disease in families ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092196/#:~:text=the%20loss%20of%20PUS3%20transcript,Phe%7D%20in)). This provided a clear genotype–phenotype correlation and mechanistic insight: many **disease-causing PUS3 alleles produce an unstable enzyme**, leading to deficient tRNA pseudouridylation and cellular dysfunction.

- **Structural and Mechanistic Insight (2024):** The most detailed mechanistic understanding of PUS3 came from a study by Lin *et al.* (2024, *Molecular Cell*), in which researchers solved the structure of human PUS3 (including a catalytically inactive mutant D118A) in complex with tRNA substrates. They revealed that **PUS3 forms a homodimer** and uncovered how it specifically recognizes its tRNA targets ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=human%20PUS3%2C%20which%20catalyzes%20the,associated%20human%20diseases%20to%20tRNAs)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)). The structural data, combined with binding assays, showed PUS3’s preferences for certain tRNA sequence/structure features (explaining why it pseudouridinates particular tRNAs at position 39). Notably, they found that **PUS3’s C-terminal coiled-coil dimerization domain is crucial for high-affinity tRNA binding** and that each PUS3 dimer can potentially engage two tRNA molecules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=Human%20PUS3%20harbors%20a%20conserved,type%20%28WT%29%20PUS3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=match%20at%20L231%20parallel%20coiled,coil)). Additionally, this work confirmed that PUS3 has no off-target activity on other RNA classes (e.g., no pseudouridylation detected in rRNA or mRNA in PUS3-proficient vs deficient cells) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=human%20PUS3%2C%20which%20catalyzes%20the,associated%20human%20diseases%20to%20tRNAs)). This comprehensive analysis solidified our understanding of PUS3’s catalytic mechanism, substrate selectivity, and the structural basis for its function. It also provided a framework to interpret how different mutations (e.g. ones affecting the core vs the dimerization helix) impact the enzyme’s function – for example, a mutation in the core active site versus one destabilizing the dimer interface could both abrogate activity.

- **Additional References:** Earlier fundamental studies on pseudouridine synthases, predating the identification of human PUS3, also inform our knowledge. Biochemical characterization of *E. coli* TruA and yeast Deg1 had demonstrated the requirement of a particular aspartate and the dimeric nature of these enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=,alone%20pseudouridine)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1650%20Yokoyama%20S,Google%20Scholar)). Those classical studies, along with more recent reviews (e.g. Charette and Gray 2000 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11258540/#:~:text=,alone%20pseudouridine)), Rintala-Dempsey & Kothe 2017), provide context that PUS3 operates via the same conserved mechanism as other pseudouridine synthases. Furthermore, clinical genetics databases (ClinVar, DECIPHER) list several pathogenic PUS3 variants, and model organism databases (MGI for mouse, SGD for yeast) note the phenotype of PUS3/Pus3/Deg1 loss in model systems, reinforcing the human findings.

In conclusion, a robust body of evidence – from human genetics and clinical observations to cellular biochemistry and structural biology – converges to explain PUS3’s role. **PUS3 is a tRNA pseudouridine synthase essential for proper neuron development and function**, and when this enzyme is absent or nonfunctional, the resulting cascade of tRNA instability and translational impairment leads to a defined neurodevelopmental syndrome. This gene’s annotations in the Gene Ontology and related databases reflect these findings, ensuring that PUS3 is recognized for its RNA-binding, pseudouridine synthase activity and its involvement in tRNA processing and human disease.
