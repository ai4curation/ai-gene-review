## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q6UXY1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BAR/IMD domain-containing adapter protein 2-like 2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:26203}; AltName: Full=Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 2; Short=BAI1-associated protein 2-like protein 2; AltName: Full=Planar intestinal- and kidney-specific BAR domain protein; Short=Pinkbar;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BAIAP2L2; ORFNames=UNQ9336/PRO34007;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AH/BAR_dom_sf. (IPR027267); Baiap2l2_I-BAR_dom. (IPR030126); I-BAR_dom. (IPR013606); IRSp53/IRTKS/Pinkbar. (IPR027681); Pinkbar_SH3. (IPR035593)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BAIAP2L2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BAIAP2L2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BAIAP2L2** (gene ID: BAIAP2L2, UniProt: Q6UXY1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human BAIAP2L2 (Pinkbar; UniProt Q6UXY1)

Identity verification and domain architecture
- Gene/protein identity: The target is BAIAP2L2 (Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 2; Pinkbar). Experimental studies focused on BAIAP2L2 in mammalian hair cells and human cancers consistently use this symbol and name, aligning with the human gene context specified here (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma cohorts and cell lines, and mouse inner ear hair-cell models for mechanistic studies) (wei2023baiap2l2isa pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 5-9, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 5-6).
- Domains/family: BAIAP2L2 contains an N-terminal inverse BAR (I-BAR/IMD) domain. Halford et al. mapped the I-BAR to approximately amino acids 1–261 and used isolated I-BAR constructs to demonstrate membrane association properties characteristic of the BAR/IMD superfamily, consistent with membership in the IRSp53/IRTKS/Pinkbar I-BAR family (Molecular Biology of the Cell, Apr 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 11-12, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7).
- Organism: The studies cited include human tumor data (HCC cohorts and cell lines) and mechanistic work in mammalian systems, supporting that the research pertains to human BAIAP2L2 biology and its conserved function (Scientific Reports, May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35420-0; Cancer Gene Therapy, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (wei2023baiap2l2isa pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Molecular function: The I-BAR domain mediates membrane binding and negative curvature generation. In heterologous cell assays, BAIAP2L2’s I-BAR exhibited enhanced plasma membrane association when intracellular Ca2+ was elevated, consistent with Ca2+-dependent stabilization of protein–membrane interactions at the inner leaflet (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7).
- Localization in hair cells: BAIAP2L2 becomes highly enriched at the tips of stereocilia (with row-specific enrichment) in cochlear hair cells. Tip localization requires functional mechanotransduction (MET) channels and is lost upon acute pharmacological channel block or intracellular Ca2+ chelation; localization recovers after washout. This demonstrates a tight coupling between channel activity, local Ca2+ entry, and BAIAP2L2 tip retention (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 5-6, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 7-9).
- Transport/partners at stereocilia tips: A tripartite complex of MYO15A (myosin XVa), EPS8, and BAIAP2L2 effectively targets to filopodia tips in cells and is implicated in transport to stereocilia tips in hair cells. Full-length EPS8 is required for efficient complex formation with MYO15A tail and BAIAP2L2; EPS8 residues ~208–310 contribute to BAIAP2L2 association (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 9-11, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 11-12).
- Phenotypes upon loss: Prior work summarized by Halford et al. indicates that loss of Baiap2l2 destabilizes transducing stereocilia and leads to deafness, linking BAIAP2L2 to maintenance of the mechanotransduction apparatus and auditory function (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 13-14).

Recent developments (priority to 2023–2024 primary literature)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):
  • Overexpression and prognosis. A 2023 integrative study found BAIAP2L2 overexpressed in HCC across TCGA, GEO, ICGC, and HPA datasets and showed that BAIAP2L2 promotes migration and invasion in vitro. It also associated BAIAP2L2 with immune infiltration, DNA methylation features, and cuprotosis-linked signatures (Scientific Reports, May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35420-0) (wei2023baiap2l2isa pages 1-2).
  • Mechanism and clinical relevance. In 2024, Jia et al. demonstrated that NF-κB1 directly upregulates BAIAP2L2 transcription by binding its promoter, and that BAIAP2L2 physically binds GABPB1 to inhibit its ubiquitin-mediated degradation and promote its nuclear translocation. Through GABPB1, BAIAP2L2 lowers mitochondrial ROS, promoting proliferation, metastasis, stemness, and resistance to lenvatinib in vitro and in vivo. High BAIAP2L2 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor (Cancer Gene Therapy, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 12-15, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 5-9).
- Immune-oncology signatures (NSCLC): BAIAP2L2 was included among 16 T cell–related prognostic genes in a 2025 model trained on TCGA NSCLC; small qRT-PCR validation showed tumor upregulation versus adjacent normal. While the model’s predictive AUCs were reported for the entire signature, the paper confirms BAIAP2L2’s differential expression in NSCLC tissue (Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1566597) (zhang2025developmentandvalidation pages 8-11).
- Prostate cancer: A 2025 transcriptomic and experimental study reported elevated BAIAP2L2 expression in prostate cancer tissues, with knockdown impairing migration, colony formation, and viability in PC3 and DU145 cells, suggesting oncogenic functions warranting further mechanistic mapping (Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1543476) (zhan2025identificationofprognostic pages 11-12).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Hearing biology: Mechanistic data supports BAIAP2L2 as part of the stereocilia-tip machinery that depends on Ca2+ influx through MET channels and on MYO15A–EPS8 transport. Its loss destabilizes transducing stereocilia and is linked to deafness in mouse models, highlighting potential relevance to human hereditary sensorineural hearing loss and the maintenance of hair-cell mechanotransduction (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 5-6, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 7-9, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 13-14).
- Oncology biomarkers/targets:
  • HCC: Elevated BAIAP2L2 expression can stratify patient outcomes and may indicate lenvatinib resistance risk via the NF-κB1→BAIAP2L2→GABPB1→ROS pathway; BAIAP2L2 knockdown reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, and modulates lenvatinib IC50 in resistant vs. sensitive lines (Cancer Gene Therapy, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 12-15).
  • NSCLC: Inclusion in a T cell–related prognostic signature and qRT-PCR tumor upregulation support its potential role as a component of multigene biomarkers (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1566597) (zhang2025developmentandvalidation pages 8-11).
  • Prostate cancer: Functional dependence of migration/proliferation on BAIAP2L2 suggests a candidate therapeutic target; further in vivo validation is needed (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1543476) (zhan2025identificationofprognostic pages 11-12).

Expert opinions and mechanistic analysis (authoritative sources)
- Membrane mechanics and I-BAR function: Direct experimental work in hair cells demonstrates I-BAR–mediated membrane binding is enhanced by Ca2+, and that local Ca2+ entry through MET channels is necessary for BAIAP2L2 retention at stereocilia tips. Together with tripartite complex formation with MYO15A and EPS8, these features position BAIAP2L2 as a Ca2+-responsive membrane–actin interface component shaping the stereociliary tip membrane (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 9-11, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 7-9).
- Cancer pathway logic: In HCC, the NF-κB1→BAIAP2L2→GABPB1 axis connects inflammatory transcriptional control to redox regulation and drug resistance. This provides a mechanistic rationale for combining BAIAP2L2/GABPB1 axis inhibitors with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (e.g., lenvatinib) to overcome resistance, and for using BAIAP2L2 expression as a prognostic and possibly predictive biomarker (Cancer Gene Therapy, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 12-15, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 5-9).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (with dates/URLs)
- Hair-cell localization and Ca2+ dependence: Acute block of MET channels or intracellular Ca2+ chelation led to a significant loss of BAIAP2L2 tip signal, reversible upon washout. Mapping of the I-BAR domain to aa 1–261 and membrane enrichment with raised intracellular Ca2+ were demonstrated (Molecular Biology of the Cell, Apr 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 5-6, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 11-12, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 7-9).
- HCC prognosis: High BAIAP2L2 was an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival with multivariable HR 1.878 (95% CI 1.13–2.626, P = 0.024); univariable HR 2.10 (95% CI 1.30–3.50, P = 0.0031). Functional assays showed BAIAP2L2 increased proliferation, migration/invasion, stemness, reduced apoptosis, and elevated lenvatinib IC50 in resistant cells; knockdown reversed these phenotypes (Cancer Gene Therapy, published online Nov 4, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 5-9, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 12-15).
- HCC overexpression and migration/invasion: Integrative analyses confirmed overexpression in HCC vs normal, with in vitro promotion of migration/invasion. Associations with immune infiltration, methylation, and cuprotosis were reported (Scientific Reports, May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35420-0) (wei2023baiap2l2isa pages 1-2).
- NSCLC and prostate cancer: NSCLC modeling confirmed tumor upregulation by qRT-PCR; prostate cancer knockdown studies showed reduced migration, colony formation, and viability (Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1566597; Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1543476) (zhang2025developmentandvalidation pages 8-11, zhan2025identificationofprognostic pages 11-12).

Subcellular localization and pathway integration
- Hair-cell mechanotransduction: BAIAP2L2 functions at stereocilia tips, a domain enriched in MET channels and actin-regulatory machinery. The protein is delivered to tips by MYO15A in conjunction with EPS8 and is retained at the plasma membrane by local Ca2+ influx through MET channels, likely via I-BAR domain interactions with the inner leaflet. This places BAIAP2L2 within the MYO15A–EPS8 tip complex that governs stereocilia architecture and maintenance of transduction (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-10-0491) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 5-6, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 9-11, halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7).
- Cancer signaling: In HCC, transcriptional activation by NF-κB1 and stabilization of GABPB1 by BAIAP2L2 connect inflammatory signaling to mitochondrial redox control. The downstream reduction of ROS supports proliferation, stemness, and drug resistance; in vivo models show BAIAP2L2 modulates tumor growth and metastasis (Cancer Gene Therapy, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-024-00841-0) (jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 12-15, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 5-9).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- The symbol BAIAP2L2 is also used in the context of the IRSp53 family and is distinct from BAIAP2L1 (IRTKS). The studies cited here explicitly examine BAIAP2L2/Pinkbar in mammalian systems and human cancers, consistent with the target identity provided. No conflicting organism-specific symbol ambiguity was encountered in the cited literature set (Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2022; Scientific Reports, 2023; Cancer Gene Therapy, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (halford2022ca2+entrythrough pages 6-7, wei2023baiap2l2isa pages 1-2, jia2024baiap2l2promotesthe pages 1-2, zhang2025developmentandvalidation pages 8-11).
