# BAIAP2L2: Structural Characterization, Membrane Dynamics, and Cellular Functions in Human Physiology

BAIAP2L2 (BAR/IMD domain-containing adaptor protein 2-like 2), also known by its descriptive alias **Pinkbar** (planar intestinal- and kidney-specific BAR domain protein), encodes a multidomain protein that functions as a membrane-binding scaffold controlling cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. This comprehensive review examines the structural architecture, biochemical properties, and biological roles of BAIAP2L2 with particular emphasis on its well-characterized function in maintaining mechanotransductive stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, its specialized role in epithelial tissues, and emerging evidence for involvement in disease states including inherited hearing loss and hepatocellular carcinoma. The protein represents a unique member of the inverse-BAR (I-BAR) protein family, distinguished by its ability to generate planar membrane structures rather than tubular protrusions, thereby establishing distinct cellular roles compared to its paralogs. Recent research has established BAIAP2L2 as a critical component of the "row 2 protein complex" at stereocilia tips, where it maintains the morphological integrity essential for sound transduction in the inner ear, with genetic disruption causing progressive hearing loss and eventual deafness within eight months in mouse models.

## Protein Structure and Domain Architecture

The structural organization of BAIAP2L2 defines its biochemical capabilities and cellular functions. BAIAP2L2 contains several functionally distinct domains that collectively mediate membrane interactions, protein-protein binding, and actin regulation[1][3][13]. The protein's most prominent structural feature is its N-terminal I-BAR domain (inverse Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain), which assumes a characteristic zeppelin-shaped structure that differs fundamentally from the banana-shaped geometry of classical BAR domains[39][57]. This I-BAR domain forms homodimers through coiled-coil interactions and presents a convex membrane-binding surface enriched in positively charged residues, enabling electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane[57]. The distinctive feature of the I-BAR domain is its capacity to stabilize flat or gently curved membrane geometries rather than inducing the pronounced tubular invaginations characteristic of other BAR superfamily proteins[13][27].

A critical structural element unique to BAIAP2L2 among I-BAR proteins is the relatively flat lipid-binding interface of its BAR domain[13]. High-resolution crystallographic analyses combined with biochemical oligomerization studies revealed that BAIAP2L2's BAR domain assembles into sheet-like oligomeric structures on membranes rather than helical coats, providing structural explanation for its distinctive membrane-deforming properties[13][27]. This sheet-like assembly appears to reflect approximately 15-30 percent of lipid molecules displaying rapid diffusion within protein/phosphoinositide clusters, suggesting that while BAIAP2L2 restricts lateral mobility of membrane phosphoinositides, the interaction remains dynamic rather than immobilizing entire membranes[27]. The central SH3 domain of BAIAP2L2 mediates protein-protein interactions through recognition of proline-rich motifs found in multiple binding partners[49]. This domain binds with moderate affinity and selectivity to targets including the actin-regulatory protein EPS8, the Rho family GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, and other cytoskeletal effectors[25][26][49].

The C-terminal region of BAIAP2L2 contains a WH2 domain (Wiskott-Aldrich homology domain 2) that binds to actin monomers[33][49]. This WH2 domain does not possess intrinsic actin nucleation activity comparable to Arp2/3 complex, but rather functions as an actin monomer sink and may sequester actin monomers or regulate their incorporation into filaments through interactions with other actin-regulatory proteins[28][33]. Together, these multidomain features establish BAIAP2L2 as a membrane-to-cytoskeleton adaptor capable of coupling phosphoinositide-enriched membrane domains with actin filament organization and Rho GTPase signaling.

## Biochemical Function and Phosphoinositide Binding Specificity

At the molecular level, BAIAP2L2 functions primarily as a phosphoinositide-binding protein that senses and promotes specific membrane geometries while simultaneously serving as a scaffolding platform for actin-associated proteins[1][27][38]. The protein displays broad preference for phosphoinositide-containing membranes without clear preference for specific phosphoinositide species, though phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P₂) represents the predominant substrate in physiological contexts[1][37][38]. This phosphoinositide-binding property resides primarily within the I-BAR domain, which exhibits a preference toward PtdIns(4,5)P₂ enriched membranes but demonstrates adaptability toward other phosphoinositide species through similar electrostatic mechanisms[27][37][38].

A mechanistically important feature of BAIAP2L2 relates to how calcium modulates its membrane association. Unlike most I-BAR proteins lacking identified calcium-binding sites, BAIAP2L2's association with the plasma membrane is dramatically enhanced in the presence of elevated calcium[26][29][37]. Biochemical evidence demonstrates that when intracellular calcium levels are elevated through mechanotransduction channel opening, the I-BAR domain of BAIAP2L2 displays significantly increased association with plasma membranes[37]. This calcium-dependent enhancement of membrane binding likely reflects the known capacity of divalent cations to cluster phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns(4,5)P₂, creating higher-order lipid microdomains to which BAIAP2L2 exhibits increased affinity[26][37]. Conversely, chelation of intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM leads to rapid loss of BAIAP2L2 from stereocilia tips, demonstrating that sustained calcium elevation, rather than transient calcium signaling, maintains BAIAP2L2 localization[37]. This mechanism establishes calcium as a transduction-specific retention signal, selectively maintaining BAIAP2L2 at mechanotransducing stereocilia tips where continuous calcium influx occurs through open transduction channels[26][37].

The BAR domain assembly properties of BAIAP2L2 produce remarkable effects on membrane phosphoinositide dynamics. In addition to sensing curved membrane domains, BAIAP2L2's BAR domain assembles into stable scaffolds that severely restrict lateral diffusion of bound phosphoinositide molecules by at least two orders of magnitude[27]. This phenomenon appears not dependent on specific membrane curvature but rather on the assembly of oligomeric protein scaffolds themselves, as demonstrated through comparative analysis across different BAR domain superfamily members[27]. The functional consequence is that BAIAP2L2 generates extremely stable lipid microdomains by "freezing" phosphoinositide molecules into organized arrays, effectively creating nanometer-scale phosphoinositide clustering[27]. Such lipid organization could facilitate recruitment of other signaling proteins through multiple weak interactions with clustered lipid headgroups and create chemically distinct membrane compartments supporting specialized cellular processes.

## Tissue Expression Pattern and Subcellular Localization

BAIAP2L2 demonstrates highly restricted tissue expression, concentrating predominantly in epithelial tissues of specialized organs rather than exhibiting ubiquitous distribution[4][13][16][47]. In situ hybridization analysis combined with immunohistochemical examination of mouse tissues established that BAIAP2L2 mRNA expression is restricted to the epithelial layer of the intestine and specific regions of the kidney[13][16]. Within the intestinal epithelium, BAIAP2L2 protein detection is strongest in well-differentiated enterocytes organized in a polarized epithelial monolayer, with expression substantially increasing when intestinal epithelial cells achieve full polarization on culture filters[13][16]. This tissue specificity contrasts markedly with related I-BAR proteins including IRSp53 and MIM, which display more ubiquitous expression patterns across multiple cell types and tissues[13].

At the subcellular level, BAIAP2L2 localizes to distinct membrane compartments reflecting its specialized functional roles in epithelial organization. In polarized intestinal epithelial cells and in vivo in intestinal epithelium, BAIAP2L2 displays punctate localization concentrated near cell-cell contacts and occasionally at tight junction structures[13]. Importantly, many endogenous punctate BAIAP2L2-positive structures colocalize with Rab13-positive recycling vesicles, small GTPase-enriched organelles involved in trafficking of membrane proteins to lateral membrane domains and junctions[9][13]. Additionally, BAIAP2L2 localizes to the plasma membrane at intercellular junctions[1][9], positioning it to regulate membrane organization at sites of cell-cell contact. This localization pattern suggests BAIAP2L2 contributes to assembly or maintenance of specialized membrane structures supporting epithelial barrier integrity and cell-cell communication.

In cochlear hair cells, BAIAP2L2 demonstrates a highly specialized subcellular distribution far more restricted than in epithelial tissues. Immunohistochemical examination reveals that BAIAP2L2 protein becomes detectable from postnatal day 2.5 and persists throughout adulthood, but localizes exclusively to the apical stereocilia-bearing surface of hair cells[19][25][49]. Within the hair bundle, BAIAP2L2 concentrates at the tips of shorter-row transducing stereocilia, particularly the second and third rows where mechanotransduction channels reside[19][25][48][49]. This stereocilia tip localization emerges progressively during hair bundle development, with initial weak immunoreactivity in outer hair cells at postnatal day 0, strengthening to robust tip-concentrated signal by postnatal day 2, and fully mature tip-enriched distribution established by postnatal day 30[49]. Within vestibular hair cells, while BAIAP2L2 also localizes at shorter-row stereocilia tips, its localization appears less essential for vestibular hair cell function, suggesting tissue-specific variations in BAIAP2L2 requirements despite similar subcellular distribution patterns[34].

## Molecular Trafficking and Subcellular Targeting Mechanisms

BAIAP2L2 localization to stereocilia tips depends upon a sophisticated trafficking system involving motor proteins and cargo molecules. The motor protein **MYO15A** (myosin 15A) carries BAIAP2L2 within stereocilia toward tips, with this trafficking requirement documented through experiments in mice lacking either MYO15A or BAIAP2L2[25][26][29]. However, BAIAP2L2 and MYO15A do not interact directly in biochemical pull-down experiments, indicating an intermediary protein bridges their interaction[26][29]. The actin-binding protein **EPS8** serves this intermediary role, binding simultaneously to both MYO15A and BAIAP2L2 to form a tripartite complex capable of transporting BAIAP2L2 within stereocilia[26][29]. Mapping studies identify residues 208-310 of EPS8, encompassing proline-rich motifs, as the region responsible for BAIAP2L2 binding[26], consistent with SH3 domain-mediated recognition of proline-rich sequences.

Although MYO15A can traffic BAIAP2L2 in the absence of EPS8, the MYO15A-EPS8 complex transports BAIAP2L2 more efficiently than MYO15A alone, suggesting EPS8 functions as an accessory factor optimizing transport efficiency[26]. Interestingly, BAIAP2L2 also binds the closely related protein **EPS8L2**, which, unlike EPS8, concentrates at stereocilia row 2 tips rather than row 1 tips, and this interaction may contribute to BAIAP2L2's selective accumulation at row 2 tips[25][26]. The Rho family GTPases **CDC42** and **RAC1** interact directly with BAIAP2L2's C-terminal domain and may contribute to its association with stereociliary structures, though the precise mechanisms remain unclear[25][33][49]. Additionally, the actin-binding protein **ESPNL** (espin-like) interacts with BAIAP2L2 and concentrates at stereocilia tips, potentially contributing to actin organization or BAIAP2L2 retention[25][49].

## The Row 2 Protein Complex and Stereocilia Maintenance

The most thoroughly characterized biological role of BAIAP2L2 resides in its function as an essential component of the **row 2 protein complex** at the tips of mechanotransducing stereocilia in cochlear hair cells. Stereocilia represent highly ordered F-actin-based cellular protrusions that develop from an initial undifferentiated microvillus lawn into a precisely organized staircase-like bundle containing three or four rows of increasing height[15][31][33]. The stereocilia bundle structure proves essential for mechanotransduction, as sound-induced deflection of stereocilia bundle produces mechanical force transmitted to mechanotransduction channels concentrated at the tips of shorter-row stereocilia[33]. Maintaining the graded height relationships between stereocilia rows throughout adult life represents a critical requirement for continuous sound transduction, as disruption of staircase architecture correlates directly with hearing loss[19][22][33].

The row 2 protein complex localizes specifically at the tips of the second and third rows of stereocilia, distinct from the row 1 complex at the tallest stereocilia tips[25][33][40][50]. Known row 2 complex components include MYO15A-L (a long isoform of myosin 15A), EPS8L2, TWF2 (twinfilin 2), CAPZB2 (capping protein Z subunit beta 2), and the recently characterized BAIAP2L2[25][33][40][50]. BAIAP2L2 binding to known row 2 complex proteins EPS8L2, TWF2, and CAPZB2 has been demonstrated through biochemical co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down assays[40][50]. Furthermore, BAIAP2L2 binds **CIB2**, a component of the mechanotransduction channel complex itself, and BAIAP2L2 localization to stereocilia tips depends on functional CIB2, establishing a direct molecular link between the mechanotransduction machinery and the row 2 protein complex[40][50].

Loss-of-function studies employing knockout mice reveal that BAIAP2L2 plays an indispensable role in maintaining mature stereocilia structure. In **Baiap2l2-deficient mice**, the progressive deterioration of stereocilia begins subtly, with outer hair cells initiating loss of third-row stereocilia just after postnatal day 9, accompanied by a reduction in mechanotransduction currents[19][22][48]. Over the following post-hearing weeks, the ordered staircase structure progressively deteriorates, such that by 8 months of age, both outer and inner hair cells have lost most second and third row stereocilia and become profoundly deaf[19][22][48]. The mechanotransduction current reduction appears particularly dramatic in outer hair cells, decreasing from approximately 687 pA in wild-type cells to 554 pA in Baiap2l2-deficient cells at postnatal day 7[50]. Interestingly, in vestibular hair cells from the same knockout mice, BAIAP2L2 localizes to shorter-row stereocilia tips with apparently normal localization, yet does not play essential roles in stereocilia maintenance or vestibular function[34]. This tissue-specific difference suggests that while BAIAP2L2 participates in both cochlear and vestibular hair cells, compensatory mechanisms may operate more effectively in vestibular cells, possibly through overlapping functions with related proteins such as BAIAP2L1[34].

## Comparison with BAIAP2L1: Distinct Stereocilia Row Specificities

Recent research has revealed important functional distinctions between BAIAP2L2 and its paralog **BAIAP2L1** (also known as IRTKS), establishing a model of specialized row-specific protein complexes[20][23][36][45]. While BAIAP2L2 concentrates at shorter-row (row 2) stereocilia tips and proves essential for their maintenance, BAIAP2L1 localizes at the tips of tallest-row (row 1) stereocilia in a manner dependent on EPS8 and MYO15A, similar to BAIAP2L2's trafficking requirements[20][23][36]. However, a striking difference emerges in calcium dependence: unlike BAIAP2L2's localization, which requires calcium entry through mechanotransduction channels, BAIAP2L1's localization at row 1 tips proves calcium-independent[20][36][45]. This differential calcium regulation likely reflects the distinct functional contexts, as row 1 stereocilia do not house mechanotransduction channels and thus do not experience the continuous calcium influx characteristic of row 2 stereocilia[20].

Functionally, loss of BAIAP2L1 in knockout mice produces minimal phenotypic consequences, with largely normal auditory and vestibular function despite normal BAIAP2L1 localization at row 1 tips[20][45]. This contrasts sharply with BAIAP2L2 deficiency, which produces profound hearing loss. The researchers hypothesize that other BAIAP2L1-related proteins, particularly BAIAP2 (IRSp53), compensate for BAIAP2L1 loss in hair cells[20][45]. These findings suggest that while row 1 and row 2 complexes have evolved distinct protein compositions reflecting their specialized roles, row 2 complex proteins including BAIAP2L2 prove uniquely essential because row 2 stereocilia experience continuous mechanotransduction-driven calcium influx creating a cellular environment requiring BAIAP2L2's calcium-sensitive lipid binding properties.

## Role in Epithelial Cells and Microvillar Structure

Beyond its well-characterized function in cochlear stereocilia, BAIAP2L2 contributes to epithelial tissue organization, particularly in intestinal enterocytes and renal proximal tubule cells. In intestinal epithelium, BAIAP2L2 localization to Rab13-positive vesicles and intercellular junctions suggests involvement in trafficking of junctional proteins or organization of epithelial barriers[13][16]. The functional significance of this localization remains partially characterized, as mice lacking BAIAP2L2 display normal kidney and colon tissue morphology and maintain normal electrolyte homeostasis and tissue architecture under physiological conditions[18][44]. This apparent lack of obvious epithelial defects in knockout mice suggests that while BAIAP2L2 participates in epithelial organization through its localization to cell junctions and Rab13 vesicles, this role may be redundant with other proteins or becomes apparent only under specific challenge conditions.

BAIAP2L2's relationship to microvillar formation and maintenance in intestinal brush borders remains incompletely understood. Microvilli, which structurally resemble miniature versions of cochlear stereocilia through their F-actin-based organization and dynamic regulation, represent primary sites of nutrient absorption in intestinal epithelium[31]. The paralog BAIAP2L1 has been demonstrated to elongate microvilli in mouse small intestinal organoids through mechanisms involving EPS8 localization[34]. Given BAIAP2L2's similar ability to interact with EPS8 and its specific intestinal expression, BAIAP2L2 may participate in microvillar dynamics, though direct experimental evidence remains limited. The selective expression in intestinal and kidney epithelium, combined with BAIAP2L2's specialized capacity to generate flat membrane structures through its unique BAR domain properties, suggests distinct roles in epithelial tissues compared to more ubiquitous I-BAR proteins.

## Emerging Roles in Malignant Transformation and Cancer Progression

Recent literature has begun uncovering roles for BAIAP2L2 in cancer biology, revealing connections between this stereocilia-maintenance protein and pathways controlling cell proliferation, migration, and metastatic potential. BAIAP2L2 shows significant upregulation in multiple human malignancies, with particularly well-characterized roles emerging in osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. In human osteosarcoma, BAIAP2L2 is significantly upregulated compared to normal bone tissue, and functional inhibition of BAIAP2L2 suppresses both osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasive capacity[12][35]. These findings suggest BAIAP2L2 contributes to osteosarcoma malignancy through mechanisms promoting cell division and tissue invasion, consistent with its general role as a membrane-to-actin regulator that could facilitate dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling during metastatic processes.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BAIAP2L2 functions as a novel prognostic biomarker related to migration and invasion capacity[11][42][43]. Detailed mechanistic analysis demonstrates that BAIAP2L2 enhances cell proliferation, promotes metastatic potential, increases cancer stem cell properties, accelerates cell cycle progression, and simultaneously inhibits apoptosis in HCC cells[43]. The BAIAP2L2-driven malignancy appears to operate through VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and apoptosis signaling pathways[5], suggesting that BAIAP2L2 may promote tumor angiogenesis through VEGF signaling while simultaneously suppressing programmed cell death. Upregulation of BAIAP2L2 additionally associates with cuprotosis, a copper-dependent form of cell death mechanistically distinct from classic apoptosis[11][42], indicating complex relationships between BAIAP2L2 function and cellular metabolic stress responses. The precise mechanisms by which a stereocilia-maintenance protein becomes oncogenic when upregulated in cancer cells remain to be fully elucidated, though the capacity to reorganize actin cytoskeleton, recruit signaling proteins through SH3-mediated interactions, and modulate cell-cell contacts through junction localization likely creates permissive conditions for metastatic dissemination and survival.

BAIAP2L2 has also been associated with prostate cancer and gastric cancer development, further supporting a broader role in cancer biology across epithelial malignancies[5][46]. The consistent pattern of BAIAP2L2 upregulation promoting migration and invasion across these diverse cancer types suggests that the normal mechanisms controlling cell morphology and membrane dynamics become pathological when dysregulated in transformed cells. This emerging oncogenic function, while superficially disconnected from stereocilia maintenance, likely reflects the fundamental principle that proteins controlling actin dynamics and membrane geometry become oncogenic when their expression levels increase, facilitating the morphologic plasticity and migratory capacity required for metastatic progression.

## Protein Interactions and Signaling Network Integration

BAIAP2L2 functions as a signaling hub integrating multiple inputs from membrane lipids, GTPase signaling pathways, and actin-regulatory proteins. The protein's SH3 domain binds to multiple proline-rich binding partners, establishing a network of protein-protein interactions that connects BAIAP2L2 to diverse cellular processes. The primary well-characterized interaction partners include **EPS8 and EPS8L2**, actin-bundling proteins with intrinsic actin-binding and cross-linking activities, and the Rho-family GTPases **CDC42 and RAC1**, which control cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology[25][28][33][49]. Through these interactions, BAIAP2L2 couples lipid-based membrane sensing with small GTPase signaling and direct actin regulation.

The interaction between BAIAP2L2 and EPS8 appears particularly critical for BAIAP2L2 function in stereocilia. EPS8 not only serves as the intermediary enabling BAIAP2L2 transport by MYO15A but also likely contributes independently to actin organization at stereocilia tips through its own actin-bundling activities[26][28][33]. The SH3 domain recognition of EPS8's proline-rich regions establishes BAIAP2L2 as a scaffolding platform organizing actin-regulatory proteins at stereocilia tips. Similarly, interactions with CDC42 and RAC1 position BAIAP2L2 at the convergence of Rho GTPase signaling pathways that coordinate actin polymerization and cell morphology changes. The Rho GTPase signaling pathway emerges as a key functional context for BAIAP2L2, as evidenced by GO (Gene Ontology) annotations identifying BAIAP2L2 participation in "Signaling by Rho GTPases" and "RHOD GTPase cycle" pathways[1][21].

More recently, the interaction between BAIAP2L2 and CIB2, a component of the mechanotransduction channel complex, establishes a direct molecular connection linking mechanotransduction with stereocilia structural maintenance[40][50]. This interaction raises the intriguing possibility that BAIAP2L2 localization and retention at stereocilia tips becomes partly self-regulating through direct sensing of mechanotransduction complex assembly. Additionally, while calcium does not appear to affect BAIAP2L2-binding protein interactions directly, the calcium-enhanced membrane association of BAIAP2L2 may facilitate its interactions with membrane-proximal binding partners or concentrate the complex at specific membrane microdomains enriched in PtdIns(4,5)P₂[26][37].

## Genetic and Molecular Basis of Associated Hearing Disorders

BAIAP2L2 mutations cause **autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness 78 (DFNA78)**, an inherited hearing disorder characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss[1][21]. The dominant nature of DFNA78 suggests that heterozygous mutations affecting BAIAP2L2 function produce sufficient cellular dysfunction to impair hearing, though specific DFNA78-causing mutations have not been extensively characterized in the available literature. The deafness phenotype aligns precisely with BAIAP2L2's known function, as mutations disrupting stereocilia maintenance would logically produce progressive hearing loss through the same cellular mechanisms demonstrated in knockout mouse studies.

BAIAP2L2 mutations additionally associate with **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 15 (BBS15)**, a complex ciliary disorder characterized by diverse developmental and degenerative manifestations[1][21][24]. Bardet-Biedl syndrome represents a genetic ciliopathy, and BAIAP2L2's association with BBS15 appears surprising given its established stereocilia role, as stereocilia represent modified microvilli rather than true primary cilia[24][56][59]. This association suggests either that BAIAP2L2 functions in primary ciliary structures in BBS-relevant tissues (such as kidney and photoreceptor cells) in addition to its role in stereocilia, or that BBS15-associated BAIAP2L2 mutations disrupt functions beyond stereocilia maintenance. The BBS phenotype, characterized by pigmentary retinopathy, early-onset obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism, renal malformations, and intellectual impairment, suggests BAIAP2L2 may contribute to photoreceptor outer segment organization or ciliary trafficking in multiple tissues[24]. Future research clarifying the mechanisms linking BAIAP2L2 to BBS15 will likely reveal either tissue-specific functions or previously unappreciated roles in primary ciliary biology.

## Conclusion and Future Perspectives

BAIAP2L2 represents a uniquely specialized member of the I-BAR protein family evolved to generate planar rather than curved membrane structures, positioning it as a distinctive regulator of epithelial tissue organization, mechanical signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics. At the molecular level, BAIAP2L2 functions as a phosphoinositide-binding membrane scaffold whose association with the plasma membrane becomes dramatically enhanced by calcium, establishing a mechanism through which mechanotransduction events translate directly into retention of cytoskeletal-organizing machinery at stereocilia tips. The protein's most well-characterized role involves maintaining the structural integrity of mechanotransducing stereocilia in cochlear hair cells through participation in the row 2 protein complex, where its loss produces irreversible hearing loss. The calcium-dependent regulation of BAIAP2L2 localization represents a sophisticated cellular mechanism linking sensory signal transduction directly to structural maintenance, ensuring that regions of the stereocilia bundle actively engaged in mechanotransduction receive continuous supply of stabilizing proteins.

Beyond auditory function, emerging evidence increasingly recognizes BAIAP2L2 as a contributor to epithelial tissue organization in intestinal and renal tissues, though the precise mechanisms and functional consequences remain incompletely characterized. The surprising discovery that BAIAP2L2 becomes upregulated in multiple cancer types, where it promotes migration, invasion, and metastatic potential, reveals an oncogenic aspect of this protein's membrane-organizing and actin-regulatory functions. Future research must address several key questions: what specific roles does BAIAP2L2 play in maintenance of intestinal brush borders and renal epithelial organization under physiological and pathological conditions; what mechanisms link BAIAP2L2 dysfunction to Bardet-Biedl syndrome features beyond hearing loss; how do cancer cells exploit BAIAP2L2's normal cellular functions to achieve metastatic competence; and whether targeting BAIAP2L2 in cancer contexts might provide therapeutic benefit. Understanding the full scope of BAIAP2L2's cellular roles promises insights into both the precise mechanisms of mechanotransduction and epithelial homeostasis, as well as novel therapeutic targets for hearing loss and metastatic disease.
