description: >-
  BAIAP2L2 (Pinkbar) is an epithelial-specific I-BAR domain-containing adapter protein
  that generates planar membrane structures rather than tubular protrusions typical of
  other I-BAR family members. The protein contains an N-terminal I-BAR/IMD domain
  (aa 1-239) with a relatively flat lipid-binding interface and a C-terminal SH3 domain
  (aa 324-387). Unlike IRSp53 which induces membrane tubulation, Pinkbar promotes the
  formation of planar membrane sheets through its unique oligomerization properties.
  The protein binds phosphoinositides including PtdIns(4,5)P2 and localizes to RAB13-positive
  vesicles and plasma membrane at intercellular junctions in intestinal epithelial cells.
  In hair cells, BAIAP2L2 localizes to stereocilia tips in a Ca2+-dependent manner via
  a tripartite complex with MYO15A and EPS8, playing a role in stereocilia maintenance
  and mechanotransduction.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER family analysis. While BAIAP2L2
      may have some cytosolic pool before membrane recruitment, the primary functional localization
      is at plasma membrane, vesicle membranes, and cell junctions. This is a non-specific localization
      that does not capture the functionally relevant sites.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The cytosolic localization is likely a general feature inherited from the IRSp53 family
      (which includes BAIAP2, BAIAP2L1) but does not reflect the primary functional localization
      of Pinkbar. The key experimental localizations are membrane-associated: RAB13-positive vesicles,
      plasma membrane at intercellular contacts [PMID:21743456], and stereocilia tips in hair cells.
      Keep as non-core since cytosolic pool exists before membrane recruitment.

      IBA annotation inferred from phylogenetic relationship to IRSp53 family members. No experimental

      phylogenetic inference from other family members that may not apply to Pinkbar.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      There is no experimental evidence for nuclear localization of BAIAP2L2. The protein is
      epithelial-specific and primarily membrane-associated [PMID:21743456]. The nucleoplasm
      annotation is based on inference from other I-BAR family members (IRSp53/BAIAP2) but
      Pinkbar has distinct localization and function. The I-BAR domain of Pinkbar has a
      relatively flat lipid-binding interface specialized for planar membrane structures,
      inconsistent with nuclear function.

      IBA annotation inferred from phylogeny with other I-BAR family members like IRSp53.
      While IRSp53 directly promotes actin polymerization through effector interactions,
      Pinkbar's role appears more focused on membrane organization and planar structure
      generation rather than direct actin regulation.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The evidence for direct positive regulation of actin polymerization by BAIAP2L2 is
      inferred from phylogeny with IRSp53 family. While BAIAP2L2 contains an SH3 domain
      that could interact with actin regulatory proteins, the experimental literature focuses
      on its unique membrane-shaping properties [PMID:21743456]. In hair cells, BAIAP2L2
      forms a complex with EPS8 and MYO15A at stereocilia tips, but
      whether this involves direct regulation of actin polymerization versus scaffolding
      is unclear. More direct experimental evidence is needed.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic relationship to other I-BAR family members.
      IRSp53 family proteins are known to be involved in actin bundling. For BAIAP2L2
      specifically, the stereocilia localization suggests involvement in actin-based
      structures but direct experimental evidence for bundle assembly activity is limited.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      While BAIAP2L2 localizes to stereocilia tips which are composed of bundled actin
      filaments, there is no direct evidence that BAIAP2L2 itself
      promotes actin filament bundle assembly. The protein's role appears more related
      to membrane organization and serving as a scaffold for the MYO15A-EPS8 complex.
      The IBA inference from IRSp53 may not fully apply given Pinkbar's unique properties.

      The actin crosslink formation annotation is based on phylogenetic inference.
      BAIAP2L2's primary characterized functions are membrane binding and planar membrane
      structure generation [PMID:21743456], not direct actin crosslinking. The SH3 domain
      could potentially mediate interactions with actin-regulatory proteins, but no
      crosslinking activity has been demonstrated for Pinkbar specifically.

      Generation of planar membrane structures through the I-BAR domain. Unlike other
      I-BAR family members that induce membrane tubulation, Pinkbar's relatively flat
      lipid-binding interface and sheet-like oligomerization generate planar membrane
      sheets at epithelial cell junctions and vesicle membranes.

      Scaffolding function in stereocilia tip complex. BAIAP2L2 forms a tripartite
      complex with MYO15A and EPS8 for transport to and retention at stereocilia tips.
      Loss of function leads to destabilization of transducing stereocilia and deafness.

          BAIAP2L2 becomes highly enriched at the tips of stereocilia (with row-specific enrichment)
          in cochlear hair cells. Tip localization requires functional mechanotransduction (MET)
          channels and is lost upon acute pharmacological channel block or intracellular Ca2+ chelation

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does BAIAP2L2 directly regulate actin dynamics through its SH3 domain interactions,
      or is its role primarily in membrane organization with indirect effects on actin?
  - question: What is the functional significance of the oncogenic roles reported in HCC and
      other cancers - is this related to normal membrane/cytoskeletal functions or
      represents gain-of-function?
  - question: What are the specific phosphoinositide binding preferences of Pinkbar's I-BAR
      domain compared to other family members?

suggested_experiments:
