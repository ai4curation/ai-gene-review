description: SCAMP5 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 5) is a 
  brain-enriched, tetraspanning membrane protein of the SCAMP family that 
  functions as a key organizer of vesicular trafficking pathways. SCAMP5 
  localizes predominantly to synaptic vesicles, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), 
  and recycling endosomes. Its N-terminal region directly binds the mu4 subunit 
  of the AP-4 adaptor complex, enabling recruitment of AP-4 to the TGN and 
  facilitating export of ATG9A to axons and presynaptic terminals, thereby 
  enabling presynaptic autophagy and synaptic vesicle protein turnover. SCAMP5 
  also cooperates with SNARE machinery by interacting with synaptotagmins (SYT1,
  SYT2) via its C-terminal tail, promoting calcium-triggered exocytosis of 
  signal peptide-containing cytokines such as CCL5. Additionally, SCAMP5 
  interacts with the organellar Na+/K+/H+ exchanger NHE7 (SLC9A7) and 
  participates in shuttling NHE7 between recycling vesicles and the TGN. 
  Disease-associated variants in SCAMP5 are linked to neurodevelopmental 
  disorders with seizures, and increased SCAMP5 expression under ER stress 
  contributes to polyglutamine aggregate accumulation via endocytosis 
  inhibition.

    review:
      summary: SCAMP5 localizes to recycling endosome membranes where it
