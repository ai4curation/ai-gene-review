## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8TAC9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 5; Short=Secretory carrier membrane protein 5; Short=hSCAMP5;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SCAMP5;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SCAMP family. SCAMP5 subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** SCAMP. (IPR007273); SCAMP (PF04144)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SCAMP5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SCAMP5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SCAMP5** (gene ID: SCAMP5, UniProt: Q8TAC9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and approach
- Verify identity and nomenclature (complete): SCAMP5, human protein (UniProt Q8TAC9), a tetraspanning secretory carrier–associated membrane protein of the SCAMP family. Confirmed brain enrichment and localization to synaptic vesicles and the Golgi/TGN in neurons (see below). (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 1-8)
- Prioritize recent primary literature (2023–2024) for mechanistic roles, complemented by earlier work as cited in these papers. Key sources identified: Ryu et al., 2023 (IBRO Neuroscience Reports) and Mustafá et al., 2023 (Channels). (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 1-8, mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)
- Extract evidence on function, localization, interactions, pathways, disease associations, and quantifiable data; synthesize into a comprehensive report with URLs and dates.

Comprehensive research report: SCAMP5 (human; UniProt Q8TAC9)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Definition and family: SCAMP5 (secretory carrier–associated membrane protein 5) is a brain-enriched, tetraspanning membrane protein of the SCAMP family that localizes predominantly to synaptic vesicles and is also enriched at the Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN). It is implicated in synaptic vesicle cycling and membrane trafficking. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 1-8)
- Core conceptual role: SCAMP5 serves as a trafficking organizer linking TGN export pathways to presynaptic terminals, including an AP-4–dependent pathway that controls delivery of ATG9A (the only transmembrane core autophagy protein) to presynapses, thereby enabling presynaptic autophagy and synaptic vesicle protein turnover. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)

2) Molecular and cellular functions (current understanding)
- AP-4 recruitment at the TGN and ATG9A trafficking: SCAMP5’s N-terminal region directly binds the μ4 subunit of the AP-4 adaptor (AP4M1), a critical step for recruiting AP-4 to the TGN. Loss of SCAMP5 disrupts AP-4 localization at the TGN and impedes ATG9A export from the TGN to axons/presynapses, leading to ATG9A accumulation at the TGN and reduced presynaptic ATG9A. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
- Presynaptic autophagy and SV protein turnover: SCAMP5 knockdown in primary neurons reduces presynaptic autophagosome formation (even upon rapamycin or depolarization), leading to impaired turnover and accumulation of older synaptic vesicle proteins, consistent with a requirement for SCAMP5 in presynaptic autophagy. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
- Regulation of plasma-membrane expression of T-type CaV3 channels: In heterologous cells, SCAMP5 co-expression markedly suppresses whole-cell T-type Ca2+ currents (Cav3.1/Cav3.2/Cav3.3) by reducing functional channel expression at the plasma membrane; this effect largely persists with patient-associated SCAMP5 variants (R91W, G180W). Channels, June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)
- Broader SV cycling roles: SCAMP5 is described as synaptic vesicle–enriched and involved in SV endocytosis during high activity and release-site clearance, acting with endocytic adaptor AP-2. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)

3) Subcellular localization
- Neurons: Highly enriched at presynaptic boutons and at the Golgi/TGN. Loss-of-function redistributes ATG9A to the TGN and reduces axonal/presynaptic ATG9A. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 1-8, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
- Other cell systems: SCAMPs are primarily Golgi-localized with fractions at the plasma membrane in heterologous cells; SCAMP5 thus likely participates in secretory pathway regulation more generally, consistent with its suppression of CaV3 channel surface expression in tsA-201 cells. Channels, June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)

4) Interaction partners and trafficking pathways
- AP-4 adaptor complex (μ4/AP4M1): Direct interaction with SCAMP5 N-terminus; required to recruit AP-4 to TGN subdomains that sort ATG9A for axonal delivery to presynapses. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43)
- ATG9A: Cargo of the AP-4 pathway; its axonal/presynaptic localization depends on SCAMP5–AP-4 trafficking. Loss of SCAMP5 or AP4M1 KO causes ATG9A accumulation in TGN and reduced presynaptic ATG9A puncta. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
- AP-2 adaptor: Co-immunoprecipitation shows SCAMP5 also associates with AP2M1; functionally linked to SV endocytosis/release-site clearance. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
- NHE6/SLC9A6: Prior work cited by Ryu et al. indicates SCAMP5-dependent recruitment of NHE6 to synaptic vesicles to modulate presynaptic efficacy; SCAMP5 knockdown abolished activity-dependent enhancement of NHE6 recruitment. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43)

5) Effects on synaptic vesicle cycling, autophagy, and membrane protein trafficking
- Quantitative neuronal data (Ryu et al., 2023):
  • ATG9A intensity at TGN (arbitrary units): control ≈ 482; SCAMP5 KD ≈ 1068; AP4M1 KO ≈ 1742 (increased accumulation in TGN). Presynaptic colocalization (Mander’s coefficient with synaptophysin): control ≈ 0.51 vs SCAMP5 KD ≈ 0.29. ATG9A axonal puncta per 50 μm: control ≈ 11.42 vs SCAMP5 KD ≈ 7.14 vs AP4M1 KO ≈ 5.46. mFT-SV2 red/blue ratio (older SV protein accumulation): control ≈ 0.84 vs SCAMP5 KD ≈ 1.53 (impaired turnover). IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)
  • Presynaptic autophagosome formation (EGFP-LC3 puncta) induced by rapamycin or high K+ is significantly reduced upon SCAMP5 knockdown. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23)
- T-type channel trafficking and function (Mustafá et al., 2023): SCAMP5 co-expression nearly abolishes Cav3.1/3.2/3.3 currents by diminishing surface expression; R91W variant preserved downregulation of Cav3.2 yet additionally shifted activation to more hyperpolarized potentials, implying variant-dependent effects on gating when mislocalized to plasma membrane. Channels, June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)

6) Disease associations and translational relevance
- Human genetics and phenotypes: SCAMP5 missense variants (e.g., R91W, G180W) are reported in individuals with severe neurodevelopmental delay and seizures; SCAMP5 deficiency has been associated with pediatric epilepsy and juvenile Parkinson’s disease. Channels, June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)
- Mechanistic links to disease pathways: Impairment of presynaptic autophagy via the SCAMP5–AP-4–ATG9A axis is posited to disturb synaptic proteostasis and SV protein turnover, offering a plausible mechanism for synaptic dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)

7) Recent developments (2023) prioritized and expert perspectives
- Ryu et al., 2023: Identifies a direct molecular link between SCAMP5 and AP-4 at the TGN that is required for presynaptic localization of ATG9A and for presynaptic autophagy. This work provides quantitative evidence connecting SCAMP5 to synaptic proteostasis and positions SCAMP5 as a potential therapeutic target in disorders of presynaptic autophagy. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23)
- Mustafá et al., 2023: Demonstrates that SCAMP5 controls plasma-membrane targeting of Cav3 channels, with disease-linked variants preserving much of the trafficking repression but introducing gating alterations, bridging membrane trafficking regulation to channelopathies. Channels, June 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)

8) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Experimental tools and reagents: Ryu et al. provide constructs (e.g., RFP-ATG9A), validated shRNAs/sgRNAs (AP4M1 target sequence provided), and antibody conditions (e.g., anti-SCAMP5) that can be directly implemented to interrogate presynaptic autophagy pathways in neuronal cultures. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13)
- Assays of synaptic proteostasis: mFT-SV2 “age” reporting and EGFP-LC3–based presynaptic autophagosome quantification are deployable readouts to evaluate SCAMP5-dependent autophagy and SV protein turnover in neurons. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)

9) Synthesis and outlook
- Converging evidence defines SCAMP5 as a presynaptic trafficking organizer with two major mechanistic arms: (i) at the TGN, its N-terminus recruits AP-4 to sort ATG9A for axonal/presynaptic delivery, enabling presynaptic autophagy and maintaining the quality of the synaptic vesicle proteome; and (ii) in secretory/membrane trafficking, it restricts surface expression of T-type channels, with variant-specific effects on gating that may contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability phenotypes. The quantitative neuronal and biophysical data from 2023 studies prioritize SCAMP5 as a key node at the interface of synaptic proteostasis and excitability. IBRO Neuroscience Reports, October 2023; Channels, June 2023. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2023.08.624; https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2230776 (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 43-47, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 8-13, mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 13-17, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 17-23, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 40-43, ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 34-40)

Mandatory verification summary
- Gene symbol and UniProt: SCAMP5 matches UniProt Q8TAC9 (Homo sapiens) and is a SCAMP family member. The literature above consistently studies SCAMP5 in mammalian neurons and directly discusses human variants, aligning with the provided identity constraints. (ryu2023scamp5ap4dependenttrafficking pages 1-8, mustafa2023secretorycarrierassociatedmembrane pages 7-8)
