description: >-
  IL23R encodes the interleukin-23 receptor, the IL-23-specific subunit of
  the heterodimeric IL-23 receptor complex. IL23R pairs with IL12RB1 to form
  the functional receptor for IL-23 (a p19/p40 heterodimeric cytokine).
  IL23R is a single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein containing an N-terminal
  Ig-like domain and two fibronectin type III domains in its extracellular
  region, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic tail bearing
  tyrosine motifs that recruit JAK2 and STAT3. Upon IL-23 binding, the
  receptor activates the JAK2/TYK2-STAT3/STAT4 signaling cascade, with
  predominant STAT3 activation distinguishing IL-23 signaling from IL-12
  signaling. IL23R is expressed on Th17 cells, gamma-delta T cells, group 3
  innate lymphoid cells, NKT cells, and NK cells, where it drives type 17
  immune responses critical for mucosal immunity and defense against
  extracellular pathogens. The R381Q variant (rs11209026) in the cytoplasmic
  domain is strongly protective against inflammatory bowel disease and
  psoriasis, consistent with the causal role of IL-23 signaling in
  autoimmune inflammation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IL23R contributes to IL-12 receptor binding in the sense that IL-23
      shares the p40 subunit with IL-12 and IL23R pairs with IL12RB1 (the
      shared IL-12 receptor chain). The IBA annotation with
      contributes_to qualifier reflects that IL23R is part of a complex
      that engages IL-12-family cytokine receptor components.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The contributes_to qualifier is appropriate. IL23R pairs with IL12RB1
      to form the functional receptor, and IL-23 shares the p40/IL12B
      subunit with IL-12. This means IL23R contributes to a complex that
