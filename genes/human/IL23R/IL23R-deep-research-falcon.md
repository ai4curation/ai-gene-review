## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q5VWK5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-23 receptor; Short=IL-23 receptor; Short=IL-23R; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL23R;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the type I cytokine receptor family. Type 2
- **Key Domains:** FN3_dom. (IPR003961); FN3_sf. (IPR036116); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783); Type1_Cytokine_Rcpt_Type2. (IPR052672)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL23R" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL23R' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL23R** (gene ID: IL23R, UniProt: Q5VWK5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity/domain check: IL23R encodes the human interleukin-23 receptor (UniProt Q5VWK5), a type I single-pass cytokine receptor of the IL-12/IL-23 receptor family. Domain architecture comprises an N-terminal Ig-like domain and fibronectin type III-like cytokine receptor modules, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic tail containing tyrosine motifs for signaling; this conforms with the family/domain annotations provided and confirms we are addressing human IL23R (Homo sapiens) (audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4, audia2024theil23rand pages 1-2).

Research report: IL23R (human) functional annotation

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Receptor composition and ligand recognition: IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine (p19 + p40). Its receptor is a heteromer of IL23R (the IL-23-specific chain) and IL12RB1 (the shared chain with IL-12). IL-23 first engages IL23R via p19, then recruits IL12RB1 through p40 to form the signaling-competent ternary complex (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2) (audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5).
- Subcellular localization: IL23R is a single-pass type I membrane glycoprotein on the plasma membrane of responsive immune cells (audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4, audia2024theil23rand pages 1-2).
- Canonical signaling: IL23R associates with JAK2 and IL12RB1 with TYK2. Ligand engagement triggers JAK2/TYK2 activation and downstream STAT phosphorylation, with predominant activation of STAT3 in IL-23 signaling (contrast: IL-12 signals mainly via STAT4). Resulting transcriptional programs stabilize/expand Th17 and other IL-23-responsive populations (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).
- Cellular expression: IL23R is expressed on Th17 cells and multiple innate-like lymphocytes including γδ T cells, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), and NKT cells; inducible/condition-specific expression is reported in certain myeloid contexts (lay2023useofnanobit pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 8-10, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Preformed receptor assemblies and signaling in living cells: Using NanoBiT/NanoBRET in HEK293 cells, pre-assembled IL23R:IL12RB1 heteromers were detected at the cell surface in the absence of ligand; IL‑23 binding to these preformed complexes induces STAT3 phosphorylation. Artificial high-affinity crosslinking can elicit ligand-independent signaling, underscoring the importance of receptor geometry/avidity (Lay et al., Br J Pharmacol, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.16018) (lay2023useofnanobit pages 1-2).
- Structural insights into the extracellular assemblies: Cryo-EM models of complete extracellular IL-23:receptor assemblies reveal how IL-23 p19 engages IL23R and p40 engages IL12RB1, and how therapeutic antagonists (e.g., ustekinumab or designed binders) sterically disrupt assembly. These structures provide a framework for cytokine-specific antagonism within the IL‑12 family (bioRxiv, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.13.532366) (bloch2024structuresofcomplete pages 20-27).
- Authoritative overview of IL‑23 biology and therapeutics: A 2024 Lancet review synthesizes basic and clinical advances, highlighting IL-23’s dominant role across several IMIDs, the receptor’s JAK2/TYK2 coupling, and clinical data showing high objective response rates with p19 inhibitors, alongside safety similar to placebo across indications (The Lancet, Oct 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01750-1) (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).

3) Primary function and pathways
- Functional role: IL23R is the signaling chain of the IL‑23 receptor complex. Upon IL-23 binding, IL23R:IL12RB1 engagement triggers JAK2/TYK2 activation, predominantly STAT3 signaling, and reinforcement of Th17/IL-23-responsive programs (e.g., IL-17A/F, IL-22), also influencing innate-like lymphocytes (γδ T, ILC3, NKT) (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).
- Pathway placement: IL23R sits upstream of JAK2/TYK2→STAT3/STAT4 (mainly STAT3 for IL-23), integrating microbial and inflammatory cues into effector cytokine production that sustains type 17 immunity (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).

4) Structural and biophysical details
- Domain architecture: N-terminal Ig-like domain plus FNIII-like cytokine receptor modules for ligand binding and receptor assembly; single transmembrane helix; cytosolic tail with tyrosine motifs docking JAKs and STATs (audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).
- Ligand–receptor complex organization: Cryo-EM reconstructions of extracellular assemblies show p19:IL23R and p40:IL12RB1 interfaces and map where approved or experimental antagonists block assembly (bioRxiv 2024; URL above) (bloch2024structuresofcomplete pages 20-27).
- Stoichiometry/dynamics at the cell surface: Pre-assembled IL23R–IL12RB1 heteromers exist prior to ligand addition; high-affinity ligand binding (picomolar by NanoBRET) drives signaling, with receptor crosslinking geometry influencing basal activity (Br J Pharmacol 2023; URL above) (lay2023useofnanobit pages 1-2).

5) Expression, cellular and tissue context
- Immune cell expression: Prominent on Th17 cells; also on γδ T cells, ILC3, and NKT cells; inducible in some myeloid settings. These distributions align with IL‑23’s role in type‑17 immunity at barrier tissues (lay2023useofnanobit pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 8-10, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4).
- Disease-relevant contexts: IL23R+ ILC3s and Th17-lineage responses are enriched in inflamed mucosa and synovium across IMIDs, consistent with clinical efficacy of IL‑23 blockade (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2, audia2024theil23rand pages 8-10).

6) Human genetics and disease association
- Missense variant R381Q (rs11209026): A well-established protective allele for IMIDs, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, with evidence for protection in psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis in multiple populations; mechanistically, it reduces IL‑23R signaling and/or surface expression, dampening IL‑23–dependent IL‑17 production (2025 synthesis; prioritized here for mechanism) (pastras2025targetingtheil23 pages 6-7) (pastras2025targetingtheil23 pages 9-10, audia2024theil23rand pages 8-10, audia2024theil23rand pages 1-2).
- Other IL23R variants: Protective missense G149R (rs76418789) and V362I (rs41313262) that impair trafficking/stability or signaling; 3′ UTR/regulatory variant rs10889677 associated with risk in some ethnicities (e.g., CD in Caucasians, UC in Asians) via increased expression (pastras2025targetingtheil23 pages 9-10, pastras2025targetingtheil23 pages 6-7).
- Disease links: Multiple GWAS and follow-ups implicate IL23R in IBD, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis; convergence on reduced IL‑23R signaling conferring protection across diseases underscores the pathway’s causal role (pastras2025targetingtheil23 pages 6-7, audia2024theil23rand pages 8-10, audia2024theil23rand pages 1-2).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic classes targeting the IL‑23 axis:
  - Anti‑p40 (IL‑12/23) monoclonal antibody: ustekinumab, effective across psoriasis, PsA, and IBD; now complemented or surpassed by p19-selective agents in some settings (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).
  - Anti‑p19 monoclonal antibodies: guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab (dermatology/rheumatology) and mirikizumab, risankizumab, guselkumab (gastroenterology). Lancet 2024 highlights that p19 inhibitors generally show greater efficacy than p40 blockade and, in psoriasis, superiority over TNF inhibitors in achieving high-level responses with extended dosing intervals up to 12 weeks (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).
- Quantitative efficacy and safety (selected 2023–2024 data):
  - Psoriatic arthritis RCT meta-analysis (6 trials; guselkumab/risankizumab/tildrakizumab): ACR-linked musculoskeletal domains improved—resolution of enthesitis RR 1.50 (95% CI 1.34–1.67) and dactylitis RR 1.40 (95% CI 1.22–1.61) vs placebo at ~24 weeks; overall AEs RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.99–1.15), SAEs RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.52–1.15); elevated transaminases increased (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.29–2.23) (Immunologic Research, Feb 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-023-09366-4) (huang2023efficacyandsafety pages 4-8).
  - Across indications, pooled data summarized by The Lancet show objective improvement in >70% of psoriasis patients and up to ~50% in IBD with IL‑23 pathway inhibitors; serious AEs and infections comparable to placebo (The Lancet, Oct 2024; URL above) (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).

8) Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- The Lancet 2024 review positions IL‑23 as a hierarchically dominant cytokine across several IMIDs, explains differences in signaling bias versus IL‑12 (STAT3 vs STAT4 bias), and synthesizes comparative clinical performance and safety of p19 vs p40 agents, including practical considerations such as long dosing intervals and broad efficacy across organ systems (Oct 2024; URL above) (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).

9) Statistics and data highlights
- Psoriatic arthritis: IL‑23 inhibitor RCT meta-analysis—enthesitis RR 1.50 and dactylitis RR 1.40 vs placebo; no increase in SAEs; elevated transaminases RR 1.69 (Immunologic Research, Feb 2023; URL above) (huang2023efficacyandsafety pages 4-8).
- Aggregate cross-indication outcomes: >70% objective improvement in psoriasis and up to ~50% in IBD with IL‑23 blockade; safety similar to placebo (The Lancet, Oct 2024; URL above) (jairath2024il23inhibitionfor pages 1-2).

10) Notes on ambiguity and verification
- The symbol IL23R is unambiguous in this context and maps to the human interleukin‑23 receptor, UniProt Q5VWK5 (Homo sapiens). Domain architecture and receptor family assignment (type I cytokine receptor with Ig-like and FNIII-like domains) in the cited literature match the UniProt description provided, confirming correct target identification (audia2024theil23rand pages 2-5, garciadominguez2025theroleof pages 2-4, audia2024theil23rand pages 1-2).

Limitations
- Some genetics summaries (e.g., specific non‑R381Q variants) derive from 2025 reviews; core mechanisms and clinical data are anchored to 2023–2024 high‑quality sources where available. Future guideline updates and head‑to‑head trials will refine positioning among p19 inhibitors.
