description: >-
  NOVA2 is a neuron- and endothelium-expressed RNA-binding protein that functions
  as a master regulator of alternative
  pre-mRNA splicing. It contains three KH-type RNA-binding domains that recognize
  YCAY (Y=C/U) tetranucleotide motifs
  in pre-mRNAs. NOVA2 acts in the nucleus to regulate co-transcriptional splicing
  with position-dependent rules: binding
  upstream of an exon promotes exon skipping, while binding downstream promotes exon
  inclusion. NOVA2 regulates approximately
  700 target transcripts in brain, with targets enriched in synaptic and neuronal
  genes. Beyond the nervous system, NOVA2
  also functions in endothelium (regulating FLT1/VEGFR1 splicing affecting angiogenesis)
  and in adipose tissue (suppressing
  thermogenesis through alternative splicing programs). Mutations in NOVA2 cause NEDASB,
  a severe neurodevelopmental disorder.
