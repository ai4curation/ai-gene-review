description: HDAC6 is a class IIb cytoplasmic protein deacetylase with unique 
  dual catalytic domains (CD1/CD2) and a C-terminal ZnF-UBP ubiquitin-binding 
  domain. It primarily deacetylates non-histone substrates in the cytoplasm, 
  most notably alpha-tubulin (K40), HSP90, and cortactin. HDAC6 plays a central 
  role in microtubule-dependent cell motility, cilium disassembly, and the 
  aggresome-autophagy pathway for clearing misfolded protein aggregates. The 
  SE14 repeat region mediates cytoplasmic retention, while the ZnF-UBP domain 
  enables binding to polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and their transport 
  via dynein motors to aggresomes for autophagic clearance.

      summary: HDAC6 is predominantly cytoplasmic, where it associates with 
        microtubules and carries out its primary deacetylase functions on 
        tubulin, HSP90, and cortactin [PMID:12024216]. The SE14 repeat region 
        mediates cytoplasmic retention.
