## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UBN7

- **Gene Information:** Name=HDAC6 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10220385, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:14064}; Synonyms=KIAA0901 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10048485}; ORFNames=JM21;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the histone deacetylase family. HD type 2
- **Key Domains:** HDAC_PDAC. (IPR050284); His_deacetylse. (IPR000286); His_deacetylse_dom. (IPR023801); His_deacetylse_dom_sf. (IPR037138); Ureohydrolase_dom_sf. (IPR023696)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HDAC6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HDAC6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HDAC6** (gene ID: HDAC6, UniProt: Q9UBN7) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human HDAC6 (UniProt Q9UBN7)

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Gene/protein identity: HDAC6 is a human class IIb histone deacetylase with two Zn2+-dependent catalytic deacetylase domains (variously termed CD1/DD1 and CD2/DD2), an internal SE14 serine–glutamate repeat region that drives cytoplasmic retention, and a C‑terminal ZnF‑UBP (BUZ) domain that binds unanchored and K63-linked ubiquitin. It possesses NLS/NES signals enabling nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling, but resides predominantly in the cytoplasm. These features match the UniProt Q9UBN7 annotation and distinguish HDAC6 from other HDAC isoforms (class IIb versus IIa/I) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17050620; https://doi.org/10.1111/cbdd.14366; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216548) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 4-6, han2024discussiononstructure pages 7-7, qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4).

Key concepts, enzymatic function, and substrates
- Reaction and specificity: HDAC6 is a Zn2+-dependent lysine deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.-) that primarily targets non-histone substrates in the cytoplasm, most notably α-tubulin at K40, HSP90 (e.g., K294), and cortactin. Deacetylation of α-tubulin regulates microtubule stability and transport; deacetylation of HSP90 modulates chaperone function; deacetylation of cortactin affects actin dynamics and invasion. Additional reported substrates include Ku70, Tau, β‑catenin, survivin, and peroxiredoxins, supporting broad roles in cytoskeleton and stress responses (https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17050620; https://doi.org/10.1111/cbdd.14366; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26031274) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 4-6, han2024discussiononstructure pages 7-7, asaad2025regulationofhdac6 pages 2-4).
- Localization and domains: HDAC6 is mainly cytoplasmic due to SE14‑mediated retention and NES/NLS‑regulated shuttling; domains DD1/DD2 confer deacetylase activity; ZnF‑UBP enables ubiquitin binding; a dynein-motor binding region mediates cargo transport along microtubules to the MTOC (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216548; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112631) (qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4, spallotta2024theroleof pages 14-15).

Pathways and cellular roles
- Cytoskeleton and proteostasis: HDAC6 is a central coordinator of microtubule dynamics and proteostasis. Through ZnF‑UBP and dynein interactions it binds ubiquitinated aggregates and directs them to the MTOC for aggresome formation and autophagic clearance; it regulates HSP90/HSF1 chaperone responses and interacts with the inflammasome machinery (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112631) (spallotta2024theroleof pages 14-15).
- Innate immunity and antiviral signaling: HDAC6 intersects with RIG‑I and cGAS–STING pathways, modulating type I interferon responses. Recent work highlights viral strategies to subvert HDAC6: SARS‑CoV‑2 nucleocapsid (N) protein engages and upregulates HDAC6 to promote replication; swine enteric coronaviruses cleave HDAC6 via nsp5 to blunt its antiviral functions. Reviews synthesize HDAC6’s positive and negative regulatory roles in IFN signaling depending on context (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-024-02460-5; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01814-23; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216548) (mukherjee2024sarscov2nucleocapsidprotein pages 7-10, spallotta2024theroleof pages 18-20, qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4).

Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Structural/chemical biology: Difluoromethyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were reported as slow‑binding substrate-analog inhibitors with unprecedented HDAC6 isoform selectivity, offering a non-hydroxamate avenue with favorable kinetics (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102800) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 4-6).
- Antiviral interface: Primary studies in 2024 showed SARS‑CoV‑2 N protein drives HDAC6 accumulation and interaction with stress granule proteins, facilitating replication, and that multiple swine coronaviruses deploy nsp5 to cleave HDAC6 and disable its deacetylase-mediated antiviral actions (Virology Journal 2024, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-024-02460-5; Journal of Virology 2024, https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01814-23) (mukherjee2024sarscov2nucleocapsidprotein pages 7-10, spallotta2024theroleof pages 18-20).
- PROTACs and target engagement: Reviews and methodological advances in 2024–2025 detail rapid growth of HDAC6-targeted PROTAC degraders and the emergence of live-cell target engagement/degradation assays, enabling systematic evaluation and potentially improved pharmacology compared with occupancy-based inhibition (Theranostics 2024, https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92526) (spallotta2024theroleof pages 18-20).

Current applications and implementations
- Selective HDAC6 inhibitors in the clinic: Ricolinostat (ACY‑1215) and Citarinostat (ACY‑241) have been tested in Phase 1/2 settings. In a Phase Ib/II lymphoma cohort, ricolinostat showed a highly favorable safety profile with predominantly grade 1–2 AEs (diarrhea 57%, nausea 57%, fatigue 43%); no dose‑limiting toxicities were observed. Objective responses were not seen; stable disease occurred in 50% of evaluable patients with median PFS of 56 days (The Oncologist, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13673) (amengual2021firstinclassselectivehdac6 pages 4-5).
- Representative trials and statuses with URLs:
  • NCT02091063 (Ricolinostat in relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies): Status TERMINATED (lack of funding); start 2014; completion 2019; sponsor Columbia University. Record: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02091063 (NCT02091063).
  • NCT01323751 (Ricolinostat ± bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma): Status COMPLETED; enrollment 120. Record: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01323751 (NCT02551185).
  • NCT02632071 (Ricolinostat + nab‑paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer): Status COMPLETED; enrollment 17. Record: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02632071 (NCT02551185).
  • NCT02551185 (Citarinostat + paclitaxel in advanced solid tumors): Status COMPLETED; enrollment 20; start 2015-12-22; completion 2019-10-04; last update 2020-02-26. Record: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02551185 (NCT02551185).

- Translational areas: Oncology (myeloma, lymphomas, and exploratory solid tumors), neurology/neurodegeneration (HDAC6’s cytoskeletal/proteostasis roles), and infectious disease/immunology (context‑dependent modulation of interferon responses and viral restriction) are active domains for HDAC6 targeting (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112631; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216548) (spallotta2024theroleof pages 14-15, qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Synthesis from recent reviews positions HDAC6 as a multifunctional, predominantly cytoplasmic deacetylase that couples cytoskeletal regulation to protein quality control and innate immunity. Domain architecture (DD1/DD2, SE14, ZnF‑UBP) underlies its ability to bind ubiquitin, recruit dynein, and direct aggresome-autophagy processes, while substrate scope (α‑tubulin, HSP90, cortactin) explains effects on transport, chaperoning, and motility. The 2023–2024 literature highlights a nuanced role in antiviral signaling—supporting or restraining IFN pathways depending on context—and documents viral countermeasures that target HDAC6 directly (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216548; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-024-02460-5; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01814-23) (qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4, mukherjee2024sarscov2nucleocapsidprotein pages 7-10, spallotta2024theroleof pages 18-20).

Recent statistics and data
- Clinical safety/efficacy: In relapsed/refractory lymphoma treated with ricolinostat 160 mg BID or QD, grade 1–2 AEs predominated (diarrhea 57%, nausea 57%, fatigue 43%); grade 3–4 anemia and hypercalcemia occurred in 9.5% each; 50% stable disease; median PFS 56 days; study stopped early (https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13673) (amengual2021firstinclassselectivehdac6 pages 4-5).
- Trial-level metadata: ACY‑241 + paclitaxel (NCT02551185) completed with 20 participants; ACY‑1215 studies show mixed statuses (completed/terminated) across myeloma, lymphoma, breast cancer; specific NCT statuses and dates are listed above from ClinicalTrials.gov records (NCT02551185, NCT02091063).

Conclusion
Human HDAC6 (UniProt Q9UBN7) is a class IIb deacetylase whose unique domain composition (DD1/DD2, SE14, ZnF‑UBP) enables cytoplasmic deacetylation of non‑histone substrates (α‑tubulin, HSP90, cortactin) and coupling of cytoskeletal regulation with proteostasis and innate immunity. 2023–2024 studies emphasize its context‑dependent influence on antiviral signaling and document viral strategies that antagonize HDAC6. In the clinic, selective HDAC6 inhibition remains well tolerated but has shown modest single‑agent efficacy; rational combinations and next‑generation chemotypes (slow‑binding selective inhibitors, PROTAC degraders) are active directions. Together, these insights delineate HDAC6’s primary biochemical functions, cellular locales, and translational potential, grounded in recent peer‑reviewed literature and clinical records (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 4-6, han2024discussiononstructure pages 7-7, qu2023histonedeacetylase6’s pages 2-4, asaad2025regulationofhdac6 pages 2-4, spallotta2024theroleof pages 14-15, mukherjee2024sarscov2nucleocapsidprotein pages 7-10, spallotta2024theroleof pages 18-20, amengual2021firstinclassselectivehdac6 pages 4-5, NCT02551185, NCT02091063).
