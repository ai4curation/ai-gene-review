description: >-
  Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is a protein repair enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent
  phosphorylation of fructosamines (Amadori products) on glycated proteins at the 3-position
  of the sugar moiety. This phosphorylation creates an unstable intermediate (fructosamine
  3-phosphate) that spontaneously decomposes to release 3-deoxyglucosone, inorganic phosphate,
  and the regenerated free lysine residue, thereby reversing non-enzymatic glycation. FN3K
  is widely expressed but particularly active in erythrocytes where it participates in
  hemoglobin deglycation. The enzyme can also phosphorylate psicosamines and ribulosamines
  with lower efficiency. FN3K activity is redox-regulated through a P-loop cysteine residue.

      FN3K can phosphorylate ribulosamines (PMID:14633848) but with lower affinity than
      fructosamines. The KM for deoxymorpholinoribulose is 2.6 uM vs 10 uM for DMF.
      However, the primary physiological substrate is fructosamines from glucose glycation.
      FN3KRP is the dedicated ribulosamine kinase. This annotation is technically correct
      but represents a secondary activity.

      hemoglobin intermediate.
    supporting_text: >-
      incubation of human erythrocytes with 200 mM glucose not only caused the progressive
      formation of glycated haemoglobin, but also increased the level of an anionic form
      of haemoglobin containing alkali-labile phosphate, to approx. 5% of total haemoglobin.
  - statement: DMF (FN3K inhibitor) doubled accumulation of glycated hemoglobin but decreased
      phosphorylated form - proving FN3K involvement.
    supporting_text: >-
      1-Deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF), a substrate and competitive inhibitor of
      fructosamine 3-kinase, doubled the rate of accumulation of glycated haemoglobin,
      but markedly decreased the amount of haemoglobin containing alkali-labile phosphate.
  - statement: Removal of DMF caused decrease in glycated hemoglobin and transient increase in
      FN3P-Hb, demonstrating active deglycation cycle.
    supporting_text: >-
      Returning erythrocytes incubated with 200 mM glucose and DMF to a low-glucose medium
      devoid of DMF caused a decrease in the amount of glycated haemoglobin, a transient

      3-deoxyglucosone, and Pi.
    supporting_text: >-
