description: >-
  PLD4 (Phospholipase D family member 4) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein
  that, despite its name, functions as a 5'-to-3' exonuclease rather than a classical
  phospholipase. It is highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, microglia,
  and other myeloid lineage cells. PLD4 localizes to endolysosomes where it degrades
  single-stranded DNA and RNA, thereby limiting activation of nucleic acid-sensing
  Toll-like receptors (TLR7, TLR9) and preventing autoinflammatory responses. Recent
  work (2024) has also demonstrated that PLD4 synthesizes S,S-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate
  (BMP), a key lysosomal lipid essential for lipid catabolism. PLD4 is associated
  with autoimmune disease susceptibility including systemic lupus erythematosus,
  rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic sclerosis.

      Duplicate of IEA annotation. Nuclear localization observed in resting
      microglia with translocation upon activation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is observed in resting cells but PLD4 translocates
      to phagosomes upon activation. The nucleus is not the primary site of
      PLD4's enzymatic activity.

    INCORRECT ANNOTATION - This pathway confuses PLD4 with PLCD4. PLD4 does not
    hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      The Reactome pathway R-HSA-1855214 incorrectly states that PLD4 hydrolyzes
      PI(4,5)P2 to IP3 and DAG. This is a gene symbol confusion with PLCD4
      (Phospholipase C delta 4). PLD4 has no phospholipase C or D activity.

    label: single-stranded DNA 5'-3' DNA exonuclease activity
  description: >-
    PLD4 is a 5'-to-3' exonuclease that degrades single-stranded DNA and RNA from
    their 5' ends. This activity is optimal at acidic pH consistent with
    endolysosomal localization. The enzyme processes nucleic acids that enter
    endolysosomes via phagocytosis or autophagy.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the relative contribution of PLD4's exonuclease activity versus its
    BMP synthase activity to autoimmune disease susceptibility?

- question: >-
    Does PLD4 have RNA exonuclease activity as a distinct GO annotation?

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Determine kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) for PLD4's exonuclease activity on
    DNA versus RNA substrates. This would help distinguish whether DNA or RNA
    degradation is the primary physiological function.

- description: >-
    Characterize BMP levels in immune cells from patients with PLD4 variants
    associated with autoimmune disease. This would help determine whether BMP
    deficiency contributes to autoimmune pathology in humans with PLD4 variants.
