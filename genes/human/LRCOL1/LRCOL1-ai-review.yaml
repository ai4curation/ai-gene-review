description: Leucine-rich colipase-like protein 1 is a small secreted protein (159 AA) containing colipase-like
  domains that functions as a cofactor/activator for lipid-degrading enzymes. The protein contains a signal
  peptide, 18 conserved cysteines forming multiple disulfide bonds, and two internal colipase-like domains
  similar to pancreatic colipase. Unlike pancreatic colipase which is produced by the pancreas, LRCOL1
  is expressed in digestive tissues (small intestine, colon), liver, lymphatic endothelium, and is highly
  enriched in the epididymis (~50-fold). LRCOL1 is predicted to bind lipases and stabilize their activity
  at lipid-water interfaces, facilitating triglyceride hydrolysis in extracellular fluids. Expression
  in the male reproductive tract suggests a potential role in sperm maturation through lipid remodeling.
  The protein is secreted into extracellular spaces (intestinal lumen, lymph, seminal fluid) where it
  acts on lipid substrates. Direct biochemical studies and identification of specific lipase partners
  are still lacking.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: LRCOL1 is expressed in digestive tissues (small intestine, colon in rodents). Predicted to
      function like colipase in facilitating dietary lipid digestion through lipase cofactor activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Supported by expression in digestive tissues and structural homology to pancreatic colipase
      which is central to fat digestion.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: LRCOL1 is predicted to act as a cofactor for lipase enzymes, activating their catalytic activity
      at lipid-water interfaces similar to how colipase activates pancreatic lipase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function inferred from colipase-like domains and expression pattern. Colipase
      proteins are canonical enzyme activators.

    label: lipid catabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: LRCOL1 participates in lipid breakdown by enabling lipase activity. Expression in digestive
      tissues, liver, and epididymis suggests roles in dietary fat digestion and lipid metabolism in multiple
      compartments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Consistent with enzyme activator function and expression in lipid-metabolic tissues.

      lipase activity during triglyceride hydrolysis. LRCOL1 likely serves similar cofactor role.
