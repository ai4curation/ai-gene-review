## Normal Physiological Functions

### Barrier and Lubrication [Perplexity, OpenAI]

- **Hydration**: Maintains surface wetness at mucosal tissues
- **Protection from proteolysis**: Glycosylation protects peptide backbone
- **Mucous pellicle**: Anchors gel-forming mucins like MUC5B

### Pathogen Defense [OpenAI, Perplexity PMID:H. pylori studies]
- **Steric hindrance**: 200-500 nm extension blocks pathogen access to cellular receptors
- **Releasable decoy mechanism**:
  - Pathogens bind to MUC1 glycan epitopes
  - Ectodomain shedding removes bound pathogen from cell surface
  - Demonstrated for *Helicobacter pylori*, *Campylobacter jejuni*
- **Genetic evidence**:
  - Muc1-knockout mice: Increased GI colonization and inflammation (*C. jejuni*, *H. pylori*)
  - Shorter VNTR alleles in humans: Higher risk of *H. pylori*-associated gastritis and cancer
- **Paradox in *P. aeruginosa* infection**: MUC1 suppresses inflammation, leading to reduced early bacterial clearance

### Anti-Adhesive Function [Perplexity, OpenAI]
- **Apical localization in normal epithelia**: Prevents unwanted cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions
- **Steric hindrance**: Bulky glycan chains impede adhesion molecule interactions
- **Regulated by hormones and cytokines**: Dynamic expression in reproductive tissues
- **Implantation**: MUC1 downregulation required for blastocyst attachment

### Inflammation and Immune Regulation [OpenAI PMID:TLR studies, Perplexity]
- **Negative regulator of TLR signaling**:
  - Interacts with TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9
  - **TLR5 mechanism**: MUC1-CT blocks MyD88 recruitment upon flagellin binding
  - **TLR3 mechanism**: MUC1-CT prevents TRIF adapter binding, suppresses IFN-β response
  - Universal attenuator of TLR-mediated inflammation
- **Anti-inflammatory feedback loop**:
  - Upregulated by inflammatory stimuli (TNF-α, pathogen components)
  - Dampens excessive inflammatory response
  - Prevents tissue damage from overzealous immune activation
- **Inflammasome suppression**: Indirectly suppresses IL-1β and IL-18 maturation
- **Balance**: Allows initial pathogen sensing but prevents chronic inflammation

## Oncogenic Functions in Cancer

## Notes on Glycosylation Pathways
Multiple Reactome annotations related to O-glycan biosynthesis:
- These are valid but represent the SUBSTRATE role of MUC1, not its primary molecular function
- MUC1 is modified BY glycosyltransferases, does not PERFORM glycosylation
- Should be marked as NON-CORE or contextual annotations
