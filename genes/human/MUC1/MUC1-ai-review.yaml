description: MUC1 (Mucin-1) is a heavily glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that functions as both a protective barrier at epithelial surfaces and a signaling molecule. In normal epithelia, MUC1 localizes to the apical membrane where it provides lubrication, pathogen defense, and negative regulation of inflammation via TLR signaling suppression. The cytoplasmic tail (MUC1-CT) functions as a signaling scaffold that interacts with multiple growth factor receptors, kinases, and transcription factors. In carcinomas, MUC1 is overexpressed and loses apical polarity, with MUC1-CT translocating to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional coregulator, modulating p53, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways to promote cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis.

  review:
    summary: MUC1 is specifically localized to the apical plasma membrane in normal polarized epithelial cells, which is its primary and defining cellular location. This apical localization is critical for its barrier, lubrication, and pathogen defense functions. Supported by IBA phylogenetic inference and extensive literature documentation. In cancer cells, this polarity is lost and MUC1 appears across the entire cell surface, but the apical membrane remains the core physiological location.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents the primary and most functionally significant cellular localization of MUC1 in normal epithelial cells. Apical membrane localization is essential for all of MUC1's protective barrier functions and is evolutionarily conserved across species.

    summary: The MUC1 ectodomain (N-terminal subunit) extends 200-500 nm into the extracellular space and is also released by ectodomain shedding via ADAM17/TACE cleavage. The shed ectodomain is found in serum (CA 15-3 biomarker) and extracellular fluids. While technically correct, this term is too generic.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While MUC1 does have extensive extracellular presence, this term is too generic. The more specific term "extracellular space" (GO:0005615) better captures the location of shed MUC1 fragments, which is already annotated with experimental evidence (HDA). The membrane-associated extracellular domain is better captured by the plasma membrane annotations.

  original_reference_id: PMID:15710329
  review:
    summary: PMID:15710329 demonstrates that MUC1-CT coactivates p21 gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. MUC1 functions as a transcriptional coregulator that enhances p53-dependent transcription of specific target genes while repressing others (e.g., Bax).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This accurately captures MUC1-CT's role as a transcriptional coregulator that positively regulates specific RNA Pol II-dependent genes. The experimental evidence demonstrates direct chromatin occupancy and transcriptional enhancement. This is a core signaling function of MUC1-CT in the nucleus.

  review:
    summary: Reactome pathway "CHST4 transfers SO4(2-) from PAPS to Core 2 mucins" describes sulfation of MUC1 in the Golgi lumen. MUC1 transits through the Golgi during biosynthesis where it undergoes extensive O-glycosylation and other modifications.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While MUC1 does transit through the Golgi lumen during biosynthesis and post-translational modification, this is not a primary functional location. The Golgi annotations represent MUC1 as a SUBSTRATE for glycosyltransferases rather than MUC1 performing an active function. These are valid but non-core localizations representing transient biosynthetic trafficking.

    summary: PMID:23533145 identified MUC1 in exosomes isolated from expressed prostatic secretions in urine using proteomic analysis. MUC1 is found in extracellular exosomes released from epithelial cells.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: MUC1 is legitimately found in extracellular exosomes, representing shed ectodomain or exosomal secretion. However, this is a consequence of shedding/secretion rather than a core functional location. The biological significance is uncertain - exosomal MUC1 may serve as a biomarker but is not a primary site of MUC1 function.

  original_reference_id: PMID:7698991
  review:
    summary: PMID:7698991 directly demonstrated that MUC1 (Episialin) overexpression inhibits integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components. The large extracellular domain sterically blocks integrin-ECM interactions, creating an anti-adhesive barrier.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core biological function of MUC1 in normal epithelial cells, where apical MUC1 prevents unwanted adhesion. The anti-adhesive function is well-documented and represents a primary physiological role. In cancer, loss of polarity extends this anti-adhesive effect to the entire cell surface, promoting metastasis.

  review:
    summary: PMID:15710329 demonstrates that MUC1 suppresses the p53-dependent apoptotic response to DNA damage while promoting growth arrest. MUC1 coactivates p21 (pro-arrest) but attenuates Bax transcription (pro-apoptotic), thereby blocking intrinsic apoptosis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-documented oncogenic function of MUC1-CT. By modulating p53 target gene selection, MUC1 shifts the cellular response from apoptosis to growth arrest, promoting survival of damaged cells. This is a core cancer-associated function supported by direct experimental evidence.

    summary: PMID:15710329 shows MUC1-CT binds to the p21 promoter (a cis-regulatory region) via association with p53. MUC1-CT also binds the PE21 element to repress TP53 transcription via interaction with KLF4.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: MUC1-CT demonstrates sequence-specific DNA binding activity at RNA Pol II regulatory elements, though this may be mediated through transcription factor partners (p53, NF-κB, β-catenin, KLF4) rather than direct DNA contact. The ChIP evidence supports functional association with specific cis-regulatory sequences. This is a core molecular function for MUC1-CT's transcriptional regulatory role.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of MUC1-CT. Direct p53 binding is central to MUC1's role in DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis suppression. This is well-documented with multiple lines of evidence including co-immunoprecipitation, ChIP, and functional assays.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of MUC1-CT in the nucleus. MUC1-CT does not directly bind DNA alone but functions as a coregulator that modulates the activity of multiple transcription factors. This represents the primary molecular mechanism by which MUC1-CT influences gene expression. Extensively supported by literature.

  review:
    summary: PMID:15710329 shows MUC1-CT represses Bax transcription while coactivating p21, suggesting differential regulation of p53 target genes. MUC1-CT/KLF4 complex also competes for binding to the PE21 element to repress TP53 transcription.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This captures MUC1-CT's ability to negatively regulate specific genes through competitive binding mechanisms. By occupying regulatory elements with transcription factors, MUC1-CT can block access of other regulatory factors or modulate the transcriptional outcome. This is a specific and well-supported regulatory mechanism.

  - statement: MUC1 overexpression inhibits integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix through steric hindrance
    supporting_text: Episialin (MUC1) is a transmembrane molecule with a large mucin-like extracellular domain protruding high above the cell surface. The molecule is located at the apical side of most glandular epithelial cells, whereas in carcinoma cells it is often present at the entire surface and it is frequently expressed in abnormally large quantities. We have previously shown that overexpression of episialin reduces cell-cell interactions. Here we show that the integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix of transfectants of a melanoma cell line (A375), a transformed epithelial cell line (MDCK-ras-e) and a human breast epithelial cell line (HBL-100) is reduced by high levels of episialin.

suggested_experiments:
- description: Determine crystal structure of MUC1-CT in complex with β-catenin and p53 to understand competitive binding and nuclear complex formation
  experiment_type: structural analysis
  hypothesis: MUC1-CT binds β-catenin and p53 through overlapping or adjacent interaction surfaces, and phosphorylation alters binding preferences
- description: Use CRISPR to generate cells with VNTR alleles of defined lengths (e.g., 21, 41, 85, 125 repeats) and measure pathogen binding, shedding efficiency, and TLR signaling suppression
  experiment_type: genetic manipulation
  hypothesis: Longer VNTR alleles provide better pathogen defense through enhanced steric hindrance and releasable decoy function
- description: Perform time-resolved mass spectrometry to map the complete phosphorylation dynamics of MUC1-CT tyrosines upon EGFR, PDGFRB, and Src activation, and correlate with protein interaction changes
  experiment_type: phosphoproteomics
  hypothesis: Different kinases create distinct phosphorylation codes that recruit specific signaling complexes (Grb2 vs β-catenin vs PI3K)
- description: Use proximity labeling (BioID/APEX) to identify the complete MUC1-CT interactome in normal epithelial cells versus cancer cells, comparing apical membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear compartments
  experiment_type: interactomics
  hypothesis: MUC1-CT interactome shifts from structural/trafficking proteins in normal cells to signaling/transcriptional proteins in cancer cells
- description: Measure the effect of specific O-glycosylation patterns (controlled via glycosyltransferase knockout/overexpression) on MUC1 ectodomain shedding kinetics, drug penetration, and immune recognition
  experiment_type: glycobiology
  hypothesis: Aberrant cancer-associated glycosylation (short glycans) accelerates shedding, creates drug resistance barrier, and generates tumor-specific epitopes
- description: Use kidney organoids derived from ADTKD2 patient iPSCs to identify the molecular pathways disrupted by MUC1 frameshift mutations and test therapeutic interventions
  experiment_type: disease modeling
  hypothesis: Mutant MUC1 accumulates in ER causing ER stress and activating fibrotic pathways in tubular epithelial cells
