## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P10599
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Thioredoxin; Short=Trx; AltName: Full=ATL-derived factor; Short=ADF; AltName: Full=Surface-associated sulphydryl protein; Short=SASP; AltName: Allergen=Hom s Trx {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=TXN; Synonyms=TRDX, TRX, TRX1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thioredoxin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Thioredoxin. (IPR005746); Thioredoxin-like_sf. (IPR036249); Thioredoxin_CS. (IPR017937); Thioredoxin_domain. (IPR013766); Thioredoxin (PF00085)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TXN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TXN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TXN** (gene ID: TXN, UniProt: P10599) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# TXN (Thioredoxin-1) – Function, Roles, and Significance

## Gene and Protein Overview  
The **TXN gene** in humans encodes **thioredoxin-1 (Trx1)**, a small (~12 kDa), ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a central role in cellular redox homeostasis ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,as%20neurodegenerative%20and%20cardiovascular%20diseases)). Thioredoxin-1 is characterized by a highly conserved active-site motif **Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys** (at residues Cys32 and Cys35 in the human protein) that directly mediates its redox activity ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,as%20neurodegenerative%20and%20cardiovascular%20diseases)). This protein was originally discovered in *E. coli* in 1964 as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase (the enzyme needed for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20Trx,5)). The human TXN gene product was later independently identified as **“Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor” (ADF)**, a factor secreted by HTLV-I–infected T-cells that could stimulate IL-2 receptor expression ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20Trx,5)). TXN is also known by synonyms **TRX, TRX1, or TRDX**, and it belongs to the **thioredoxin family** of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. Like others in this family, Trx1 adopts the classic **thioredoxin fold** (a four-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices) and contains the signature -Cys-X-X-Cys- active site ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=The%20thioredoxin%20superfamily%20is%20an,are%20involved%20in%20redox%20regulation)). This fold is evolutionarily ancient and is shared by numerous redox proteins such as glutaredoxins, peroxiredoxins, and protein disulfide isomerases ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=The%20thioredoxin%20superfamily%20is%20an,are%20involved%20in%20redox%20regulation)). Consistent with its fundamental role, **thioredoxin-1 is essential for life** – knockout of the TXN gene in mice causes early embryonic lethality ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,13%2C14)), underscoring that Trx1 is *“one of the most important proteins for proper cell and organ function.”* ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20that%20Trx,10%2C66%2C67%2C68%2C69%2C70%2C71%2C72))

## Biochemical Function and Mechanism  
Thioredoxin-1 functions as a **thiol oxidoreductase**, catalyzing dithiol–disulfide exchange reactions that reduce disulfide bonds in target proteins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). In its **reduced** state, Trx1 has two free thiol groups in the Cys32–Cys35 active site. These cysteine thiols can attack disulfide bonds in substrate proteins, forming a transient mixed disulfide and ultimately reducing the substrate (restoring its cysteine thiols) while Trx1 itself becomes **oxidized** (forming an intramolecular Cys32–Cys35 disulfide) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). Through this **reversible oxidation of its active-center dithiol**, Trx1 directly **maintains other proteins’ cysteine residues in a reduced (active) state** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,as%20neurodegenerative%20and%20cardiovascular%20diseases)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). Notably, Trx1’s action **restores the function of proteins inactivated by oxidative disulfide formation**. For example, an important substrate of Trx1 is **peroxiredoxin (Prx)**, an antioxidant enzyme that neutralizes hydrogen peroxide; Trx1 reduces the oxidized disulfide form of Prx, allowing Prx to detoxify additional peroxides ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). In the process of reducing such targets, Trx1 itself is oxidized and must be recycled: the flavoenzyme **thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD1)** uses NADPH to reduce the Trx1 disulfide back to dithiol, completing the **thioredoxin system** redox cycle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). This NADPH-dependent **Trx1/TXNRD1 cycle** provides reducing power to a wide range of cellular processes and complements the glutathione/glutaredoxin antioxidant system ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). Unlike highly substrate-specific enzymes, thioredoxin-1 has **broad substrate specificity**, interacting with numerous proteins that form reversible disulfides. Key biochemical targets include **Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR)** – Trx1 provides electrons to regenerate the active form of RNR during DNA precursor synthesis ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20Trx,5)) – and various metabolic enzymes and transcription factors that contain redox-sensitive cysteine residues ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=maintained%20in%20a%20reduced%20state,13%2C14)). In summary, Trx1’s primary biochemical function is to **act as a general protein disulfide reductase**, maintaining the intracellular environment in a reduced state and thereby protecting proteins from oxidative damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)).

## Cellular Localization and Regulation  
Under normal conditions, thioredoxin-1 is predominantly a **cytosolic** protein, but it is also found in the nucleus and can shuttle between these compartments in response to cellular signals ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=Interacts%20with%20APEX1%3B%20the%20interaction,73%20are)). Trx1 **lacks a classical secretion signal**; however, it can be secreted via a leaderless secretory pathway ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=from%20the%20cytoplasm%20into%20the,regulated%20by%20ionizing)). Experiments have shown that oxidative stress and certain stimuli induce **nuclear translocation** of Trx1. For instance, treatment with phorbol ester (PMA) or exposure to ionizing radiation causes Trx1 to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=Interacts%20with%20APEX1%3B%20the%20interaction,73%20are)). In unstressed cells, Trx1 resides mostly in the cytoplasm, but upon stimuli like UV or gamma-irradiation, a significant fraction relocalizes to the nucleus ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=Interacts%20with%20APEX1%3B%20the%20interaction,Secreted%20by%20a%20leaderless)). This **stress-dependent nuclear accumulation** is thought to facilitate repair of oxidatively damaged DNA and redox regulation of nuclear proteins. Intriguingly, a portion of Trx1 can also be **exported outside the cell** despite no signal peptide; secreted Trx1 has been detected in the extracellular milieu ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=from%20the%20cytoplasm%20into%20the,regulated%20by%20ionizing)). Extracellular Trx1 may act in paracrine or autocrine signaling – historically, ADF/Trx was noted to augment IL-2 receptor (CD25) expression on T-cells ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/66001#:~:text=thereby%20inhibits%20caspase,linked)), and more recent studies show **secreted thioredoxin can modulate inflammation** and cell–cell communication. The activity of Trx1 is tightly regulated by endogenous inhibitors. In particular, **Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP)** binds directly to Trx1 and blocks its active site cysteines ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Studies%20using%20the%20yeast%20two,37%2C38%2C39%2C40)). TXNIP (also called “Vitamin D₃ Up-regulated Protein 1”) forms a mixed disulfide with Trx1’s catalytic cysteine, thereby **inhibiting Trx1’s reductive activity** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Studies%20using%20the%20yeast%20two,37%2C38%2C39%2C40)). This interaction is redox-sensitive: under oxidative conditions TXNIP more readily binds Trx1, serving as a sensor that dampens Trx1 activity when the cell is under reduced stress ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Studies%20using%20the%20yeast%20two,37%2C38%2C39%2C40)). Through TXNIP and other post-translational modifications (for example, Trx1 can be phosphorylated or S-nitrosylated as discussed below), the cell finely **modulates Trx1 activity** to balance the redox state ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=translational%20modifications%20of%20Trx%20include,nitrosylation%2C%20and%20glutathionylation%20%5B31)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Several%20reports%20have%20demonstrated%20that,3)).

## Biological Functions and Pathways  

### Redox Homeostasis and Antioxidant Defense  
Thioredoxin-1 is a **central player in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis**. By keeping proteins in their reduced form, Trx1 protects cells from oxidative stress. One critical pathway is the **detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS)**. Trx1 directly reduces oxidized peroxiredoxins, which in turn convert hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to water ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). In this way, the Trx1 system is crucial for **neutralizing peroxides** and limiting ROS accumulation. Mice lacking components of the thioredoxin system suffer from elevated oxidative damage, highlighting Trx1’s antioxidant role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). Trx1 also helps regenerate other antioxidant enzymes and can reduce oxidized methionine sulfoxide reductases and protein disulfide isomerases, contributing to a broad anti-oxidative network. Notably, **thioredoxin-1 and glutathione** represent two major, complementary antioxidant systems in the cytosol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Role%20of%20thioredoxin%20system%20in,SH%20%3D%20reduced%20form)). Under stress conditions, increased expression or nuclear translocation of Trx1 is observed as a cytoprotective response ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=from%20the%20cytoplasm%20into%20the,73%20are)). **Nitric oxide (NO) signaling** intersects with the Trx1 system as well. Trx1 can carry NO in the form of an S-nitrosothiol on specific cysteine residues (Cys69 or Cys73), and subsequently **trans-nitrosylate target proteins** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Several%20reports%20have%20demonstrated%20that,3)). This reversible S-nitrosylation capacity of Trx1 contributes to redox regulation beyond simple disulfide reduction. For example, Trx1 (when itself S-nitrosylated at Cys69) can **transfer the NO group to caspase-3**, thereby S-nitrosylating and inactivating caspase-3 ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Several%20reports%20have%20demonstrated%20that,3)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=inhibited%20by%20Trx,3%20%5B47%2C62%2C63)). This mechanism provides an additional antioxidant and anti-apoptotic defense: under high NO stress, Trx1 helps prevent excessive cell death by **inhibiting caspase activation via S-nitrosylation** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=inhibited%20by%20Trx,3%20%5B47%2C62%2C63)). In summary, Trx1 is a **key antioxidant** that not only scavenges ROS indirectly (through peroxiredoxin reduction) but also modulates reactive nitrogen species signals and preserves the redox state of critical cysteine proteins. These activities make Trx1 indispensable for resisting oxidative injury in cells.

### DNA Synthesis and Cell Proliferation  
A principal role of thioredoxin-1 is to support DNA synthesis and cell proliferation by supplying reducing equivalents to **ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)**. RNR is the enzyme that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), providing the building blocks for DNA replication. Thioredoxin was in fact first identified as the electron donor required for RNR activity ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=In%201964%2C%20Trx,5)). In its catalytic cycle, RNR generates a disulfide in its R1 subunit (RRM1) that must be reduced for the enzyme to continue operating; Trx1 directly reduces this disulfide, thereby regenerating active RNR and enabling continued dNTP production ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). This function is so critical that cells cannot proliferate without a functional thioredoxin system. Consistent with this, Trx1-null embryos cannot develop ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,13%2C14)), and conditional suppression of Trx1 leads to proliferation arrest due to dNTP depletion. **Recent research (2024)** has underscored the importance of Trx1 for RNR function: a genetic screen identified Trx1 as a key determinant of cancer cell sensitivity to replication stress, because Trx1 loss leads to deficient **redox recycling of RNR** and a drop in deoxynucleotide pools ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). In that study, Trx1 impairment made tumor cells highly susceptible to DNA damage when checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) was inhibited, linking Trx1’s support of DNA synthesis to potential therapeutic strategies ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). Beyond RNR, thioredoxin-1 also contributes to DNA *repair* and cell cycle control. In the nucleus, Trx1 may interact with DNA repair proteins (directly or via redox factor APE1) to facilitate the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA bases ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=case%20of%20infection%2C%20interacts%20with,Secreted%20by%20a%20leaderless)). Moreover, by regulating the activity of transcription factors (described next), Trx1 can influence the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and growth. Overall, Trx1 is vital for cell proliferation as it ensures a sufficient supply of dNTPs and protects genomic integrity during DNA replication.

### Regulation of Transcription Factors and Gene Expression  
Thioredoxin-1 has emerged as an important modulator of **transcription factor activity**, especially for factors that require reduced cysteine residues for DNA binding or activation. Trx1 can influence such factors both directly (through redox changes) and indirectly (through protein–protein interactions). A well-known example is the **AP-1 transcription factor** (a dimer of Fos/Jun). The DNA-binding domains of Fos and Jun contain redox-sensitive cysteines; changes in Trx1’s redox state can enhance AP-1 binding. Experimental studies showed that in cells exposed to ionizing radiation, **oxidation/reduction cycling of Trx1 increases AP-1 (Fos/Jun) DNA-binding activity and boosts AP-1–driven gene expression** ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/66001#:~:text=thereby%20inhibits%20caspase,augments%20the%20expression%20of%20the)). This redox effect on AP-1 is partly mediated by Trx1’s interaction with the **Ref-1 (APE1)** protein, a nucleus enzyme that directly reduces transcription factor cysteines. Trx1 keeps Ref-1 in a reduced, active state, enabling Ref-1 to promote DNA binding of AP-1 and other factors ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=case%20of%20infection%2C%20interacts%20with,Secreted%20by%20a%20leaderless)). **NF-κB** (a master regulator of inflammation) is another transcription factor regulated by the thioredoxin system. NF-κB’s p50 subunit requires a reduced cysteine (Cys62) for DNA binding, and oxidative stress can inactivate NF-κB by oxidizing this residue ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=High%20levels%20of%20oxidative%20stress,This%20oxidized)). Thioredoxin-1 helps maintain the nuclear environment in a reducing state; by facilitating the reduction of p50’s critical cysteine (likely via Ref-1 or direct reduction), **Trx1 ensures NF-κB remains DNA-binding competent in the nucleus** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=High%20levels%20of%20oxidative%20stress,This%20oxidized)). Through such mechanisms, Trx1 can potentiate the transcription of cytokine genes and other stress-response genes when cells are under oxidative challenge. Additionally, Trx1 has been reported to interact with and modulate other transcriptional regulators. For instance, Trx1 can bind to and reduce oxidized **p53 tumor suppressor**, potentially affecting p53’s activity under oxidative stress (p53 contains redox-sensitive cysteines in its DNA-binding domain). Trx1 also regulates the **HIF-1α** (hypoxia-inducible factor) pathway indirectly by controlling cellular redox and the stability of HIF-1α (through prolyl hydroxylase influences). In summary, thioredoxin-1 acts as a **redox switch** for multiple transcription factors, enabling or enhancing their DNA-binding and transcriptional activity under appropriate (reducing) conditions. This places Trx1 upstream of many gene expression programs, including those for **cell growth, inflammatory responses, and stress adaptation** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Thioredoxin,a%20transition%20from%20the%20physiological)).

### Apoptosis and Cell Survival Signaling  
A crucial aspect of Trx1’s function is its role in **regulating apoptosis (programmed cell death)** and stress signaling pathways. Generally, Trx1 exerts an **anti-apoptotic effect**, helping cells survive under stress by modulating key signaling proteins. One of the best-characterized interactions is between Trx1 and **ASK1 (Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1)**, a MAP3K that triggers cell death pathways (through JNK/p38 MAP kinases) in response to stress. In healthy conditions, **reduced Trx1 binds directly to ASK1 and keeps it in an inhibited state** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12089063/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20shown%20that,to%20release)). Trx1 interacts with the N-terminal regulatory region of ASK1, preventing ASK1 activation. However, under oxidative stress or certain death stimuli (e.g. TNF-α signaling), Trx1 itself becomes oxidized (forming a disulfide between Cys32–Cys35), which causes Trx1 to **dissociate from ASK1** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12089063/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20shown%20that,to%20release)). The loss of Trx1 binding permits ASK1 to form active oligomers and initiate the JNK/p38 cascade, leading to apoptosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12089063/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20shown%20that,to%20release)). In essence, Trx1 acts as a redox-sensitive *brake* on a major apoptosis pathway: when Trx1 is reduced, it holds ASK1 inactive, and when Trx1 is oxidized, the brake is released and cell death signaling proceeds. This mechanism is supported by structural studies showing that Trx1 binding to ASK1 masks critical interfaces needed for ASK1 oligomerization ([elifesciences.org](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95199#:~:text=TRX1%20binding%20presumably%20inhibits%20ASK1,sufficiently%20stable%20ASK1%3ATRX1%20complex%20for)). Besides ASK1, thioredoxin-1 influences apoptosis through direct chemical modification of caspases. As described earlier, Trx1 can **trans-nitrosylate procaspase-3 and caspase-3 on their active-site cysteine**, which *inhibits caspase activation and activity* ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=inhibited%20by%20Trx,3%20%5B47%2C62%2C63)). By S-nitrosylating caspase-3 (and reportedly caspase-9 in some studies), Trx1 prevents the execution of apoptosis, especially under conditions of nitrosative stress. Trx1’s anti-apoptotic role is also evident in its effect on mitochondrial integrity: although Trx1 is mostly cytosolic, it can influence the Bcl-2/Bax family balance indirectly via redox signaling, and a mitochondrial isoform (Trx2) directly affects mitochondria-mediated death pathways. Cells with high Trx1 activity tend to resist apoptosis induced by oxidative insults, whereas Trx1 inhibition or depletion makes cells more prone to undergo programmed death. This is one reason why **cancer cells often upregulate Trx1** – to attain greater resistance against oxidative stress and pro-apoptotic signals. Indeed, experimental Trx1 inhibitors trigger cancer cell apoptosis by lifting this redox safety net (more on this in the clinical significance section). Overall, through both **protein–protein interactions (e.g. Trx1–ASK1)** and **redox modifications of apoptosis enzymes (caspases)**, thioredoxin-1 is a pivotal regulator of cell survival during stress.

### Immune Function and Extracellular Role  
While thioredoxin-1 primarily functions inside cells, it also has notable **extracellular and immunomodulatory roles**. Trx1 can be secreted from cells (via an atypical secretion pathway) and has been detected in blood and extracellular fluids ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=from%20the%20cytoplasm%20into%20the,regulated%20by%20ionizing)). Extracellular Trx1 can act as a **cytokine or chemokine-like factor**. The historical example of ADF activity illustrates this: Trx1 added to T-cell cultures **enhanced the expression of the IL-2 receptor (CD25)**, thereby promoting T-cell responsiveness to IL-2 ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/66001#:~:text=thereby%20inhibits%20caspase,linked)). Trx1 has also been reported to chemoattract neutrophils and to suppress HIV-1 virus replication in lymphocytes, suggesting diverse immune impacts (Trx1 can bind or modify extracellular proteins and receptors via its thiol-disulfide exchange activity). In inflammation, **secreted Trx1 may protect tissues from excessive damage** – for instance, it can reduce oxidized extracellular proteins or neutralize extracellular ROS. Clinical studies have found that **blood levels of thioredoxin increase during inflammatory exacerbations**: patients in severe asthma attacks or sepsis have significantly elevated serum Trx1 levels compared to healthy controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11521983/#:~:text=,thioredoxin%20levels%20are%20increased%20in)). This likely reflects an adaptive response, where stressed tissues release Trx1 to bolster antioxidant defenses or modulate immune cells. Notably, Trx1 is considered an **allergen in some contexts**; e.g. human Trx1 can bind IgE in patients with atopic dermatitis who are sensitized to a yeast thioredoxin, suggesting cross-reactivity of immune responses ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP10599#:~:text=for%20nitrosylation%20of%20target%20proteins,colonizing%20yeast%20M.sympodialis.%20Intermediate%20cross)). On cell surfaces, Trx1 has been found associated with membrane proteins, sometimes termed a “surface-associated sulfhydryl protein” that might reduce disulfide bonds in extracellular portions of receptors or adhesion molecules (though these functions are less well-characterized). In summary, beyond its intracellular roles, thioredoxin-1 also participates in **intercellular signaling and immune regulation**. By being secreted and acting on other cells, Trx1 can influence immune **responses, inflammation, and possibly pathogen defense**, extending its functional reach to the extracellular environment.

## Current Research and Developments (2023–2024)  
Given thioredoxin-1’s central importance, it remains an active area of research. **Recent studies (2023–2024)** have provided new insights into Trx1’s functions and potential applications:

- **Link to Replication Stress and Cancer Therapy:** A 2024 study in *Nature Communications* identified Trx1 as a key factor in how cancer cells cope with replication stress ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). Using high-throughput genetic screens, researchers found that Trx1 loss made lung cancer cells much more sensitive to CHK1 inhibitors (drugs that induce replication stress) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). Mechanistically, the absence of Trx1 led to failure in **recycling RNR’s active site** and a subsequent depletion of dNTPs, exaggerating DNA damage in replicating cells ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48076-9#:~:text=strategies%20that%20can%20overcome%20these,mediated%20CHK1i%20sensitivity.%20Further%2C%20the)). This finding underscores Trx1’s role in DNA synthesis and suggests that **inhibiting Trx1 could potentiate certain cancer therapies** by crippling tumor DNA replication. It highlights a current trend of targeting redox vulnerabilities in cancer – the thioredoxin system being a prime candidate.

- **Structural Biology Advances:** In 2023, cryo-EM studies shed light on the Trx1–ASK1 interaction. A *preprint in eLife* reported the structure of the ASK1 kinase and how Trx1 binding produces allosteric changes that prevent ASK1 activation ([elifesciences.org](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95199#:~:text=TRX1%20binding%20presumably%20inhibits%20ASK1,sufficiently%20stable%20ASK1%3ATRX1%20complex%20for)). These structural insights confirm the **model of redox-regulation of ASK1** and may guide the design of peptides or mimetics that modulate the Trx1–ASK1 interface for therapeutic benefit. Understanding the precise binding mechanism (Trx1 likely blocks ASK1 dimerization interfaces) is a notable development for drug discovery in apoptosis-related diseases.

- **Thioredoxin and Aging:** There is growing evidence that the thioredoxin system influences longevity and aging-related diseases. A 2023 review in *Antioxidants (Basel)* highlighted that thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase are **evolutionarily conserved longevity determinants** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Antioxidants,Article)). In model organisms, enhancing thioredoxin expression can extend lifespan under certain conditions, presumably by mitigating age-associated oxidative damage. Mouse studies show only modest lifespan extension with Trx1 overexpression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9049237/#:~:text=age,these%20studies%20indicate%20that%20Trx)), but they confirm that oxidative stress resistance is improved. Ongoing 2023 research is examining Trx1’s role in age-related pathologies (e.g. neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases) and whether boosting the Trx system can ameliorate such conditions ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20modulation%20of%20Trx%20gene,potential%20function%20as%20a%20biomarker)). Conversely, chronic high Trx1 activity may have trade-offs (e.g. possibly higher cancer incidence in aged Trx1 transgenic mice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9049237/#:~:text=age,these%20studies%20indicate%20that%20Trx))), so current research is dissecting these complex effects.

- **Post-translational Modifications and Regulation:** Cutting-edge studies are also exploring how Trx1 is regulated by modifications. For instance, research in 2023 has detailed how **S-nitrosylation at specific cysteine residues (Cys69, Cys73)** alters Trx1’s structure and function ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Several%20reports%20have%20demonstrated%20that,3)). One report showed that Cys69 S-nitrosylation is *required* for Trx1 to trans-nitrosylate caspase-3 ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Several%20reports%20have%20demonstrated%20that,3)), revealing a finely tuned mechanism of signal transduction via Trx1. Other work is mapping Trx1 phosphorylation sites (e.g. Thr100) and acetylation, which may affect its interaction with binding partners or its subcellular localization ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=translational%20modifications%20of%20Trx%20include,nitrosylation%2C%20and%20glutathionylation%20%5B31)). These studies use advanced proteomics and imaging to understand Trx1 regulation in real time within living cells (an example being real-time redox sensors that track Trx1 oxidation state). Such 2023 advancements provide a **richer picture of Trx1’s regulation** in physiological vs. stress conditions.

- **Biotechnological and Diagnostic Developments:** Thioredoxin’s unique properties are being harnessed in biotechnology. For example, engineered Trx1 fusions are used to enhance the folding of disulfide-containing proteins in E. coli expression systems. In diagnostics, new assays to measure **Trx1 redox state** are under development, aiming to use the ratio of oxidized to reduced Trx1 as a sensitive indicator of cellular oxidative stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10135697/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Antioxidants,Article)). Researchers in 2023 have also investigated **serum Trx1 as a biomarker** for diseases like stroke and cancer. A 2023 clinical study found correlations between high serum Trx1 and worse outcomes in ischemic stroke patients ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28828929/#:~:text=Prognostic%20value%20of%20serum%20thioredoxin,that%20Trx%20is%20a%20potent)), aligning with earlier reports of Trx1 as a general stress marker. Overall, current research is expanding both our fundamental understanding of Trx1 and its practical applications in medicine and technology.

## Clinical Significance and Applications  
Thioredoxin-1’s pivotal role in cell survival and proliferation makes it highly relevant in various diseases, especially **cancer** and chronic inflammatory conditions. Many tumors show **elevated Trx1 expression**, which is often associated with more aggressive growth and therapy resistance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1432091/#:~:text=human%20tumors%2C%20where%20it%20is,12%20treatment%20significantly%20lowered)). Cancer cells benefit from high Trx1 levels to combat the elevated oxidative stress of the tumor microenvironment and to support rapid DNA synthesis. Clinically, **high Trx1 levels have been correlated with poor prognosis** in certain cancers ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=%28Figure%202%29%20%5B6%2C7%2C8%2C9%5D.%20Moreover%2C%20Trx,for%20disease%20treatment%20and%20prevention)). Moreover, Trx1 is actively secreted by tumor cells and can be detected in the blood; one study found that cancer patients had on average ~182 ng/mL of Trx1 in plasma versus ~27 ng/mL in healthy individuals (a seven-fold increase) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1432091/#:~:text=human%20tumors%2C%20where%20it%20is,12%20treatment%20significantly%20lowered)). Trx1 may also promote tumor angiogenesis by increasing the activity of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) – indeed, Trx1 can upregulate HIF-1 targets under some conditions, indirectly boosting VEGF production. These insights have driven efforts to **target the thioredoxin system in cancer therapy**. Small-molecule inhibitors of Trx1 or TrxR are being explored as anti-cancer agents. One example is **PX-12 (1-methylpropyl-2-imidazolyl disulfide)**, an irreversible Trx1 inhibitor that was tested in phase I clinical trials ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1432091/#:~:text=human%20tumors%2C%20where%20it%20is,12%20treatment%20significantly%20lowered)). PX-12 was shown to lower tumor intracellular Trx1 levels and even reduced circulating Trx1 and VEGF concentrations in patients, demonstrating on-target activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1432091/#:~:text=human%20tumors%2C%20where%20it%20is,12%20treatment%20significantly%20lowered)). Although PX-12’s clinical development encountered challenges (toxicity and limited efficacy as a single agent), this line of therapy remains of interest, and improved Trx1/TXNRD inhibitors (including analogues and redox-active gold compounds like **auranofin**) are under investigation. The rationale is that **blocking Trx1 forces cancer cells into oxidative distress and apoptosis**, or sensitizes them to chemo/radiotherapy that induces ROS. Recent preclinical findings support combining Trx system inhibitors with DNA-damaging treatments to achieve synergistic cancer cell kill ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=interacts%20with%20Trx%20and%2C%20thereby%2C,and%20radiotherapy%20might%20ameliorate%20clinical)).

Aside from cancer, thioredoxin-1 has implications in other diseases. In diseases with excessive inflammation or autoimmunity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, or severe asthma, Trx1 levels are often found elevated, likely as a countermeasure to inflammation-induced oxidative stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11521983/#:~:text=,thioredoxin%20levels%20are%20increased%20in)). In sepsis and acute lung injury, patients can have dramatically higher plasma Trx1, and these levels have been proposed as a **biomarker for disease severity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11521983/#:~:text=,thioredoxin%20levels%20are%20increased%20in)). For example, measuring serum Trx1 might help gauge the oxidative stress burden in critical illness or predict outcomes (some studies in sepsis suggest higher Trx1 portends greater organ failure) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11521983/#:~:text=,thioredoxin%20levels%20are%20increased%20in)). In metabolic diseases like diabetes, Trx1’s role intersects with redox-sensitive signaling; high glucose can induce TXNIP, which then inhibits Trx1 and contributes to oxidative damage in tissues – a pathway under study for diabetic complications. There is also interest in **thioredoxin as a therapeutic protein**: recombinant human thioredoxin-1 has been tested in models of cardiac ischemia and neurodegeneration, where delivering extra Trx1 can protect tissues from ischemic or oxidative injury. However, translating this to clinics is complex due to Trx1’s pleiotropic effects and short half-life in circulation.

From an expert perspective, there is a consensus that **proper regulation of the Trx1 system is crucial for health**, and its dysregulation is a common thread in many pathologies ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20that%20Trx,10%2C66%2C67%2C68%2C69%2C70%2C71%2C72)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20modulation%20of%20Trx%20gene,potential%20function%20as%20a%20biomarker)). As one recent review summarizes, alterations in Trx1 activity or expression can tip the balance from normal physiology to disease states such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or cardiovascular disease ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20modulation%20of%20Trx%20gene,potential%20function%20as%20a%20biomarker)). On the positive side, bolstering Trx1-mediated defenses is seen as beneficial against aging and degenerative diseases, whereas dampening an overactive Trx1 (as in tumors) is a promising treatment strategy. Clinical trials are ongoing to better define Trx1’s utility as a **biomarker** and to test **Trx system modulators** in diseases. Notably, thioredoxin-1 itself has been proposed as a **drug target, antioxidant therapy, and disease marker all in one** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11521983/#:~:text=,37)), reflecting its multifaceted importance. 

## Conclusion  
In summary, the human TXN gene encodes thioredoxin-1, a **master regulator of cellular redox balance** and a facilitator of many vital processes. Trx1’s primary function is to **reduce disulfide bonds in proteins**, using its Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys active site to keep other proteins (enzymes, transcription factors, signaling molecules) in their functional reduced states. Through this activity, Trx1 supports **DNA synthesis**, defends against **oxidative stress**, and governs **signals for cell growth and survival**. It operates in the cytosol, shuttles to the nucleus under stress, and even acts outside the cell in certain contexts. **Biologically, thioredoxin-1 is indispensable** – it is required for embryonic development and for the survival of virtually all cell types ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Trx,13%2C14)). Its influence extends from controlling the cell’s redox environment and metabolic flux to fine-tuning the immune response and apoptosis. Recent research continues to unveil new dimensions of Trx1’s role, from aging to cancer therapy, reinforcing that Trx1 sits at a nexus of redox-regulated pathways. As a result, thioredoxin-1 is not only a fundamental biochemical catalyst but also a potential **therapeutic pivot**: scientists and clinicians are leveraging knowledge about Trx1 to develop redox-based interventions and to use Trx1 levels as an indicator of disease states. In the words of experts, **thioredoxin-1 is a multitasking protein crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis** ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=Thioredoxin,a%20transition%20from%20the%20physiological)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/5/1078#:~:text=It%20is%20known%20that%20Trx,10%2C66%2C67%2C68%2C69%2C70%2C71%2C72)). Ongoing studies and clinical efforts aimed at the thioredoxin system hold promise for novel antioxidant therapies and for improving outcomes in diseases where redox imbalance is a key player. The current understanding of TXN/Trx1, grounded in decades of research and bolstered by the latest findings, underscores its role as a linchpin of cellular function and a continuing focus in biomedical science.
