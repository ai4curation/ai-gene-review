description: >-
  Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is a small (~12 kDa) ubiquitous oxidoreductase that plays a central role in
  cellular redox homeostasis. The protein contains the conserved active site motif CGPC (Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35)
  within a canonical thioredoxin fold, enabling it to catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions.
  The catalytic mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by Cys32 on substrate disulfide bonds, forming
  a mixed disulfide intermediate that is resolved by Cys35, releasing the reduced substrate while
  forming an intramolecular disulfide in Trx1. The oxidized Trx1 is regenerated by thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR1) using NADPH. Major physiological substrates include peroxiredoxins (for H2O2 detoxification),
  ribonucleotide reductase (for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis), and oxidized protein tyrosine phosphatases.
  Beyond its catalytic function, Trx1 regulates transcription factors including AP-1 and NF-kB via
  interaction with APE1/Ref-1, and modulates apoptosis by binding ASK1 in its reduced state. Trx1 also
  serves as a nitrosothiol carrier, with Cys73 capable of S-nitrosylation and transnitrosation of
  target proteins like caspase-3. The protein is predominantly cytosolic but translocates to the nucleus
  upon cellular stress, and is also secreted via a leaderless pathway where it exhibits cytokine-like
  properties and can modulate cell surface receptors like CD30.
