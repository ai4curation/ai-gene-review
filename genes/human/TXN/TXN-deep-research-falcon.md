## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P10599
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Thioredoxin; Short=Trx; AltName: Full=ATL-derived factor; Short=ADF; AltName: Full=Surface-associated sulphydryl protein; Short=SASP; AltName: Allergen=Hom s Trx {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=TXN; Synonyms=TRDX, TRX, TRX1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thioredoxin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Thioredoxin. (IPR005746); Thioredoxin-like_sf. (IPR036249); Thioredoxin_CS. (IPR017937); Thioredoxin_domain. (IPR013766); Thioredoxin (PF00085)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TXN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TXN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TXN** (gene ID: TXN, UniProt: P10599) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update: Identity verified and evidence gathered from recent peer-reviewed sources (2023–2024) with supplemental mechanistic reviews. The gene symbol TXN (also known as TRX, TRX1) corresponds to human thioredoxin-1 (UniProt P10599), a canonical member of the thioredoxin family with the conserved redox-active motif Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (CGPC) and thioredoxin fold; organism is Homo sapiens. The following report synthesizes current knowledge with emphasis on 2023–2024 developments and includes URLs and publication dates where available (citations given as context IDs).

Comprehensive Research Report: Human TXN (Thioredoxin-1; UniProt P10599)

1) Key concepts and definitions; catalytic mechanism and substrates
- Definition and family: Thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is a ~12 kDa oxidoreductase of the thioredoxin family that maintains protein cysteines in reduced states and transduces redox signals. It contains a conserved active-site CGPC motif within the thioredoxin fold (five β-strands/four α-helices), defining its dithiol–disulfide exchange activity (Antioxidants; published 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 16-18).
- Catalytic mechanism: Trx1 reduces disulfide bonds via a two-step nucleophilic substitution: Cys32 attacks the substrate disulfide to form a mixed disulfide intermediate, and Cys35 resolves it to release the reduced substrate while forming the Cys32–Cys35 intramolecular disulfide in Trx1; thioredoxin reductase (TrxR, an NADPH/FAD-dependent enzyme) then reduces Trx1 back to its dithiol state (Antioxidants; 2023 review synthesizing mechanism with underlying primary literature; 26 Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040944) (alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4).
- Physiologic substrates and partners: Major substrates include peroxiredoxins (for H2O2 detoxification and signaling), ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and diverse transcription factors and signaling proteins whose cysteines govern activity; Trx1 is kept reduced by cytosolic TrxR1 using NADPH (Antioxidants 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078; Antioxidants 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040944) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4).
- Regulatory cysteines and PTMs: In addition to the catalytic Cys32/Cys35, human Trx1 contains noncatalytic Cys62, Cys69, and Cys73 that undergo redox PTMs (e.g., S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation) influencing function and interactions (Molecular Medicine Reports; online ahead 2025; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13737) (wang2026involvementofthe pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024): structure, signaling, ferroptosis, ion channel regulation, ER redox localization
- Structural and mechanistic consolidations: Recent reviews reaffirm Trx1’s CGPC active site and system components (Trx/TrxR/NADPH), connecting structural motif to oxidoreductase function and therapeutic interest, especially in cancer where elevated ROS enhances reliance on the Trx system (Antioxidants; 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2).
- ASK1 redox signaling: Contemporary syntheses highlight Trx1’s inhibitory interaction with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Under basal conditions reduced Trx1 binds ASK1 and suppresses its activation; oxidative stress or TXNIP disrupts Trx1–ASK1, enabling JNK/p38 MAPK signaling and apoptosis (Antioxidants; 26 Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040944) (alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4).
- Ferroptosis/autophagy cross-talk: The thioredoxin system is increasingly linked to regulated cell death. A 2025 review (synthesizing recent primary data) concludes Trx1 generally inhibits ferroptosis and apoptosis, while TXNIP promotes them, integrating Trx/TXNIP with autophagy–ferroptosis crosstalk (Molecular Medicine Reports; Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13737) (wang2026involvementofthe pages 1-2).
- ER redox compartmentalization: New work emphasizes that thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase activity is largely absent from the ER lumen in mammalian cells, explaining parallel existence of a reduced pyridine nucleotide pool with an oxidizing protein-disulfide pool necessary for oxidative folding; mislocalization of Trx1/TrxR1 to ER lumen can be cytotoxic (2024 review synthesis) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2).

3) Cellular and extracellular localization; regulation (including secretion, nuclear roles, TXNIP)
- Subcellular distribution: Trx1 is predominantly cytosolic but also traffics to the nucleus and can appear extracellularly; distinct isoforms include mitochondrial Trx2 (TXN2). Gene regulation of TXN involves ubiquitous promoter elements and stress-responsive ARE/Nrf2 input (synthesis of primary literature) (shcholok2023examinationofcellular pages 24-29).
- Secretion and extracellular roles: Trx1 can be secreted via leaderless pathways (e.g., by immune cells), and a truncated extracellular form (Trx80) has been described, suggesting paracrine immunomodulatory roles (review synthesis, 2023) (shcholok2023examinationofcellular pages 24-29).
- Nuclear functions: Trx1 reduces critical cysteines in transcriptional regulators either directly or via APE1/Ref-1, thereby modulating DNA-binding activity of factors such as NF-κB and AP‑1; this connects cellular redox to gene expression programs (2023 review) (alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 14-15, alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4).
- Regulation by TXNIP: TXNIP (VDUP1) forms inhibitory mixed disulfide complexes with Trx1, suppressing Trx1 reductase activity and freeing ASK1 to activate stress MAPKs; TXNIP expression increases with hyperglycemic cues and ER stress, linking metabolism to redox signaling (Metabolites; 13 May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo15060351) (kokkinopoulou2025thioredoxininteractingprotein(txnip) pages 2-5).

4) Pathway integration: peroxiredoxins, RNR, and APE1/Ref-1-dependent transcription
- Peroxiredoxin cycle: Trx1 reduces oxidized peroxiredoxins (Prx-S2), enabling H2O2 detoxification and redox relay signaling; TrxR1 sustains Trx1 in its active dithiol state with NADPH (Antioxidants; 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2).
- DNA synthesis: Trx1 serves as an electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), supporting deoxyribonucleotide production for DNA replication/repair; this underlies links between Trx1 activity and cell-cycle progression (Antioxidants; 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2).
- Redox control of transcription: Through direct reduction and APE1/Ref-1-dependent redox regulation, Trx1 influences NF‑κB and AP-1 DNA binding and downstream inflammatory/antioxidant programs (2023 overview) (alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 14-15).

5) Applications and translational relevance; expert opinions; recent statistics/data
- Cancer biology and targeting: Tumors’ high ROS burdens create dependency on the Trx system for redox homeostasis and signaling; reviews argue this makes Trx/TrxR an attractive therapeutic axis, with multiple chemical classes (e.g., electrophiles) targeting selenocysteine in TrxR and perturbing Trx1-dependent networks (Antioxidants; 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 16-18).
- Therapeutic combinations and synthetic lethalities: Integrative analyses emphasize that inhibiting the Trx system can sensitize cancer cells to replication stress and oxidative damage by limiting RNR reduction and Prx recycling; expert opinion in 2024 reviews suggests combining Trx/TrxR inhibitors with agents that elevate ROS or induce replication stress (Antioxidants; 4 Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13091078) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 16-18).
- Systems and disease breadth: Contemporary reviews connect Trx1/TXNIP axis to cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases via modulation of ASK1, inflammasome activation, and mitochondrial redox crosstalk, highlighting biomarker and therapeutic opportunities (Antioxidants; 26 Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12040944; Metabolites; 13 May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo15060351) (alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4, kokkinopoulou2025thioredoxininteractingprotein(txnip) pages 2-5).

Gene/protein identity verification and domain alignment
- The gene symbol TXN unambiguously refers to human thioredoxin-1 (UniProt P10599), a thioredoxin family member with the hallmark CGPC catalytic motif and thioredoxin fold; sources above are specific to Homo sapiens Trx1 and its mammalian system (Antioxidants 2024; Antioxidants 2023) (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4).

Notes on limitations and open questions
- While the 2023–2024 literature robustly supports TXN’s catalytic mechanism, peroxiredoxin/RNR roles, and ASK1 pathway regulation, finer-grained 2024 structural insights (e.g., cryo‑EM of ASK1 complexes), ER-lumen exclusion experiments, and ion-channel redox regulation advances are primarily consolidated in reviews rather than fully detailed here due to source availability constraints in the present evidence set (seitz2024exploringthethioredoxin pages 1-2, alokda2023evolutionarilyconservedrole pages 2-4). Where 2025 reviews are cited (TXNIP–ferroptosis/autophagy), they synthesize late‑2023/2024 primary literature but should be cross-validated with the underlying studies for application-specific decisions (wang2026involvementofthe pages 1-2, kokkinopoulou2025thioredoxininteractingprotein(txnip) pages 2-5).
