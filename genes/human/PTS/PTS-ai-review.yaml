description: 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) is a Zn2+-dependent 
  lyase that catalyzes the second step in de novo tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
  biosynthesis, converting 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (DHNTP) to 
  6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6-PTP). The enzyme functions as a 
  homohexamer (two trimers in head-to-head fashion) with active sites at subunit
  interfaces containing an intersubunit Cys-Asp-His catalytic triad. 
  Phosphorylation at Ser-19 by cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKG2) is 
  required for maximal enzyme activity. PTPS is primarily a cytosolic enzyme and
  is part of the GCH1-PTS-SPR pathway that supplies BH4, an essential cofactor 
  for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (PAH, TH, TPH1/2), nitric oxide synthases
  (NOS1/2/3), and alkylglycerol monooxygenase. Biallelic loss-of-function 
  mutations cause PTPS deficiency (OMIM 261640), a form of BH4-deficient 
  hyperphenylalaninemia with central neurotransmitter deficiency leading to 
  progressive cognitive and motor deficits if untreated.

    description: PTS catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin 
      triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (EC 4.2.3.12). This is
      supported by biochemical characterization showing a Km of 8.1 uM for DHNTP
      and Vmax of 120 nmol/min/mg (PMID:10531334). The enzyme requires Zn2+ 
      coordination at the active site and phosphorylation at Ser-19 for full 
      activity. This represents the core molecular function of the enzyme.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: PTPS catalytic activity is the core molecular function of this 
        enzyme, well-supported by phylogenetic analysis (IBA) from PANTHER 
        family PTN000287347 which includes orthologs from mouse, rat, C. 
        elegans, and Dictyostelium. This is consistent with the deep research 
        review describing PTPS as a Zn2+-dependent lyase that converts 
        7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin
        (Werner et al. 2011).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation correctly captures the core enzymatic function 
        of PTPS. This activity is extensively documented in biochemical 
        literature and represents the defining function of the enzyme. UniProt 
        confirms EC 4.2.3.12 classification and the catalytic activity details.

    review:
      summary: PTPS involvement in BH4 biosynthesis is well-established through 
        phylogenetic analysis. The enzyme catalyzes the second step in the de 
        novo BH4 biosynthetic pathway (GCH1 -> PTS -> SPR), providing BH4 as an 
        essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide
        synthases (Werner et al. 2011).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation correctly identifies the core biological process 
        for PTPS. BH4 biosynthesis is the primary pathway in which PTPS 
        functions, and deficiency causes BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia 
        (OMIM 261640).

    review:
      summary: The mitochondrial localization is supported by IBA from 
        phylogenetic analysis. However, the primary localization literature 
        describes PTPS as a soluble cytosolic enzyme. The deep research review 
        states PTPS is a "soluble cytosolic enzyme functioning within the 
        cytosolic de novo BH4 synthesis machinery." Some mitochondrial 
        localization may exist but cytosol is the primary site.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While there is evidence for mitochondrial localization (also 
        supported by IDA from LIFEdb), the primary functional localization of 
        PTPS is cytosolic where BH4 biosynthesis occurs. Mitochondrial 
        localization may represent secondary localization or experimental 
        detection but is not the primary site of function.

    review:
      summary: This annotation references a 1987 clinical study of PTPS 
        deficiency that established the enzymatic defect in patients with 
        hyperphenylalaninemia due to biopterin synthesis deficiency. The paper 
        characterized erythrocyte PTS activity and demonstrated "less than 10% 
        of normal" activity in affected individuals.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The study provides clinical evidence supporting PTPS as the 
        deficient enzyme in this form of hyperphenylalaninemia, confirming the 
        enzymatic function.

          supporting_text: The deficient enzyme in these subjects is 6-pyruvoyl 
            tetrahydropterin synthase (PTS). Erythrocyte activity of PTS in 
            homozygotes (or compound heterozygotes) is less than 10% of normal.

    review:
      summary: PTPS deficiency leads to impaired phenylalanine metabolism 
        (hyperphenylalaninemia) because BH4 is required as a cofactor for 
        phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). However, PTPS itself does not directly 
        metabolize amino acids - it produces the BH4 cofactor.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While PTPS deficiency affects amino acid metabolism (especially 
        phenylalanine via PAH), this is an indirect effect. The primary function
        is BH4 biosynthesis. The term is not wrong but represents downstream 
        physiological consequences rather than the direct biological process of 
        PTPS.

    review:
      summary: The study demonstrates that PTPS deficiency causes impaired 
        biopterin synthesis. Patients had deficient biopterin synthesis and 
        treatment with oral tetrahydropterin restored function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The clinical study provides evidence that PTPS is essential for 
        BH4 (biopterin) biosynthesis.

    review:
      summary: PTPS deficiency leads to impaired CNS development due to 
        deficiency of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) that require BH4 
        as a cofactor for their biosynthesis. The paper notes "Impaired 
        development was apparent at 3 months in one proband not treated early" 
        and that treatment "maintained or improved CNS function."
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While PTPS deficiency clearly affects CNS development, this is an 
        indirect downstream effect of impaired neurotransmitter biosynthesis due
        to BH4 deficiency. PTPS itself is not directly involved in CNS 
        developmental processes; rather, its product BH4 is required for 
        tyrosine hydroxylase (dopamine) and tryptophan hydroxylase (serotonin). 
        This is a pleiotropic disease phenotype rather than a core function.

            proband not treated early. Treatment with oral tetrahydropterin 
            restored adequate phenylalanine hydroxylase activity; it also 
            maintained or improved CNS function.
