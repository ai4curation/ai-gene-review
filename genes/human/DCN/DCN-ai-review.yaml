description: 'Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP, 359 amino acids) consisting of a core protein (~40 kDa) with 12 leucine-rich repeats and a single attached chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chain at Ser-34. Decorin plays two critical core functions in the extracellular matrix: (1) regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis, where it binds to collagen types I, II, III, and VI fibrils via its LRR domain to control fibril diameter, spacing, and assembly kinetics, and (2) sequestration and negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling, where it binds all three TGF-beta isoforms in the ECM to diminish their biological activity and exert anti-fibrotic effects. Additionally, decorin binds and modulates receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, VEGFR2, and Met, triggering receptor internalization, autophagy induction in endothelial cells via Peg3, and suppression of angiogenesis. Decorin also binds fibronectin, thrombospondin-1, and other ECM components. The protein is secreted and localized to the extracellular matrix, with transient presence in Golgi lumen during biosynthesis and GAG chain modification. Decorin deficiency causes congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD), highlighting its essential role in collagen organization and tissue architecture.'

    summary: Decorin is a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan. IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference correctly captures decorin's localization to extracellular space where it performs its core functions in collagen fibril organization and TGF-beta sequestration.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core cellular component annotation supported by extensive experimental evidence (UniProt CC line "Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular matrix"), IBA phylogenetic inference, and multiple proteomic studies. Decorin functions exclusively in the extracellular space.

  review:
    summary: Decorin itself is a proteoglycan containing a GAG chain, and may have self-association properties. However, the primary molecular function is collagen binding and TGF-beta binding rather than GAG binding per se.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While decorin has a GAG chain (dermatan/chondroitin sulfate) attached, GAG binding is not a prominently reported molecular function. The annotation likely derives from domain-based inference (IEA from Ensembl) but decorin's core functions are collagen binding and growth factor binding, not GAG binding. May reflect some self-association or interaction with other proteoglycans, but this is not well-documented as a primary function.

    reason: Well-supported experimental finding (IDA) from PMID:23798385. Decorin binding to VEGFR2 on endothelial cells triggers Peg3-dependent autophagy and angiogenesis suppression. However, this is a downstream consequence of decorin's receptor binding activity in specific cell types (endothelial cells) rather than a core function.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Correct annotation from PMID:7961765 studying murine decorin expression during development. Decorin is expressed during organ morphogenesis and tissue differentiation. However, this is a developmental/tissue-specific process rather than decorin's core molecular/cellular function. Decorin's core functions are collagen fibril organization and TGF-beta sequestration.
