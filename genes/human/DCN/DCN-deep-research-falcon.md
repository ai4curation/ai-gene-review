## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P07585
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Decorin; AltName: Full=Bone proteoglycan II; AltName: Full=PG-S2; AltName: Full=PG40; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DCN; Synonyms=SLRR1B;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP)
- **Key Domains:** Leu-rich_rpt. (IPR001611); Leu-rich_rpt_typical-subtyp. (IPR003591); LRR_dom_sf. (IPR032675); LRRNT. (IPR000372); SLRP. (IPR050333)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DCN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DCN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DCN** (gene ID: DCN, UniProt: P07585) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status and verification
We verified the target gene/protein identity. DCN encodes human decorin (UniProt P07585), a class I small leucine‑rich proteoglycan (SLRP) bearing an N‑terminal dermatan/chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain on a leucine‑rich repeat (LRR) core; it localizes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and pericellular space. This aligns with recent reviews and primary literature focused on human tissues and disease contexts (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2, patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13).

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and structure: Decorin is a secreted ECM proteoglycan with a ~40 kDa core protein comprising an N‑terminal signal and pro‑peptide, a cysteine‑rich N terminus carrying a single GAG chain (usually dermatan sulfate, sometimes chondroitin sulfate), 10–12 central LRRs that mediate ligand binding, and a C‑terminal cysteine‑containing region; it can exist in ECM as a soluble or matrix‑bound species (frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34, rao2025researchprogresson pages 1-2). Functionally, decorin is an archetypal SLRP that regulates matrix assembly, growth factor bioavailability, and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34, rao2025researchprogresson pages 1-2).
- Localization: Decorin is synthesized by stromal/mesenchymal cells and deposited in interstitial ECM, with prominent localization around collagen fibrils and in vascular/perivascular niches in tumors (patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13, frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34). In glioblastoma, decorin mRNA and protein localize to regions of microvascular proliferation and the tunica adventitia, consistent with perivascular ECM roles (patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13).
- Core functions: (i) Collagen binding and fibrillogenesis control; (ii) sequestration/neutralization of TGF‑β to tune fibrogenic signaling; (iii) direct modulation of RTKs including EGFR, MET, and VEGFR family members, conferring anti‑tumor, anti‑angiogenic, and anti‑lymphangiogenic actions (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2, patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13, frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Antilymphangiogenic mechanism via VEGFR3: A 2024 PNAS study demonstrated that recombinant decorin suppresses tumor lymphangiogenesis by down‑regulating VEGFR3 signaling and evoking autophagic degradation of the lymphatic marker LYVE1; decorin acts as an extracellular ligand/modulator for multiple RTKs (EGFR, MET, VEGFR2) and additionally targets VEGFR3 (new mechanistic addition) (Mondal 2024; Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317760121) (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2).
- Corneal dystrophy classification update: The 2024 IC3D third edition confirms DCN among stromal dystrophy genes underlying congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD), integrating recent genetic and clinicopathologic evidence (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000003420) (IC3D) (Referenced in table).
- Human DCN variant in CSCD: A 2023 report identified a novel de novo frameshift in DCN (NM_001920.5:c.953del; p.Asn318Thrfs*10) in a pediatric CSCD case with bilateral stromal opacity, strengthening DCN causality in human corneal stromal organization (Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41439-023-00239-8) (Morikawa 2023) (Referenced in table).
- Fibrosis biomarker development: In MASLD, a serum panel incorporating decorin (with GDF15 and clinical variables) predicted hepatic fibrosis with AUROC 0.912 (development cohort, n=144) and 0.977 (biopsy‑validated external cohort, n=41), indicating clinical utility of circulating decorin as part of a composite fibrosis index (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-77719-6) (Chang 2024) (Referenced in table).
- ECM assembly perspective: A 2024 Nature Reviews article on ECM mechanisms details SLRP roles (including decorin) in collagen fibrillogenesis and growth‑factor sequestration, integrating structural–functional knowledge central to DCN biology (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00767-3) (Referenced in table).
- TGF‑β signaling nexus: A 2024 translational review highlights TGF‑β’s centrality in fibrosis and cancer and recognizes decorin’s capacity to sequester TGF‑β and induce p21, contextualizing DCN within anti‑fibrotic and tumor‑suppressive signaling networks (Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-024-05411-4) (Referenced in table).
- Ocular neovascularization therapeutics: A 2024 review lists decorin among anti‑fibrotic options to mitigate corneal scarring and pathological angiogenesis by TGF‑β sequestration, aligning with its anti‑angiogenic RTK‑modulatory profile (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105479) (Referenced in table).

3) Primary molecular functions and pathways
- Collagen fibrillogenesis and matrix organization: Decorin binds fibrillar collagens (types I/III/V) at periodic sites, regulates fibril diameter/spacing, and contributes to tissue tensile properties; these structural roles underpin corneal transparency and tendon/skin mechanics (frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34). The ECM assembly review synthesizes SLRP participation in these processes (2024) (Referenced in table).
- TGF‑β sequestration and anti‑fibrotic signaling: Decorin binds TGF‑β isoforms in the ECM, limiting receptor engagement and downstream profibrotic SMAD signaling; this mechanism is repeatedly implicated in anti‑fibrotic activity in multiple tissues and in therapeutic proposals (frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34). Contemporary reviews (2024) emphasize decorin as an ECM checkpoint for TGF‑β bioavailability (Referenced in table).
- RTK modulation and downstream signaling: Decorin directly interacts with and modulates RTKs, including EGFR and MET, leading to receptor down‑regulation, p21 induction, apoptosis, and suppression of pro‑oncogenic pathways (patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13, frejborg2025decorinexpressingoncolyticherpes pages 30-34). It also antagonizes VEGFR2 signaling to inhibit angiogenesis, and, critically, 2024 work extends this to VEGFR3, linking decorin to antilymphangiogenic programs via suppression of lymphatic gene clusters and Lyve1 degradation (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2). Collectively, decorin acts as a pan‑RTK extracellular modulator shaping tumor, angiogenic, and stromal responses (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2, patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13).

4) Disease relevance and human genetics
- Corneal stromal dystrophy (CSCD): Pathogenic DCN variants cause autosomal dominant CSCD with diffuse stromal opacity, consistent with decorin’s essential role in corneal collagen lamellae organization; the 2023 pediatric case (c.953del) provides direct human genetic evidence, and the 2024 IC3D classification recognizes DCN in stromal dystrophies (Morikawa 2023; IC3D 2024) (Referenced in table).
- Cancer biology: Decorin often exhibits oncosuppressive roles. In glioblastoma, higher decorin expression is observed in perivascular niches and correlates with MRI diffusion phenotypes linked to improved benefit from anti‑VEGF therapy; DCN expression colocalizes with VEGFR1/2, aligning with its anti‑angiogenic positioning (Sep 2020; human cohorts, imaging–molecular correlations) (patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13). In 2024, systemic decorin delivery curtailed breast tumor lymphangiogenesis via VEGFR3, providing a mechanistic basis for anti‑metastatic potential through lymphatic suppression (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2).
- Fibrosis and organ remodeling: By neutralizing TGF‑β and modulating ECM assembly, decorin is positioned as an anti‑fibrotic agent. Clinically oriented evidence in MASLD shows circulating decorin contributes to a high‑performance panel predicting hepatic fibrosis severity (AUROC up to 0.977), supporting translational relevance as a systemic biomarker (Chang 2024) (Referenced in table).

5) Quantitative and localization data (selected recent metrics)
- MASLD fibrosis prediction: Serum panel including decorin (MSI‑F) achieved AUROC 0.912 in a population‑based development cohort (n=144) and 0.977 in a biopsy‑validated external cohort (n=41), with diagnostic accuracy 82.6–92.4% (Nov 2024; Scientific Reports) (Referenced in table).
- GBM imaging–molecular correlations: High ADCL tumors showed markedly higher DCN RNA (41.6 vs 1.5; P=0.0081), and DCN protein correlated with ADCL across and within tumors (Pearson R² ≈ 0.30–0.40), with spatial localization to microvascular proliferation and vessel adventitia (Sep 2020; Scientific Reports) (patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13).
- Lymphangiogenesis suppression: Mondal 2024 reports reduction of lymphatic gene signatures (Lyve1, Podoplanin) and functional suppression of ex vivo lymphatic sprouting upon decorin treatment, mechanistically linked to VEGFR3 down‑regulation and Lyve1 autophagic degradation (Apr 2024; PNAS) (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2).

6) Current applications and implementations
- Biomarkers: Emerging evidence positions circulating decorin as a component of multi‑analyte panels for fibrosis (MASLD), with externally validated performance (Chang 2024) (Referenced in table).
- Therapeutic concepts: Preclinical work supports recombinant decorin or vector‑delivered decorin to suppress angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and fibrotic remodeling via TGF‑β sequestration and RTK modulation; ocular surface and corneal neovascularization reviews identify decorin among anti‑fibrotic, anti‑angiogenic candidates (2024) (Referenced in table). While clinical trials specifically administering decorin remain limited, these converging data underscore translational potential.

Expert analysis and synthesis
Decorin’s core biology—ECM localization, LRR‑mediated binding to collagens and growth factors, and modulation of RTKs—provides a coherent mechanistic basis for its roles in tissue architecture, fibrotic signaling control, and tumor/vascular microenvironment regulation. The 2024 PNAS study extends the RTK paradigm to VEGFR3 and lymphatic biology, suggesting decorin shapes not only angiogenesis but also lymphangiogenesis, with implications for metastasis control. Concurrently, human genetic evidence for DCN in CSCD reinforces decorin’s necessity for collagen lamellar order in the cornea. Translationally, the high AUROC values achieved when decorin is combined with stress biomarkers (GDF15) in MASLD highlight its promise as part of non‑invasive fibrosis diagnostics. Together, these lines of evidence establish decorin as a matrix‑embedded signaling hub and structural organizer with growing clinical relevance (mondal2024decorinsuppressestumor pages 1-2, patel2020decorinexpressionis pages 12-13).

Notes and limitations
Where indicated, some foundational mechanistic details (e.g., precise LRR mapping for ligand contacts, broad collagen binding) derive from prior experimental work consolidated in reviews and are consistent with recent summaries; the 2024–2023 human‑focused studies provide updated genetics (CSCD), tumor lymphangiogenesis mechanisms, and clinical biomarker performance. Further quantitative binding constants and site‑specific interaction maps were beyond the present sources and may require additional targeted structural studies.
