description: 'DAB2IP (Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein, also known as AIP1)
  is a multifunctional tumor suppressor that serves as both a GTPase-activating protein
  (GAP) and a signaling scaffold. The protein contains PH, C2, GAP, PER, and proline-rich
  domains that enable it to coordinate multiple signaling pathways. Core enzymatic
  functions include GAP activity toward Ras, ARF6, and RAB40C GTPases. As a scaffold,
  DAB2IP coordinates opposing pathways: inhibiting PI3K-AKT (survival) while activating
  ASK1-JNK (apoptosis) in response to TNF-alpha. DAB2IP inhibits multiple oncogenic
  pathways including Ras-MAPK, NF-kappaB, Wnt/beta-catenin, VEGFR2, and JAK-STAT signaling.
  Loss of DAB2IP through promoter methylation or EZH2-mediated silencing drives cancer
  progression, EMT, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Also functions in vascular
  biology (anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic) and neuronal migration during cortical
  development.'

core_functions:
- description: GTPase activator (GAP) for multiple small GTPases including Ras, ARF6,
