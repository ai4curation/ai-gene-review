description: >-
  DAB2IP (Disabled homolog 2-interacting protein, also known as AIP1) is a multifunctional
  tumor suppressor that serves as both a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and a signaling
  scaffold. The protein contains PH, C2, GAP, PER, and proline-rich domains that enable
  it to coordinate multiple signaling pathways. Core enzymatic functions include GAP
  activity toward Ras, ARF6, and RAB40C GTPases. As a scaffold, DAB2IP coordinates
  opposing pathways: inhibiting PI3K-AKT (survival) while activating ASK1-JNK (apoptosis)
  in response to TNF-alpha. DAB2IP inhibits multiple oncogenic pathways including
  Ras-MAPK, NF-kappaB, Wnt/beta-catenin, VEGFR2, and JAK-STAT signaling. Loss of DAB2IP
  through promoter methylation or EZH2-mediated silencing drives cancer progression,
  EMT, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Also functions in vascular biology
  (anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic) and neuronal migration during cortical development.

    GTPase activator (GAP) for multiple small GTPases including Ras, ARF6, and RAB40C.

    Signaling scaffold that coordinates opposing survival (PI3K-AKT) and apoptotic
    (ASK1-JNK) pathways. In response to TNF-alpha, DAB2IP recruits PP2A to dephosphorylate
    and activate ASK1 while simultaneously inhibiting PI3K-AKT, shifting balance toward
    apoptosis.
