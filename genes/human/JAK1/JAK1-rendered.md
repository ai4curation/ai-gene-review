|description[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/description)|JAK1 (Janus Kinase 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cytokine signal transduction. Contains four major domains: FERM domain for receptor binding, SH2-like domain for receptor interaction, pseudokinase domain for regulation, and active kinase domain for catalytic activity. Essential for Type I/II interferon signaling, IL-6 family cytokines, and γc-dependent cytokine pathways. Required for immune cell development, antiviral responses, and inflammatory processes. Mutations cause cancer (gain-of-function) or severe immunodeficiency (loss-of-function). Target of therapeutic JAK inhibitors.|

## suggested_questions


|question|
|---|
|How does JAK1 achieve specificity in cytokine signaling despite being used by multiple different cytokine receptors?|
|What are the molecular mechanisms of JAK1 activation and how do negative regulatory mechanisms prevent inappropriate signaling?|
|How do JAK1 inhibitors achieve selectivity and what are the structural determinants of drug binding and specificity?|
|What role does JAK1 play in immune cell development versus mature immune cell function and how is this regulated?|
