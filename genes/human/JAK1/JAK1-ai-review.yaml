description: 'JAK1 (Janus Kinase 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a
  pivotal role in cytokine signal transduction. Contains four major domains: FERM
  domain for receptor binding, SH2-like domain for receptor interaction, pseudokinase
  domain for regulation, and active kinase domain for catalytic activity. Essential
  for Type I/II interferon signaling, IL-6 family cytokines, and γc-dependent cytokine
  pathways. Required for immune cell development, antiviral responses, and inflammatory
