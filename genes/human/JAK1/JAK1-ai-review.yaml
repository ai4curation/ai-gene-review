description: 'JAK1 (Janus Kinase 1) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a
  pivotal role in cytokine signal transduction. Contains four major domains: FERM
  domain for receptor binding, SH2-like domain for receptor interaction, pseudokinase
  domain for regulation, and active kinase domain for catalytic activity. Essential
  for Type I/II interferon signaling, IL-6 family cytokines, and γc-dependent cytokine
  pathways. Required for immune cell development, antiviral responses, and inflammatory
  processes. Mutations cause cancer (gain-of-function) or severe immunodeficiency
  (loss-of-function). Target of therapeutic JAK inhibitors.'

- question: How does JAK1 achieve specificity in cytokine signaling despite being used by multiple different cytokine receptors?
- question: What are the molecular mechanisms of JAK1 activation and how do negative regulatory mechanisms prevent inappropriate signaling?
- question: How do JAK1 inhibitors achieve selectivity and what are the structural determinants of drug binding and specificity?
- question: What role does JAK1 play in immune cell development versus mature immune cell function and how is this regulated?
