## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O75027
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Iron-sulfur clusters transporter ABCB7, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 7, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATP-binding cassette transporter 7; Short=ABC transporter 7 protein; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ABCB7 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:48}; Synonyms=ABC7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. ABCB family.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ABC1_TM_dom. (IPR011527); ABC1_TM_sf. (IPR036640); ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ABCB7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ABCB7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ABCB7** (gene ID: ABCB7, UniProt: O75027) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human ABCB7 (UniProt O75027)

Identity verification and definitions

- Correct gene/protein: The target is human ABCB7 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 7), UniProt O75027. ABCB7 is a mitochondrial ABC transporter of the ABCB family, evolutionarily orthologous to yeast Atm1. It is a half-transporter with nucleotide-binding (AAA+ ATPase) and transmembrane domains consistent with the ABCB fold (yeast/eukaryotic Atm1-type) (pearson2021evolutionofthe pages 19-24, li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.108661; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118.
- Key concept: ABCB7 functions as the mitochondrial inner-membrane exporter that links the mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis system to cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S protein maturation (CIA system) by transporting a sulfur- and glutathione-dependent Fe–S intermediate (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2, maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8; https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118.

Subcellular localization and molecular mechanism

- Localization: ABCB7 resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane with its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) facing the matrix, consistent with an exporter topology (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118.
- Transported substrate and mechanism: Multiple studies support ABCB7/Atm1-type exporters translocating glutathione-coordinated Fe–S species. Structural and biochemical data from eukaryotic Atm1 homologs show binding and transport consistent with a glutathione-coordinated [2Fe–2S] cargo ([2Fe–2S](GS)4), which stimulates ATPase activity; alternate or complementary models implicate glutathione persulfide species (e.g., GSSSG). Transport is driven by ATP binding/hydrolysis that transitions the protein between inward-open and occluded states, with a positively charged, matrix-facing cargo-binding cavity (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2, pearson2019glutathionecoordinatedironsulfur pages 153-159, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7, pearson2021evolutionofthe pages 19-24). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8; (Pearson 2019); https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.108661.

Pathway context: ISC biogenesis and the CIA pathway

- Role in Fe–S biogenesis: ABCB7 exports a mitochondrially generated, glutathione-dependent sulfur/Fe–S intermediate to the cytosol, enabling maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe–S proteins. ABCB7 deficiency causes mitochondrial iron accumulation and loss of Fe–S enzymes, with downstream impairment of heme synthesis and cellular iron misdistribution (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7, ochi2022exploringthemechanistic pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18921-2.
- Conservation and essentiality: Cross-species work (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii ABCB7-like) underscores conservation of ABCB7’s essential role in supplying the cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S pathway; depletion specifically compromises cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S proteins and translation, while sparing core mitochondrial Fe–S assembly (maclean2024thetoxoplasmagondiia pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00872-24.

Structural and mechanistic insights

- Atm1/ABCB7-type structures: High-resolution cryo-EM structures of a eukaryotic homolog (CtAtm1) delineate inward-open and partially occluded conformations, identify a positively charged matrix-side cavity that engages glutathione-complexed [2Fe–2S] cargo, and illuminate coupling between cargo binding and NBD-driven conformational changes for export (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8.
- Biochemical reconstitution: Human ABCB7 reconstituted in proteoliposomes shows ATPase stimulation by glutathione and [2Fe–2S](GS)4 and supports transport assays consistent with a glutathione-coordinated Fe–S cargo model, aligning disease-causing variant effects with mechanistic disruption (pearson2021evolutionofthe pages 19-24). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.108661.

Protein–protein interactions relevant to heme synthesis

- FECH–ABCB7–ABCB10 complex: Dimeric ferrochelatase (FECH) bridges ABCB7 and ABCB10 homodimers in a molecular complex in mitochondria. ABCB7 deficiency destabilizes FECH and impairs heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells, linking ABCB7 function to heme pathway integrity in addition to Fe–S metabolism (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320.

Disease links and real-world relevance

- X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A): Germline loss-of-function ABCB7 variants cause XLSA/A, characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia and sideroblastic anemia with ring sideroblasts and mitochondrial iron accumulation in erythroblasts. Mechanistically, impaired ABCB7-mediated export undermines cytosolic Fe–S maturation and heme synthesis in erythroid lineage. Summaries and case literature corroborate the phenotype and variant spectrum (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2, ogunbileje2024atpbindingcassettetransporter pages 6-7, pearson2019glutathionecoordinatedironsulfur pages 153-159). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm14060636; (Pearson 2019).
- MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS), SF3B1 mutations: In MDS-RS, SF3B1 mutations (≈80% of cases) drive missplicing and downregulation of ABCB7, contributing to mitochondrial iron accumulation and ring sideroblast formation. ABCB7’s pathogenic impact includes FECH destabilization despite FECH being genetically intact, providing a mechanistic bridge between aberrant splicing and impaired heme synthesis; clinically, iron overload is common and chelation can improve outcomes (gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2, ochi2022exploringthemechanistic pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000569; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18921-2.
- Oncology (acute myeloid leukemia, AML) and cell death pathways: SF3B1-mutated AML exhibits ABCB7 missplicing/downregulation that creates vulnerability to copper ionophores. A genome-scale loss-of-function screen showed that ABCB7 loss is synthetic lethal with a copper ionophore (UM4118) that triggers mitochondrial cuproptosis, positioning ABCB7 status (and SF3B1 mutation) as a potential biomarker for copper ionophore–based therapy (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018.

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)

- SF3B1-mutated AML and cuproptosis targeting (2024): Copper ionophore UM4118 induces cuproptosis; ABCB7 loss and broader ISC deficiency sensitized AML cells. ABCB7 overexpression partially rescued SF3B1-mutant AML from copper overload, highlighting a therapeutic window (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018 (published March 2024).
- MDS-RS pathophysiology and clinical management (2024): ABCB7 mis-splicing/downregulation is highlighted as pathogenic in MDS-RS; iron overload arises from ineffective erythropoiesis and hepcidin suppression. Deferasirox is widely used for chelation; luspatercept reduces transfusion burden though not existing iron burden (gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000569 (December 2024).
- Conservation of ABCB7 function in pathogens (2024): Toxoplasma gondii ABCB7-like (ABCB7L) is essential for cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S biogenesis and translation, reinforcing the conserved role of ABCB7-type transporters in eukaryotes (maclean2024thetoxoplasmagondiia pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00872-24 (October 2024).
- Structural mechanisms (continuing relevance): Eukaryotic Atm1 cryo-EM structures provide detailed cargo-binding and transport-state insights, supporting the GSH-coordinated [2Fe–2S] export model relevant to human ABCB7 (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8 (July 2022).

Expert opinions and synthesis

- Consensus: Authoritative structural, biochemical, and disease studies converge on a model in which ABCB7 is the mitochondrial inner-membrane exporter of a glutathione-dependent Fe–S intermediate that is essential for cytosolic and nuclear Fe–S protein maturation; genetic defects (in ABCB7 or via mis-splicing) cause mitochondrial iron loading, heme synthesis defects in erythroid cells, and ring sideroblast formation. FECH stabilization via the FECH–ABCB7–ABCB10 complex mechanistically links ABCB7 to heme synthesis (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2, gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2, ochi2022exploringthemechanistic pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320; https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000569; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18921-2.
- Mechanistic nuance: While glutathione-coordinated [2Fe–2S] clusters provide a strong mechanistic match for Atm1/ABCB7 transport, alternative glutathione persulfide species have been proposed; Atm1 structural states and ATPase coupling support a transporter cycle that reconciles both substrate models pending definitive in vivo identification of the physiological export species (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8; https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20150118.

Current applications and translational angles

- Precision oncology: Exploiting ABCB7 deficiency/missplicing in SF3B1-mutated AML with copper ionophores (cuproptosis) is a near-term application; ABCB7 expression may serve as a biomarker for response. Functional genetics demonstrated synthetic lethality when ABCB7 is lost (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018.
- Hematology practice: In MDS-RS with ABCB7 downregulation, management of iron overload (e.g., oral deferasirox) and transfusion-sparing strategies (e.g., luspatercept) remain key; mechanistic clarity on ABCB7’s role strengthens rationale for monitoring iron indices and considering chelation in appropriate patients (gattermann2024ironoverloadin pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000569.

Relevant statistics and quantitative findings

- Synthetic lethality: Loss of ABCB7 was identified as synthetic lethal to the copper ionophore UM4118 in CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening in AML; ABCB7 overexpression partially rescued SF3B1-mutant cells (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018.
- Biochemical activity: Human ABCB7 shows ATPase stimulation by glutathione and [2Fe–2S](GS)4 in proteoliposomes; Atm1/ABCB7 homologs display transport states and cargo-binding features consistent with GSH-coordinated cluster export (pearson2021evolutionofthe pages 19-24, li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.108661; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32006-8.
- Multiprotein complex architecture: Crosslinking/MS revealed a dimeric FECH bridging ABCB7 and ABCB10 homodimers in mitochondria, mapping interaction interfaces near NBDs (maio2019dimericferrochelatasebridges pages 1-2). URL/DOI: https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2018.214320.

(Science Advances, 2024) (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2); preclinical reports (conference/abstract) show ABCB7 inhibition potentiates cisplatin via ferroptosis in tumor models (moison2024sf3b1mutationsprovide pages 1-2). | https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl4018 |

Notes on gene symbol disambiguation

- The symbol ABCB7 in this report refers exclusively to the human mitochondrial ABC transporter encoded on the X chromosome (UniProt O75027). All cited studies align with the ABC transporter superfamily, ABCB subfamily membership, and Atm1/ABCB7-type domain architecture. No conflicting organism/gene symbol usage was found; where non-human homologs (e.g., yeast Atm1 or Toxoplasma ABCB7-like) are cited, they are explicitly identified as homologs used for mechanistic inference (li2022structuresofatm1 pages 1-2, maclean2024thetoxoplasmagondiia pages 1-2, schaedler2015structuresandfunctions pages 5-7).
