description: 'ABCB7 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 7) is an essential mitochondrial
  inner membrane ABC transporter that exports glutathione-coordinated [2Fe-2S] clusters
  from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol, enabling maturation of cytosolic and
  nuclear iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins via the CIA (cytosolic iron-sulfur
  assembly) pathway. As a half-transporter, ABCB7 functions as a homodimer with each
  monomer containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide-binding domain
  (NBD). ABCB7 forms a functional complex with ferrochelatase (FECH) and ABCB10, where
  dimeric FECH bridges ABCB7 and ABCB10 homodimers, linking Fe-S cluster export to
  heme biosynthesis. ABCB7 deficiency causes mitochondrial iron accumulation, loss
  of cytosolic Fe-S enzymes (notably cytosolic aconitase/IRP1), and impaired heme
  synthesis due to ferrochelatase destabilization. Germline loss-of-function mutations
  in ABCB7 cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A, SCAX6), characterized
  by ring sideroblasts in erythroblasts, microcytic anemia, and early-onset cerebellar
  ataxia. ABCB7 downregulation via SF3B1 mutation-induced missplicing is a pathogenic
  mechanism in myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS).
