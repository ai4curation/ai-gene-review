description: >-
  SDHB encodes the iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, Complex II),
  a heterotetrameric enzyme (SDHA/SDHB/SDHC/SDHD) embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
  SDHB contains three iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S]) organized in a
  butterfly-like two-domain structure that relays electrons from the FAD cofactor in SDHA to
  ubiquinone bound at the SDHC/SDHD membrane interface. SDHB also directly contacts the
  ubiquinone binding site via residues Pro197, Trp201, and Ile246. Complex II is unique among
  OXPHOS complexes in that it does NOT pump protons across the inner membrane. SDHB functions
  as a tumor suppressor; heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause paraganglioma/
  pheochromocytoma (PPGL4) via succinate accumulation and pseudohypoxic HIF stabilization.
  Biallelic mutations cause mitochondrial complex II deficiency type 4 (MC2DN4) with
  leukoencephalopathy.

      entire SDH complex (succinate + quinone -> fumarate + quinol). For SDHB, the qualifier
      should ideally be 'contributes_to' rather than 'enables' since SDHB alone cannot

  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:30030361
  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation from ComplexPortal suggesting SDHB is involved in proton motive
      force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis. This annotation is problematic because
      Complex II does NOT pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Unlike
      Complexes I, III, and IV which translocate protons to generate the proton motive force,
      Complex II transfers electrons from succinate to ubiquinone without any proton pumping.
      Complex II contributes to ATP synthesis only indirectly by feeding reduced ubiquinol
      into the Q pool, which is then oxidized by Complex III (which does pump protons).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Complex II is the only OXPHOS complex that does NOT pump protons. The proton motive
      force is generated by Complexes I, III, and IV. Complex II feeds electrons into the
      ubiquinone pool but does not directly contribute to the proton gradient. This annotation
      is misleading. The correct process annotation for SDHB is GO:0006121 (mitochondrial
      electron transport, succinate to ubiquinone).

  description: >-
    SDHB is the iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II).
    It contains three iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S]) organized in a
    butterfly-like two-domain structure that relays electrons from the FAD cofactor in SDHA
    to ubiquinone at the SDHC/SDHD membrane interface. The primary subunit-specific molecular
    function of SDHB is electron transfer activity (GO:0009055), while it contributes to the
    overall succinate dehydrogenase (quinone) activity (GO:0008177) of the Complex II
    heterotetramer. SDHB also directly contacts the ubiquinone binding site via residues
    Pro197, Trp201, and Ile246 (GO:0048039 ubiquinone binding). The complex resides in the
    inner mitochondrial membrane with SDHB facing the matrix. SDHB is essential for coupling
    the TCA cycle (succinate oxidation) to the electron transport chain (ubiquinone reduction),
    the defining biological process GO:0006121.
