description: >-
  STOML1 (Stomatin-like protein 1, also known as SLP-1) is a monotopic membrane protein
  belonging to the SPFH/band-7 family with a distinctive bipartite architecture: an N-terminal
  stomatin-like (SPFH) domain and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) domain.
  Unlike stomatin which localizes predominantly to the plasma membrane, STOML1 is targeted
  to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies via an N-terminal GYXXF sorting signal. The protein
  plays roles in cholesterol/lipid transfer within endolysosomal membranes, modulation of
  acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in sensory neurons, and regulation of F-box protein FBXW7
  stability. STOML1 interacts with stomatin, redistributing it from plasma membrane to late
  endosomes, associates with the lysosomal cation channel TRPML1, and binds FBXW7-gamma and
  CDK2 to regulate protein turnover. Expression is highest in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle,
  with functional significance in neuronal proton sensing.

  review:
    summary: >-
      STOML1 has been experimentally demonstrated to inhibit acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs),
      specifically strongly inhibiting ASIC1a-mediated proton currents and accelerating ASIC3
      inactivation. The SCP-2 domain is required for ASIC1a modulation. STOML1 knockout mice
      show larger proton-gated currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons, confirming an endogenous
      inhibitory function (file:human/STOML1/STOML1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This IBA annotation is strongly supported by experimental evidence. The annotation accurately
      reflects the core molecular function of STOML1 in inhibiting acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs).
      GO:0008200 (ion channel inhibitor activity) is appropriate as STOML1 inhibits ASIC1a current
      amplitude and accelerates ASIC3 inactivation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      While STOML1 does localize to the plasma membrane in neurons where it modulates ASICs,
      experimental evidence shows that STOML1 primarily localizes to late endosomes/multivesicular
      bodies, not the plasma membrane. Wild-type STOML1 was never observed at significant plasma
      membrane levels in steady state; only when the N-terminal GYXXF sorting signal was mutated
      did STOML1 relocate to the plasma membrane (PMID:19696025).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation suggesting plasma membrane localization may be inherited from other
      stomatin family members. While STOML1 may transit through or function at the plasma membrane
      in certain contexts (particularly for ASIC modulation in neurons), its predominant
      steady-state localization is to late endosomes. This annotation is acceptable as non-core
      but late endosome membrane (GO:0031902) is more representative of STOML1's primary localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation suggesting plasma membrane localization is less accurate than
      late endosome membrane for STOML1. Experimental evidence clearly shows STOML1 localizes
      to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies as its primary location. Plasma membrane localization
      only occurs when the N-terminal sorting signal is mutated.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This is a computational annotation that is broader than the experimentally determined
      primary localization. While not incorrect (STOML1 may function at plasma membrane in
      neurons for ASIC modulation), the primary localization is to late endosomes. Accept as
      non-core since it represents a secondary or transient localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      STOML1 contains an SCP-2 (sterol carrier protein-2) domain, which is implicated in
      cholesterol and lipid transfer. Under conditions of blocked cholesterol efflux from late
      endosomes, STOML1 expression induces enlarged, cholesterol-filled vesicles, and this
      phenotype requires the SCP-2 domain (PMID:19696025). This strongly supports a role in
      lipid/sterol transport.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping is well-supported by experimental
      evidence showing STOML1's SCP-2 domain is involved in cholesterol handling at late

    summary: >-
      This is the most accurate cellular component annotation for STOML1. Experimental evidence
      from confocal microscopy, immuno-EM, and co-localization studies shows STOML1 localizes
      to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, co-localizing with LAMP-2, Rab7, and Rab9 but
      not early endosome markers (PMID:19696025).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately represents STOML1's primary subcellular localization. The
      N-terminal GYXXF sorting signal directs STOML1 specifically to late endosomes, and
      mutation of this signal results in plasma membrane localization instead. This is a
      core annotation for STOML1.

      PMID:19696025 demonstrates that STOML1 interacts directly with stomatin via
