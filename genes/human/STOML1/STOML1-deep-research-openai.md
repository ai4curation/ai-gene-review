## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UBI4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stomatin-like protein 1; Short=SLP-1; AltName: Full=EPB72-like protein 1; AltName: Full=Protein unc-24 homolog; AltName: Full=Stomatin-related protein; Short=STORP;
- **Gene Information:** Name=STOML1; Synonyms=SLP1, UNC24; ORFNames=MSTP019;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Band-7_stomatin-like. (IPR043202); Band_7. (IPR001107); Band_7/SPFH_dom_sf. (IPR036013); SCP2_sterol-bd_dom. (IPR003033); SCP2_sterol-bd_dom_sf. (IPR036527)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "STOML1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'STOML1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **STOML1** (gene ID: STOML1, UniProt: Q9UBI4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Stomatin-Like Protein 1 (STOML1) – Structure, Function, and Emerging Roles

## Introduction and Key Characteristics  
**STOML1 (Stomatin-like protein 1)** is a human membrane protein encoded by the **STOML1 gene** (UniProt Q9UBI4) and is part of the conserved **band-7/SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflC/K)** superfamily ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=Proteins%20of%20the%20stomatin%20family,and%20intracellular%20N%20and%20C)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=predominantly%20expressed%20in%20the%20brain%2C,17)). It is also known by synonyms *SLP-1*, *EPB72-like 1*, or *UNC24 homolog*, reflecting its homology to *C. elegans* **unc-24** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=Human%20stomatin,residue%20hydrophobic%20domain%20that%20is)). STOML1’s amino acid sequence (~332 residues) contains a central **stomatin/SPFH domain** and a unique **C-terminal sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) domain**, separated by a hydrophobic segment that anchors the protein to membranes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=The%20human%20stomatin,endosomes%20suggesting%20a%20complex%20formation)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=contains%20a%20hydrophilic%20N%20terminus%2C,24)). This bipartite structure – a membrane-anchor plus lipid-binding domain – immediately suggested a role in sterol or lipid transport and membrane organization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=The%20human%20stomatin,endosomes%20suggesting%20a%20complex%20formation)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=protein,24)). 

STOML1 is one of five mammalian stomatin-domain proteins, alongside stomatin (STOM), podocin, STOML2 (SLP-2), and STOML3 (SLP-3) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=Proteins%20of%20the%20stomatin%20family,and%20intracellular%20N%20and%20C)). It shares the hallmark **SPFH (band-7)** domain with these family members but is unique in the family for possessing an SCP-2 lipid-binding domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=contains%20a%20hydrophilic%20N%20terminus%2C,24)). STOML1 is broadly expressed across tissues; highest levels are reported in the **brain, heart, and skeletal muscle**, with moderate expression in many other tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=comprises%205%20human%20members%3A%20stomatin,21%2C%2015)). In the nervous system, STOML1 mRNA/protein is present in both central and peripheral neurons. For example, in mice a STOML1 promoter-trap reporter is active in **at least 50% of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=STOML1%20null%20mutant%20mice%20with,endogenous%20inhibitory%20function%20for%20STOML1)), and overall STOML1 is particularly enriched in the brain where its modulator targets (like ASIC1a ion channels) are abundant ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=to%20eliminate%20inhibition%20of%20ASIC1a,21%E2%80%9323)).

## Subcellular Localization and Membrane Association  
Endogenous STOML1 is primarily an **intracellular membrane protein** found on late endosomal compartments. Unlike its paralog stomatin (which resides at the plasma membrane and lipid raft domains), STOML1 is **targeted to late endosome membranes** via a canonical sorting signal in its N-terminus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=first%20studied%20the%20molecular%20and,in%20the%20late%20endosomal%20compartment)). A specific **GYXXΦ motif** (Φ = hydrophobic residue) in STOML1’s N-terminal region functions as a sorting signal; mutating this motif causes STOML1 to mis-localize to the plasma membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=compartment%2C%20like%20stomatin,direct%20interaction%2C%20and%20they%20associate)). Thus, in normal cells STOML1 localizes to **late endosomes and associated vesicles**, and only small fractions (if any) appear at the cell surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=first%20studied%20the%20molecular%20and,in%20the%20late%20endosomal%20compartment)). Consistent with this, UniProt-curated data (based on experimental evidence) report STOML1 on **late endosome membranes and lipid raft microdomains**, but not significantly at the general plasma membrane ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=STOML1#:~:text=%2A%20Membrane%3B%20Single,Cytoplasmic%20vesicle%20%7BECO%3A0000250)). STOML1 is thought to insert into the membrane as a **monotopic or single-pass protein** (often termed type III membrane protein) with both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=STOML1#:~:text=%2A%20Membrane%3B%20Single,Cytoplasmic%20vesicle%20%7BECO%3A0000250)). Like other SPFH-domain proteins, STOML1 can oligomerize and associate with **detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains** (“lipid rafts”) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=is%20caused%20by%20a%20GYXX%CE%A6,1)). Indeed, STOML1 was shown to **co-localize and physically interact with stomatin** in shared DRM/raft domains of late endosomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=is%20caused%20by%20a%20GYXX%CE%A6,1)). When STOML1 is overexpressed in cells, it can recruit or redistribute stomatin from the plasma membrane to the late endosomal compartment, indicating that these proteins form complexes in vivo and can influence each other’s localization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=first%20studied%20the%20molecular%20and,in%20the%20late%20endosomal%20compartment)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=is%20caused%20by%20a%20GYXX%CE%A6,1)). This mirrors findings in *C. elegans*, where the STOML1 ortholog UNC-24 is required for proper distribution/stability of the stomatin ortholog UNC-1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=39%20%29.%20Importantly%2C%20MEC,the%20activity%20of%20ion%20channels)). In summary, STOML1 resides on internal membranes (late endosomes/lysosome-related vesicles) and is closely associated with specialized lipid raft-like microdomains and with other stomatin-family proteins in those compartments.

## Role in Lipid Transport and Cholesterol Homeostasis  
One of the key proposed functions for STOML1 is in **intracellular lipid trafficking**, particularly involving **cholesterol handling in late endosomes**. The presence of a sterol-binding SCP-2 domain suggests a capacity to bind and transfer lipids. Experimental evidence from Mairhofer *et al.* (2009) supports this role: Overexpression of STOML1 (SLP-1) in cultured cells, under conditions where late endosomal cholesterol egress was blocked, induced the formation of **enlarged, cholesterol-filled vesicles** in the perinuclear region ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=with%20detergent,cholesterol%20transfer%20to%20late%20endosomes)). These swollen, cholesterol-rich endosomal structures were only induced when STOML1’s SCP-2 domain was intact, implying that STOML1 was actively binding/accumulating cholesterol in endosomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=with%20detergent,cholesterol%20transfer%20to%20late%20endosomes)). A **mutant STOML1 lacking the SCP-2 domain failed to cause cholesterol accumulation**, reinforcing that the C-terminal lipid-binding domain is functionally important in cholesterol transfer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=with%20detergent,cholesterol%20transfer%20to%20late%20endosomes)). From these findings, the authors concluded that STOML1 likely facilitates **cholesterol transport to (or retention in) late endosomes** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=with%20detergent,cholesterol%20transfer%20to%20late%20endosomes)). This might occur via STOML1 sequestering cholesterol in the endosomal membrane or shuttling sterol molecules between compartments. Indeed, STOML1 and stomatin both associate with cholesterol-rich raft microdomains, and many SPFH proteins (including stomatin and podocin) are known to bind cholesterol and form large oligomeric complexes that modulate membrane lipid organization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=defect%20%2821%20%2C%20%2029%29,and%20the%20glucose)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=respective%20stomatin,hypothesize%20that%20human%20stomatin%20and)). In *C. elegans*, the stomatin-like protein MEC-2 (a relative of STOML1) must bind cholesterol to activate mechanosensory ion channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=respective%20stomatin,hypothesize%20that%20human%20stomatin%20and)), highlighting how cholesterol interaction is a recurring theme in this protein family. 

**Protective lipid-transfer function:** The ability of STOML1 to gather cholesterol in endosomes suggests it might normally help distribute cholesterol to these organelles or regulate cholesterol flux between membranes. STOML1’s reported **interaction with late endosome/lysosomal cholesterol pathways** aligns with the idea that it could cooperate with other lipid transport machinery. For instance, one curated annotation (UniProt) posits that STOML1 “may play a role in cholesterol transfer to late endosomes” ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=STOML1#:~:text=May%20play%20a%20role%20in,%28%20STML1_HUMAN%2CQ9UBI4)). This function could be relevant in cell types with active endosomal cholesterol processing (e.g. macrophages or neurons). It is noteworthy that STOML1 is expressed in tissues that also handle significant lipid traffic (brain – for myelin and synaptic membranes; muscle – for membrane repair and signaling). No human genetic disorder has been directly linked to STOML1 mutations, but its paralog **podocin** (NPHS2) causes a kidney disease when mutated (due to disrupted lipid raft function in glomerular filtration). By analogy, STOML1’s influence on membrane lipid domains could be physiologically important, even if subtle. Further research is needed to clarify how STOML1’s lipid-binding activity affects cellular cholesterol homeostasis and whether it partners with known cholesterol transporters (such as NPC1/NPC2 or StAR domain proteins) at endosomal membranes.

## Modulation of Ion Channels and Sensory Signaling  
A major discovered function of STOML1 is the **regulation of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs)**, which are proton-gated Na^+ channels involved in pain perception, neuroplasticity, and mechanosensation. All stomatin-family proteins have been implicated in ion channel modulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=Stomatin%20appears%20to%20be%20a,mammals%2C%20four%20different%20genes%20encode)), and STOML1 is no exception. **Electrophysiological studies** have shown that STOML1 can bind to specific ASIC subunits and alter their gating behavior in an isoform-specific manner ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=Among%20the%20other%20members%20of,truncation%20eliminated%20the%20sterol%20carrier)). Kozlenkov *et al.* (2014) demonstrated that **STOML1 “profoundly inhibits” homomeric ASIC1a currents**, drastically reducing the proton-evoked current amplitude through ASIC1a channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=membrane%20proteins%20that%20can%20modulate,gated)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=also%20been%20shown%20to%20regulate,truncation%20eliminated%20the%20sterol%20carrier)). In contrast, STOML1 had **no effect on ASIC1b** (an alternative splice variant of ASIC1) and did not significantly change ASIC2a currents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=Among%20the%20other%20members%20of,truncation%20eliminated%20the%20sterol%20carrier)). STOML1 also modulates ASIC3, another proton-sensitive channel: co-expression of STOML1 **accelerated the inactivation (desensitization) rate of ASIC3 currents**, meaning the channel closed more rapidly in the presence of STOML1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=membrane%20proteins%20that%20can%20modulate,gated)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=also%20been%20shown%20to%20regulate,truncation%20eliminated%20the%20sterol%20carrier)). These effects were specific and required structural features of STOML1 – notably, **truncating STOML1’s C-terminus (removing its SCP-2 domain)** abolished the inhibition of ASIC1a ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=slightly%20speeds%20the%20desensitization%20of,21%E2%80%9323)). This suggests the unique C-terminal region of STOML1 is critical either for interacting with ASIC1a or for the conformational changes that inhibit channel opening. It is intriguing that the SCP-2 lipid-binding domain is required for channel modulation; one hypothesis is that STOML1 might alter the local membrane environment around ASIC channels (via lipid interactions) or use its C-terminus as a physical tether to the channel complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=slightly%20speeds%20the%20desensitization%20of,21%E2%80%9323)).

**Physiological context – sensory neurons:** STOML1 is abundantly expressed in sensory neurons, and its channel-modulating activity likely contributes to sensory transduction. In mouse DRG neurons lacking STOML1, **proton-gated ASIC currents are significantly larger** than in wild-type neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=STOML1%20null%20mutant%20mice%20with,endogenous%20inhibitory%20function%20for%20STOML1)). This indicates that endogenous STOML1 acts as a **negative regulator of ASIC activity** – its absence leads to enhanced acid-evoked currents, consistent with the inhibition observed in heterologous systems ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=STOML1%20null%20mutant%20mice%20with,endogenous%20inhibitory%20function%20for%20STOML1)). ASICs (especially ASIC3 and ASIC1) in DRGs are known to mediate pain from tissue acidosis and contribute to mechanoreceptor function in the skin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=have%20upon%20specific%20subunits%20of,2007%3B%20Diochot)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=lacking%20STOML3%20when%20compared%20to,and%20double%20mutants%20of%20stomatin)). By dampening ASIC1a/ASIC3 responses, STOML1 may raise the threshold for acid-induced pain or modulate mechanosensitivity. Notably, other stomatin-family members (stomatin itself and STOML3) are established modulators of mechanosensation: knocking out **stomatin (STOM)** or **STOML3** in mice causes distinct deficits in mechanoreceptor function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20it%20has%20been,28%3B%20Page%20et%20al)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=the%20stomatin%20family%20are%20involved,a%20complex%20that%20also)) (e.g. reduced touch sensitivity and silenced subsets of mechanosensory fibers). STOML1’s impact seems more subtle, but it could be part of the larger complex of proteins tuning somatosensory neuron excitability. There is cross-talk among these family members – for example, **STOML3 and STOML1 are both expressed in DRG neurons and may each contribute to overall ASIC regulation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20it%20has%20been,28%3B%20Page%20et%20al)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=Stomatin,and%20regulation%20might%20be%20conserved)). Additionally, stomatin-family proteins often form oligomers; a hetero-oligomer of STOML1 with stomatin or STOML3 could conceivably assemble at sensory neuron membranes to modulate channel function. 

In the **central nervous system**, ASIC1a plays roles in fear conditioning, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration during acidosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=ASIC,2013)). STOML1 is highly expressed in brain neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=protein,21%E2%80%9323)), so it may influence those CNS functions by regulating ASIC1a there. For instance, STOML1 inhibition of ASIC1a might be neuroprotective in conditions like ischemic stroke (where excessive ASIC1a activity causes Ca^2+-dependent damage) – though this remains speculative. A recent review (2021) summarizes that **“STOML1 slightly speeds desensitization of ASIC3 and drastically reduces acid-evoked currents of ASIC1a”**, and it points out that STOML1’s distribution overlaps with ASIC1a in the brain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=also%20been%20shown%20to%20regulate,Unlike%20STOM%2C%20which%20is%20found)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=protein,21%E2%80%9323)). In summary, through **direct protein-protein interactions or membrane microdomain effects**, STOML1 serves as an auxiliary subunit of ASIC channels, tuning their responsiveness to pH changes and mechanical stimuli. This places STOML1 as a component of sensory signaling pathways – particularly in nociception (pain sensing) and possibly mechanotransduction.

## Interaction with F-box Protein FBXW7 and Cell Cycle Implications  
Beyond its membrane-related roles, STOML1 has an unexpected function in the nucleus/cytoplasm related to protein turnover and cell cycle regulation. A **Yeast two-hybrid screen** identified STOML1 (SLP-1) as a novel binding partner of **FBXW7 (F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7)**, specifically the **FBXW7-γ isoform** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3%20as%20well%20as)). FBXW7 is the substrate-recognition subunit of a ubiquitin ligase (SCF^FBXW7) that targets various oncoproteins (cyclin E, c-Myc, Notch, etc.) for degradation to restrain cell proliferation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=Control%20of%20cellular%20proliferation%20is,1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=proteins%20that%20function%20in%20this,to%20wildtype%20animals%20%209)). FBXW7 has three splice variants (α, β, γ) with different N-termini and subcellular localizations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=Skp1,interaction%20can%20happen%20in%20vivo)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=Fbw7%20is%20conserved%20from%20yeast,this%20isoform%20is%20largely%20responsible)). The γ isoform is less understood but is highly expressed in brain and muscle tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=variants,targets%2C%20although%20there%20is%20evidence)) – interestingly, the same tissues where STOML1 is most enriched ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=comprises%205%20human%20members%3A%20stomatin,21%2C%2015)). Zhang *et al.* (2012) found that STOML1 binds to the unique N-terminal domain of FBXW7-γ and **protects it from proteasomal degradation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3)). In cells, overexpression of STOML1 **stabilized FBXW7-γ**, increasing its half-life and steady-state levels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3%20as%20well%20as)). As a functional consequence, **c-Myc protein levels were reduced** when STOML1 was co-expressed, because the now-stabilized FBXW7-γ continued to target c-Myc for ubiquitination and destruction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=Using%20a%20two,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). In other words, STOML1 serves as a **positive regulator of FBXW7-γ**, enhancing the tumor-suppressive activity of the FBXW7 ubiquitin ligase complex (since c-Myc is a pro-proliferative oncogene) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3)). This is a remarkable finding connecting a membrane protein to cell cycle control: STOML1, through binding FBXW7-γ, can influence the turnover of key cell-cycle regulators.

Intriguingly, STOML1 also interacts with **Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)**, a cell cycle kinase ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=the%20degradation%20of%20Fbw7,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). CDK2 was found to bind the same N-terminal region of FBXW7-γ as STOML1 does ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=the%20degradation%20of%20Fbw7,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). Co-expression experiments showed that **CDK2 has an opposing effect** to STOML1 on FBXW7-γ stability: when CDK2 and STOML1 are both overexpressed, STOML1 no longer stabilizes FBXW7-γ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=the%20degradation%20of%20Fbw7,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). One interpretation is that CDK2 might phosphorylate FBXW7-γ or sterically hinder STOML1’s binding, promoting FBXW7-γ degradation (since certain CDK2 phosphorylation sites on FBXW7 are known to mark it for self-destruction). Thus, STOML1 and CDK2 may **compete or counter-regulate** the stability of the FBXW7-γ complex. The discovery of these interactions suggests that **STOML1 indirectly influences cell proliferation**: by modulating FBXW7-γ, STOML1 can alter the degradation rate of oncogenic proteins like c-Myc. This aligns with STOML1’s possible role as a tumor suppressor co-factor. It’s noteworthy that FBXW7-γ’s physiological role is still being unraveled, but STOML1’s preferential binding to this isoform might target this regulation to particular contexts (neuronal or muscle cells, where FBXW7-γ is expressed highly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=variants,targets%2C%20although%20there%20is%20evidence))). In summary, **STOML1–FBXW7 interaction adds a new dimension** to STOML1’s function, linking a membrane/raft protein to the ubiquitin–proteasome system and cell cycle checkpoints.

## Clinical and Current Research Insights  
**Cancer biomarker and prognosis:** The connection to FBXW7 (a known tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer) has spurred interest in STOML1’s role in oncogenesis. Notably, recent clinical studies have identified STOML1 expression as a **prognostic biomarker** in certain cancers. A comprehensive 2025 study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients found that **high STOML1 expression is associated with significantly improved survival outcomes** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=mRNA%20expression%20levels%20of%20STOML1,0.001%5D%2C%20compared%20with%20TNM%20staging)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20high%20protein,010)). In NPC tumor samples, patients with elevated STOML1 had better 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates compared to those with low STOML1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20high%20protein,010)). STOML1 expression remained an **independent prognostic factor** for OS/DFS in multivariate Cox analysis, and combining STOML1 levels with standard TNM staging enhanced prognostic accuracy (in one model, the AUC for 5-year OS prediction increased from 0.715 with staging alone to 0.874 when STOML1 was included) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20high%20protein,010)). These data suggest that STOML1 has a protective association in NPC, consistent with the notion that it may bolster tumor-suppressive pathways (e.g. stabilizing FBXW7 and curbing c-Myc-driven proliferation). Similarly, the Human Protein Atlas reports STOML1 as a prognostic marker in **glioblastoma multiforme and kidney renal papillary carcinoma** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000067221-STOML1#:~:text=Prognostic%20summary%20STOML1%20is%20a,Low%20cancer%20specificity%20Cell%20line)), although further studies are needed to determine if high STOML1 is favorable in those cancers (the NPC study implies it might be). 

**Disease mechanisms and applications:** While no hereditary diseases are linked to STOML1, its known functions hint at several pathological contexts:  
- **Neurological Disorders & Pain:** Given STOML1’s modulation of ASIC channels, it could influence neurological conditions involving ASICs (e.g. chronic pain, anxiety, or stroke damage). For instance, ASIC1a is implicated in anxiety/fear and neurodegeneration; higher STOML1 might reduce ASIC1a activity, potentially blunting some pathological effects of excess ASIC signaling. Indeed, research in sensory neurons suggests stomatin-family proteins (like STOML1 and STOML3) are potential targets for new analgesics, as they tune the sensitivity of pain-sensing nerves ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=lacking%20STOML3%20when%20compared%20to,and%20double%20mutants%20of%20stomatin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=Stomatin,and%20regulation%20might%20be%20conserved)). Although no drug directly targeting STOML1 exists, understanding its ASIC inhibition mechanism could inspire peptide mimics or small molecules that stabilize the ASIC-STOML1 interaction to dampen pain responses.  
- **Metabolic and Lipid Storage Diseases:** STOML1’s role in cholesterol trafficking to late endosomes may intersect with disorders of cholesterol storage (such as Niemann-Pick disease). If STOML1 helps load cholesterol into endo-lysosomes, changes in its expression or function might modify how cells handle excess cholesterol. It is conceivable that in certain metabolic conditions or atherosclerosis, STOML1 levels could affect intracellular lipid distribution. This remains hypothetical, but future research could assess STOML1 in models of lysosomal storage disorders or cholesterol imbalance.  
- **Cancer Therapy:** The NPC findings raise the question of whether STOML1 could be harnessed as a **prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target** in oncology. High STOML1 correlated with better outcomes, so restoring STOML1 expression in tumors (or enhancing its stabilizing effect on FBXW7) might be beneficial. Since FBXW7 loss-of-function is common in cancers, a protein that protects FBXW7 from degradation is inherently appealing. Some researchers have suggested that STOML1 expression could stratify patients or serve as part of a gene signature for predicting prognosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=genes%2C%20including%20stomatin%20like%201,revealed%20improved%20predictive%20accuracy%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20high%20protein,010)). As of 2023, this is still at the research stage; more data from other cancer types are needed. However, the consistent pattern of STOML1’s association with tumor suppression pathways (FBXW7, low c-Myc) provides a mechanistic basis for these clinical correlations.

## Expert Perspectives and Ongoing Research  
Experts view STOML1 as a **multifunctional adapter protein** that links membrane domain biology with cellular signaling. Its dual-domain structure allows it to interact with **lipids, membrane proteins, and cytosolic factors**, making it something of a bridge between the cell membrane (particularly specialized raft regions) and intracellular pathways. **Review articles** in the ion channel field emphasize the importance of stomatin-family proteins for fine-tuning sensory transduction. A 2021 review noted that STOML1’s selective inhibition of ASIC1a (but not ASIC1b) highlights how subtle sequence differences in ion channels can dictate regulation by accessory proteins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=Among%20the%20other%20members%20of,truncation%20eliminated%20the%20sterol%20carrier)). The same review pointed out that truncation of STOML1’s sterol-binding domain abolishes channel regulation, underscoring the unexpected role of a lipid-binding module in electrical signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8555555/#:~:text=slightly%20speeds%20the%20desensitization%20of,21%E2%80%9323)). This has led to speculation that perhaps STOML1 must bind a lipid (like cholesterol) to attain a conformation that interacts with ASIC1a – a hypothesis that blurs the line between **lipid transport and ion channel modulation** (current investigations are looking at whether altering membrane cholesterol content changes STOML1’s effects on ASICs). Structural biologists are also interested in the oligomerization of SPFH proteins: STOML1 likely forms oligomers (homotrimers or higher-order complexes) in membranes similar to stomatin’s donut-shaped oligomers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=functional%20diversity%20of%20stomatin%20domain,10)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20it%20has%20been,28%3B%20Page%20et%20al)). Determining STOML1’s structure (perhaps by cryo-EM) could reveal how its two domains are arranged and how it interfaces with partners like ASIC1a or FBXW7. 

From a cell biology angle, the discovery of STOML1 in the FBXW7 pathway was unexpected, prompting further questions: *How does a late-endosomal protein influence a nuclear ubiquitin ligase?* One idea is that a pool of STOML1 might *not* be membrane-bound; perhaps STOML1 can exist in a soluble form or vesicle-derived form that traffics to the nucleus. Another simpler explanation is that FBXW7-γ may localize to cytosolic/endosomal surfaces (the γ isoform’s unique N-terminus could target it to membranes or the perinuclear region ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=N,but%20is%20not%20well%20studied))), thereby coming into contact with STOML1 on endosomal membranes. Ongoing research is examining where within the cell STOML1–FBXW7 interactions occur, and whether STOML1’s binding alters FBXW7’s E3 ligase activity beyond just stabilizing it. Some **experts in ubiquitin signaling** have commented that STOML1 might represent a new class of “ubiquitin ligase modulators” that shield E3 enzymes from autocatalytic degradation (analogous to how some proteins protect E3s or substrates by sequestering them) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=the%20degradation%20of%20Fbw7,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). If so, STOML1 could be influencing cell cycle progression in tissues like the brain, potentially linking neuronal activity (via ASICs) to cell cycle-related signaling – a novel cross-talk worth exploring. 

## Conclusion  
**STOML1 (Stomatin-like protein 1)** emerges as a versatile protein with roles in **membrane biology, sensory neuron function, and protein turnover regulation**. At the cellular level, STOML1 helps organize specialized lipid-rich endosomal membranes and likely transfers cholesterol within cells, thanks to its sterol-binding domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=with%20detergent,cholesterol%20transfer%20to%20late%20endosomes)). In excitable cells, STOML1 serves as an **auxiliary subunit of proton-gated ion channels**, dampening ASIC-mediated currents – which may modulate pain perception and neuroplasticity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=ability%20of%20stomatin,to%20a%20contribution%20of%20effects)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3934701/#:~:text=reporter%20driven%20from%20the%20STOML1,endogenous%20inhibitory%20function%20for%20STOML1)). On a molecular level, STOML1 can bind to the F-box protein FBXW7 and protect it from degradation, indirectly reinforcing the degradation of oncoproteins like c-Myc ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=implicated%20in%20the%20degradation%20of,%CE%B3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474722/#:~:text=the%20degradation%20of%20Fbw7,1%20may%20have%20opposing%20functions)). This multifaceted functionality positions STOML1 at the intersection of **lipid metabolism, ion channel signaling, and cell proliferation control**. Current research (2023–2024) has highlighted STOML1’s potential clinical relevance – for example, as a **prognostic biomarker in cancers** such as NPC, where high STOML1 correlates with better patient outcomes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=mRNA%20expression%20levels%20of%20STOML1,0.001%5D%2C%20compared%20with%20TNM%20staging)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12329485/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20high%20protein,010)). Going forward, **detailed mechanistic studies** will be crucial to fully elucidate STOML1’s precise role: How does its SCP-2 domain contribute to channel gating? Does STOML1 actively shuttle cholesterol or merely scaffold lipid domains? Can modulating STOML1–FBXW7 interaction be leveraged therapeutically in cancers? As an evolutionarily conserved protein (homologous to C. elegans UNC-24 involved in touch sensation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2781465/#:~:text=The%20C,24%20gene%20controls%20the))), STOML1 represents a significant piece in the puzzle of how cells coordinate membrane composition with signaling pathways. The latest evidence solidifies STOML1 as an important, if somewhat underappreciated, regulator of cellular function – **integrating membrane microdomain dynamics with both nervous system activity and cell cycle regulation**, a convergence that offers exciting avenues for future investigation.
