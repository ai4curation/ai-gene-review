## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UBI4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stomatin-like protein 1; Short=SLP-1; AltName: Full=EPB72-like protein 1; AltName: Full=Protein unc-24 homolog; AltName: Full=Stomatin-related protein; Short=STORP;
- **Gene Information:** Name=STOML1; Synonyms=SLP1, UNC24; ORFNames=MSTP019;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Band-7_stomatin-like. (IPR043202); Band_7. (IPR001107); Band_7/SPFH_dom_sf. (IPR036013); SCP2_sterol-bd_dom. (IPR003033); SCP2_sterol-bd_dom_sf. (IPR036527)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "STOML1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'STOML1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **STOML1** (gene ID: STOML1, UniProt: Q9UBI4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview: We verified target identity for human STOML1 (UniProt Q9UBI4) and gathered primary evidence defining its domains, subcellular localization, targeting signal, interaction partners, and functional roles, with emphasis on endolysosomal biology, ion channel modulation, and recent proteomics. We synthesized quantitative findings where available and prioritized recent sources (2024) when relevant.

Gene/protein identity and key concepts
- Identity and family: STOML1 encodes stomatin-like protein 1 (SLP-1), a SPFH/band-7 family protein with a bipartite architecture: an N-terminal stomatin-like (SPFH) domain and a C-terminal sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) domain. This architecture supports a role in lipid/sterol handling and membrane microdomain biology (2009 Journal of Biological Chemistry). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993 (published Oct 2009). (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2)
- Definition and distinguishing features: Unlike stomatin, which prominently localizes to the plasma membrane, human STOML1/SLP-1 is targeted primarily to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies and contains an endosomal targeting signal (see below). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 2-3, mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 3-5)

Subcellular localization, targeting signals, and molecular interactions
- Localization: STOML1 localizes to perinuclear multivesicular bodies/late endosomes; it co-localizes with LAMP-2, Rab7, and Rab9, but not early/recycling endosome markers such as Rab5 or transferrin receptor. Confocal microscopy, immuno-EM, and fractionation support this localization. URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993 (Oct 2009). (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 3-5)
- Targeting signal: An N-terminal GYXXΦ motif (Φ = bulky hydrophobic residue) mediates endosomal targeting. Mutations (e.g., Y6A, L9S) misdirect STOML1 to the plasma membrane, indicating the motif is necessary for late endosomal localization. URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 2-3)
- Interactions: STOML1 directly interacts with stomatin (co-immunoprecipitation), and overexpression of STOML1 redistributes stomatin from the plasma membrane to late endosomes, consistent with complex formation in detergent-resistant membranes. URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2)
- TRPML1 association: STOML1 co-immunoprecipitates strongly with lysosomal cation channel TRPML1 (MCOLN1) in mammalian cells (HeLa and RAW264.7 macrophages), consistent with an endolysosomal functional context (PLoS ONE 2013). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056780 (Feb 2013). (spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6)

Molecular function and pathway roles
- Lipid/sterol handling: The C-terminal SCP-2 domain implicates STOML1 in sterol/lipid transfer within endolysosomal membranes. Under conditions of blocked cholesterol efflux from late endosomes, STOML1 expression induces enlarged, cholesterol-rich, weakly LAMP-2–positive acidic vesicles; this phenotype requires the SCP-2 domain, indicating a role in cholesterol handling at late endosomes/lysosomes (JBC 2009). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2, mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 2-3)
- Endolysosomal trafficking: STOML1 is found on the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies and participates in late endosomal membrane biology; redistribution of stomatin to late endosomes by STOML1 suggests coordinated SPFH-protein scaffolding in this compartment (JBC 2009). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 3-5)
- Ion channel regulation: STOML1 modulates acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in sensory neurons. It strongly inhibits ASIC1a-mediated proton currents and accelerates ASIC3 inactivation, with no inhibition of ASIC2a. The SCP-2 domain is necessary for ASIC1a modulation. STOML1 is expressed in approximately half of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; STOML1−/− DRG neurons show larger proton-gated currents. For example, at pH 4.0, T-current inactivation time was 1243 ± 57 ms (wild-type) versus 1596 ± 80 ms (knockout), P < 0.01 (J Physiol 2014). URL: https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.258657 (Jan 2014). (kozlenkov2014subunitspecificinhibitionof pages 8-10)
- TRPML1-linked processes: The biochemical interaction with TRPML1 places STOML1 in proximity to pathways involved in lysosomal Ca2+ signaling, membrane trafficking, and autophagosome–lysosome fusion, although direct mechanistic roles for STOML1 in autophagy/mitophagy have not been demonstrated by the gathered sources (PLoS ONE 2013). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056780. (spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6)

Recent developments (2023–2024) and datasets
- EV proteomics (2024): STOML1 appears among proteins detected in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from nucleus pulposus cells in a December 2024 bioRxiv preprint. The study’s quantitative proteomics catalogs endosome/lysosome and exosome-associated proteins, supporting the view that STOML1 can be packaged into vesicles, consistent with its endolysosomal localization. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.628054 (posted Dec 14, 2024). (samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 36-38, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 33-35, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 38-39)
- 2023–2024 targeted functional studies specifically on human STOML1 were not identified in our evidence set; however, the above 2024 proteomic mention supports ongoing interest in STOML1 within vesicle/endolysosomal proteomes. (samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 36-38, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 33-35, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 38-39)

Physiological and disease-relevant contexts
- Tissue expression and neuronal function: STOML1 is reported in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and in about half of DRG neurons, aligning with roles in neuronal acid sensing via ASIC modulation (JBC 2009; J Physiol 2014). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993; https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.258657. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2, kozlenkov2014subunitspecificinhibitionof pages 8-10)
- Lysosomal channel networks: STOML1’s association with TRPML1 suggests potential relevance to lysosome function and associated disorders, but the gathered evidence demonstrates interaction rather than causality in disease (PLoS ONE 2013). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056780. (spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6)

Quantitative and mechanistic details
- Endosomal targeting: Mutation of the N-terminal GYXXΦ motif (e.g., Y6A or L9S) redirects STOML1 to the plasma membrane, demonstrating necessity of this motif for late endosomal localization (JBC 2009). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 2-3)
- ASIC modulation: STOML1 inhibits ASIC1a current amplitude and accelerates ASIC3 inactivation; in STOML1−/− DRG neurons, proton-gated currents are larger. An example quantitative comparison at pH 4.0 showed T-current inactivation 1243 ± 57 ms (WT) versus 1596 ± 80 ms (KO), P < 0.01 (J Physiol 2014). URL: https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2013.258657. (kozlenkov2014subunitspecificinhibitionof pages 8-10)
- Cholesterol handling phenotype: Under blocked cholesterol efflux (e.g., pharmacologic conditions), STOML1 expression induces large, cholesterol-filled, weakly LAMP-2–positive acidic vesicles; this requires the SCP-2 domain (JBC 2009). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2, mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 3-5)

Current applications and implementations
- Research applications: The validated localization signal (GYXXΦ) and SCP-2 dependence provide experimental handles for dissecting endolysosomal targeting and lipid handling. The interaction with TRPML1 offers a route to study lysosomal ion channel complexes via co-IP and imaging in macrophage and epithelial cell models (PLoS ONE 2013; JBC 2009). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056780; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.014993. (spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6, mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2)
- Proteomics and vesicle biology: 2024 sEV proteomics place STOML1 within vesicle cargo lists, supporting its consideration as a marker or component in endolysosomal/exosomal proteome studies in musculoskeletal niches (bioRxiv 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.628054. (samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 36-38, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 33-35, samanta2024smallextracellularvesicles pages 38-39)

Expert analysis and current understanding
- Primary function: STOML1 is a monotopic endolysosomal membrane protein that scaffolds with stomatin family partners and likely contributes to lipid/sterol transfer and compartmental membrane organization via its SCP-2 domain. It modulates acid-sensing ion channels in neurons and physically associates with lysosomal TRPML1, suggesting a broader role in endolysosomal signal–trafficking interfaces. No catalytic enzymatic activity has been demonstrated; functions are mediated by protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions (JBC 2009; J Physiol 2014; PLoS ONE 2013). URLs above. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 1-2, kozlenkov2014subunitspecificinhibitionof pages 8-10, spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6)
- Cellular location of action: The limiting membrane of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies is the primary site, with potential transient presence in vesicular carriers that interact with the plasma membrane in neurons. ASIC modulation indicates functional consequences at or near the cell surface in neurons, while the predominant pool is endolysosomal (JBC 2009; J Physiol 2014). URLs above. (mairhofer2009stomatinlikeprotein1interacts pages 3-5, kozlenkov2014subunitspecificinhibitionof pages 8-10)
- 2023–2024 perspective: Although no 2023–2024 mechanistic studies on human STOML1 were captured in our evidence set, the 2024 sEV proteomic detection underscores ongoing attention to STOML1 in vesicle/endolysosomal proteomics and supports its inclusion in updated pathway maps for vesicle-mediated processes (bioRxiv 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.628054.

Limitations and open questions
- Direct roles in autophagy/mitophagy have not been established by the sources gathered here; the TRPML1 association suggests possible relevance, but causal evidence specific to STOML1 remains limited in the published literature we reviewed. Future work should test whether STOML1 affects autophagosome–lysosome fusion or lysosomal Ca2+ signaling in a STOML1-dependent manner (PLoS ONE 2013). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0056780. (spooner2013systematicscreensfor pages 5-6)
- Disease associations: While family members (e.g., stomatin, STOML2/3) have broader disease links, our collected sources did not provide validated, direct causal associations for human STOML1. More large-scale genetic and functional studies would help clarify potential disease relevance.
