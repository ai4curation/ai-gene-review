## Question

Research the PRG2 (P13727) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **PRG2 gene (P13727)** encodes **eosinophil major basic protein (MBP)**, a cytotoxic and immunomodulatory protein predominantly found in eosinophil granules, with key roles in immune defense, allergic inflammation, and tissue remodeling[1][3][9].

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  - **Cytotoxin and helminthotoxin:** MBP is toxic to helminths, bacteria, and mammalian cells, contributing to antiparasitic defense[1][3][9].
  - **Histamine release:** MBP induces non-cytolytic histamine release from basophils and mast cells, promoting allergic responses[1][3][9].
  - **Carbohydrate and heparin binding:** MBP binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces, acting as an intercellular signal modulator in inflammation[1][3][4].
  - **Proteinase inhibitor:** The proform of MBP inhibits pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA)[1][3][4].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  - **Antiparasitic defense mechanisms**  
  - **Immune hypersensitivity reactions**  
  - **Negative regulation of macrophage cytokine production**  
  - **Tissue damage and remodeling in allergic diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic myositis)**[1][2][3][4][12]

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  - **Granule core of eosinophils:** MBP is the main constituent of eosinophil granules[1][3].
  - **Secreted protein:** MBP is released extracellularly, especially during eosinophil activation[4][7].
  - **Detected in placenta and pregnancy serum:** Exists as a complex with PAPPA, angiotensinogen (AGT), and C3dg[1][3].

---

### 2. Protein Domains

- **Lectin_C domain (PF00059):**  
  MBP has a fold similar to C-type lectins (sugar-binding proteins), but does not bind calcium or typical lectin carbohydrates; instead, it binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans[3][4][7].
- **Signal region:**  
  Amino acids 1–16, indicating secretion[4][7].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Protein complexes:**  
  - MBP forms complexes with **PAPPA**, **AGT**, and **C3dg** in pregnancy serum[1][3].
- **Cellular targets:**  
  - **Basophils and mast cells:** Induces histamine release[1][3][9].
  - **Neutrophils and macrophages:** Activates these cells, contributing to inflammation[2][3].
  - **Respiratory epithelial cells:** Synergizes with pathogens to provoke cell death and cytokine release[2].

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Dermatographia:**  
  Associated with hypersensitivity and skin reactions[1].
- **Hypereosinophilic syndrome:**  
  Linked to excessive eosinophil activity and tissue damage[1].
- **Allergic diseases:**  
  MBP is implicated in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and other allergic conditions due to its role in epithelial damage and bronchospasm[1][2][3].
- **Pregnancy-related disorders:**  
  Altered MBP levels and complexes in pregnancy serum may be relevant to placental function[1][3].
- **Cancer:**  
  Emerging evidence suggests PRG2 may act as a tumor suppressor in certain hematologic malignancies, with overexpression linked to inactivation of STAT3 and increased drug sensitivity[2].

---

### 5. Recent Developments and Latest Research (2023–2024)

- **Tumor suppressor role:**  
  Recent studies indicate PRG2 overexpression in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloproliferative cells leads to STAT3 inactivation and enhanced drug sensitivity, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor function[2].
- **Biomarker potential:**  
  PRG2 expression and circulating proMBP levels are being investigated as biomarkers in hematologic disorders[2].
- **Structural studies:**  
  Crystallographic structures of MBP have been determined, confirming its lectin-like fold and heparan sulfate binding specificity[3].

### 6. Statistics and Data

- **Protein length:**  
  222 amino acids[4][7].
- **Molecular weight:**  
  25,205 Da[4][7].
- **Theoretical pI:**  
  6.64[4][7].

---

### 7. Expert Opinions and Authoritative Analysis

- **GeneCards, UniProt, and NCBI** consistently describe PRG2/MBP as a key effector in eosinophil-mediated immunity and allergic inflammation, with well-established cytotoxic and immunomodulatory functions[1][3][6][9][11].
- **Recent research** highlights its emerging roles in cancer biology and as a biomarker, expanding its relevance beyond classical allergic and parasitic contexts[2].
