## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene PRG2 (P13727) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Gene PRG2 (P13727) – Eosinophil Major Basic Protein (MBP) in Human

## Introduction and Gene Overview  
The **PRG2 gene** (Proteoglycan 2) encodes **eosinophil major basic protein 1 (MBP-1)**, a highly cationic protein that is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core in eosinophil granules ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,positive%20bacteria%2C%20Gram)). MBP-1 is often simply called **Major Basic Protein** for its abundance and strong basicity; it is also known as **bone marrow proteoglycan** (BMPG) and was historically termed **pregnancy-associated major basic protein** due to its presence in the placenta ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/schema/instance/browser/uniprot%3AP13727#:~:text=,associated%20major%20basic%20protein%20%2Fcomponent)). The mature MBP-1 protein is relatively small (~13.8 kDa) and extremely basic (isoelectric point ≈11.4) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=Eosinophil%20Major%20Basic%20Protein)). It is stored in eosinophils – a type of white blood cell – and released during immune responses. Broadly, MBP-1 serves dual roles as a **toxic effector molecule in host defense** (particularly against parasites) and as a mediator of **inflammatory tissue damage** in allergic conditions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=complex%20with%20several%20other%20proteins,Alternatively)). The PRG2 gene product is therefore central to eosinophil function, with a unique biology that spans roles in **immunity, inflammation, and even pregnancy**.

## Protein Structure and Processing  
PRG2/MBP-1 is synthesized as a precursor (*prepro-MBP*) that undergoes post-translational processing. The nascent polypeptide (222 amino acids in humans) includes an N-terminal signal peptide and a **prosegment** (~9 kDa) followed by the C-terminal **mature MBP** (~117 amino acids) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=basic%20protein,secretory%20apparatus%2C%20and%20SGrs%20are)). The prosegment is **acidic and heavily glycosylated**, in stark contrast to the arginine-rich basic mature domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=protein%20is%20initially%20expressed%20as,neutrophils%20and%20platelets%2C%20and%20augments)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=thiol%20groups%20,50)). This charge polarization is so extreme that the protein has been likened to a “magnet” of opposing ends ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). Functionally, the acidic pro-piece is thought to **neutralize the toxicity** of MBP during its synthesis and packaging – essentially acting as an intramolecular chaperone to protect the eosinophil from its own toxic protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=protein%20is%20initially%20expressed%20as,neutrophils%20and%20platelets%2C%20and%20augments)). Indeed, the prosegment carries multiple **glycans (N-linked, O-linked, and even glycosaminoglycan chains)**, which raise the precursor’s molecular mass to ~30–50 kDa and mask the highly basic charge of MBP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=thiol%20groups%20,50)). This explains the gene’s name “proteoglycan 2.” Upon eosinophil maturation, the prosegment is proteolytically **cleaved in the Golgi/secretory granule**, yielding the **active 13.8-kDa MBP** that is stored in granules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=protein%20is%20initially%20expressed%20as,neutrophils%20and%20platelets%2C%20and%20augments)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=basic%20protein,secretory%20apparatus%2C%20and%20SGrs%20are)). Notably, the *proMBP* remains non-covalently associated until granule storage is complete. Both the full-length proMBP and the crystallized form of MBP are **non-toxic** inside the cell, whereas the freed, soluble MBP is highly cytotoxic ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=basic%20protein,secretory%20apparatus%2C%20and%20SGrs%20are)). This clever strategy ensures that eosinophils can produce and stockpile a potent toxin without self-harm.

Structurally, mature MBP-1 has an **fold similar to C-type lectins** (carbohydrate-binding proteins), although it is not a classical calcium-dependent lectin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=The%20three,It%20is)). Crystal structure analysis revealed that MBP-1’s topology aligns with the lectin family, sharing weak sequence homology (~23–28%) to C-type lectin domains and even to the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=heavily%20glycosylated%20with%20N,42)). However, MBP lacks the Ca²⁺-binding sites of typical lectins and instead presents a highly cationic surface for ligand binding ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=The%20three,It%20is)). In fact, MBP-1 can bind strongly to **sulfated polysaccharides** like heparin and heparan sulfate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=binding%20site%20in%20MBP,wide%20variety%20of%20sulfated%20ligands)). A co-crystal of MBP-1 with a heparin fragment showed the basic region engaging the sulfate groups, suggesting that **heparan sulfate in tissues or on pathogens may be a physiological ligand** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=binding%20site%20in%20MBP,wide%20variety%20of%20sulfated%20ligands)). This heparin-binding property is also pharmacologically relevant: polyanionic compounds (e.g. heparin or polyglutamate) readily bind and neutralize MBP’s positive charges, thereby inhibiting its toxic effects ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=biological%20fluids%20%28e,1%20into%20the%20mouse)). 

## Localization and Expression  
**Cellular localization:** Within eosinophils, MBP-1 is stored in large **secondary (specific) granules**. It is highly concentrated in the **electron-dense crystalline core** of these granules, forming paracrystalline arrays due to its propensity to self-aggregate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=SGr%20in%20mature%20eosinophils%20contain,1%20are%20nontoxic%5E%7B%2016%2C10)). Electron microscopy of mature eosinophils shows each granule with a dense core composed largely of MBP-1, surrounded by a matrix containing other eosinophil proteins. MBP-1 is the single most abundant protein in these granule cores ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,protein%20contains%20a%20peptide%20that)). This crystalline packing not only fits a large amount of protein into the granule, but also keeps MBP sequestered in an inactive crystalline state until the eosinophil is activated. 

**Secretion:** Upon eosinophil activation (for example, by parasites, allergens, or cytokine stimuli), MBP-1 is **released by degranulation**. The protein then localizes to the **extracellular space** at sites of inflammation or infection. In disease settings like allergic asthma, substantial amounts of MBP are found in fluids and tissues – it has been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, and tissue sections where eosinophils have degranulated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=enzymes%20within%20tissues.%20MBP,in%20tissue%20damage%20associated%20with)). MBP can also adhere to cell surfaces: an older study showed MBP coating the surface of basophils in some conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=match%20at%20L685%20J,Google%20Scholar)), and MBP released in tissues may bind to negatively charged matrix components (consistent with its heparan sulfate affinity). In short, MBP is stored intracellularly in eosinophils but carries out its functions **extracellularly** after secretion.

**Tissue expression:** PRG2 is *predominantly expressed in eosinophil-lineage cells* (developing in the bone marrow under IL-5 stimulation). However, a remarkable aspect of PRG2 is its high expression in the **placenta** during pregnancy. In fact, PRG2 is among the most highly expressed genes in the placenta, and its product (proMBP) is released into the maternal circulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). In pregnancy, proMBP is found in **serum as part of large protein complexes** (described below). Low levels of circulating proMBP in the first trimester have been linked to adverse outcomes such as Down syndrome, highlighting its value as a biomarker ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). Outside of pregnancy, healthy individuals have very low levels of proMBP in blood; by contrast, in eosinophil-associated diseases (like hypereosinophilic syndrome or parasitic infections), **elevated MBP** can sometimes be detected in serum or urine as a result of mass eosinophil degranulation ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRG2#:~:text=PRG2%20,of%20this%20gene%20is%20PRG3)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)).

## Antiparasitic and Antimicrobial Functions  
One of the primary roles of MBP-1 is in **host defense against parasites**, especially helminth worms. Eosinophils accumulate during parasitic infections, and MBP is a key toxin they deploy. **MBP is directly toxic to many parasites (helminths)** – it can damage or kill parasite larvae by disrupting their outer membranes and cuticle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=transport%2C%20and%20packaging%20in%20the,1%20induces)). In vitro, purified MBP causes marked ultrastructural damage to schistosome larvae and other helminths, correlating with eosinophils’ known ability to kill these parasites. In vivo experimental evidence strongly supports MBP’s anti-parasitic function. For example, in a mouse model of **Strongyloides** worm infection, eosinophils use an MBP-dependent mechanism to kill the larvae: mice lacking MBP show significantly impaired larval killing compared to wild-type ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3191984/#:~:text=infections%20with%20S,a%20significant%20impairment%20in%20larval)). Similarly, a recent study demonstrated that eosinophils from mice **knockout for MBP-1** have a diminished ability to immobilize and kill filarial worm *microfilariae*. Eosinophil extracellular traps (DNA-based nets) from MBP-deficient mice were much less effective at ensnaring parasites, and supplementation of exogenous MBP restored parasite killing in a dose-dependent manner ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11902130/#:~:text=mice%20that%20lack%20eosinophil%20peroxidase,examined%20eosinophils%20from%20the%20natural)). These findings confirm that MBP is a **crucial effector molecule** for anti-helminth immunity in mammals. 

Beyond worms, MBP-1 exhibits broad **antimicrobial activity**. The protein’s strong cationic nature allows it to bind and disrupt microbial cell membranes, akin to a host defense peptide. Indeed, **MBP has demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects on bacteria and fungi** as well ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)). Notably, the MBP sequence contains a region that acts like an antimicrobial peptide; synthetic peptides derived from MBP can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeast and other fungi ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)). Thus, MBP can be considered part of the innate immune arsenal against a range of pathogens. It is one of several eosinophil granule proteins (along with eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) that have **toxic, non-specific antimicrobial properties**. These cationic toxins are thought to supplement the immune response especially in conditions where targets (like large parasites) cannot be easily phagocytosed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=transport%2C%20and%20packaging%20in%20the,1%20induces)). However, their broad toxicity means they can damage host tissues as well, a theme discussed below.

## Immunomodulatory and Inflammatory Roles  
While MBP contributes to parasite killing, it is also a **potent immunomodulator** that can exacerbate inflammation. MBP released from activated eosinophils influences other immune cells and the surrounding tissue in multiple ways:

- **Mast cell and basophil activation:** MBP can trigger the degranulation of mast cells and basophils *without* directly lysing them (termed non-cytolytic degranulation). It induces these cells to release **histamine and other mediators**, which fuel allergic inflammation ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRG2#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)). In laboratory experiments, very low concentrations of MBP provoke significant histamine release from human basophils, linking eosinophil activity to immediate hypersensitivity reactions. This effect helps explain how eosinophils amplify allergic responses – by dumping MBP, they cause mast cells and basophils to further release histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines, creating a positive feedback loop of inflammation.

- **Neutrophil and platelet activation:** MBP has been shown to activate **neutrophils**, causing them to produce superoxide (a reactive oxygen species) at an enhanced rate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=damage%20helminths%2C%20bacteria%2C%20and%20mammalian,monkey%20lung%20and%20induces%20transient)). It also can cause **platelet aggregation** and activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=damage%20helminths%2C%20bacteria%2C%20and%20mammalian,from%20patients)). In fact, a classic study found that purified MBP could directly activate platelets, which may contribute to tissue injury (through microthrombi formation) in eosinophil-rich inflammation. These interactions position MBP as a **paracrine signaling molecule** that instructs or enhances the activity of other leukocytes.

- **Epithelial toxicity:** MBP is directly toxic to host cells. Its cationic, detergent-like properties allow it to damage mammalian cell membranes, causing cell death or dysfunction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=transport%2C%20and%20packaging%20in%20the,1%20induces)). In tissues infiltrated by eosinophils, MBP can injure **epithelial cell layers**, leading to denudation (exfoliation) of mucosal surfaces ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)). For example, in chronic asthma or eosinophilic esophagitis, MBP released onto airway or esophageal epithelium is implicated in the **shedding of epithelial cells** and disruption of barrier function. Biopsies from such conditions often show deposition of MBP on damaged epithelium, correlating eosinophil activity with local tissue injury.

- **Bronchospasm and nerve effects:** One of the most significant pathological actions of MBP in asthma is its effect on nerves controlling airway smooth muscle. MBP binds to **M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors** on parasympathetic neurons in the lung and acts as an **allosteric antagonist** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=MBP,1%2C%20consistent%20with%20structural%20findings)). Under normal conditions, M2 receptors on vagal nerves serve as an inhibitory feedback mechanism – they limit acetylcholine release and thus prevent excessive bronchoconstriction. MBP, however, can occupy and block these receptors, **preventing the inhibitory signal**. The result is unrestrained acetylcholine release leading to heightened bronchoconstriction. In essence, MBP causes **hyperreactive airways** by disabling the “brake” on vagal bronchoconstrictor pathways ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563124/#:~:text=eosinophil%20granules%20are%20responsible%20for,19)). Experimental studies in guinea pigs and primates have demonstrated this clearly: instilling MBP into the airways causes acute **bronchospasm and airway hyperresponsiveness** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=biological%20fluids%20%28e,1%20into%20the%20mouse)), whereas administering an MBP-neutralizing antibody or polyanionic heparin *protects* the animals’ M2 receptors and prevents the bronchospasm ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563124/#:~:text=eosinophil%20granules%20are%20responsible%20for,19)). This mechanism highlights MBP as a key mediator of the bronchial hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma, linking eosinophil infiltration to nerve dysfunction in the lungs. 

- **Enzyme inhibition and ECM modification:** MBP has been found to bind and modulate certain enzymes. Notably, MBP-1 is a **potent inhibitor of heparanase**, the enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate in extracellular matrices ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=polyglutamic%20acids.%20MBP,1)). In fact, MBP was identified as the first known endogenous **heparanase inhibitor** in humans ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=match%20at%20L777%20J,Google%20Scholar)). By binding to heparanase (or to its heparan sulfate substrates), MBP can prevent extracellular matrix degradation. This might limit tissue damage in some contexts, but in others it could interfere with normal tissue remodeling or immune cell migration. MBP also binds to **lactoferrin** (an iron-binding immune protein) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=polyglutamic%20acids.%20MBP,1)), though the consequence of this interaction is not fully clear; it might localize MBP to sites rich in lactoferrin (such as inflammatory exudates) or modulate microbial growth indirectly via lactoferrin. These examples illustrate that MBP’s highly charged surface enables it to engage a variety of molecules, sometimes acting as an inhibitor when it forms tight complexes (as seen again with proMBP and PAPP-A below).

- **Tissue remodeling and fibrosis:** In chronic settings, MBP contributes to longer-term changes in tissues. Experiments where MBP was directly introduced into animal airways showed that it can **induce expression of TGF-β** (a profibrotic cytokine) and **matrix metalloproteinase-1** in airway epithelium, promoting **fibrosis and tissue remodeling** in the bronchi ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=binds%20lactoferrin%20,44)). Repeated or sustained release of MBP in tissues is thought to drive **fibrosis**, as seen in asthma (subepithelial fibrosis of airways) and even outside the lung. For instance, in models of **muscular dystrophy**, eosinophils infiltrate damaged muscle; MBP released by these eosinophils was shown to lyse muscle cells and stimulate fibrosis in the muscle tissue, hindering regeneration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=airway%20induces%20airway%20remodeling%2C%20including,44)). Thus, MBP can fundamentally alter tissue structure over time, turning an acute inflammatory response into chronic pathological remodeling. This fibrogenic effect is particularly concerning in diseases like eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, chronic asthma, or hypereosinophilic syndrome, where prolonged high levels of MBP in tissues lead to scarring and loss of normal organ function. 

Collectively, these activities establish MBP as a **major mediator of immune pathology**: it is instrumental in killing invaders, but it is equally capable of causing collateral damage. Elevated MBP levels have been correlated with disease severity in asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and other eosinophil-driven conditions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)). For this reason, MBP (and eosinophil granule proteins in general) are targets of therapeutic interest – for example, therapies that reduce eosinophils (like anti-IL-5 antibodies) ultimately reduce MBP release and can alleviate eosinophil-related tissue damage.

## ProMBP in Pregnancy and Extracellular Complexes  
Beyond its role in eosinophils, the PRG2 gene product has a fascinating function in the context of **pregnancy**. During human pregnancy, the **placenta expresses PRG2 abundantly**, producing and secreting the **proMBP** form into the maternal circulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). This *proform* of MBP (often called **pregnancy-associated MBP**) does **not** get cleaved and stored in granules, but instead is released as a soluble, circulating protein. In maternal blood, proMBP does not remain free; it **forms disulfide-linked complexes with several other proteins**, effectively acting as a binding partner and inhibitor. The best-characterized interaction is with **pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A)**, a metalloprotease produced by the placenta. ProMBP and PAPP-A form a **1:1 complex** (often referred to as PAPP-A/proMBP) in which proMBP **inhibits the protease activity** of PAPP-A ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRG2#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)). PAPP-A’s normal function is to cleave insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), thereby increasing local availability of IGF for fetal growth. By inhibiting PAPP-A, proMBP likely **modulates IGF signaling in the placenta**, helping to fine-tune fetal growth and maternal adaptation ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRG2#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)). 

ProMBP appears to be a broad-range **proteinase inhibitor** in circulation. In addition to PAPP-A, proMBP binds **angiotensinogen (AGT)** and **complement C3dg** (a fragment of complement C3) to form a larger complex ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=crystalline%20core%20of%20the%20eosinophil,Alternatively)). In the case of angiotensinogen, studies have noted a high-molecular-weight form of AGT in pregnancy serum that includes proMBP, though the functional consequence is not fully understood ([bioone.org](https://bioone.org/journals/biology-of-reproduction/volume-84/issue-6/biolreprod.110.090209/Placental-Regulation-of-Peptide-Hormone-and-Growth-Factor-Activity-by/10.1095/biolreprod.110.090209.full#:~:text=component%20of%20high,induced%20hypertension)). It has been speculated that such complexes could influence blood pressure regulation or immune functions in pregnancy (for example, abnormal PAPP-A/proMBP or AGT/proMBP complexes have been investigated in preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension ([bioone.org](https://bioone.org/journals/biology-of-reproduction/volume-84/issue-6/biolreprod.110.090209/Placental-Regulation-of-Peptide-Hormone-and-Growth-Factor-Activity-by/10.1095/biolreprod.110.090209.full#:~:text=component%20of%20high,induced%20hypertension))). The binding to C3dg suggests a potential role in the complement system, perhaps by sequestering complement fragments. Overall, **proMBP serves as a carrier and inhibitor molecule** outside the eosinophil context, a stark contrast to the destructive role of the mature MBP in eosinophils.

From a clinical standpoint, the **PAPP-A/proMBP complex is an important biomarker**. PAPP-A (historically measured together with proMBP) is used in first-trimester prenatal screening: abnormally low levels of PAPP-A (hence proMBP) in maternal serum are associated with fetal chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome and with poor pregnancy outcomes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). In essence, if the placenta is not producing enough proMBP (and PAPP-A), it can signal placental dysfunction. This has made PRG2 indirectly part of obstetric care protocols – for example, **Down syndrome screening tests** include measurements of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex in maternal blood (typically at 10–13 weeks of gestation). Outside of pregnancy, there is emerging interest in the proMBP–PAPP-A interaction in other diseases; notably, elevated circulating PAPP-A/proMBP complexes have been observed in patients with cardiovascular disease (e.g. unstable angina or heart failure), where they may have prognostic significance ([vbn.aau.dk](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/pregnancy-associated-plasma-protein-a-papp-a-and-the-proform-of-t#:~:text=eosinophil%20major%20basic%20protein%20,death%20in%20heart%20failure%20patients)). This suggests that the PRG2 gene product, via proMBP, might have regulatory roles in other physiological or pathological processes that involve metalloproteinase activity and IGF signaling.

It is worth emphasizing that **proMBP itself is not cytotoxic** – the *acidic prosegment renders it inert as a toxin*. In fact, proMBP can be viewed as a natural “inhibitory antibody” of sorts, keeping a dangerous protein (MBP) in a benign, soluble state. Consistent with this, **isolated proMBP and the intact MBP crystalloid core are harmless**, whereas the released, fully basic MBP is highly toxic to cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=basic%20protein,secretory%20apparatus%2C%20and%20SGrs%20are)). This dichotomy – a single gene product having a toxic effector form and an inhibitory carrier form – is a remarkable adaptation. It allows PRG2 to play roles in two very different arenas: innate immune defense and endocrine regulation. Evolution may have repurposed this protein, leveraging its strong binding abilities in the bloodstream while exploiting its cytotoxic potential in granulocytes.

## Evolutionary Notes and Gene Family  
The existence of a proform with distinct function hints at evolutionary tinkering. MBP-1 is part of a small gene family in primates. Humans have a **paralogous gene, PRG3,** which encodes **MBP-2**, a protein expressed exclusively in eosinophils and highly similar to MBP-1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=A%20homologue%20of%20MBP,utility%20has%20not%20been%20evaluated)). MBP-2 shares ~66% amino acid identity with MBP-1 and is also stored in eosinophil granules. However, MBP-2 is less basic (pI ~8.7) and, in head-to-head comparisons, **MBP-1 is more potent** in activities like cell killing and triggering mediator release ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=A%20homologue%20of%20MBP,but%20its%20utility%20has%20not)). The functional redundancy of having two major basic proteins is not fully clear; MBP-2 might serve as a backup or modulate eosinophil activity in subtle ways. Some researchers have proposed using MBP-2 as a more specific marker of eosinophil involvement in disease, since MBP-1 can come from placenta as well ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=MBP,but%20its%20utility%20has%20not)). An interesting finding in mice (which have a single Mbp gene) illustrates a possible evolutionary pressure: mice engineered to lack MBP-1 or eosinophil peroxidase individually still develop eosinophils, but **when both toxins were knocked out, the mice could not produce mature eosinophils** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=allergic%20diseases%20likely%20occurred%20via,iii%29%20most%20likely%2C%20dysfunctional)). The double-knockout animals had a selective block in eosinophilopoiesis, suggesting that producing these granule proteins is somehow required for eosinophil development or survival ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=knockouts%20unexpectedly%20generated%20a%20novel,EARs%29%20capable%20of%20degrading)). One hypothesis is that without the major granule proteins, developing eosinophils suffer unstored toxic intermediates or fail a “granule integrity” checkpoint, leading to cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=the%20mechanism%20for%20the%20eosinophil,EARs%29%20capable%20of%20degrading)). This underscores the idea that the **toxic granule proteins (MBP-1, EPO, etc.) co-evolved with the eosinophil lineage and are integral to its identity and viability**. In evolutionary terms, PRG2’s protein domain belongs to the **C-type lectin superfamily**, but it has diverged to acquire unique features (like extreme basic charge and a long anionic propeptide) that equip eosinophils for their specialized role in parasite immunity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=heavily%20glycosylated%20with%20N,42)).

## Conclusion and Clinical Significance  
**PRG2/Major Basic Protein 1** emerges as a multifaceted protein central to eosinophil function. Its **primary role** is as a **cytotoxic effector**: MBP-1 enables eosinophils to kill parasites and microbes that are too large for phagocytosis, by **permeabilizing membranes and disrupting pathogens** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=transport%2C%20and%20packaging%20in%20the,1%20induces)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11902130/#:~:text=mice%20that%20lack%20eosinophil%20peroxidase,examined%20eosinophils%20from%20the%20natural)). This makes it a crucial component of the immune response to helminth infections and certain extracellular microbes. At the same time, MBP-1 is a **double-edged sword** – when released in our tissues, it can cause collateral damage leading to **inflammation, bronchospasm, and tissue remodeling** in allergic diseases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=biological%20fluids%20%28e,1%20into%20the%20mouse)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=5553#:~:text=in%20antiparasitic%20defense%20mechanisms%20as,Alternatively)). Its ability to activate other immune cells and injure host epithelia links eosinophils to conditions like asthma (where MBP-induced nerve dysfunction causes hyperreactive airways) and atopic dermatitis or chronic urticaria (where MBP damages skin cells and nerve endings, contributing to itching and welts). Thus, MBP is a key mediator of both protective immunity and pathological hypersensitivity. 

From a **biochemical perspective**, PRG2 is a striking example of how nature packs a potent molecule into a safe storage form: the inactive, acidic **proMBP** ensures that eosinophils don’t self-destruct and even allows the protein to moonlight in the circulation as a **metalloproteinase inhibitor** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRG2#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)). In pregnancy, this has vital implications for regulating fetal growth factors and has made proMBP a useful **clinical marker** for prenatal screening ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270431/#:~:text=The%20gene%20PRG2%2C%20encoding%20the,length)). The discovery that proMBP binds PAPP-A and other proteins opened up new understanding of maternal-fetal biology and even suggested roles in cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, intense research in immunology has solidified MBP’s importance in diseases: for instance, therapies targeting eosinophils (such as anti-IL-5 antibodies like mepolizumab) are effective in part because they reduce MBP levels and thereby reduce eosinophil-driven tissue damage. MBP itself has been studied as a drug target; although neutralizing MBP in vivo is challenging, the knowledge that **heparin can bind MBP and mitigate its effects** led to studies using heparin or heparin-mimetics to alleviate asthma symptoms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067173/#:~:text=biological%20fluids%20%28e,1%20into%20the%20mouse)). To date, the most successful approach is upstream – preventing MBP release by controlling eosinophils.

In summary, **PRG2 (MBP)** is an essential gene in human immunity with a well-defined protein product that acts in specific locations: **inside eosinophil granules and at sites of eosinophilic inflammation**. Decades of research, from the biochemical characterization of its highly basic, arginine-rich composition to recent high-resolution structural studies of MBP’s crystalline granule core ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11483036/#:~:text=SGr%20in%20mature%20eosinophils%20contain,1%20are%20nontoxic%5E%7B%2016%2C10)), have provided a detailed picture of how this protein functions. Current research continues to unveil new aspects – for example, the involvement of MBP in eosinophil extracellular trap formation against filarial worms was shown in 2025 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11902130/#:~:text=mice%20that%20lack%20eosinophil%20peroxidase,examined%20eosinophils%20from%20the%20natural)), and ongoing studies are examining how MBP’s interactions (like with heparan sulfate or cell receptors) can be modulated to treat diseases. MBP exemplifies the delicate balance in our immune system: a powerful “weapon” that, unless tightly regulated, can harm the very host it protects. Its unique features – an inhibitory pro-sequence, a crystal storage form, and a potent cationic effector domain – reflect an evolutionary solution to safely deploy a toxic protein. As both a **helminthotoxin** and a contributor to **asthma and allergy**, PRG2’s product remains a focus of immunological research and a consideration in diseases ranging from parasitic infections to allergic inflammation. The comprehensive understanding of PRG2/MBP-1 is not only of academic interest but also has practical implications for diagnosing and managing conditions where eosinophils play a central role.
