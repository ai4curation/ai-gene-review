description: 'Eosinophil major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), a highly cationic protein (~13.8 kDa, pI ~11.4)
  that is the predominant constituent of the crystalline core in eosinophil secondary granules. Synthesized
  as a 222-amino acid precursor with an acidic, heavily glycosylated prosegment (~9 kDa) that neutralizes
  the toxicity of the basic mature domain during biosynthesis. The prosegment contains N-linked, O-linked,
  and glycosaminoglycan chains (hence "proteoglycan 2"), raising precursor mass to 30-50 kDa. Upon maturation,
  the prosegment is proteolytically cleaved in the Golgi/secretory granule, yielding the active 117-residue
  MBP that is stored in paracrystalline arrays within granules. Structurally, MBP adopts a C-type lectin-like
  fold but lacks Ca2+-binding sites; instead presents a highly cationic surface for binding sulfated polysaccharides
  like heparin and heparan sulfate. Primary function: cytotoxic effector in antiparasitic defense - directly
  damages helminth larvae membranes and cuticles (experimental knockout mice show impaired killing of
  Strongyloides and filarial worms). Also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi
  via membrane disruption. Immunomodulatory roles: triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils
  (histamine release), activates neutrophils (superoxide production) and platelets. Toxic to host cells
  - causes epithelial damage and denudation in allergic diseases. In asthma, acts as allosteric antagonist
  of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on parasympathetic neurons, disabling inhibitory feedback and
  causing bronchospasm and airway hyperresponsiveness. Inhibits heparanase (first known endogenous heparanase
  inhibitor). In chronic settings, induces TGF-β and MMP-1 expression, promoting fibrosis and tissue remodeling.
  Dual biology: the proMBP form is abundantly expressed in placenta during pregnancy and secreted into
  maternal circulation, where it forms disulfide-linked 1:1 complexes with PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated
  plasma protein A), inhibiting this metalloprotease''s cleavage of IGFBPs and thereby modulating IGF
  signaling for fetal growth. ProMBP also binds angiotensinogen and complement C3dg. The PAPP-A/proMBP
  complex is a clinical biomarker in first-trimester Down syndrome screening. ProMBP is non-toxic (acidic
  prosegment renders it inert), contrasting with the highly cytotoxic mature MBP released from eosinophils.
  MBP levels correlate with disease severity in asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and other eosinophil-driven
  conditions.'

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: cytotoxic effector activity
  proposed_definition: The activity of directly killing or damaging target cells or organisms through
    membrane permeabilization or disruption, particularly via cationic charge-based interactions, as exhibited
    by antimicrobial peptides and granule proteins.
  justification: MBP's primary function is direct killing of parasites and microbes via membrane permeabilization.
    Current GO lacks specific term for this cationic antimicrobial peptide-like activity. Knockout mice
    show impaired parasite killing; purified MBP kills helminths, bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells
    via membrane disruption.

- proposed_name: M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist activity
  proposed_definition: The activity of binding to M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and blocking their
    inhibitory function, thereby preventing feedback inhibition of acetylcholine release from parasympathetic
    neurons.
  justification: MBP's allosteric antagonism of M2 receptors on airway nerves is a key mechanism in asthma
    pathophysiology, but lacks specific GO annotation. MBP binds M2 receptors, blocks inhibitory feedback,
    causes unrestrained acetylcholine release and bronchospasm. Heparin neutralization of MBP prevents
    this effect.
