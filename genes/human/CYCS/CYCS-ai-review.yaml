description: >-
  CYCS encodes human cytochrome c, a small (105 aa, ~12 kDa) soluble heme-containing
  electron carrier protein of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cytochrome c has two
  well-established, evolutionarily conserved functions: (1) In the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain, it shuttles single electrons from Complex III (cytochrome bc1, via its
  cytochrome c1 subunit) to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), accepting electrons via its
  covalently bound heme c group. (2) In apoptosis, upon mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) triggered by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (BAX/BAK),
  cytochrome c is released into the cytosol where it binds Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome,
  activating caspase-9 and triggering the downstream caspase cascade. The heme c prosthetic
  group is covalently attached via thioether bonds to Cys14 and Cys17 (mature numbering
  Cys15 and Cys18 in UniProt), with His18 and Met80 as axial ligands to the iron atom.
  Gain-of-function mutations in CYCS (e.g., G42S) cause thrombocytopenia type 4 (THC4) by
  enhancing apoptotic activation in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage. Cytochrome c is
  one of the most extensively studied proteins in biochemistry and a classic example of a
  dual-function (moonlighting) protein.

      IBA annotation for electron transfer activity. Cytochrome c is the canonical single-electron
      carrier of the mitochondrial ETC, shuttling electrons from Complex III to Complex IV via
      reversible oxidation/reduction of its heme c iron atom. This is one of the two core molecular
      functions of CYCS and is extremely well established. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically

      IBA annotation for the biological process of electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c.
      This represents the Complex III (cytochrome bc1) reaction in which ubiquinol is oxidized and
      cytochrome c is reduced. Cytochrome c is the electron acceptor in this reaction, receiving
      electrons from the cytochrome c1 subunit of Complex III. While CYCS is not a subunit of
      Complex III, it is an essential participant in this process as the mobile electron carrier
      that accepts the electrons. The IBA annotation is appropriate as this function is conserved

    summary: >-
      TAS annotation for the execution phase of apoptosis, citing Zou et al. 1997 (PMID:9267021).
      This landmark paper identified Apaf-1 and showed that cytochrome c binding to Apaf-1
      leads to caspase-3 activation, which is the execution phase of apoptosis. However,
      cytochrome c's direct role is in the initiation/signaling phase (binding Apaf-1, activating
      caspase-9) rather than the execution phase per se (which involves effector caspases cleaving
      cellular substrates). CYCS acts upstream of execution. GO:0097193 (intrinsic apoptotic
      signaling pathway) is the more appropriate process term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Cytochrome c participates in the initiation of apoptosis by binding Apaf-1 and activating
      caspase-9. The execution phase (caspase-3/7-mediated substrate cleavage) occurs downstream

      accurately describes CYCS's role. The existing annotation for GO:0097193 already captures this.

        back to O2 in the IMS).
      supporting_text: >-
        cytochrome c is a pro-apoptotic factor. It is released from its places on the outer
        surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane at early steps of apoptosis and, combining
        with some cytosolic proteins, activates conversion of the latent apoptosis-promoting
        protease pro-caspase-9 to its active form

  description: >-
    Cytochrome c is a small soluble heme-containing electron carrier protein that shuttles
    single electrons from Complex III (cytochrome bc1) to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in
    the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The protein accepts electrons from the cytochrome c1
    subunit of Complex III via its covalently bound heme c group (Fe3+ -> Fe2+) and donates
    them to cytochrome c oxidase (Fe2+ -> Fe3+). This electron transfer function is essential
    for oxidative phosphorylation and cellular respiration. The heme c prosthetic group is
    covalently attached via thioether bonds to Cys15 and Cys18, with His18 and Met80 as axial
    iron ligands. Cytochrome c is loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane
    surface via electrostatic interactions and cardiolipin binding, operating within the IMS.

  description: >-
    Upon mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) triggered by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
    family members (BAX/BAK), cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial IMS into the
    cytosol. In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, promoting Apaf-1 oligomerization
    and formation of the apoptosome, a heptameric wheel-like complex. The apoptosome recruits
    and activates procaspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates effector caspases (caspase-3,
    caspase-7), executing the apoptotic program. This dual function of cytochrome c -- electron
    carrier in the ETC and apoptotic trigger when released -- makes it a classic moonlighting
    protein. The G42S variant in CYCS enhances apoptotic activation and causes thrombocytopenia
    type 4 (THC4), demonstrating the clinical significance of this function.
