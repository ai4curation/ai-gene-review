## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q14457
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Beclin-1; AltName: Full=Coiled-coil myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein; AltName: Full=Protein GT197; Contains: RecName: Full=Beclin-1-C 35 kDa {ECO:0000303|PubMed:21364619}; Contains: RecName: Full=Beclin-1-C 37 kDa {ECO:0000303|PubMed:21364619};
- **Gene Information:** Name=BECN1; Synonyms=GT197;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the beclin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Atg6/Beclin. (IPR007243); Atg6/Beclin_C_sf. (IPR038274); Atg6/beclin_CC. (IPR041691); Atg6_BARA. (IPR040455); BH3_dom. (IPR029318)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BECN1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BECN1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BECN1** (gene ID: BECN1, UniProt: Q14457) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human BECN1 (Beclin‑1, UniProt Q14457)

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Target identity: BECN1 encodes human Beclin‑1, a 450‑aa (~60 kDa) ortholog of yeast Atg6/Vps30 and founding member of the beclin family; it maps to 17q21 and functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Domain architecture and functions below match canonical Beclin‑1 features described for human protein Q14457, confirming correct gene/protein and organism (Homo sapiens). (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5)

Key concepts, definitions, and domain architecture
- Beclin‑1 as autophagy scaffold: Beclin‑1 is the central scaffold of class III PI3K (PI3KC3/VPS34) complexes that generate PI3P for autophagosome biogenesis and regulate endocytic trafficking; two mutually exclusive complexes are assembled: PI3KC3‑C1 (BECN1–VPS34–VPS15–ATG14L) for autophagosome nucleation and PI3KC3‑C2 (BECN1–VPS34–VPS15–UVRAG) for endosome maturation/trafficking. (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1506426) (cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 25-26)
- Domain map (human Beclin‑1): N‑terminal BH3 (approx. aa 108–127) that binds anti‑apoptotic BCL‑2 family; coiled‑coil domain (CCD; ~aa 144–269) mediating dimerization and partner binding (ATG14L, UVRAG, AMBRA1, RUBICON); ECD/BARA membrane‑binding domain (~aa 244–337) enabling association with PI3KC3 and membranes; reported NES around aa 180–189; C‑terminal membrane‑proximal segment (~aa 425–450). (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1506426; preprint summary) (cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 5-8)

Core molecular functions, partners, and localization
- PI3KC3 complexes and partners: Beclin‑1 assembles PI3KC3‑C1/‑C2 with VPS34 (PIK3C3) and VPS15 (PIK3R4) and recruits complex‑specific adaptors ATG14L (C1) or UVRAG (C2); additional regulators include RUBICON (negative regulator of C2), AMBRA1 and BIF1; NRBF2 is linked to PI3KC3‑C1 in broader literature and is consistent with the Beclin‑1 scaffold role summarized here. (Nature Reviews Mol Cell Biol, Mar 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00585-z) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 35-36)
- Subcellular localization: Beclin‑1 localizes to cytoplasm, ER, perinuclear/endosomal membranes, and at mitochondria–ER contact sites (MAMs) during selective mitophagy. (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1506426; Science Signaling, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo4457) (cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7, quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)
- Endocytic trafficking: Through PI3KC3‑C2, Beclin‑1–derived PI3P drives early‑to‑late endosome maturation (Rab5→Rab7, EEA1 recruitment), receptor sorting (e.g., EGFR, TFR1) and maintenance of epithelial polarity via E‑cadherin recycling; disruption prolongs EGFR/ERK signaling and perturbs iron uptake. (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 16-18)

Pathway roles and specialized contexts
- Autophagosome nucleation: PI3KC3‑C1 (ATG14L‑containing) is the canonical nucleation module for phagophore assembly; ULK1‑dependent initiation enhances Beclin‑1 complex activity. (Nature Reviews Mol Cell Biol, Mar 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00585-z) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 35-36)
- Selective mitophagy: Beclin‑1, but not Beclin‑2, is required for efficient engulfment of damaged mitochondria; ULK1 phosphorylation of Beclin‑1 Ser15 is necessary, and Beclin‑1 relocates to MAMs during mitophagy. (Science Signaling, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo4457) (quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)
- ER‑phagy and noncanonical roles: UVRAG cooperates with ER‑phagy receptors (FAM134B, ATL3, RTN3L) to assemble ER‑phagy sites during starvation, in part independent of canonical PI3KC3‑C2; Beclin‑1 is integral to UVRAG‑containing complexes that bridge autophagy and endocytic pathways. (EMBO Journal, Oct 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2023113625) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 23-25)
- LAP/alternative autophagy: Beclin‑1 complexes contribute to LC3‑associated phagocytosis and LAP‑related endocytosis (LAP/LANDO), expanding roles beyond macroautophagy. (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 5-8)

Regulation: interactions and post‑translational modifications
- BCL‑2 family repression via BH3: Beclin‑1’s BH3 domain binds BCL‑2/BCL‑XL to inhibit autophagy; competitive interactions (e.g., AMBRA1) and phosphorylation events can release Beclin‑1 to activate PI3KC3. (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1506426; maheshwari2025) (cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 25-26)
- Phosphorylation (selected, human Beclin‑1): ULK1 at Ser15 promotes initiation/mitophagy; AMPK at Thr388 (C‑terminal/ECD) activates autophagy; stress kinases (JNK Thr69/Ser70/Ser97; MK2/3/CHK2/CaMKII Ser90/Ser93/Ser96) regulate flux; DAPK/ROCK at Thr119 (BH3) modulates BCL‑2 binding; JAK2 at Thr133 promotes VPS34 interaction; EGFR phosphorylates Tyr229/Tyr233/Tyr352 in the ECD to suppress autophagy and engage AKT signaling. (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 13-15)
- Acetylation/ubiquitylation: p300 acetylates Lys430/Lys437 to inhibit autophagosome maturation and favor RUBICON recruitment; SIRT1 deacetylation restores flux; AMBRA1‑CRL4 promotes K63‑linked ubiquitination that activates Beclin‑1; NEDD4 K11‑linked chains drive proteasomal turnover; deubiquitinase A20 counteracts activation. (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 13-15)
- Upstream initiation wiring (2023–2024): ULK1 palmitoylation by ZDHHC13 controls ULK1 translocation and enhances ATG14L phosphorylation, thereby activating PI3KC3 and PI3P production—identifying a lipidation‑dependent switch upstream of Beclin‑1 activation. (Nature Communications, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51402-w) ()
- Metabolic coupling: ULK1 activation promotes LDHA‑dependent lactate production; KAT5/TIP60 transfers lactyl groups to VPS34 (K356/K781), increasing VPS34 association with Beclin‑1/ATG14L/UVRAG and stimulating autophagy and endolysosomal flux—defining VPS34 lactylation as a PTM that potentiates Beclin‑1 complexes. (Science Advances, Jun 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg4993) ()
- Structural activation of PI3KC3‑C1: Cryo‑EM reveals a VPS15‑centered autoinhibited cytosolic state and an activation pathway where VPS15 myristate release enables VPS34 lipid kinase activity within the full PI3KC3‑C1 (with BECN1 and ATG14L). (Science, Feb 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl3787) (quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)

Beclin‑1 versus Beclin‑2 (paralogue comparison, 2023 update)
- Both Beclin‑1 and Beclin‑2 contribute to basal autophagosome formation; however, Beclin‑1 uniquely supports mitophagy by localizing to MAMs upon ULK1‑Ser15 phosphorylation. Beclin‑2 shows distinct endolysosomal cargo selectivity (e.g., GPCR turnover) and lacks certain regulatory determinants present in Beclin‑1. (Science Signaling, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo4457) (quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)

Subcellular roles consolidated
- ER/TGN/endosomes: Beclin‑1 participates in TGN‑proximal and endosomal PI3P synthesis (C2), enabling endosome maturation and cargo sorting; it maintains epithelial polarity through PI3KC3‑C2‑dependent E‑cadherin recycling. (maheshwari2025 preprint, Jul 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202507.2396.v1) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 16-18, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 23-25)
- MAMs in mitophagy: Beclin‑1 is recruited to ER–mitochondria contact sites for spatially restricted autophagosome initiation around damaged mitochondria. (Science Signaling, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo4457) (quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)

Disease relevance, expert perspectives, and applications
- Cancer biology: Beclin‑1/PI3KC3 signaling has context‑dependent tumor roles—suppresses early tumorigenesis yet supports survival of established tumors by metabolic adaptation. Therapeutically, modulating Beclin‑1 complexes (e.g., disrupting BH3 binding to BCL‑2 or inhibiting VPS34) is under active exploration. (Nature Reviews Mol Cell Biol, Mar 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00585-z; Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1506426) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 35-36, cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7)
- Intestinal epithelium (autophagy‑independent trafficking): Adult, epithelium‑specific Becn1 deletion in mice causes rapid fatal enteritis with barrier breakdown, extensive apoptosis, and trafficking defects; Atg7 deletion does not phenocopy this, indicating essential Beclin‑1 functions in endocytic trafficking beyond canonical autophagy. (Communications Biology, Feb 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-05890-7) ()
- Neurodegeneration/mitochondrial quality control: Beclin‑1’s specific role in mitophagy (MAM localization, ULK1‑Ser15 dependence) positions it as a target for neuron‑selective mitochondrial cleanup strategies. (Science Signaling, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.abo4457) (quiles2023decipheringfunctionalroles pages 1-3)
- Drug discovery vectors (2023–2024): Upstream initiation nodes—ULK1 palmitoylation (ZDHHC13) and ATG14L phosphorylation—provide leverage points to enhance Beclin‑1 complex activation; VPS34 lactylation by KAT5 integrates metabolic state with Beclin‑1 complex potency. VPS34‑targeted inhibitors and strategies that modulate Beclin‑1 BH3 interactions remain prominent translational avenues. (Nature Communications, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51402-w; Science Advances, Jun 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg4993; Biomolecules & Therapeutics, Oct 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4062/biomolther.2024.094) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5)

Expert opinions and synthesis
- Autophagy field consensus situates Beclin‑1 at the heart of PI3KC3 control, integrating stress and metabolic cues via extensive PTM crosstalk and BH3‑dependent gating by BCL‑2 family proteins; disease roles are context‑dependent, underscoring the need for pathway‑ and tissue‑specific modulation (e.g., targeting C1 vs C2, disentangling autophagy from trafficking functions in epithelia). (Nature Reviews Mol Cell Biol, Mar 2023; Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024) (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 35-36, cao2024beclin1atherapeutic pages 6-7)

Conclusion
Human Beclin‑1 (BECN1, Q14457) is a multidomain scaffold that builds and regulates PI3KC3‑C1/C2 to control autophagosome nucleation and endosomal trafficking. Recent work (2023–2024) elucidates upstream activation by ULK1 palmitoylation and VPS34 lactylation, clarifies Beclin‑1’s unique role in mitophagy at MAMs, and demonstrates essential autophagy‑independent trafficking functions in intestinal epithelial homeostasis. These insights sharpen therapeutic strategies: selectively modulating Beclin‑1 complexes or their PTM‑defined activation states (ULK1–ATG14L axis, KAT5‑driven VPS34 lactylation, BH3–BCL‑2 interactions) in cancer, neurodegeneration, and barrier epithelia.
