description: >-
  Beclin-1 is the central scaffold subunit of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3KC3/VPS34)
  complexes that generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) for autophagosome
  biogenesis and
  endocytic trafficking. BECN1 forms two mutually exclusive complexes: PI3KC3-C1 (with
  ATG14L) for
  autophagosome nucleation, and PI3KC3-C2 (with UVRAG) for endosome maturation and
  endocytic trafficking.
  The protein contains an N-terminal BH3 domain (aa 108-127) that binds BCL2/BCL-XL
  to regulate autophagy,
  a coiled-coil domain (CCD; aa 144-269) for dimerization and partner binding, and
  a C-terminal BARA/ECD
  membrane-binding domain. BECN1 is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and is essential
  for autophagy
  initiation through its adapter function in assembling PI3KC3 complex components.

        This annotation is problematic. BECN1's connection to apoptosis is through
        its interaction with BCL2 family, but this interaction REGULATES AUTOPHAGY,

      label: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, class III
    description: >-
      BECN1 is the central scaffold/adapter of PI3KC3 complexes, assembling VPS34,
      VPS15,
      and complex-specific subunits (ATG14L or UVRAG) into functional lipid kinase
      complexes
      that generate PI3P for autophagy and endocytic trafficking. As scaffold of PI3KC3-C1
      (ATG14L-containing complex), BECN1 is essential for autophagosome nucleation.
  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0043548
      label: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding
    description: >-
      BECN1 directly binds VPS34 (PIK3C3), the catalytic subunit of class III PI3K,
      through its coiled-coil and BARA domains. This binding is essential for PI3KC3
      complex formation and function.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the precise mechanism by which BECN1 membrane association regulates
      autophagosome size versus number? The PMID:23878393 study identified a membrane-association
      domain but the molecular mechanism remains unclear.
  - question: >-
      Are there isoform-specific or cell type-specific differences in BECN1 function
      between autophagy and endocytic trafficking? BECN1 participates in both PI3KC3-C1
      (autophagy) and PI3KC3-C2 (trafficking) but the determinants of which complex
      forms
      are not fully understood.
