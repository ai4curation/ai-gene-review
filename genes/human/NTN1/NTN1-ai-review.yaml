description: >-
  Netrin-1 is a secreted laminin-related protein that functions as an axon guidance cue.
  It controls guidance of CNS commissural axons and peripheral motor axons through
  interactions with its receptors DCC and UNC5 family members. Binding to DCC leads to
  axon attraction, while binding to UNC5 receptors leads to axon repulsion. Netrin-1
  also serves as a survival factor that prevents initiation of apoptosis, and is involved
  in tumorigenesis through regulation of apoptosis. The protein contains a laminin N-terminal
  domain, three laminin EGF-like domains, and a C-terminal NTR domain. It is primarily secreted
  but can also be found in the cytoplasm. Mutations in NTN1 cause congenital mirror movements
  (MRMV4) through disruption of corticospinal tract development.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is clearly erroneous. NTN1 encodes Netrin-1, a secreted laminin-related
      axon guidance protein. The IBA annotation was propagated from PANTHER:PTN000180816, which
      erroneously groups NTN1 with POU-domain transcription factors (e.g., POU1F1/Pit-1, POU2F1/Oct-1).
      NTN1 has no DNA-binding domains - it contains laminin N-terminal domain, laminin EGF-like
      domains, and NTR domain. UniProt confirms it is a secreted protein that functions extracellularly
      as an axon guidance cue [UniProt:O95631]. PMID:28945198 confirms "Netrin-1 is a secreted
      protein that was first identified 20 years ago as an axon guidance molecule."
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      NTN1 is not a transcription factor. It is a secreted axon guidance molecule with no
      DNA-binding capability. The phylogenetic tree (PANTHER:PTN000180816) erroneously included
      NTN1 alongside bona fide POU-domain transcription factors. This is a clear case of
      erroneous phylogenetic propagation - NTN1 has completely different domain architecture
      (laminin domains) compared to the POU-domain transcription factors cited in the WITH/FROM
      field.

    description: >-
      NTN1 functions as a secreted axon guidance cue that binds to netrin receptors
      including DCC (for attraction) and UNC5 family members (for repulsion). This
      receptor binding is the primary molecular function of the protein.
