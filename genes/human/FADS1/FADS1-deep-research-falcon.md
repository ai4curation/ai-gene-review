## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O60427
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Acyl-CoA (8-3)-desaturase {ECO:0000305}; EC=1.14.19.44 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10601301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10769175}; AltName: Full=Delta(5) fatty acid desaturase; Short=D5D {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q920L1}; Short=Delta(5) desaturase {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q920L1}; Short=Delta-5 desaturase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10601301, ECO:0000303|PubMed:10769175}; AltName: Full=Fatty acid desaturase 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10860662};
- **Gene Information:** Name=FADS1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10860662, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:3574}; Synonyms=FADSD5;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the fatty acid desaturase type 1 family.
- **Key Domains:** Cyt_B5-like_heme/steroid-bd. (IPR001199); Cyt_B5-like_heme/steroid_sf. (IPR036400); FA_desaturase_dom. (IPR005804); Fatty_acid_desaturase. (IPR012171); Cyt-b5 (PF00173)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "FADS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'FADS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **FADS1** (gene ID: FADS1, UniProt: O60427) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target confirmed: Human FADS1 (UniProt O60427), also called delta-5 desaturase (D5D), EC 1.14.19.44. Literature places FADS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with an N‑terminal cytochrome b5–like domain and conserved His boxes shared across FADS1/2/3; electrons are supplied by the cytochrome b5/NADH–cytochrome b5 reductase system. These features align with the UniProt description and the fatty acid desaturase type 1 family membership (human) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 3-4, majou2021synthesisofdha pages 10-10, park2018thebiochemistryand pages 13-14, koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3).

Comprehensive research report: FADS1 (Fatty Acid Desaturase 1; O60427)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and reaction. FADS1 encodes the microsomal Δ5 desaturase that introduces a double bond at the Δ5 position of C20 polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs. Canonical reactions in humans include: (i) dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA; 20:3n‑6) → arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n‑6); and (ii) eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA; 20:4n‑3) → eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n‑3). These Δ5 steps sit within the long‑chain PUFA (LC‑PUFA) biosynthetic pathway that converts dietary linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n‑6) and α‑linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n‑3) to AA, EPA, and DHA via alternating desaturation/elongation (FADS2 Δ6/Δ8 and ELOVL) (Koletzko 2019 review) (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124250, Aug 2019) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 3-4, koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization and domains. FADS1 is an ER membrane enzyme bearing an N‑terminal cytochrome b5–like domain; mammalian desaturation requires the cytochrome b5/cytochrome b5 reductase electron donor system on the ER. FADS genes share cytochrome b5 domain and three conserved histidine boxes critical for catalysis (Brenna et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2013) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plefa.2010.02.011, Apr 2010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.127, Nov 2013) (majou2021synthesisofdha pages 10-10, park2018thebiochemistryand pages 13-14).
- FADS gene cluster and regulation. FADS1 and FADS2 lie head‑to‑head on chr11q12‑q13 with numerous common variants that modulate desaturase activities and tissue/blood LC‑PUFA levels. These genotypes show marked frequency differences across ancestries and contribute to gene–diet interactions and evolutionary signatures (Koletzko 2019; Romero‑Hidalgo 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124250; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35477) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3, romerohidalgo2024selectionscanin pages 15-16).
- Alternative isoforms. A non‑catalytic FADS1 alternative transcript (FADS1AT1) modulates FADS2‑mediated desaturation and displays distinct organelle localization (ER and mitochondria), suggesting isoform‑level regulation of LC‑PUFA biosynthesis (Park et al. 2012) (https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.m025312, Aug 2012) (park2018thebiochemistryand pages 13-14).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024) and latest research
- Cancer biology: colorectal cancer (CRC) FADS1–AA axis. Xu et al. 2023 demonstrated that FADS1 upregulation is an early event in CRC, increases AA in the tumor interstitium, enriches gram‑negative microbes, activates TLR4/MYD88 signaling, and elevates PGE2; dietary AA feeding promoted tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS and Apc−/− models. Knockdown of FADS1 lowered AA (without changing EPA), reduced AA/EPA ratio, and attenuated tumor growth; a D5D inhibitor (D5D‑IN‑326) reduced CRC cell/organoid growth (e.g., P=0.003 in SW480; 0.008 HCT‑116; 0.006 organoid). High FADS1 expression associated with poorer outcomes in a clinical cohort (multivariable HRs reported for tumor features) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37590-x, Apr 2023) (xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 1-2, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 4-5, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 11-11, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 3-4).
- Lipidomics/GWAS and gene–supplement interactions. A 2024 UK Biobank GWIS of 200,060 Europeans found genome‑wide significant FADS1/FADS2 interactions with fish oil supplementation for omega‑3%, DHA%, total omega‑3 and the omega‑6:omega‑3 ratio. For omega‑3%, lead variant rs35473591 had smaller genetic effect in supplement users (β 0.35) than non‑users (β 0.42), and supplement effect sizes varied across genotypes (β 0.45, 0.50, 0.59 by genotype), underscoring personalized responses (medRxiv, Dec 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.24318956) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Lipid species GWAS. A 2024 population lipidomics GWAS (Rhineland Study) identified 51 loci for complex lipid species, including signals at FADS2/FADS1 pivotal for fatty acid metabolism, reinforcing the centrality of this locus in human lipid architecture (medRxiv, Dec 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.04.24318368) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Clinical lipid associations and risk. UK Biobank prospective analysis linked higher plasma n‑3 and n‑6 PUFA with lower incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk (HR Q4 vs Q1: 0.48 for both) and markedly lower chronic liver disease mortality (HR 0.21 for n‑3 PUFA; 0.15 for n‑6 PUFA), while saturated fat was associated with higher risk (Nature Communications, May 2024); discussion highlights roles of fatty acid desaturases (FADS1/2) in PUFA biology (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47960-8) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Genotype–phenotype in humans. In 2024, Rabehl et al. reported that homozygous ancestral (minor) FADS1 genotypes had significantly lower blood AA, with trends toward lower arachidonic‑derived oxylipins; liver fat did not differ by genotype in this 85‑patient cohort (Frontiers in Nutrition, Jul 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1356986) (rabehl2024effectoffads1 pages 7-8). Reyes‑Pérez et al. (2024) found in 76 adults with obesity that EPA+DHA supplementation raised the omega‑3 index across all, but carriers of FADS1 rs174547 CC (ancestral) showed smaller increases in n‑6, n‑3, total PUFA, EPA, DHA and omega‑3 index than TT (Nutrients, Oct 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16203522) (reyesperez2024fads1geneticvariant pages 13-13). A 2024 scoping review concluded that 47 FADS SNPs associate with EPA/DHA levels, with consistent effects for rs174537/rs174547/rs174556/rs174561 (minor alleles → lower EPA/DHA) (Genes & Nutrition, Jun 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 23-23).
- Functional and cellular effects. An exploratory 2024 JLR study linked FADS1 rs174550 genotype to differences in mitochondrial function in human adipocytes and genotype‑diet interactions under ALA‑enriched diet, tying FADS variation to bioenergetics (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jlr.2024.100638, Oct 2024) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77). In a rat Western diet model, hepatocyte‑specific AAV8‑Fads1 overexpression improved glucose tolerance and insulin signaling (low‑fat/high‑fructose diet) and reduced plasma triglyceride (~50%) and hepatic cholesterol (~25%) under high‑fat/high‑fructose; AA/DGLA ratio was restored, nominating FADS1 as a diet‑dependent MASLD target (IJMS, Apr 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094836) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Evolution and population differences. A 2024 selection scan in Native Americans highlighted FADS2 rs174616 with gene–diet interactions altering lipid levels and desaturase activity, consistent with strong selection at the FADS locus and population‑specific nutrigenomic implications (Heliyon, Aug 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35477) (romerohidalgo2024selectionscanin pages 15-16).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Nutrigenomics/precision nutrition. Multiple recent human studies and reviews show FADS1 variants strongly influence PUFA status and modify responses to diet or supplementation, supporting genotype‑aware recommendations (e.g., UK Biobank GWIS: genotype‑dependent fish oil effects; rs174547/rs174550 associations with altered response to omega‑3 or linoleic/ALA‑rich diets) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.24318956; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16203522; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1356986) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77, reyesperez2024fads1geneticvariant pages 13-13, rabehl2024effectoffads1 pages 7-8). The 2024 scoping review synthesizes 40 studies linking FADS1/2 variants to circulating EPA/DHA, endorsing their use in stratified nutrition (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 23-23). The broader expert review (Koletzko 2019) frames FADS genotype as a foundation for precision nutrition at individual/population scales (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124250) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3).
- Oncology targeting. Preclinical CRC data implicate the FADS1–AA–PGE2 axis as druggable: genetic knockdown and a D5D inhibitor reduced growth in CRC models, suggesting FADS1 inhibition and AA–PGE2 pathway modulation as candidate strategies, potentially in combination with microbiome‑informed approaches (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37590-x) (xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 1-2, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 11-11).
- Liver–metabolic disease. Proof‑of‑concept gene therapy (AAV8‑Fads1) improved metabolic features and hepatic lipid composition in diet‑induced models, nominating FADS1 for MASLD‑oriented therapeutics (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094836) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77). Observational data link higher circulating PUFAs to substantially lower HCC incidence and CLD mortality, aligning with mechanisms governed by FADS1/2 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47960-8) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Annual Review of Nutrition (2019): FADS variants are strong determinants of LC‑PUFA biosynthesis; genotype distribution differences reflect evolutionary adaptation and underpin robust gene–diet interactions; precision nutrition strategies should incorporate FADS genotypes (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124250) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3, koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 3-4).
- 2024 scoping review (Genes & Nutrition): Across 40 studies, consistent associations for key FADS1 variants (rs174537, rs174547, rs174556, rs174561) with lower EPA/DHA in minor‑allele carriers; high LD across the locus complicates isolation of single causal variants, but translational relevance for genotype‑guided omega‑3 status is clear (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 23-23).
- Population genetics (2024 Heliyon): Selection at the FADS locus and gene–diet interactions emphasize the necessity of ancestry‑sensitive dietary guidance and clinical trial interpretation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35477) (romerohidalgo2024selectionscanin pages 15-16).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Cancer (CRC) mechanistic study (Xu 2023). AA increases from normal to adenoma to CRC; AA feeding accelerates tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS and Apc−/− models; D5D inhibitor reduced growth in CRC cells/organoids with P values ~0.003–0.008; FADS1 high expression associated with worse clinical features; shFADS1 lowered interstitial AA and blunted LPS‑induced PGE2 increase (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37590-x, Apr 2023) (xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 1-2, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 4-5, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 11-11, xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 3-4).
- Human lipidomics/GWIS (UKB, 200,060 participants). FADS1/FADS2 fish‑oil interactions genome‑wide significant; for omega‑3% lead SNP rs35473591 had β 0.35 (supplement users) vs 0.42 (non‑users); fish‑oil effects varied by genotype (β 0.45/0.50/0.59) (medRxiv, Dec 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.12.24318956) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Prospective liver outcomes (UK Biobank; N=252,398). Highest quartile versus lowest for plasma n‑3 PUFA: HCC HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.33–0.69); CLD mortality HR 0.21 (0.13–0.33). For n‑6 PUFA: HCC HR 0.48 (0.28–0.81); CLD mortality HR 0.15 (0.08–0.30). Saturated fat showed increased risk (Nature Communications, May 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47960-8) (sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77).
- Human genotype–biomarker cohorts. Rabehl 2024: ancestral FADS1 genotype associated with lower blood AA; oxylipin trends lower; no significant genotype differences in liver fat (N=85) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1356986) (rabehl2024effectoffads1 pages 7-8). Reyes‑Pérez 2024: N=76 obesity; 1.5 g/day omega‑3 for 4 months; all groups increased omega‑3 index, but rs174547 CC showed smaller EPA/DHA gains than TT (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16203522) (reyesperez2024fads1geneticvariant pages 13-13).
- Evidence synthesis. Loukil 2024: 40 studies, 47 FADS SNPs; rs174537/rs174547/rs174556/rs174561 most studied; minor alleles associate with lower EPA/DHA; high LD noted (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 23-23).

Biological pathways and cellular context
- Pathway placement. FADS1 performs the Δ5 desaturation in ER‑based LC‑PUFA biosynthesis, downstream of FADS2 (Δ6/Δ8) and ELOVL elongases, governing AA and EPA availability for oxylipin biosynthesis (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes, specialized pro‑resolving mediators) (Koletzko 2019) (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124250) (koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3, koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 3-4).
- Enzyme system. FADS1 requires the ER cytochrome b5 electron shuttle and NADH‑cytochrome b5 reductase; cytochrome b5 domain and His‑box motifs are characteristic of human FADS desaturases (Brenna 2010; Chen 2013) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plefa.2010.02.011; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.127) (majou2021synthesisofdha pages 10-10, park2018thebiochemistryand pages 13-14).

Conclusions and implications
- FADS1 is a validated human ER Δ5 desaturase controlling AA and EPA synthesis and thereby oxylipin signaling. Recent human lipidomics and GWIS strengthen evidence for genotype‑dependent dietary responses, supporting precision nutrition. Translational oncology (CRC) identifies a FADS1–AA–microbiome–PGE2 axis amenable to pharmacologic inhibition. Population genetics and cohort data emphasize ancestry‑specific allele frequencies and diet interactions, necessitating thoughtful trial design and dietary guidance. Together, mechanistic, genetic, and interventional lines of evidence integrate FADS1 into cardiometabolic, hepatic, and oncologic pathways in humans (xu2023fads1arachidonicacidaxis pages 1-2, sun2024leveraginggeneticdata pages 72-77, loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 23-23, koletzko2019fads1andfads2 pages 1-3).
