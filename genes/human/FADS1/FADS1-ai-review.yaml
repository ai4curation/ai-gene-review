description: FADS1 (Fatty Acid Desaturase 1) encodes the delta-5 desaturase 
  (D5D), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of long-chain 
  polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). The enzyme catalyzes the introduction 
  of a cis double bond at the delta-5 position of C20 polyunsaturated acyl-CoA 
  substrates, specifically converting dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA; 
  20:3n-6) to arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) in the omega-6 pathway, and 
  eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA; 20:4n-3) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) 
  in the omega-3 pathway. FADS1 is an ER membrane-localized enzyme with an 
  N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and three conserved histidine-box motifs 
  essential for catalysis. The enzyme requires cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome
  b5 reductase as electron donors. By controlling AA and EPA synthesis, FADS1 is
  the rate-limiting step in the production of eicosanoid precursors and thus 
  regulates inflammatory lipid mediator production including prostaglandins. The
  PUFAs synthesized by FADS1 are incorporated into membrane phospholipids and 
  are substrates for lipid peroxidation, a key driver of ferroptosis. Common 
  genetic variants in the FADS1/FADS2 gene cluster strongly influence 
  circulating PUFA levels and show evidence of evolutionary selection across 
  human populations.

    review:
      summary: FADS1 is unambiguously involved in lipid metabolism as a delta-5 
        fatty acid desaturase that catalyzes key steps in long-chain PUFA 
        biosynthesis. This IBA annotation from phylogenetic analysis is 
        well-supported.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: FADS1 is a core enzyme in lipid metabolism, specifically in the 
        biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The phylogenetic inference

      action: REMOVE
      reason: This is an over-annotation. FADS1 is an enzyme that produces 
        PUFAs, which can then act as ligands for nuclear receptors like PPARs. 
        However, FADS1 itself does not directly regulate transcription. The 
        paper discusses that PUFAs are "regulators of nuclear transcription 
        factors" but this function is attributed to the PUFA products, not to 
        FADS1 as an enzyme.

    review:
      summary: This annotation suggests FADS1 is involved in cell-cell 
        signaling. This likely refers to the fact that its products (AA, EPA) 
        are precursors to eicosanoids which mediate signaling.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: While FADS1 products (arachidonic acid, EPA) are precursors to 
        eicosanoid signaling molecules, FADS1 itself is an enzymatic step 
        removed from the signaling process. This is an indirect/over-annotation.
        The direct function is fatty acid desaturation; eicosanoid signaling is 
        a downstream consequence.

        PMID:10601301 shows that FADS1 expression is regulated by dietary fat

        FADS1 by nutritional status, not that FADS1 mediates the cellular

    description: FADS1 is the delta-5 fatty acid desaturase that catalyzes the 
      rate-limiting step in PUFA biosynthesis. It introduces a cis double bond 
      at the delta-5 position (8 carbons from an existing double bond, hence 
      "8-3") of C20 polyunsaturated acyl-CoA substrates. Direct enzymatic 
      activity demonstrated by expression in mammalian cells (PMID:10601301, 
      PMID:10769175). By producing arachidonic acid and EPA, FADS1 provides the 
      substrates for all eicosanoid biosynthesis including prostaglandins, 
      leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and specialized pro-resolving mediators. The 
      PUFAs produced are also incorporated into membrane phospholipids and serve
      as substrates for lipid peroxidation, connecting FADS1 activity to 
      ferroptosis susceptibility.
