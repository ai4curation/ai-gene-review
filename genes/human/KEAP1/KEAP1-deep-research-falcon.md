### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q14145
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:14585973}; AltName: Full=Cytosolic inhibitor of Nrf2 {ECO:0000303|Ref.1}; Short=INrf2 {ECO:0000303|Ref.1}; AltName: Full=Kelch-like protein 19 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:23177};
- **Gene Information:** Name=KEAP1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:14585973, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:23177}; Synonyms=INRF2 {ECO:0000303|Ref.1}, KIAA0132 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8590280}, KLHL19 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:23177};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the KEAP1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** BACK. (IPR011705); BTB-kelch_protein. (IPR017096); BTB/POZ_dom. (IPR000210); KEAP1_BACK. (IPR047098); KEAP1_BTB_POZ_dom. (IPR030563)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "KEAP1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'KEAP1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **KEAP1** (gene ID: KEAP1, UniProt: Q14145) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human KEAP1 (UniProt Q14145)

Identity verification and domain architecture
- Gene/protein match and organism: KEAP1 (also known historically as KLHL19/KIAA0132/INrf2) encodes a cysteine-rich BTB–BACK–Kelch protein that functions as a substrate adaptor in CUL3–RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligases; canonical descriptions place KEAP1 in cytoplasm under basal conditions and acting on the transcription factor NRF2 (NFE2L2) (reviewed) (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4, song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-3).
- Domains and family: KEAP1 contains an N‑terminal BTB/POZ domain (homodimerization and CUL3 binding), a cysteine-rich intervening/BACK region (IVR/BACK), and a C‑terminal six-bladed Kelch β‑propeller (substrate-binding domain). This BTB–BACK–Kelch architecture is the hallmark of the KEAP1/Kelch family (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-3).

Primary function, mechanism, and localization
- Primary role: KEAP1 is the principal negative regulator of NRF2. In its homodimeric form, KEAP1 binds the Neh2 domain of NRF2 using two degron motifs—high‑affinity ETGE (“hinge”) and lower‑affinity DLG (“latch”)—to recruit the CUL3–RBX1 E3 ligase for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NRF2 under basal, reducing conditions (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4, chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5).
- Stoichiometry: The KEAP1 homodimer simultaneously engages the ETGE and DLG motifs on a single NRF2 molecule (hinge‑and‑latch model), enabling efficient ubiquitination; electrophiles/oxidants bias the cycle toward an “open” conformation and inhibit ubiquitination (dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4, chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5).
- Cysteine-based sensing: Three major reactive cysteines act as sensors—Cys151 (BTB) and Cys273/Cys288 (IVR). Differential modification (e.g., S‑alkylation by electrophiles such as sulforaphane/tBHQ, lipid electrophiles, nitro-fatty acids; S‑glutathionylation; persulfidation/sulfhydration) inhibits KEAP1’s E3 activity and stabilizes NRF2 (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 1-2, song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-3, chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 2-4). Functional importance and nonredundant/partly redundant roles of Cys151/Cys273/Cys288 in inducer classes were defined by mutational analyses (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 2-4). Mechanistically, oxidative/electrophilic stimuli block NRF2 ubiquitination by modifying KEAP1 cysteines and altering KEAP1–CUL3/NRF2 interactions (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 1-2, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
- Specific PTMs: S‑glutathionylation of KEAP1 at Cys273/Cys288 promotes NRF2 activation in pancreatic β cells exposed to oscillating glucose, illustrating endogenous thiol redox control of KEAP1 (verza2025theimpactof pages 4-5). Reviews summarize additional KEAP1 PTMs (alkylation, glycosylation, S‑sulfhydration/persulfidation) as modulators of KEAP1–NRF2 binding and signaling (song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: KEAP1 is primarily cytoplasmic under basal conditions and acts as the cytosolic inhibitor of NRF2; upon stress, NRF2 escapes cytosolic degradation and translocates to the nucleus (song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).

Recent structural biology (2023–2024): CRL3 architecture and relevance to KEAP1
- CRL3 dimerization dynamics: Cryo‑EM of dimeric CRL3KLHL22 (2024) identified a conserved N‑terminal CUL3 motif that promotes dimeric assembly and E3 activity, and described a “variable ubiquitination zone” that rationalizes how dimeric CRL3s (including KEAP1 receptors) position substrates for ubiquitination (Nature Communications, 2024) (wang2024aconservednterminal pages 1-2). These insights generalize to BTB–BACK–Kelch receptors like KEAP1.
- Neddylation- and CSN-regulated dynamics: Cryo‑EM analyses of CRL3KBTBD2 across neddylated/deneddylated states and in complexes with COP9 signalosome (CSN) elucidated dynamic conformations, subunit interfaces, and exchange factors (CAND1) that tune CRL3 activity (NSMB, 2024) (hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21). As KEAP1 is a canonical CUL3 substrate adaptor, these structural principles apply to CRL3KEAP1 regulation by NEDD8 and CSN (hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21, adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3).

Current understanding of KEAP1/NRF2 pathway outputs
- When NRF2 accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, it binds antioxidant response elements (AREs) to induce cytoprotective genes (e.g., GCLC/GCLM, NQO1, HMOX1/HO‑1, GSTs), restoring redox balance and detoxification capacity (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5, adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3).

Disease relevance and 2023–2024 developments
- Cancer mutation frequencies and prognostic impact: A 2024 retrospective cohort of 60,056 solid tumors (C‑CAT) reported KEAP1 variants in 2.5% overall, enriched in lung cancers and associated with worse prognosis in lung and other adenocarcinomas; NRF2 (NFE2L2) variants were frequent in esophageal and lung squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC 35.9%, LUSC 19.6%), clustering in DLG/ETGE motifs, with ETGE variants predicting worse outcomes (Cancer Science, 2024) (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 2-4).
- Tumor microenvironment (TME) and ICI response: Genome‑wide association across 22 TCGA cancers identified KEAP1 as a top driver of immune traits in LUAD; KEAP1 mutations accounted for >10% of variance in multiple immune traits, activated NRF2, reduced T‑cell infiltration, increased T‑cell exhaustion, and elevated PD‑L1 (CD274). An NRF2 signature predicted anti‑PD‑1 response better than CD274 alone in mixed NSCLC cohorts (PLOS Genetics, 2024) (bi2024genomewideanalysesreveal pages 1-2).
- Redox-high phenotype and clinical outcomes: In LUAD, a redoxhigh metabolic phenotype (enriched for KEAP1/STK11/NRF2/SMARCA4 mutations) showed diminished tissue‑resident memory CD8+ T cells and inferior ICI outcomes: ORR 39.1% vs 70.8%, median PFS 3.3 vs 14.6 months, OS 12.1 vs 31.2 months, across multiple cohorts (OncoImmunology, 2024) (wei2024redoxhighphenotypemediated pages 1-2).
- Immune suppression mechanisms: Experimental and single‑cell analyses indicate KEAP1‑mutant lung cancers promote immunosuppression (e.g., cytokine secretion, checkpoint expression, M2‑like macrophage polarization), aligning with clinical resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Int J Mol Sci, 2024) (wei2024redoxhighphenotypemediated pages 1-2, bi2024genomewideanalysesreveal pages 1-2, hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21).

Applications and real‑world implementations
- Approved NRF2 pathway activators via KEAP1 targeting:
  • Dimethyl fumarate (BG‑12; licensed 2013 for RRMS; also used in psoriasis) acts as an electrophile that modifies KEAP1 cysteines, stabilizing NRF2 (review) (dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
  • Omaveloxolone (RTA‑408; SKYCLARYS): FDA approval in Feb 2023 for Friedreich’s ataxia; its clinical implementation and significance in neurology and rare disease care are summarized in 2024–2023 expert perspectives (The Cerebellum, 2024; Arhiv za farmaciju, 2023; Front Pharmacol, 2024) (dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4, hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21).
- Mechanistic and safety considerations in practice: Reviews and expert commentaries outline monitoring and management of transaminase elevations with omaveloxolone and highlight broader antioxidant/NRF2‑targeting strategies under evaluation (Front Pharmacol, 2024; Arhiv za farmaciju, 2023) (hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
- Endogenous and dietary modulators: Electrophilic dietary components (e.g., isothiocyanates) can activate NRF2 by covalently modifying KEAP1 cysteines; KEAP1 cysteine targets, including Cys151 and Cys273/Cys288, are implicated in dietary induction (IJMS, 2024) (song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 1-2). Endogenous redox modifications (e.g., S‑glutathionylation at Cys273/Cys288) activate NRF2 in β‑cells, illustrating physiological control of KEAP1 (Antioxidants, 2024) (verza2025theimpactof pages 4-5).

Expert opinions and authoritative reviews
- Authoritative reviews consolidate KEAP1–NRF2 mechanisms, cysteine “codes,” hinge‑and‑latch stoichiometry, and the clinical pharmacology landscape of KEAP1‑targeting agents (Physiological Reviews, 2018; Redox Biology, 2023) (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
- 2024 mechanistic syntheses emphasize KEAP1 post‑translational modifications and their disease/therapeutic relevance (Front Cell Dev Biol, 2024) (song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 1-2).

Key quantitative/statistical findings (recent)
- KEAP1 variants frequency: 2.5% across 60,056 solid tumors; enriched in lung adenocarcinoma; worse prognosis in adenocarcinomas (Cancer Science, 2024) (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 2-4).
- NFE2L2 hotspot variants: ESCC 35.9%, LUSC 19.6% with DLG/ETGE cluster; ETGE variants associate with poorer prognosis (Cancer Science, 2024) (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 2-4).
- Immune traits variance explained by KEAP1 mutations: >10% in LUAD, with NRF2 activation correlating with lower T‑cell infiltration and higher exhaustion; NRF2 signature predicting anti‑PD‑1 response better than PD‑L1 alone in mixed NSCLC (PLOS Genetics, 2024) (bi2024genomewideanalysesreveal pages 1-2).
- ICI outcomes by redox phenotype in LUAD: ORR 39.1% vs 70.8%; PFS 3.3 vs 14.6 months (p=0.004); OS 12.1 vs 31.2 months (p=0.022) for redoxhigh vs redoxlow tumors (OncoImmunology, 2024) (wei2024redoxhighphenotypemediated pages 1-2).

Pathway integration and biochemical specificity
- Biochemical role: KEAP1 is not an enzyme per se; it is a substrate adaptor/scaffold for CUL3–RBX1 that confers substrate specificity (NRF2 via Neh2 ETGE/DLG) and redox sensitivity through sensor cysteines (adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
- Cellular compartment: KEAP1 acts predominantly in the cytoplasm (sequestering/ubiquitylating NRF2), with consequences in nuclear transcription once NRF2 escapes degradation (song2024posttranslationalmodificationsof pages 2-3, dinkovakostova2023keap1nrf2asa pages 1-4).
- Neddylation and CRL3 activation: CUL3 neddylation enhances CRL3KEAP1 activity; global CRL3 structural studies in 2024 resolve how neddylation/CSN control activity and assembly (hu2024dynamicmoleculararchitecture pages 1-21, adinolfi2023thekeap1nrf2pathway pages 2-3).

Conclusions
Human KEAP1 (Q14145) is a BTB–BACK–Kelch substrate adaptor that homodimerizes and recruits CUL3–RBX1 to ubiquitinate NRF2 bound via ETGE/DLG degrons. Its cysteine sensors (Cys151, Cys273, Cys288) detect electrophiles/oxidants through covalent thiol chemistry (e.g., S‑alkylation, S‑glutathionylation, S‑sulfhydration), inhibiting NRF2 ubiquitination and enabling ARE‑driven cytoprotective programs. Recent structural work on CRL3s (2024) clarifies dimeric assembly, CUL3 N‑terminal motifs, and neddylation/CSN regulation, informing KEAP1 complex function. In oncology, large multi‑cohort studies (2024) link KEAP1/NRF2 alterations to immunosuppressive TMEs and inferior ICI outcomes in LUAD, while broad clinical implementation of KEAP1‑targeted NRF2 inducers (dimethyl fumarate; omaveloxolone, FDA 2023) demonstrates real‑world therapeutic utility. These findings support KEAP1 as both a central redox rheostat and a clinically actionable node.
