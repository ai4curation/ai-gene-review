description: KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) is a cysteine-rich BTB-BACK-Kelch protein that functions as the principal
  substrate adaptor of the BCR(KEAP1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CUL3-RBX1-KEAP1). In its homodimeric form, KEAP1 binds
  the Neh2 domain of NRF2 (NFE2L2) via two degron motifs (ETGE and DLG) and targets NRF2 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation under basal conditions. KEAP1 contains reactive cysteine residues (especially Cys151, Cys273, Cys288) that act
  as sensors for electrophiles and oxidative stress. Upon covalent modification of these cysteines by electrophilic compounds
  (sulforaphane, itaconate, etc.) or reactive oxygen species, the E3 ligase activity is inhibited, allowing NRF2 to accumulate
  and translocate to the nucleus to activate cytoprotective genes via antioxidant response elements (AREs). KEAP1 is primarily
  cytoplasmic and is also regulated by autophagy through interaction with SQSTM1/p62, which sequesters KEAP1 in inclusion
  bodies. Loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 are frequent in lung cancer and lead to constitutive NRF2 activation, promoting
  tumor growth and chemoresistance.

  review:
    summary: KEAP1 functions as a substrate adaptor for the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets NRF2 for polyubiquitination
      and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PMID:15572695, PMID:15601839). This is a well-established core function of KEAP1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures KEAP1's role in targeting NRF2 for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.
      Multiple studies demonstrate that KEAP1 assembles with CUL3 and RBX1 to mediate NRF2 ubiquitination (PMID:15572695,
      PMID:15601839, PMID:15983046).

  title: Ubiquitination of Keap1, a BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein for Cul3, targets Keap1 for degradation by a proteasome-independent
    pathway.
  findings:
  - statement: KEAP1 is ubiquitinated by a CUL3-dependent complex
    supporting_text: Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch protein that functions as a substrate adaptor protein for a Cul3-dependent E3 ubiquitin
      ligase complex
  - statement: Oxidative stress increases KEAP1 ubiquitination
    supporting_text: Ubiquitination of Keap1 is markedly increased in cells exposed to quinone-induced oxidative stress
  - statement: KEAP1 degradation is proteasome-independent
    supporting_text: Degradation of Keap1 is independent of the 26 S proteasome, because inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome
      do not prevent loss of Keap1 following exposure of cells to quinone-induced oxidative stress

    supporting_text: DJ-1 stabilizes Nrf2 by preventing association with its inhibitor protein, Keap1
  - statement: KEAP1 promotes NRF2 ubiquitination
    supporting_text: DJ-1 stabilizes Nrf2 by preventing association with its inhibitor protein, Keap1, and Nrf2's subsequent
      ubiquitination

  title: p62/SQSTM1 is a target gene for transcription factor NRF2 and creates a positive feedback loop by inducing antioxidant
    response element-driven gene transcription.
  findings:
  - statement: p62/SQSTM1 docks onto KEAP1 Kelch domain via KIR motif
    supporting_text: p62 docks directly onto the Kelch-repeat domain of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), via a
      motif designated the KEAP1 interacting region (KIR)
  - statement: KEAP1-p62 interaction leads to KEAP1 accumulation in p62 bodies
    supporting_text: because p62 is polymeric the interaction between KEAP1 and p62 leads to accumulation of KEAP1 in p62
      bodies
  - statement: KEAP1 undergoes autophagic degradation via p62 interaction
    supporting_text: the interaction between KEAP1 and p62 leads to accumulation of KEAP1 in p62 bodies, which is followed
      by autophagic degradation of KEAP1

      neurogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis, we propose here that CRL3 complexes evolved to fulfill
      a pivotal role in mammalian cell differentiation
