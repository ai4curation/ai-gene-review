description: >-
  COPG1 encodes the gamma-1 subunit (gamma-1-COP) of the heptameric coatomer (COPI) complex.
  COPI is a cytosolic protein complex that reversibly associates with Golgi membranes and is
  essential for retrograde vesicle-mediated transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The gamma subunit resides in the adaptor "F" subcomplex (gamma/zeta) that
  connects ARF1-GTP to the coat and participates in cargo selection and vesicle formation.
  COPG1 contributes to recognition of dilysine (KKxx/KxKxx) retrieval motifs on cargo proteins
  and interacts with KDEL receptors for retrograde trafficking of ER-resident proteins. Mutations
  in COPG1 cause immunodeficiency 128 (IMD128), characterized by recurrent infections and ER stress
  due to defective retrograde transport of KDEL-bearing chaperones.

      COPG1 is a core structural subunit of the COPI vesicle coat. The COPI complex is a
      heptamer consisting of alpha, beta, beta', gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta subunits.

      COPG1 is an essential component of the COPI coat, residing in the gamma/zeta adaptor

  review:
    summary: >-
      COPI-coated vesicles are transported along microtubules between the Golgi and ER.
      The annotation is based on phylogenetic inference. While COPG1 is part of the vesicle
      coat, the direct role in microtubule-based transport is more a property of the motor
      proteins that interact with COPI vesicles.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While COPI vesicles do travel along microtubules (as shown in Reactome pathway
      R-HSA-6809003 "ERGIC-to-Golgi vesicles bind dynein:dynactin"), COPG1's primary function
      is as a structural component of the coat, not as a motor or microtubule-binding protein.
      The transport along microtubules is mediated by dynein/dynactin that associate with
      the vesicles. This annotation represents an indirect consequence of being part of
      the transported vesicle coat.
