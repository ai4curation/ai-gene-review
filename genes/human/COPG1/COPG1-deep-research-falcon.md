## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9Y678
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Coatomer subunit gamma-1; AltName: Full=Gamma-1-coat protein; Short=Gamma-1-COP;
- **Gene Information:** Name=COPG1; Synonyms=COPG;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the COPG family. .
- **Key Domains:** ARM-like. (IPR011989); ARM-type_fold. (IPR016024); Clathrin/coatomer_adapt-like_N. (IPR002553); Clathrin_app_Ig-like_sf. (IPR013041); Coatomer/calthrin_app_sub_C. (IPR009028)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "COPG1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'COPG1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **COPG1** (gene ID: COPG1, UniProt: Q9Y678) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: COPG1 encodes the human coatomer subunit gamma-1 (γ1-COP), a core subunit of the heptameric coatomer (COPI) complex that mediates retrograde Golgi-to-ER and intra-Golgi trafficking. This aligns with the UniProt descriptor “Coatomer subunit gamma-1; Gamma-1-COP” and the organism Homo sapiens. Mechanistic and disease evidence below explicitly pertain to human COPG1 within COPI (γ/ζ subcomplex) and its ARF1-dependent recruitment, confirming the correct target (Frontiers in Cell Dev. Biol., 2025; Nature Commun., 2023; J Clin Invest., 2021) (amin2025vesiculartraffickingand pages 4-6, dejgaard2025arfsonthe pages 7-8, bainter2021combinedimmunodeficiencydue pages 2-4).

Key concepts and current understanding
- COPI architecture and COPG1’s role: COPI is a heptamer (α, β, β′, γ, δ, ε, ζ). γ-COP (COPG1) resides in the adaptor “F” subcomplex (γ/ζ) that connects ARF1 to the coat and participates in cargo selection and vesicle formation. Cryo-EM and biochemical work show two ARF1 molecules per coatomer, one engaging the γ/ζ subcomplex, anchoring coatomer on membranes prior to polymerization and budding (Frontiers in Mol. Biosci., 2025; Frontiers in Cell Dev. Biol., 2025) (dejgaard2025arfsonthe pages 7-8, amin2025vesiculartraffickingand pages 4-6).
- Core function of COPI: ARF1-GTP recruits coatomer to cis-Golgi/ERGIC membranes, where COPI polymerizes, generates curvature, and buds vesicles; subsequent ARF1 GTP hydrolysis triggers uncoating and fusion at target membranes. COPI’s principal routes are Golgi→ER retrograde retrieval (e.g., KDEL receptor/cargo receptors) and intra-Golgi retrograde transport (Mol. Biol. Cell, 2003; Frontiers in Cell Dev. Biol., 2025) (garciamata2003adpribosylationfactorcopidependentevents pages 1-2, amin2025vesiculartraffickingand pages 4-6).
- Cargo recognition: COPI recognizes cytosolic C-terminal dilysine motifs (KKxx/KxKxx). γ-COP contributes to dilysine signal recognition within coatomer, often cooperating with dihydrophobic motifs in some cargos (Plant Cell Physiol., 2004; Human Mol. Genet., 2023) (contreras2004sortingsignalsin pages 2-3, contreras2004sortingsignalsin pages 5-6, custer2023copicoatomersubunit pages 1-2).

Mechanistic role, localization, and pathways
- ARF1- and GBF1-dependence: GBF1 (an ARF-GEF) activates ARF1 at ER–Golgi intermediates, enabling COPI recruitment and maturation of carriers moving toward the Golgi; COPI cycles rapidly on/off membranes, requiring continuous cytosolic recruitment (Mol. Biol. Cell, 2003) (https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E02-11-0730; Jun 2003) (garciamata2003adpribosylationfactorcopidependentevents pages 1-2).
- KDELR cycle and COPI: KDELR binds KDEL ligands in the Golgi at low pH, undergoes a conformational change that promotes direct COPI binding and retrograde vesicle formation; KDELR and p24 proteins are among the most abundant in mammalian COPI vesicles. ARF-GAPs can act as cargo adaptors in COPI (Nature Commun., 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45849-0; Mar 2024) (aniento2024doesthekdel pages 1-2).
- Subcellular routes: COPI functions predominantly at cis-Golgi/ERGIC and mediates Golgi→ER and intra-Golgi retrograde traffic, integrating with broader endosome–TGN and secretory pathway logistics (Frontiers in Cell Dev. Biol., 2025; Frontiers in Cell Dev. Biol., 2024) (amin2025vesiculartraffickingand pages 4-6, marco2025copz1anexample pages 2-3).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- ARF1–COPI–STING axis in innate immunity: Pathogenic ARF1 R99C (reduced GTPase activity) shows diminished binding to COPI subunits, including COPG1, by quantitative proteomics and co-IP. The mutant causes accumulation of active STING at Golgi/ERGIC due to defective COPI-dependent retrograde recycling, leading to aberrant type I IFN induction; manipulating ARF1 GAP/GEF activity modulates this phenotype (Nature Commun., 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42150-4; Nov 2023) (hirschenberger2023arf1preventsaberrant pages 6-8).
- COPI in cell cycle control via nuclear delivery: TANGO6 is a COPI-associated membrane protein that captures RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2 at the cis-Golgi in G1 and, via COPI-dependent retrograde transport to ER followed by nuclear import, promotes cell-cycle progression. ARF1 or COPA knockdown disrupts this pathway and reduces nuclear RPB2 (Nature Commun., 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46720-y; Mar 2024) (feng2024tango6regulatescell pages 1-2, feng2024tango6regulatescell pages 5-6).
- KDELR trafficking revisited: A 2024 commentary synthesizes structural and mechanistic evidence that KDEL ligand binding activates KDELR for COPI recruitment; emphasizes roles for p24 family, ARF1, COPI subunits, and ARF-GAPs in cargo recruitment and COPI vesicle formation (Nature Commun., 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45849-0; Mar 2024) (aniento2024doesthekdel pages 1-2).
- Coatomer as EV-binding protein for Wnt secretion: A Wnt7a “exosome-binding peptide” (EBP) mediates EV secretion through direct binding to coatomer subunits COPA/COPB2. ITC and 1.8-Å structures show a KIKK motif in EBP engages acidic pockets in the COPB2 WD-repeat; K253A/K255A disrupts binding and EV secretion. siRNA of COPA/COPB2 reduces Wnt7a EV secretion and function. The study identifies coatomer as an EV-binding partner for Wnts via lysine-rich motifs, conceptually parallel to COPI’s recognition of KKxx/KxKxx (Science Advances, 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado5914; Dec 2024) (gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 6-9, gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 9-10, gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 3-6).

Human disease associations and mutations
- Combined immunodeficiency caused by COPG1 mutation: Five siblings homozygous for COPG1 p.K652E (appendage domain) presented with recurrent infections, poor vaccine responses, and increased ER stress. The mutation impairs KDELR association and retrograde retrieval of KDEL-bearing chaperones, establishing γ1-COP’s essential role in ER homeostasis and adaptive immunity (J Clin Invest., 2021) (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI140494; Feb 2021) (bainter2021combinedimmunodeficiencydue pages 2-4).
- Broader COPI disease context: COPI subunit defects (e.g., COPA WD40 mutations) dysregulate STING recycling and IFN signaling; ARF1 mutants perturb COPI association and Golgi vesiculation, linking COPI mechanics to autoinflammation and neurodevelopment (Nature Commun., 2023; review context) (hirschenberger2023arf1preventsaberrant pages 6-8, delafontaine2024clinicalimmunologicaland pages 27-30).

Applications and real-world implementations
- Immunology and autoinflammation: Understanding COPG1/COPI in STING recycling suggests therapeutic angles leveraging ARF1 cycle modulation or COPI cargo interactions to control chronic type I IFN states (Nature Commun., 2023) (hirschenberger2023arf1preventsaberrant pages 6-8).
- Cell-cycle and hematopoiesis: Targeting the COPI–TANGO6–RPB2 axis can modulate G1 progression and hematopoietic stem cell expansion/maintenance (Nature Commun., 2024) (feng2024tango6regulatescell pages 1-2, feng2024tango6regulatescell pages 5-6).
- EV engineering and signaling: Wnt EV secretion via coatomer recognition of lysine-rich EBP motifs offers a design principle for directing cargos onto EVs and potential therapeutic delivery strategies (Science Advances, 2024) (gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 9-10, gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 6-9).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic reviews emphasize COPI’s adaptor/scaffold division, dual ARF1 binding per coatomer, and continuous cycling at the ER–Golgi interface under GBF1 control, placing γ1-COP as a key ARF1-interacting adaptor node (Frontiers in Mol. Biosci., 2025; Mol. Biol. Cell, 2003) (dejgaard2025arfsonthe pages 7-8, garciamata2003adpribosylationfactorcopidependentevents pages 1-2).
- The KDELR commentary consolidates a maturing consensus that ligand-activated KDELR directly recruits COPI and that ARF-GAPs can contribute to cargo sorting, integrating signals and pH-driven conformational changes with coat assembly (Nature Commun., 2024) (aniento2024doesthekdel pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data
- ARF1–COPI association defect in innate immunity: Quantitative proteomics (SILAC) show reduced enrichment of COPI subunits (including COPG1) with ARF1 R99C versus WT; co-IP confirms diminished COPI binding. Ultrastructural STEM tomography revealed decreased vesicle release and increased Golgi lumen density with R99C (Nature Commun., 2023) (hirschenberger2023arf1preventsaberrant pages 6-8).
- Wnt7a EBP–coatomer biophysics: ITC Kd for EBP–COPB2 WD domain is ~11.6 μM (full 18-aa peptide) and ~37.2 μM (C-terminal half); mutations K253A/K255A abolish binding and EV secretion; 1.8-Å complex structure defines the interaction interface (Science Advances, 2024) (gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 6-9, gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 9-10).
- Human immunodeficiency phenotype for COPG1 p.K652E: Clinical data across five siblings with homozygous K652E document recurrent infections, impaired humoral and cellular immunity, defective KDELR-mediated retrieval, and ER stress; murine Copg1K652E recapitulates immune defects, rescued by ER stress-relieving tauroursodeoxycholic acid (J Clin Invest., 2021) (bainter2021combinedimmunodeficiencydue pages 2-4).

Additional notes on cargo recognition
- COPI recognizes classical C-terminal KKxx/KxKxx signals, and γ-COP contributes to this recognition in coatomer; cooperativity with proximal dihydrophobic residues can enhance COPI affinity and bias sorting (Plant Cell Physiol., 2004). α-COP WD40 also binds C-terminal KKxKxx motifs in Nucleolin, highlighting multi-subunit KK-motif recognition within COPI (Human Mol. Genet., 2023) (contreras2004sortingsignalsin pages 2-3, contreras2004sortingsignalsin pages 5-6, custer2023copicoatomersubunit pages 1-2).

Conclusion
Human COPG1 (γ1-COP) is an adaptor subunit of coatomer essential for ARF1-dependent recruitment of COPI, recognition of canonical dilysine retrieval signals, and assembly of retrograde carriers from the Golgi/ERGIC to the ER and within the Golgi. Recent work links COPI (and by extension COPG1) to regulation of innate immune signaling via STING recycling, to cell-cycle control through COPI-mediated nuclear delivery of RPB2, and to EV biology via coatomer recognition of lysine-rich sorting peptides. Human genetics further underscore COPG1’s requirement for immune homeostasis via KDELR-dependent ER protein retrieval and stress control (garciamata2003adpribosylationfactorcopidependentevents pages 1-2, aniento2024doesthekdel pages 1-2, hirschenberger2023arf1preventsaberrant pages 6-8, feng2024tango6regulatescell pages 1-2, gurriaranrodriguez2024identificationofthe pages 6-9, bainter2021combinedimmunodeficiencydue pages 2-4).
