description: 'TPM3 (Tropomyosin 3) is a coiled-coil actin-binding protein with 7 tissue-specific
  isoforms. ISOFORM BIOLOGY: (1) Isoform 1 (P06753-1) is expressed in SLOW SKELETAL
  MUSCLE (type I fibers); (2) Isoform 2 (TM30nm, P06753-2) is the shorter CYTOSKELETAL
  form (248 AA vs 285 AA for muscle). The muscle isoform is part of the thin filament
  regulatory complex essential for muscle contraction in slow-twitch fibers. The cytoskeletal
  TM30nm variant has different actin binding properties and functions in non-muscle
  cells. DISEASE: Mutations cause Congenital myopathy 4A (CMYO4A) with nemaline rods,
  cap structures, and fiber-type disproportion. Annotations for "muscle contraction"
  apply to muscle isoforms; "actin cytoskeleton" applies primarily to cytoskeletal
  isoforms.'

  review:
    summary: TPM3 is a well-established actin-binding protein. UniProt states "Binds
      to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells" [UniProt P06753]. Both the
      muscle isoform (285 AA) and cytoskeletal TM30nm isoform (248 AA) bind actin
      filaments, though with different properties. PMID:3018581 confirms tissue-specific
      expression with "a 2.5-kilobase (kb) mRNA encoding a 248-amino-acid tropomyosin
      in human fibroblasts" (cytoskeletal) and "a 1.3-kb mRNA encoding a 285-amino-acid
      tropomyosin in human skeletal muscle." This is a core molecular function shared
      across all isoforms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Actin filament binding is a fundamental molecular function of all tropomyosin
      isoforms. The IBA annotation is well-supported by the phylogenetic conservation
      of this function across the tropomyosin family and direct experimental evidence
      from multiple studies. This represents a core function of TPM3.

  review:
    summary: TPM3 contributes to actin filament organization in both muscle and non-muscle
      contexts. In non-muscle cells, UniProt states TPM3 "is implicated in stabilizing
      cytoskeleton actin filaments" [UniProt P06753]. PMID:16236705 demonstrated TPM3
      localization to stress fibers and its role in cytoskeletal organization. The
      muscle isoform also contributes to thin filament organization. This process
      annotation appropriately captures the functional role of tropomyosins in organizing
      actin filament architecture.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Actin filament organization is a well-supported biological process for
      TPM3. The IBA annotation reflects the conserved role of tropomyosins in organizing
      and stabilizing actin filament structures. This applies to both muscle (thin
      filament organization) and non-muscle (cytoskeletal) isoforms, representing
      a core function of the gene.

  review:
    summary: TPM3 localizes to actin filaments as an integral component. Tropomyosins
      are coiled-coil proteins that bind along the length of actin filaments. UniProt
      confirms "Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells" [UniProt
      P06753]. In muscle, TPM3 is part of the thin filament; in non-muscle cells,
      it decorates cytoskeletal actin filaments. This localization is fundamental
      to tropomyosin function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Actin filament is the correct cellular component for TPM3 localization.
      This is a core structural feature of tropomyosins - they bind along the entire
      length of actin filaments as coiled-coil dimers. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      well-supported across the tropomyosin family.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Muscle contraction is a function specific to TPM3 Isoform 1 (skeletal
      muscle isoform, 285 AA). UniProt states TPM3 "Plays a central role, in association
      with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate
      striated muscle contraction" [UniProt P06753]. The cytoskeletal isoforms (TM30nm)
      do not participate in muscle contraction. TPM3 Isoform 1 is expressed in slow-twitch
      (type I) skeletal muscle fibers. Disease mutations causing CMYO4A demonstrate
      the importance of this function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Muscle contraction is valid for the skeletal muscle isoform (Isoform 1)
      but not for cytoskeletal isoforms (Isoform 2/TM30nm and others). Since this
      annotation applies to only a subset of isoforms expressed in specific tissues,
      it should be marked as non-core. The core function of TPM3 across all isoforms
      is actin filament binding and organization, while muscle contraction is tissue/isoform-specific.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation for "actin binding" is derived from UniProt keyword
      mapping. While technically correct, it is less specific than the IBA annotation
      for GO:0051015 "actin filament binding" which better captures the mechanism
      by which TPM3 binds actin (along the filament, not to monomeric actin).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0051015 "actin filament binding" is more specific and preferred,
      this broader "actin binding" annotation is not incorrect. TPM3 does bind actin
      (specifically filamentous actin). The IEA provides complementary support to
      the more specific IBA annotation. Both can coexist as the more specific term
      is appropriately annotated via IBA.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation for cytoskeleton localization is derived from UniProt
      subcellular location mapping. UniProt lists "Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton" as the
      subcellular location [UniProt P06753]. While correct, more specific terms like
      "actin filament" (GO:0005884) or "stress fiber" (GO:0001725) better describe
      the actual localization of TPM3.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The cytoskeleton annotation is a valid but general cellular component
      term. TPM3 is indeed a cytoskeletal protein, associating with actin filaments
      in both muscle and non-muscle cells. The more specific IBA annotation to "actin
      filament" (GO:0005884) provides better granularity, but this broader term is

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning correctly identifies TPM3
      as a component of muscle thin filament tropomyosin. However, this applies specifically
      to Isoform 1 (skeletal muscle isoform). The cytoskeletal isoforms (TM30nm/Isoform
      2) are not part of the muscle thin filament structure. PMID:3018581 and PMID:3418707
      clearly describe the tissue-specific alternative splicing that produces distinct
      muscle and non-muscle isoforms.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is accurate for the muscle isoform (Isoform 1) but not
      for cytoskeletal isoforms. The muscle thin filament complex includes tropomyosin
      in association with troponin for calcium-regulated muscle contraction. Since
      this is isoform-specific, it represents a non-core function. The core localization

    summary: This IPI annotation is from a large-scale TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B signaling
      pathway mapping study (PMID:14743216). The generic "protein binding" term provides
      limited functional information about TPM3's specific interactions. TPM3 is known

      The mitochondrial localization identified in this high-throughput proteomics

      While this relates to an oncogenic fusion, cytosol is still an appropriate localization
      for TPM3-containing proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytosol is an appropriate general localization for TPM3, which functions
      as a cytoskeletal protein. While this Reactome entry relates to TPM3-ALK fusion
      proteins in cancer, the cytosolic localization is consistent with TPM3's normal

      The study "identified 539 proteins" in exosomes from B cells. TPM3 detection
      in exosomes likely represents packaging of cytoskeletal components into exosomal

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Detection of TPM3 in extracellular exosomes represents exosomal cargo
      packaging rather than a site of TPM3 function. Cytoskeletal proteins are commonly

      tropomyosin alongside calponin in the context of actin cytoskeleton and stress
      fibers. Stress fibers are contractile actin bundles in non-muscle cells where
      cytoskeletal tropomyosins (like TPM3 isoform 2/TM30nm) localize.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Stress fiber localization is appropriate for the cytoskeletal isoforms
      of TPM3 (especially Isoform 2/TM30nm). Non-muscle tropomyosins associate with
      stress fibers to help stabilize these contractile actin structures. This represents
      a core localization for cytoskeletal TPM3 isoforms, complementing the muscle

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is accurate for the skeletal muscle isoform (Isoform 1,

      complex is specific to muscle tissue where TPM3 Isoform 1 functions with the
