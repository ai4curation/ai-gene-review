# TPM3 (Tropomyosin 3) Notes - ISOFORMS Project

## Key Isoform Biology

TPM3 has **7 named isoforms** with tissue-specific expression, similar to TPM1.

### Tissue-Specific Isoforms

| Isoform | UniProt ID | Synonym | Tissue | Key Feature |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Isoform 1** | P06753-1 | Skeletal muscle | Slow skeletal muscle | Type I fibers |
| **Isoform 2** | P06753-2 | TM30nm, Cytoskeletal | Non-muscle cells | 30nm variant |

### Functional Distinctions

**Skeletal muscle isoform (1):**
- Expressed in slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibers
- Part of thin filament regulatory complex
- Essential for proper muscle contraction

**Cytoskeletal isoforms (2, 3, etc.):**
- TM30nm - shorter variant (248 AA vs 285 AA for muscle)
- Functions in non-muscle actin cytoskeleton
- Different actin binding characteristics

### Disease Associations

**CMYO4A: Congenital myopathy 4A**
- Autosomal dominant
- Muscle weakness in infancy/childhood
- Features: hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency
- Muscle biopsy shows nemaline rods, "cap" structures, fiber-type disproportion

UniProt states:
> "A muscular disorder characterized by onset of muscle weakness in infancy or childhood. Most affected individuals show mildly delayed motor development, hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness"

## Relationship to TPM1

TPM1 and TPM3 are both members of the tropomyosin family but:
- TPM1: More associated with cardiac/smooth muscle function
- TPM3: More associated with slow skeletal muscle and cytoskeleton

## Expected Annotation Issues

1. **"Muscle contraction"** - applies to muscle isoforms
2. **"Actin binding"** - all isoforms but with different properties
3. **"Cytoskeleton organization"** - primarily cytoskeletal isoforms

## GOA Annotation Count: 39
