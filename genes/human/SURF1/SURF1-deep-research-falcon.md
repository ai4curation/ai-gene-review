## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q15526
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Surfeit locus protein 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SURF1; Synonyms=SURF-1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SURF1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Surf1/Shy1. (IPR002994); Surf1/Surf4. (IPR045214); SURF1 (PF02104)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SURF1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SURF1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SURF1** (gene ID: SURF1, UniProt: Q15526) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: SURF1 (UniProt Q15526) — human cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor

Identity verification and key concepts
- Identity and family: SURF1 encodes Surfeit locus protein 1, a conserved member of the SURF1 (Surf1/Shy1) family implicated in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV, CIV) biogenesis. Comparative analyses with fungal homologs (Shy1) demonstrate a conserved SURF1 domain and a closely conserved 3D fold across yeast and human orthologs, supporting shared function (Luo et al., 2024; Scientific Reports; published Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2). Yeast-focused reviews similarly place SURF1/SHY1 among core assembly factors for COX (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22).
- Localization and topology: Experimental work in fission yeast shows the SURF1 homolog (Shy1) is an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein bearing two transmembrane helices with an intermembrane space–facing region, established by mitochondrial fractionation, protease-protection, and alkaline extraction; these findings support analogous topology for human SURF1 given structural conservation (Luo et al., 2024; Sci Rep; Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2).

Primary molecular function and pathways
- Role in Complex IV biogenesis: Multiple lines of evidence position SURF1 as an assembly factor essential for the maturation/assembly of Complex IV, particularly linked to COX1 module assembly and cofactor installation steps. Yeast genetics and patient-derived studies demonstrate that SURF1/SHY1 loss reduces COX abundance/activity and perturbs COX1 expression and assembly, with literature implicating SURF1 in steps related to heme/Cu center maturation during COX1 processing (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22). Fission yeast Shy1 interacts with COX structural subunits (Cox5, Cox6) and assembly factors (e.g., Sco1, Pet117; some analyses also point to Cox14/COA3-related factors), and its deletion reduces Complex IV abundance on BN-PAGE, strengthening evidence for a direct role in CIV biogenesis (Luo et al., 2024; Sci Rep; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2).
- Supercomplex linkage: Co-immunoprecipitation of Shy1 with Rip1 (Complex III subunit) and BN-PAGE analyses suggest SURF1-family proteins may influence, or operate within, respiratory supercomplex assembly contexts, integrating CIV assembly with higher-order complexes (Luo et al., 2024; Sci Rep; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Mechanistic advances: Updated yeast-based syntheses emphasize modular assembly of CIV and the centrality of assembly factors like SURF1/SHY1 in COX1-module maturation and coordination with metal/cofactor handling (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22). Fission yeast work adds conserved topology, direct partner interactions, and supercomplex links (Luo et al., 2024; Sci Rep; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2).
- Model systems: Cross-species models—from budding and fission yeasts to mouse and human cellular systems—remain pivotal. 2023 symposium reporting highlighted Surf1 knockout mouse rescue by AAV9-mediated human SURF1 expression (see Applications/Therapeutics) and ongoing build-out of patient-derived iPSC models for screening (Moreira et al., 2023; Orphanet J Rare Dis; Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 1-2, moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4). Emerging organoid and deep-learning screening platforms target Leigh syndrome neuromorphogenesis defects, with hits improving neuronal differentiation and lactate phenotypes (Menacho et al., 2024; bioRxiv; Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602501) (menacho2024deeplearningdrivenneuromorphogenesis pages 1-5).

Disease association, clinical context, and statistics
- Disease mechanism and phenotype: Biallelic pathogenic variants in SURF1 are a recurrent cause of nuclear-encoded Leigh syndrome with Complex IV deficiency, typically presenting in infancy/early childhood with neurometabolic deterioration (Moreira et al., 2023; Orphanet J Rare Dis; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 1-2). Contemporary reviews and advocacy-led summaries consistently trace SURF1 to COX deficiency and Leigh spectrum disease burden, while noting variable genotype–phenotype expressivity (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22).
- Registry and natural history resources: The Leigh Syndrome Global Patient Registry (Cure Mito Foundation) provides structured, IRB-approved data capture for diagnosis, symptoms, milestone loss, healthcare utilization, and quality of life, enabling clinical trial readiness and natural history analysis; advocacy literature underlines its central role for recruitment and data standardization (Moreira et al., 2023; Orphanet J Rare Dis; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7; Zilber et al., 2025; Research Involvement & Engagement; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00808-x) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 5-6, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14). These resources complement variant curation frameworks and broader mitochondrial repositories cited by expert reviews (Frontiers in Bioscience-Scholar; Dec 2025; https://doi.org/10.31083/fbs45427) (shen2025thepathto pages 14-15).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostics and variant interpretation: Yeast models and cross-species complementation remain practical for testing SURF1 variant pathogenicity within CIV assembly frameworks (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22). Patient registries support natural history baselines, outcome measure development, and trial enrollment logistics (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7; Zilber et al., 2025; RIE; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00808-x) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 5-6, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14).
- Preclinical gene therapy: Symposium-reported mouse studies showed that AAV9-mediated delivery of human SURF1 restored Surf1 expression and normalized mitochondrial dysfunction metrics, including Complex IV levels and lactic acidosis, in Surf1 knockout mice (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4). Additional advocacy/review sources document an AAV-based SURF1 gene-replacement program (AAV5/AAV9 vectors reported in earlier preclinical literature) that advanced toward development, including licensing and orphan/rare pediatric designations (Zilber et al., 2025; RIE; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00808-x) (zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-13, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14).
- Drug repurposing and screening: Deep learning–driven neuromorphogenesis screening in Leigh cerebral organoids identified azole compounds (e.g., Talarozole, Sertaconazole) that improved neuronal commitment/branching and lowered lactate release; a complementary yeast survival screen supported convergence on these classes, illustrating an end-to-end pipeline from organoid phenotyping to candidate selection (Menacho et al., 2024; bioRxiv; Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602501) (menacho2024deeplearningdrivenneuromorphogenesis pages 1-5). Symposium reporting describes additional iPSC-based screening and transcriptomic precision-medicine platforms applied to SURF1 patient-derived cells (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4).

Expert opinions and consensus perspectives
- Community and expert synthesis underscore that SURF1 is central to CIV biogenesis and that cross-model validation (yeast→mouse→human iPSC/organoid) is essential for variant interpretation and therapeutic discovery (Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22). Patient-led networks are catalyzing data standards, registries, and translational programs for Leigh syndrome, including SURF1-focused initiatives and gene therapy development (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7; Zilber et al., 2025; RIE; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00808-x) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 1-2, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 5-6, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14).

Relevant statistics and recent data
- Genetic heterogeneity: Expert summaries report that Leigh syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants across more than a hundred genes, emphasizing the importance of gene-specific natural history and outcome measures; registry efforts document high disease burden and rapid time-to-diagnosis, facilitating trial readiness (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7; Zilber et al., 2025; RIE; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-025-00808-x) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 1-2, moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 5-6, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14).
- Model-derived efficacy signals: In Surf1-deficient mice, AAV9-SURF1 restored CIV levels and reduced lactic acidosis (as reported in the 2023 symposium review), providing quantitative directions for biomarker selection in translational studies (Moreira et al., 2023; OJRD; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-023-02871-7) (moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 2-4). In Leigh organoids, azole-class compounds improved neurite organization and decreased lactate release, offering measurable phenotypic readouts for candidate advancement (Menacho et al., 2024; bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602501) (menacho2024deeplearningdrivenneuromorphogenesis pages 1-5).

Notes on gene/protein identity verification
- The gene symbol SURF1 (human) matches UniProt Q15526 (Surfeit locus protein 1). Recent mechanistic studies on SURF1 homologs in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae (Shy1) corroborate family/domain assignments (SURF1/Surf1-Shy1 domain) and inner mitochondrial membrane localization with two TMs and an IMS-facing domain, consistent with UniProt domain annotations (Luo et al., 2024; Sci Rep; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-72681-9; Guaragnella et al., 2024; Int J Mol Sci; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25073814) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22).

Conclusion
- SURF1 is a conserved IMM assembly factor required for proper biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), likely acting at COX1-module maturation/assembly and interfacing with metal/cofactor handling machinery. Cross-model evidence—from yeast homologs to mammalian systems—supports this role, and recent work adds potential linkage to supercomplex assembly. Clinically, biallelic SURF1 variants produce a reproducible Leigh syndrome phenotype with Complex IV deficiency. Translational momentum includes AAV-based gene-replacement proof-of-concept in Surf1-null mice and organoid-based deep-learning screens nominating repurposable compounds that rescue neuronal and metabolic readouts, all supported by expanding patient registries and advocacy-led infrastructures essential for natural history and trial readiness (Luo et al., 2024; Guaragnella et al., 2024; Moreira et al., 2023; Zilber et al., 2025; Menacho et al., 2024) (luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 4-6, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 3-4, luo2024characterizationofshy1 pages 1-2, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 2-4, guaragnella2024morethanjust pages 21-22, moreira2023teamworkmakesthe pages 1-2, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 5-6, zilber2025expandingresearchand pages 13-14, menacho2024deeplearningdrivenneuromorphogenesis pages 1-5).
