description: >-
  SURF1 (Surfeit locus protein 1) is a conserved mitochondrial inner membrane protein that
  functions as an assembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV, CIV). It is a component
  of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c
  oxidase) complex, where it participates in early COX1-module assembly, likely facilitating
  heme a insertion into COX1 or stabilizing COX1 assembly intermediates. SURF1 is NOT a
  structural subunit of Complex IV itself. The protein contains two transmembrane helices
  with an intermembrane space-facing domain. Loss-of-function mutations in SURF1 are the
  most common nuclear gene cause of COX-deficient Leigh syndrome (MC4DN1), and SURF1
  mutations also cause demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4K (CMT4K). SURF1 is
  the human ortholog of yeast Shy1. Interacts with the MITRAC component COA3/MITRAC12.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SURF1 is a well-established assembly factor for mitochondrial Complex IV (cytochrome c
      oxidase). Phylogenetic inference (IBA) based on conserved function from yeast Shy1 through
      human SURF1 is strongly supported. The founding paper (PMID:9843204) demonstrated that SURF1
      mutations cause COX deficiency and concluded "a role for SURF1 in the biogenesis of the COX
      complex." Subsequent work confirmed SURF1 as a component of the MITRAC complex that regulates
      COX assembly (PMID:26321642, PMID:23260140). The deep research review (Guaragnella et al.,
      2024; Luo et al., 2024) further confirms this as the core conserved function across species.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly is the core biological process of SURF1.
      This IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive experimental evidence from multiple

      SURF1 is unambiguously a mitochondrial protein. UniProt annotates it to the mitochondrion
      inner membrane (by sequence similarity to mouse ortholog P09925). The IBA annotation

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation was inferred via logical inference from GO:0004129 (cytochrome-c
      oxidase activity), since cytochrome c oxidase catalyzes proton translocation across
      the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, SURF1 is NOT a structural subunit of Complex
      IV and does not itself catalyze proton transport. It is an assembly factor that facilitates
      the biogenesis of the complex. Proton transmembrane transport is an activity of the
      assembled Complex IV, not of the assembly factor.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      SURF1 does not directly participate in proton transmembrane transport. This annotation
      derives from the erroneous upstream annotation of cytochrome-c oxidase activity
      (GO:0004129) to SURF1 via Ensembl Compara. Since SURF1 is an assembly factor and not
      a catalytic subunit of Complex IV, attributing the catalytic process of proton pumping
      to SURF1 is incorrect. The assembled complex performs proton translocation; the assembly
      factor does not.

    summary: >-
      SURF1 is indeed a membrane protein with two predicted transmembrane helices, placed in
      the mitochondrial inner membrane. The generic GO:0016020 (membrane) annotation from
      InterPro domain mapping is not wrong but is very unspecific compared to the more precise
      GO:0005743 (mitochondrial inner membrane) annotations already present.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While very general, this IEA annotation from InterPro is technically correct. SURF1
      contains transmembrane domains and is an integral membrane protein. More specific
      mitochondrial inner membrane annotations are present from other evidence codes. It is
      acceptable for an IEA to be broader than what is established by more detailed evidence.

      This IEA annotation was transferred from the mouse ortholog (P09925) via Ensembl Compara.
      However, SURF1 is NOT a structural or catalytic subunit of cytochrome c oxidase. It is
      an assembly factor that facilitates the biogenesis of the complex. SURF1 does not itself
      possess cytochrome-c oxidase enzymatic activity (the catalysis of ferrocytochrome c
      oxidation coupled to proton pumping). The original paper (PMID:9843204) explicitly states
      SURF1 encodes "a factor involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase," not a
      subunit with catalytic activity.
    action: REMOVE

      This is an incorrect annotation. Cytochrome-c oxidase activity (GO:0004129) describes
      the catalytic reaction performed by the assembled Complex IV holoenzyme. SURF1 is an
      assembly factor, not a catalytic subunit. It does not catalyze the reduction of oxygen
      or pump protons. The Ensembl Compara transfer is erroneous here, likely propagating
      an annotation from the mouse ortholog that was itself over-annotated. UniProt explicitly
      describes SURF1 as a "Component of the MITRAC complex that regulates cytochrome c
      oxidase assembly" (PMID:24027061, PMID:9843204, PMID:26321642), not as having COX

      (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly) is preferred. This term is
      already annotated via IBA, IEA, and IMP evidence, so this is a specificity refinement.

  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9843204
  review:
    summary: >-
      This TAS annotation to aerobic respiration is based on the founding SURF1 paper. While
      SURF1 loss does impair aerobic respiration (because Complex IV is the terminal enzyme
      of the electron transport chain), SURF1 is an assembly factor, not a direct participant
      in the respiratory process itself. The aerobic respiration annotation represents an
      over-annotation; the correct primary annotation is to Complex IV assembly. The
      downstream consequences of impaired CIV assembly include impaired aerobic respiration,
      but that does not mean SURF1 is directly "involved_in" aerobic respiration.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      SURF1 facilitates the assembly of Complex IV, which is required for aerobic respiration.
      However, SURF1 does not directly participate in the respiratory chain or electron
      transport. Annotating an assembly factor to the process carried out by the assembled
      complex is an over-annotation. The correct annotation is to Complex IV assembly
      (GO:0033617), which is already present. The relationship between SURF1 and aerobic
      respiration is indirect (assembly factor -> complex -> process).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This TAS annotation places SURF1 as a component of the "respiratory chain complex."
      GO:0098803 is defined as "any protein complex that is part of a respiratory chain."
      SURF1 is NOT a structural subunit of the mature respiratory chain Complex IV. It is an
      assembly factor that transiently associates with assembly intermediates (MITRAC complex)
      but is not part of the final assembled complex. The founding paper (PMID:9843204)
      describes SURF1 as "a factor involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase," not
      as a component of the respiratory chain.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      SURF1 is not a structural subunit of the respiratory chain. It is a component of the
      MITRAC complex, which is a transient assembly intermediate, not the mature respiratory
      chain complex. The correct CC annotation would be to the mitochondrial respiratory chain
      complex IV pre-assembly complex (GO:0062011), which describes the MITRAC complex where
      SURF1 resides. Annotating SURF1 to GO:0098803 (respiratory chain complex) incorrectly
      implies it is a structural component of the electron transport chain.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SURF1 is a component of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly
      intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase) complex. This was established by Mick et al.
      (2012, PMID:23260140), who identified SURF1 as part of early COX assembly intermediates.
      Dennerlein et al. (2015, PMID:26321642) further confirmed SURF1 presence in the MITRAC
      complex. UniProt states SURF1 is a "Component of the MITRAC complex." Reactome
      (R-HSA-9865350) explicitly lists SURF1 as a MITRAC subunit alongside CMC1, COX14,
      COA1, COA3, and SMIM20. GO:0062011 is defined as "A protein complex that contributes
      to and regulates mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (COX) formation."
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This CC annotation is missing from the current annotation set and would accurately
      capture SURF1's localization within the MITRAC complex. This is more informative than
      the generic 'respiratory chain complex' (GO:0098803) currently annotated. The MITRAC
      complex is the specific subcompartment where SURF1 functions, and GO:0062011 was
      created to describe this complex.

  findings:

      SURF1 is a conserved IMM assembly factor required for proper biogenesis of cytochrome

  description: >-
    SURF1 functions as an assembly factor for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV),
    acting within the MITRAC complex during early COX1-module assembly. It may facilitate
    heme a insertion into COX1 or stabilize COX1 assembly intermediates. The precise molecular
    function is not yet fully characterized; evidence from bacterial models suggests a possible
    role as a heme insertion chaperone, but this has not been confirmed for the human protein.
