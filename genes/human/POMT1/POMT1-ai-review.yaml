description: 'Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1, glycosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.109) that catalyzes the first
  committed step in protein O-mannose glycan biosynthesis by transferring mannose from dolichol-phosphate-mannose
  to serine/threonine hydroxyl groups on target proteins. Forms obligate heteromeric complex with POMT2
  in 1:1 stoichiometry - individually neither subunit has enzymatic activity, only the POMT1/POMT2 complex
  is functional. ER-resident integral membrane protein with ~10 transmembrane helices and luminal catalytic
  domains facing ER lumen. Belongs to GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases with conserved acidic residues
  in first luminal loop forming active site that binds dolichol-P-mannose. Contains MIR domains and TPR
  repeats predicted to mediate protein substrate recognition; no short consensus sequence motif identified
  - substrate recognition depends on folded protein context and structural features rather than linear
  sequence. Primary physiological substrate: α-dystroglycan (α-DG), an ECM receptor glycoprotein requiring
  O-mannose glycan (matriglycan) to bind laminin, agrin, and perlecan. POMT1/2 initiate attachment of
  mannose on specific Thr residues (e.g. Thr-317, Thr-379) which primes sites for elongation into core
  M1/M2/M3 glycan structures - subsequent enzymes add GalNAc, xylose, ribitol-phosphate, and ultimately
  LARGE1 polymerizes matriglycan repeating disaccharide that directly binds ECM ligands. Without initial
  mannose from POMT1, entire carbohydrate scaffold cannot be built. Loss of POMT1 causes hypoglycosylation
  of α-dystroglycan, disrupting muscle-ECM anchorage. Other substrates: receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases
  (RPTPζ/phosphacan) carrying O-mannose glycans with HNK-1 epitopes in neural development, KIAA1549, PTP69D
  in fly for sensory axon guidance. POMT1-mediated O-mannosylation extends to cell-surface receptors in
  neural circuit formation. Critical for basement membrane assembly: Pomt1 knockout mice are embryonically
  lethal due to failure of Reichert''s membrane formation (non-functional dystroglycan). Dystrophin-glycoprotein
  complex: α-dystroglycan (heavily O-mannosylated) binds extracellular laminin while β-dystroglycan links
  to cytoskeleton via dystrophin, stabilizing muscle fibers during contraction. Mutations cause Walker-Warburg
  syndrome (WWS, ~20% of cases), severe congenital muscular dystrophy with brain malformations (cobblestone
  lissencephaly, hydrocephalus), eye defects (retinal dysplasia), early lethality; also limb-girdle muscular
  dystrophy 2K (LGMD2K) with later-onset milder muscle weakness but often intellectual disability. POMT1
  mutations tend to have CNS involvement even in milder forms. One of three mammalian protein O-mannosyltransferase
  families (others: TMTC1-4 for cadherins, TMEM260 for plexin/RON/MET) - POMT1/2 uniquely responsible
  for dystroglycan-type pathways, occupying non-redundant niche. Acts early in secretory pathway modifying
  nascent polypeptides in ER lumen before Golgi trafficking. Essential for muscle fiber integrity, brain
  cortical layering, eye development, peripheral nerve myelination. Substrate specificity is broad in
  function but narrow in occurrence - targets select set of large extracellular/membrane proteins requiring
  O-mannose for function.'
