description: Ferroportin (SLC40A1/FPN1/IREG1) is the sole known mammalian cellular
  iron exporter, functioning as a 12-transmembrane domain protein in the Major Facilitator
  Superfamily (MFS). It exports ferrous iron (Fe2+) from the cytoplasm across the
  plasma membrane via an electroneutral 2H+/Fe2+ antiport mechanism. Ferroportin is
  predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes (for
  dietary iron absorption), macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (for iron
  recycling from senescent erythrocytes), hepatocytes (for iron store mobilization),
  and erythrocytes. The protein is negatively regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin
  (HAMP), which binds to ferroportin in a metal-dependent manner (Fe2+ increases hepcidin
  affinity ~80-fold), blocking transport and triggering ubiquitination via RNF217
  and subsequent lysosomal/proteasomal degradation. Ferroportin works in concert with
  extracellular ferroxidases (ceruloplasmin, hephaestin) that oxidize exported Fe2+
  to Fe3+ for loading onto transferrin. Mutations in SLC40A1 cause hemochromatosis
  type 4 (ferroportin disease), with loss-of-function mutations causing macrophage
  iron retention and gain-of-function (hepcidin-resistant) mutations causing parenchymal
  iron overload.

  review:
    summary: Ferroportin is definitively established as an iron transmembrane transporter.
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is well-supported by extensive
      experimental evidence across vertebrates including human.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of ferroportin. The protein exports
      Fe2+ across the plasma membrane as demonstrated by multiple experimental studies
      including functional assays in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. Cryo-EM
      structures have revealed the iron-binding sites and transport mechanism.

    summary: Generic membrane annotation from early discovery paper.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Ferroportin is an integral membrane protein. This broad annotation is
      accurate, though more specific annotations (plasma membrane, basolateral membrane)
      are more informative.

    id: GO:0015093
    label: ferrous iron transmembrane transporter activity
  description: Ferroportin is the sole known mammalian iron exporter. It specifically
    transports ferrous iron (Fe2+) from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space via
    an electroneutral 2H+/Fe2+ antiport mechanism. This function has been demonstrated
    by direct transport assays in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (PMID:15692071,
    PMID:24304836), cryo-EM structural analysis revealing iron-binding sites (PMID:32814342),
    and genetic evidence from hemochromatosis type 4 patients (PMID:12091367).
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0017046
    label: peptide hormone binding
  description: Ferroportin directly binds the peptide hormone hepcidin (HAMP), which
    is the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin binding blocks
    iron transport and triggers ferroportin ubiquitination and degradation. Structural
    studies have mapped the hepcidin-binding site (PMID:29237594, PMID:32814342).
    Iron binding to ferroportin increases hepcidin affinity ~80-fold, ensuring hepcidin
    preferentially targets iron-loaded ferroportin.
