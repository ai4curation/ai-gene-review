## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9NP59
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ferroportin {ECO:0000305|PubMed:15692071}; AltName: Full=Ferroportin-1; AltName: Full=Iron-regulated transporter 1; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 40 member 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:10909};
- **Gene Information:** Name=SLC40A1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:10909}; Synonyms=FPN {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15692071}, FPN1, IREG1, SLC11A3; ORFNames=MSTP079;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ferroportin (FP) (TC 2.A.100) family. SLC40A
- **Key Domains:** Ferroportin-1. (IPR009716); MFS_trans_sf. (IPR036259); FPN1 (PF06963)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SLC40A1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SLC40A1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SLC40A1** (gene ID: SLC40A1, UniProt: Q9NP59) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human SLC40A1 (UniProt Q9NP59), also known as ferroportin, FPN1, IREG1; member of the solute carrier family 40 (SLC40A). Literature reviewed below consistently refers to human ferroportin/SLC40A1 and the ferroportin (FP) family, with a 12-transmembrane Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) fold and hallmark regulation by hepcidin. No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered. The organism context is Homo sapiens. Family/domain assignments and functional attributes align with the ferroportin (TC 2.A.100) group and MFS-related structural superfamily. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 20-25, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30)

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Primary function and substrate: SLC40A1 encodes ferroportin, the sole known cellular iron exporter in mammals. It exports ferrous iron (Fe2+) across the plasma membrane, cooperating with extracellular ferroxidases (hephaestin, ceruloplasmin) to load iron onto transferrin. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 20-25, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 20-25)
- Cellular and tissue localization: Ferroportin is localized to the basolateral membrane of duodenal enterocytes (dietary iron export), is highly expressed in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (iron recycling), and hepatocytes (iron release from stores). Additional expression occurs in placenta and cells of the central nervous system (astrocytes/microglia). (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30)
- Structural class/domains: Human FPN is an ~571 aa, 12‑TM transporter with intracellular N- and C-termini, adopting an MFS fold comprising N- (TM1–6) and C- (TM7–12) domains forming a central cavity. TM7 is split into TM7a/TM7b and harbors key residues implicated in metal binding and hepcidin regulation (e.g., D325, C326). (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30)
- Transport stoichiometry: Experimental structural/functional studies support that FPN exports Fe2+ in exchange for protons; mammalian/primate cryo‑EM studies showed electroneutral H+/Fe2+ antiport with two H+ per Fe2+. (eLife/related structural work as collated in 2025 review) (amadei2025thedifferentaffinity pages 11-12)

2) Structural mechanism and hepcidin binding/inhibition (with structural data)
- Conformational cycle: Mammalian FPN structures are captured mainly in outward‑open or partially occluded states; inward‑open states are inferred from bacterial homologs. An intracellular “gating network” (e.g., R88, D157, E486, R489) stabilizes outward‑open conformations; mutations in this network can cause loss‑of‑function disease. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 25-30, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30)
- Hepcidin binding site and metal dependence: Cryo‑EM of FPN–metal–hepcidin complexes shows hepcidin binds within the central cavity bridging N‑ and C‑domains, acting as a “molecular cork” that locks an outward‑open state. Key residues at or near the site include N144, D325, C326, Y333, Y501, D504, H507; the hepcidin C‑terminus coordinates a divalent metal at the S2 site. Binding is metal‑dependent; Fe2+ markedly increases hepcidin affinity (~80‑fold), consistent with hepcidin preferentially inhibiting iron‑loaded FPN. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 35-40, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 35-40)
- Inhibitor‑bound structures: Recent structural work has reported FPN in complex with the specific small‑molecule inhibitor vamifeport (VIT‑2763), capturing a partially closed/occluded central cavity that rationalizes inhibition. (Lehmann et al., 2023, eLife, DOI: 10.7554/eLife.83053) (amadei2025thedifferentaffinity pages 11-12)
- Evidence for antiport stoichiometry in structure-guided studies: Cryo‑EM analyses of primate FPN (e.g., Philippine tarsier) indicated electroneutral 2H+/1Fe2+ antiport with two metal‑binding sites (one per domain); mutating either site impairs coupled transport. (Pan et al., Biophysical Journal 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.656) (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 20-25)

3) Regulation: systemic and cellular pathways
- Hepcidin–FPN axis: Hepcidin (25 aa peptide hormone from hepatocytes) is the master systemic regulator. Hepcidin binding to surface FPN blocks transport and triggers FPN ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation. Mechanistic studies indicate recruitment of kinases (e.g., Jak2) and ubiquitin ligases (e.g., RNF217) in internalization/degradation pathways. (domenico12011hepcidinandferroportin pages 8-9, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 35-40)
- Upstream hepcidin regulation: Hepcidin is upregulated by iron and inflammation (e.g., IL‑6/STAT3; BMP/SMAD via BMP6/HJV), and suppressed by erythropoietic drive (e.g., erythroferrone) and hypoxia. These changes modulate FPN activity system‑wide by altering hepcidin levels. (domenico12011hepcidinandferroportin pages 11-13)
- Transcriptional/post‑transcriptional control of SLC40A1: FPN transcription responds to NRF2/ARE and HIF signals (notably HIF‑2α in enterocytes), linking oxidative stress and hypoxia to iron export capacity; post‑transcriptionally, most SLC40A1 transcripts contain a 5′ iron‑responsive element (IRE) that suppresses translation via IRP binding under low cytosolic iron. miRNAs (e.g., miR‑20 family) also modulate FPN expression via the 3′ UTR. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 20-25, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 35-40, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 152-156)
- Ferroxidases modulate FPN stability: Cell‑surface hephaestin/ceruloplasmin promote iron oxidation/loading and stabilize FPN at the membrane; loss of ferroxidase activity can accelerate hepcidin sensitivity/internalization of FPN. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 35-40)

4) Disease associations, mutations, and pathophysiology
- Hemochromatosis type 4 (ferroportin disease): Autosomal dominant SLC40A1 mutations cause two clinical patterns: (a) loss‑of‑function (classically “type 4A”) with iron retention in macrophages, high ferritin but normal/low transferrin saturation; (b) hepcidin‑resistant gain‑of‑function (“type 4B”) with high transferrin saturation and parenchymal iron overload similar to classic hemochromatosis. (domenico12011hepcidinandferroportin pages 11-13)
- Mechanistic mutation classes: Mutations that disrupt transport/localization or the intracellular gate produce loss‑of‑function; mutations near the hepcidin‑binding/metal site (e.g., C326, Y333, D325) can confer hepcidin resistance. Structural reviews highlight residues D157 (gate), D325/C326 (TM7b metal/hepcidin interface), and Y333 (hepcidin pocket) as critical. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 25-30, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 35-40)
- Anemia of inflammation: Elevated hepcidin during inflammation blocks FPN‑mediated iron export from enterocytes and macrophages, restricting plasma iron and contributing to iron‑restricted erythropoiesis. (domenico12011hepcidinandferroportin pages 11-13)

5) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)
- Structural advances: 2023 cryo‑EM studies reported FPN in complex with the small‑molecule inhibitor vamifeport, providing atomistic insight into pharmacologic inhibition and an occluded/closed central cavity. These data complement earlier hepcidin‑bound structures and support an elevator‑like or rocker‑switch cycle biased by intracellular and extracellular gating networks. eLife 2023 (DOI: 10.7554/eLife.83053). (amadei2025thedifferentaffinity pages 11-12)
- Mechanism updates: Contemporary analyses emphasize a split TM7 with dynamic TM7b stabilized by bound metal, formation of two metal sites (one per domain), and a metal‑dependent increase in hepcidin affinity that may tune inhibition to iron‑loaded FPN. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 25-30, amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 35-40)

6) Current applications and translational implementations
- Hepcidin agonists (mimetics): Rusfertide (PTG‑300) is a clinical hepcidin mimetic advancing in late‑stage development for polycythemia vera; clinical studies show reduction/elimination of therapeutic phlebotomy requirements and normalization of hematologic/iron parameters. (Review coverage of ongoing late‑stage trials and results) (domenico12011hepcidinandferroportin pages 11-13)
- Ferroportin inhibitor: Vamifeport (VIT‑2763) is an oral small‑molecule FPN blocker in clinical development; it has been reported as the only FPN blocker in human testing to date in several recent reviews and summaries. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30)
- Broader therapeutic landscape: Multiple agents target the hepcidin/FPN axis directly or indirectly (e.g., ALK2/BMP pathway inhibitors or TMPRSS6 modulation), with intent to correct iron maldistribution in disorders with ineffective erythropoiesis or inflammatory anemia. (guerra2023novelpotentialtherapeutics pages 5-5)

7) Quantitative data and statistics
- Transport stoichiometry: Structural/functional evidence indicates electroneutral antiport with two protons per exported Fe2+ (2H+/Fe2+). (Pan et al., Biophysical Journal 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.656) (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 20-25)
- Metal‑dependent hepcidin affinity: Binding of Fe2+ markedly increases hepcidin affinity to FPN (approximately 80‑fold), consistent with a model in which hepcidin preferentially targets iron‑occupied FPN. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidasea pages 35-40)
- Clinical development notes: Reviews summarizing recent trial activity indicate rusfertide has shown robust hematocrit control and phlebotomy elimination in phase 2 PV studies and is in a global phase 3 trial; vamifeport has completed early‑phase clinical testing as an oral FPN inhibitor. (amadei2024investigatingtheferroportinferroxidase pages 25-30, guerra2023novelpotentialtherapeutics pages 5-5)

Expert analysis and synthesis
- SLC40A1/ferroportin represents the systemic bottleneck for iron entry into plasma from diet and stores. The convergence of structure, biophysics, and pathophysiology now supports a cohesive model wherein FPN exports Fe2+ via 2H+ antiport, is directly corked by hepcidin in a metal‑dependent manner, and is subsequently removed by ubiquitin‑mediated endocytosis. Structural localization of disease mutations to the intracellular gate or the hepcidin/metal site explains the dichotomy of ferroportin disease phenotypes (loss of transport vs hepcidin resistance). Therapeutic manipulation of this axis—either amplifying hepcidin activity (agonists) or directly inhibiting FPN (vamifeport)—is yielding clinically meaningful effects in iron‑loading and erythrocytosis disorders, with continued momentum in 2023–2024.
