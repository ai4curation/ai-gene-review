## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene ATP5MC1 (P05496) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Introduction 
ATP5MC1 (also known as ATP5G1 or ATP synthase subunit c locus 1) encodes a **subunit c of the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP synthase (Complex V)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/516#:~:text=alpha%2C%203%20beta%2C%20and%20a,24%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)) ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=ATP5G1%2C%20ATP5MC1%2C%20ATP%20synthase%20lipid,protein%209%2C%20ATPase%20subunit%20c)). This enzyme complex is the primary generator of ATP in cells, using the energy of the proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (the proton-motive force) to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)). ATP5MC1 is one of three nuclear genes in humans (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3) that each produce an identical **ATP synthase proteolipid subunit c** after import into mitochondria and cleavage of targeting sequences ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/516#:~:text=alpha%2C%203%20beta%2C%20and%20a,24%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). The mature protein is a **mitochondrial inner membrane protein** that is highly hydrophobic and forms part of the F<sub>0</sub> proton-conducting channel. It is sometimes referred to as **ATP synthase proteolipid P1** or **subunit 9** in older literature ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=ATP5G1%2C%20ATP5MC1%2C%20ATP%20synthase%20lipid,protein%209%2C%20ATPase%20subunit%20c)). 

**Functionally**, the ATP synthase F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> complex is a rotary enzyme that couples proton transport to ATP production ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)). Subunit c of ATP5MC1 plays a **critical role in proton translocation**: it binds and transports protons across the membrane as part of a ring of c-subunits (the c-ring) in the F<sub>0</sub> domain ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). This proton movement drives mechanical rotation of the c-ring and attached central stalk, which in turn stimulates the F<sub>1</sub> catalytic domain to phosphorylate ADP to ATP ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). Below, we detail the **biochemical activity, mechanism, localization, and pathways** involving ATP5MC1’s gene product, drawing on current research and high-resolution structural studies. We also discuss recent findings on its role in cell death pathways, and highlight expert analyses and data from the latest literature. 

# ATP5MC1 and the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATP Synthase Complex 
**Complex V Composition and Catalysis:** Mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATP synthase (Complex V) is a large multi-subunit complex composed of two coupled motors: the soluble F<sub>1</sub> headpiece (α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γδε) which contains the catalytic sites, and the membrane-embedded F<sub>0</sub> portion which forms a proton channel ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)). These parts are connected by a central rotating stalk (γδε and the c-ring) and a peripheral stalk (stabilizing scaffold) ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=F,Part%20of%20the)). The overall reaction catalyzed is:  **ADP + P<sub>i</sub> + nH<sup>+</sup> (intermembrane space) → ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O + nH<sup>+</sup> (matrix)**, i.e. ATP synthesis driven by proton flux. Subunit c (ATP5MC1’s product) is an essential component of the F<sub>0</sub> motor and **does not catalyze ATP formation directly**, but facilitates it by translocating protons. In essence, the **substrates** of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> enzyme are ADP/P<sub>i</sub> (for ATP synthesis in F<sub>1</sub>) and H<sup>+</sup> ions (for transport through F<sub>0</sub>), and subunit c is specifically responsible for binding and ferrying **protons** across the inner membrane as the enzyme operates ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)).

Each subunit c is a small (~75 amino acid) proteolipid with two transmembrane helices that embed in the inner membrane. A key feature of subunit c is a **conserved acidic residue** (a glutamate in mitochondria, e.g. Glu-58 in human subunit c) situated in the middle of the membrane, which serves as the proton-binding site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). During operation, a proton from the intermembrane space half-channel (provided by subunit a of F<sub>0</sub>, encoded by mitochondrial gene *ATP6*) binds to this glutamate on a c-subunit. The protonation neutralizes the charge, allowing the c-ring to rotate within the hydrophobic membrane. As the c-ring turns and brings that subunit around to the matrix-side half-channel of subunit a, the proton is released into the mitochondrial matrix when the acidic side chain re-ionizes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). This cycle of proton binding and release occurs sequentially on each c-subunit, such that **proton flow drives continuous rotation of the c-ring**. The rotation is **mechanically coupled** to the F<sub>1</sub> headpiece via the central stalk (made of γ, δ, ε subunits) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). Each 360° revolution of the c-ring forces conformational changes in the catalytic α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> core, leading to synthesis of three ATP molecules (Boyer’s binding-change mechanism) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)). In summary, subunit c enables **chemiosmotic energy conversion**: the energy from **proton translocation** is converted into mechanical rotation and then into chemical bond energy in ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)).

**Subunit c-ring Stoichiometry:** Notably, multiple c subunits assemble into an **oligomeric ring (c-ring)** that constitutes the rotary element of F<sub>0</sub>. In human mitochondria, **8 copies** of subunit c form the ring (c<sub>8</sub>) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=provide%20a%20description%20of%20the,8)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). (By comparison, many bacteria and yeast have larger rings of 10–15 c subunits, meaning the proton/ATP ratio can vary by species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=stoichiometry%20of%20the%20c,dimeric%20bovine%20ATP%20synthase%20described)).) The human/bovine c<sub>8</sub>-ring stoichiometry implies that **eight protons** translocated correspond to one full rotation generating three ATP, roughly 2.7 H<sup>+</sup> per ATP synthesized ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=stoichiometry%20of%20the%20c,dimeric%20bovine%20ATP%20synthase%20described)). The small ring size in mammals reflects a high coupling efficiency of proton motive force to ATP production. Cryo-EM structures of bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase confirmed the c-ring to be a **circle of 8 proton-binding c-subunits** in contact with subunit a (ATP6) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=interact%20with%20a%20ring%20of,cavity%20to%20tether%20the%20C)). The interface between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and subunit a forms two half-channels that guide protons; protons enter through the inlet half-channel, bind to c subunits, rotate ~45° per proton, and exit via the outlet half-channel on the opposite side ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=adjacent%20c,159)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). This design ensures proton flow is tightly coupled to rotor motion in the **“rotational catalysis”** mechanism of ATP synthase ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=F,Part%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)).

**Enzymatic and Transport Activity:** Within the F<sub>0</sub> sector, the ring of subunit c together with subunit a essentially constitutes a **proton turbine**. Subunit a (mitochondrial ATP6) provides stationary half-channels, while the c-ring provides mobile proton-binding sites. Each c subunit alternates between protonated and deprotonated states as it rides past the two half-channels, functioning collectively as a **proton-translocating enzyme** element ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)). Though subunit c itself does not hydrolyze ATP, it is integral to the enzyme’s ability to **couple proton movement to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis**. In fact, if the F<sub>1</sub> sector runs in reverse (ATP hydrolysis), the c-ring will rotate in the opposite direction and pump protons against the gradient – showing that the **ATP synthase is reversible**, acting as a proton-pumping ATPase when necessary ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=energy%2C%20which%20is%20then%20released,across%20cellular%20boundaries%20called%20membranes)). Thus, ATP5MC1’s product can be viewed as part of a **rotary proton transporter** whose activity is harnessed to drive a chemical reaction. The importance of the c subunit is underscored by classic biochemical inhibitors: e.g. **dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)** binds covalently to the essential acidic residue in subunit c, preventing proton binding and **inhibiting ATP synthase activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). Likewise, oligomycin (an antibiotic) is known to block the proton channel of F<sub>0</sub> by binding the interface of subunit a and the c-ring, demonstrating the critical role of subunit c in proton translocation (indeed “oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein” was historically a name for a different subunit, but oligomycin’s effect highlights the c-ring’s function). 

# Localization and Structural Context 
**Mitochondrial Localization:** ATP5MC1’s protein product is localized to the **inner membrane of mitochondria**, where it resides as a multi-pass membrane protein in the F<sub>0</sub> sector of ATP synthase ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11951#:~:text=activity,27%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). It is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor with an N-terminal **mitochondrial targeting sequence**, which is then imported into the organelle. Upon import into the matrix, the targeting pre-sequence is cleaved, yielding the mature subunit c (~75 amino acids) that embeds in the inner membrane lipid bilayer ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/516#:~:text=alpha%2C%203%20beta%2C%20and%20a,24%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). Both N- and C-termini of subunit c face the mitochondrial matrix, with a small loop in the matrix and the two hydrophobic α-helices spanning the membrane. The helices pack in the membrane alongside those of other c subunits, forming a ring-shaped oligomer (often called the **c-ring or rotor ring**). This ring is part of the **F<sub>0</sub> rotary motor** domain and is physically attached to the central stalk (γδε subunits) that penetrates into F<sub>1</sub> ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=,the%20region%20of%20the%20monomer%E2%80%93monomer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=,the%20region%20of%20the%20monomer%E2%80%93monomer)). The arrangement effectively makes subunit c a **structural component** of the rotor assembly, connecting the flow of protons in the membrane to the mechanical rotation of the enzyme.

**Assembly into Complex V:** Human ATP synthase is a **multi-protein complex of 18 distinct subunit types (nominally named a, b, c, α, β, γ, etc.) totaling 29 polypeptides in the monomer** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=The%20ATP%20synthase%20in%20human,c_%7B8%7D%20complex%20inhibited%20by%20the)). All subunits of the membrane domain except two (ATP6 and ATP8 encoded by mitochondrial DNA) are encoded by nuclear genes like ATP5MC1 and imported ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=The%20ATP%20synthase%20in%20human,c_%7B8%7D%20complex%20inhibited%20by%20the)). Subunit c is one of these nuclear-encoded membrane components. During assembly, multiple c subunits first oligomerize into the c-ring, which then attaches to the F<sub>1</sub> sector and other F<sub>0</sub> subunits. Studies on assembly intermediates in human cells showed a stable F<sub>1</sub>-c<sub>8</sub> module can form even if other F<sub>0</sub> parts are missing, indicating the c-ring readily binds to F<sub>1</sub> ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=human%20genes%20for%20the%20nuclear,proteolipid%2C%20and%20the%20complex%20is)). The proper integration of the mitochondrial-encoded subunit a (ATP6) with the c<sub>8</sub>-ring is a late step required to form a functional proton channel ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=provide%20a%20description%20of%20the,8)). Once fully assembled, subunit c sits in the membrane domain in contact with subunits a, e, f, g, and others that help organize the complex into **dimers** within the inner membrane. (Complex V dimers line the edges of cristae — interestingly, while subunit c itself is not the dimer interface, its ring’s rotation and the overall structure of ATP synthase dimers contribute to maintaining crista curvature ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20,motions%20of%20the%20machine%20accompanying)).) Structurally, each c subunit helix contains the proton-binding glutamate, arranged such that the c-ring presents a ring of acidic residues at a mid-membrane level. These acidic residues are only accessible to the hydrophilic environment when aligned with a proton half-channel of subunit a. High-resolution structures show that the interface of subunit a and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring contains two offset channels – one opening to the intermembrane space and one to the matrix – separated by a critical arginine on subunit a that helps **release protons from subunit c** by electrostatic repulsion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). This elaborate architecture underscores how the **precise localization and structure** of subunit c in the inner membrane enable it to perform its function – essentially acting as **rotating proton carriers** in the membrane, tightly coupled to a central shaft and enzymatic head.

# Biological Pathways and Processes 
**Oxidative Phosphorylation:** The primary biological process involving ATP5MC1 is **oxidative phosphorylation**, the process by which cells generate ATP using energy from electron transport. Complex V (ATP synthase) is the terminal step of the mitochondrial respiratory chain: it uses the proton gradient established by the upstream complexes I–IV to produce ATP ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)). Subunit c (as part of F<sub>0</sub>) is directly involved in **proton transmembrane transport coupled to ATP synthesis** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11951#:~:text=activity,27%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). In functional terms, ATP5MC1 enables “**proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis**” ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11951#:~:text=activity,27%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). Every turn of the c-ring driven by proton flux results in ATP generation in the matrix, making subunit c indispensable for cellular energy metabolism. Tissues with high oxidative metabolism (heart, brain, skeletal muscle, etc.) express high levels of ATP5MC1 (and its paralogs) because of the high demand for ATP. Transcript data confirm that **ATP5MC1 is ubiquitously expressed**, with especially high expression in energy-demanding tissues like heart (e.g. heart muscle RPKM ~134, among the highest) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/516#:~:text=mature%20protein,24%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). This reflects the universal requirement of subunit c for ATP production in virtually all human cells. 

Because the **ATP synthase is reversible**, subunit c also plays a role (in conditions of high ATP and low proton gradient) in pumping protons out of the matrix by ATP hydrolysis, which can occur in some physiological or pathological states. Thus, ATP5MC1 is central to maintaining the *ATP/ADP balance* and mitochondrial membrane potential. When oxygen is plentiful and cells carry out oxidative phosphorylation, subunit c helps drive ATP synthesis. If mitochondria experience an excess of ATP or certain stress conditions, the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> complex can reverse to prevent over-reduction of the electron transport chain, again relying on subunit c to move protons. In summary, ATP5MC1’s gene product is a core component of the **energy-conversion pathway**, linking the **electron transport chain** (which creates the proton gradient) to the **synthesis of ATP**, the energy currency of the cell ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)).

**Interplay with Other Pathways:** As a crucial part of ATP synthase, subunit c indirectly influences many ATP-dependent cellular processes. While its primary role is bioenergetic, there are links between ATP synthase activity and signaling pathways. For instance, the efficiency of ATP synthase (and proton leak through it) can affect reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the respiratory chain, thereby influencing redox signaling and apoptosis. Additionally, regulation of ATP synthase (e.g. by IF<sub>1</sub>, the endogenous inhibitor protein that binds F<sub>1</sub>) can modulate whether mitochondria favor ATP production or thermogenesis (heat generation via proton leak). Subunit c itself is not known to have direct signaling activity, but **its dysfunction can trigger cellular stress responses** due to energy deficiency. In fact, complete loss-of-function of ATP5MC1 would be lethal at the cellular level, but even partial inhibition (e.g. by oligomycin) causes a rapid drop in ATP and activation of AMPK signaling (energy stress sensor). Thus, while ATP5MC1 is not a “signaling molecule” per se, it sits at a nexus of metabolic control that can secondarily affect signaling pathways such as AMPK, mTOR (through cellular energy status), and apoptosis pathways.

# Recent Research and Emerging Insights 
Despite ATP synthase being a well-established machine, **recent studies (2020–2024)** have provided new insights into subunit c’s roles and potential as a therapeutic target. One breakthrough has been in understanding the mitochondrial **permeability transition pore (mPTP)** – a high-conductance inner membrane channel involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury and cell death. Long a mystery, evidence now strongly suggests that the **c-subunit ring itself can form the core of the mPTP when the ATP synthase complex degenerates or is deregulated** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=cavity,56%5D.%20The)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=of%20c,subunit%20is)). In 2022, Mnatsakanyan *et al.* demonstrated that purified human ATP synthase c-rings can autonomously form large, non-selective channels in lipid bilayers, consistent with mPTP properties ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)). Their experiments showed that the isolated c-ring is a **multi-conductance, voltage-gated ion channel** that remains closed when the F<sub>1</sub> sector is attached, but opens upon F<sub>1</sub> dissociation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)). In cellular models, loss of the F<sub>1</sub> headpiece (or its decoupling) led to unregulated proton/ion flow through the c-ring (“ATP synthase leak channel”), collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)). Knockdown of subunit c was found to prevent mitochondrial swelling and cell death under calcium overload, confirming that **the c-ring is required for the mPTP and its pore-forming, cell-death triggering activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=multi,These)). These findings (Cell Death & Diff. 2022) suggest that normally the F<sub>1</sub> sector acts as a **“gatekeeper”** on the c-ring channel, and that pathological calcium stress can cause F<sub>1</sub> to detach, unleashing the c-ring as an open pore ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)). This is a paradigm shift in understanding the mPTP: rather than a separate dedicated protein pore, the **ATP synthase’s own membrane domain (subunit c-ring) may double as a latent death channel** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=cavity,56%5D.%20The)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=of%20c,subunit%20is)). It connects ATP5MC1’s product to apoptosis/necrosis pathways – an example of how a bioenergetic protein also influences cell-fate decisions. 

Following this line of discovery, very recent research has explored targeting the c-subunit to modulate cell death and inflammation. In 2023, Zhan *et al.* reported that inhibiting the ATP synthase c-subunit can **ameliorate inflammatory injury** in airway epithelial cells by preventing mPTP opening and subsequent mitochondrial DNA release ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=ameliorated%20airway%20inflammation%20in%20HDM%2FLPS,induced%20cells%20or%20mouse%20models)). They used a small-molecule inhibitor (a triazaspiro compound, PP10) specific to subunit c in a model of severe asthma and observed reduced inflammation markers when the c-ring was inhibited ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=ameliorated%20airway%20inflammation%20in%20HDM%2FLPS,induced%20cells%20or%20mouse%20models)) ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=1%2C3%2C8,elevated%20in%20asthmatic%20patients%2C%20HDM%2FLPS)). Mechanistically, **excessive opening of the mPTP led to mitochondrial DNA leaking into the cytosol**, which triggers the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway and drives inflammation ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=ameliorated%20airway%20inflammation%20in%20HDM%2FLPS,induced%20cells%20or%20mouse%20models)). By blocking subunit c (and thus the mPTP channel), the treatment prevented mtDNA release and blunted the downstream inflammatory cascade ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=ameliorated%20airway%20inflammation%20in%20HDM%2FLPS,induced%20cells%20or%20mouse%20models)). This study highlights a **novel therapeutic angle**: modulation of ATP5MC1’s activity to control inflammatory and cell death pathways in disease. It also reinforces the idea that subunit c is a pivotal point where metabolism and cell signaling intersect – too much proton leak or dysregulation can initiate immune and death signals. 

On the structural front, recent high-resolution cryo-EM analyses (2018–2021) of mammalian ATP synthase have fleshed out the details of subunit c’s arrangement and interactions. Walker and colleagues solved structures of dimeric bovine ATP synthase at near-atomic resolution, confirming the **c<sub>8</sub>-ring stoichiometry** and visualizing how subunit **c’s glutamate interacts with subunit a’s arginine in the proton channel** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)). These structures also revealed associated lipids and suggested how the c-ring might be stabilized or modulated by lipid molecules and by subunit e’s C-terminus in the dimeric state ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=interact%20with%20a%20ring%20of,cavity%20to%20tether%20the%20C)). The improved maps showed an *hourglass-shaped solvent channel* through the center of the c-ring, sometimes occupied by lipids, but also potentially by ions if the complex opens ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=The%20central%20cavity%20of%20the,including%20possibly%20coenzyme)). Such findings contribute to our current understanding that the c-ring is not just a rigid rotor, but a dynamic structure that might undergo conformational changes under stress (e.g. twisting or “wobbling” in the membrane) that could relate to the opening of the mPTP channel. Additionally, biochemical studies in 2022 (Mitome *et al.*, eLife) used engineered c-rings with mutations to demonstrate **cooperative interactions between c-subunits during proton transport**, showing that altering one proton-binding glutamate affects the entire ring’s performance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=In%20F_%7Bo%7DF_%7B1%7D,single%20cE56D%20mutation%20and%20further)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)). These precise mutational analyses underscore that the ring of ~8 identical subunits operates in a highly coordinated way – effectively functioning as a **unified rotary motor** rather than independent subunits acting alone. 

# Conclusion and Expert Perspectives 
In summary, ATP5MC1 encodes the **mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c**, a small proteolipid that is central to the fundamental process of ATP production in human cells. **Key concepts** defining this protein include its role as a **proton carrier** within the F<sub>0</sub> rotor, its **rotational coupling mechanism** to ATP synthesis, and its localization in the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex V ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). The current understanding, bolstered by structural biology and biochemistry, is that each subunit c binds a proton at a conserved glutamate, rotates within the c-ring, and releases the proton to drive the **F<sub>1</sub> motor that makes ATP** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=neutralized%20%CE%B3,inlet%20and%20outlet%20channels%20are)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8809890/#:~:text=The%20region%20of%20the%20enzyme,together%20to%20drive%20the%20rotation)). All evidence indicates this mechanism is **highly conserved** from bacteria to humans, though the human enzyme has one of the smallest c-rings (8 subunits) for maximal efficiency ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7519299/#:~:text=stoichiometry%20of%20the%20c,dimeric%20bovine%20ATP%20synthase%20described)). The biological processes most closely tied to ATP5MC1 are **oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis**, making it indispensable for energy homeostasis. Its action is also essential for maintaining the proton gradient and thus impacts processes like heat production and ion homeostasis in mitochondria.

Importantly, **recent developments (2020–2024)** have expanded ATP5MC1’s relevance beyond bioenergetics. Cutting-edge research by experts like Jonas and Bernardi proposes that the c-ring of ATP synthase can become a pathophysiological **megachannel (mPTP)** under stress, implicating subunit c in the regulation of cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=cavity,56%5D.%20The)). This has been supported by experimental evidence and is changing longstanding views in mitochondrial biology. Expert reviews (Halestrap 2014; Mnatsakanyan & Jonas 2020) have debated and now increasingly support the idea that **“the c-subunit ring [acts] as a central player in mitochondrial permeability transition”**, essentially forming the pore that can flicker between low and high conductance states in response to calcium and cyclophilin D signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7877492/#:~:text=recent%20findings%20on%20the%20role,development%20and%20in%20degenerative%20diseases)). Such insights connect ATP5MC1 to conditions like stroke, myocardial infarction, neurodegeneration, and even immune activation, where mPTP and metabolic reprogramming play roles. 

From an **applications and translational** standpoint, ATP5MC1 (subunit c) is emerging as a potential drug target in specific contexts. While one would not generally inhibit ATP synthase systemically (due to its necessity for life), transient or targeted modulation of the c-ring’s proton leak could be beneficial. The example of an ATP synthase c-subunit inhibitor protecting against asthmatic inflammation by blocking the mtDNA-triggered immune pathway illustrates a novel therapeutic avenue ([respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-025-03299-2#:~:text=ameliorated%20airway%20inflammation%20in%20HDM%2FLPS,induced%20cells%20or%20mouse%20models)). Additionally, the c-ring is the binding site of the tuberculosis drug bedaquiline in bacterial ATP synthase, and though human ATP5MC1 is not directly targeted in current therapies, understanding its structure has aided antibiotic development by highlighting differences between bacterial and human enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11707528#:~:text=tuberculosis%20and%20its%20potential%20as,across%20species%2C%20structural%20differences%20arise)). This speaks to the importance of a detailed functional annotation: knowledge of ATP5MC1’s precise role and features allows researchers and clinicians to predict consequences of its dysfunction and to design interventions (for example, ischemia treatments aimed at stabilizing ATP synthase to prevent c-ring mediated cell death). 

In conclusion, ATP5MC1’s gene product is **a proton-translocating enzyme subunit and structural rotor element** vital for ATP production, localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane and operating within the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It carries out its primary function by forming an **eight-member c-ring that converts proton motive force into mechanical rotation**, thereby driving the synthesis of ATP ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29440398/#:~:text=mitochondrially%20encoded%20subunits%20ATP6%20and,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). Contemporary research has reinforced this core function with high-resolution detail and has also uncovered **broader impacts**, showing that when this subunit’s function goes awry (or is deliberately modulated), it can tip the balance between cell survival and death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=multi,These)). As such, ATP5MC1 stands as a prime example of how a well-known metabolic workhorse can have multi-faceted importance – from powering life’s processes to being a linchpin in cell fate under stress – as evidenced by a rich body of experimental studies and expert analyses up to 2024. All major findings about ATP5MC1 are supported by a convergence of biochemical, structural, and genetic evidence, making it one of the best-understood yet continually intriguing components of mitochondrial biology ([www.abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-az/targets/atp5mc1/11243?srsltid=AfmBOorEU4wNQ4RE21udvEmCtmNKUvvlFeVUztohbfZ5NtuQxNtpQl6v#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,Part%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433415/#:~:text=human%20c,These)).
