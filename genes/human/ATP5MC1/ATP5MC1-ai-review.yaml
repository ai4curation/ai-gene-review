description: 'ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C1 is a critical component of the
  mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V), forming the proton-conducting c-ring rotor
  that couples proton translocation to ATP synthesis. The protein is a small hydrophobic
  51-amino acid mature polypeptide that oligomerizes into a homooctamer (8 copies
  arranged in a circular ring structure), with each subunit adopting a hairpin conformation
  of two transmembrane α-helices. The c-ring functions as the central rotor of the
  F₀ domain, rotating in response to proton flow through half-channels formed at the
  interface with the a-subunit (MT-ATP6). A conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu-59)
  serves as the proton-binding site whose protonation/deprotonation drives directional
  rotation. This mechanical rotation of the c-ring and attached central stalk drives
  conformational changes in the F₁ catalytic domain, powering ATP synthesis from ADP
  and inorganic phosphate. ATP5MC1 is one of three paralogous genes (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2,
  ATP5MC3) that encode identical mature proteins distinguished only by different mitochondrial
  targeting sequences. Beyond its catalytic role, ATP5MC1 participates in ATP synthase
  oligomerization that shapes mitochondrial cristae architecture, and under stress
  conditions can form the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a calcium-regulated
  ion channel involved in apoptosis.
