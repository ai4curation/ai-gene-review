## Question

Research the ATP5MC1 (P05496) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

**ATP5MC1** (UniProt: P05496) encodes a membrane subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V), which is essential for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in human cells[1][3][4][7][15]. The protein is localized to the **inner mitochondrial membrane** as part of the Fo proton channel[1][3][5][7][15].

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  ATP5MC1 is a component of the **Fo subcomplex** of mitochondrial ATP synthase, forming part of the **proton channel** that translocates protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, coupling this movement to ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate[1][3][4][7][15].  
  - **GO Molecular Function:** ATP binding, proton transmembrane transporter activity[1][7][15].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  - **ATP synthesis coupled proton transport** (core process of oxidative phosphorylation)[1][3][4][7][15].
  - **Regulation of energy homeostasis** and **cellular response to glucose starvation**[2].
  - Involvement in broader processes such as **blood vessel development**, **immune response**, and **inflammation** (based on related ATP synthase subunits and ceRNA analyses)[2].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  - **Inner mitochondrial membrane** as part of the Fo complex[1][3][5][7][15].
  - Forms a **homomeric c-ring** (likely 10 subunits) that rotates during proton translocation[1][7][15].

---

### 2. Protein Domains

- **Subunit c (Fo complex):**  
  - The mature protein is a small, highly hydrophobic polypeptide (~75 amino acids) that forms a hairpin structure with two transmembrane helices[7][15].
  - The c subunit is essential for the rotary mechanism of ATP synthase, forming the c-ring that binds and translocates protons[1][7][15].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Complex Assembly:**  
  - ATP5MC1 interacts with other Fo subunits (a, b, d, e, f, g, F6, and 8) and is tightly associated with the F1 catalytic core via the central stalk[1][3][7][15].
  - The c-ring interacts with the a subunit to facilitate proton translocation and rotary catalysis[1][7][15].

- **Paralogs:**  
  - ATP5MC1 is one of three human genes (with ATP5MC2 and ATP5MC3) encoding identical mature c subunits but with distinct mitochondrial import sequences[1][3][7].

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Mitochondrial Disease:**  
  - Pathogenic variants in ATP synthase subunits, including ATP5MC1, are associated with **mitochondrial diseases** characterized by defects in energy metabolism[1][10].
  - **Cardiomyopathy, Familial Hypertrophic, 16:** ATP5MC1 is linked to this form of inherited heart disease[1].
  - Broader associations (from related subunits and ceRNA analyses) include **metabolic syndrome**, **type 2 diabetes**, **neurological disorders**, and **cardiovascular diseases**[2][10].

---

### 5. Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)

- **Pathogenic Variants:**  
  - Recent reviews highlight the role of ATP synthase gene mutations (including ATP5MC1) in mitochondrial disorders, with clinical presentations ranging from neuromuscular symptoms to cardiomyopathies[10].
- **Systems Biology and Disease Networks:**  
  - ceRNA and interRNA analyses implicate ATP5MC1 and related subunits in **immune regulation**, **inflammation**, and **infection susceptibility** (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, viral myocarditis)[2].
- **Metabolic and Cardiovascular Research:**  
  - ATP5MC1 is increasingly studied in the context of **metabolic syndrome** and **cardiovascular disease**, with evidence for its involvement in energy regulation and cellular stress responses[2][10].

---

### 6. Expert Opinions and Authoritative Sources

- **GeneCards, UniProt, and NCBI** consistently describe ATP5MC1 as a core component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase Fo complex, essential for cellular energy production[1][4][7][11][13].
- **Recent reviews** (2024) emphasize the clinical significance of ATP synthase gene variants, including ATP5MC1, in mitochondrial pathologies[10].

---

### 7. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Protein Structure:**  
  - The c-ring is typically composed of 8–10 c subunits in mammals, forming the rotary element of the Fo complex[1][7][15].
- **Disease Prevalence:**  
  - Mitochondrial diseases due to ATP synthase defects are rare but often severe, with variable penetrance and clinical heterogeneity[10].

**Summary:**  
ATP5MC1 encodes a critical subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase Fo complex, mediating proton translocation and ATP synthesis in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is essential for cellular energy metabolism, with disease associations including mitochondrial disorders and cardiomyopathies. Recent research highlights its broader roles in metabolism, immunity, and disease susceptibility[1][2][7][10][15].
