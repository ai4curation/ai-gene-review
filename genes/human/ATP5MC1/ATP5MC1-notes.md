# ATP5MC1 Gene Review Notes

## Gene Overview

**ATP5MC1** (ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 1) encodes subunit c of the mitochondrial F₀F₁-ATP synthase complex (Complex V). One of three paralogous genes (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3) that encode identical mature proteins with different mitochondrial targeting sequences [PMID:37244256].

**Key characteristics:**
- 136 amino acid precursor → 51 amino acid mature protein after mitochondrial targeting sequence removal
- Forms homooctamer (c-ring) - 8 subunits in circular arrangement
- Each subunit adopts hairpin structure (2 transmembrane α-helices)
- Critical glutamic acid at position 59 (mature protein) = proton-binding site

## Protein Structure and Function

### C-Ring Architecture (from deep research and PMID:37244256)

**Structure:**
- Homooctamer: 8 copies of subunit c form circular rotor
- Hairpin shape: N-terminal and C-terminal transmembrane helices
- Inner concentric ring (N-terminal helices) and outer ring (C-terminal helices)
- High-resolution cryo-EM structures available (2.53-3.47 Å)

**Critical residue:**
- Glu-59 (mature protein) = absolutely conserved proton-binding site
- When protonated: neutral, hydrophobic → inserts into membrane → drives rotation
- When deprotonated: charged → orients toward hydrophilic half-channels

### Rotary Mechanism

**Components:**
- **F₀ domain (membrane-embedded):** Proton channel
  - c-ring (rotor) - ATP5MC1 product
  - Subunit a (stator) - MT-ATP6
  - Subunits e, f, g, k, j
- **F₁ domain (soluble):** Catalytic core
  - α₃β₃ hexamer (catalytic sites in β subunits)
  - Central stalk: γ, δ, ε subunits (rotate with c-ring)
  - Peripheral stalk: b, d, F6, OSCP (stationary)

**Mechanism:**
1. Protons enter via inlet half-channel (intermembrane space → membrane)
2. Proton binds Glu-59 on c-subunit
3. Protonated Glu-59 becomes hydrophobic → c-ring rotates
4. Proton exits via outlet half-channel (membrane → matrix)
5. Each full rotation = 8 protons translocated (8 c-subunits)
6. Rotation drives conformational changes in F₁ β subunits
7. 3 ATP synthesized per 360° rotation
8. **Stoichiometry:** ~2.7 protons per ATP (8 protons ÷ 3 ATP)

### Binding-Change Mechanism (Boyer)

Each β subunit cycles through 3 states as γ subunit rotates:
- **LOOSE (L):** Binds ADP + Pi with low affinity
- **TIGHT (T):** High affinity, catalyzes ATP formation
- **OPEN (O):** Low ATP affinity, product release

## Post-Translational Modifications

### Trimethylation at Lys-104 [PMID:30530489]
- Modified by ATPSCKMT (FAM173B)
- **Function:** Required for proper incorporation into c-ring
- **Impact:** Essential for mitochondrial respiration
- Deletion of ATPSCKMT → impaired ATP synthase assembly

## Assembly and Biogenesis

### TMEM70 Interaction [PMID:31652072, PMID:33359711]

**TMEM70 functions:**
1. Facilitates c-ring oligomerization
2. Promotes c-ring membrane insertion
3. Protects ATP5MC1 from intramitochondrial proteolysis
4. Forms oligomeric scaffolds within cristae
5. Required for in situ assembly of proton channel

**Clinical relevance:**
- TMEM70 mutations → neonatal mitochondrial encephalomyopathy
- Impaired ATP synthase assembly → severe ATP synthesis defects

### Lipid Interactions

**Cardiolipin binding:** [from deep research]
- Cardiolipin = 20% of inner membrane phospholipids
- Specific "non-annular" binding to c-subunit
- Two cardiolipin molecules near F₀ half-channels
- Function: Regulates proton translocation, stabilizes structure

**Quinones in c-ring interior:**
- Coenzyme Q intercalates into ring center
- Stabilizes c-ring structure
- Prevents unproductive proton leakage

## Biological Processes and Pathways

### Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
- Terminal step of cellular energy production
- Couples proton gradient (from ETC Complexes I-IV) to ATP synthesis
- Glucose → ~30-32 ATP (vs 2 ATP from glycolysis alone)
- Proton-motive force: ~180-220 mV

### Role in Cristae Morphology [from deep research]
- ATP synthase forms dimers and higher-order oligomers
- Dimers localize to cristae tips and edges
- Dimerization requires subunits e and g
- Creates positive membrane curvature → tubular cristae structure
- Loss of dimerization → aberrant cristae morphology

### Regulation by IF1 [from deep research]
- IF1 (ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1) = endogenous inhibitor
- Inhibits reverse ATP hydrolysis under low energy conditions
- Promotes ATP synthase oligomerization
- Creates spatial heterogeneity: active vs inhibited pools

## Clinical and Pathological Relevance

### Mitochondrial Diseases
While direct ATP5MC1 mutations rare, ATP synthase dysfunction causes:
- NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa)
- MILS (maternally inherited Leigh syndrome)
- Cardiomyopathy
- Neurological disorders

**Most common:** MT-ATP6 mutations (e.g., m.8993T>G)
- Disrupts rotor-stator interface
- Impairs proton translocation
- >90% reduction in ATP synthesis

### Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (mPTP) [from deep research]
**Remarkable dual function:**
- Normal conditions: ATP synthesis
- Stress (high Ca²⁺): c-ring → high-conductance ion channel (~1.5 nS)

**Mechanism:**
1. F₁ domain partially dissociates from F₀
2. Exposes c-ring channel activity
3. Regulated by cyclophilin D
4. Large ions (K⁺, Cl⁻, Ca²⁺) flow through
5. Dissipates proton gradient
6. Mitochondrial swelling → outer membrane rupture
7. Cytochrome c release → apoptosis

**Clinical implications:**
- Neurological injury
- Myocardial infarction
- Diseases with excessive cell death

### Batten Disease (Ceroid Lipofuscinosis)
- ATP5MC1 = major protein in storage bodies
- Accumulation in lysosomes
- Neurodegeneration

## Tissue Distribution and Expression

**Ubiquitous expression** across all tissues (universal ATP requirement)

**Highest expression:**
- Heart (30% cardiomyocyte volume = mitochondria)
- Brain (20% of body's energy expenditure)
- Kidney
- Liver
- Skeletal muscle

**Differential paralog expression:**
- ATP5MC1: relatively uniform
- ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3: tissue-specific variation

## Evolutionary Conservation

**Ancient origin:**
- Present in Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) >4 billion years ago
- Conserved across bacteria, archaea, plants, animals
- Fundamental mechanism optimized for ~4 billion years

**Conservation of critical features:**
- Glutamic acid proton-binding site: 100% conserved
- Hairpin structure: universal
- Rotary mechanism: all F-type ATP synthases

**C-ring stoichiometry variation:**
- Mammals: typically 8-10 subunits
- Bacteria: 10-12 subunits
- Chloroplasts: 14 subunits
- Determines H⁺/ATP ratio

## Annotation Review Strategy

### Accept/Modify priorities:
1. **ACCEPT** annotations well-supported by PMID:37244256 (recent structure with IDA):
   - Proton-transporting ATP synthase complex
   - Proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis
   - Proton channel activity
   - Proton transmembrane transport
   - Mitochondrial inner membrane

2. **MODIFY** generic terms:
   - "protein binding" → specific binding partners (TMEM70)
   - "lipid binding" → cardiolipin binding (more specific)

3. **KEEP_AS_NON_CORE** or accept based on evidence:
   - Broader terms like "mitochondrial membrane", "mitochondrion"
   - "monoatomic ion transport" (too general, though technically correct)

4. **Remove duplicates** - Same term with multiple evidence codes

### Avoid over-annotation:
- Generic "protein binding" should be made more specific where possible
- Focus on the direct function: proton channel, ATP synthesis coupling
