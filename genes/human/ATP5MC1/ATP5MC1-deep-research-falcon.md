## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P05496
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C1, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATP synthase lipid-binding protein; AltName: Full=ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:841}; AltName: Full=ATP synthase proteolipid P1; AltName: Full=ATP synthase proton-transporting mitochondrial F(0) complex subunit C1; AltName: Full=ATPase protein 9; AltName: Full=ATPase subunit c; AltName: Full=Proton-conducting channel, ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit c {ECO:0000305}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATP5MC1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:841}; Synonyms=ATP5G1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:841};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATPase C chain family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATP_synth_F0_csu. (IPR000454); ATP_synth_F0_csu_DDCD_BS. (IPR020537); ATP_synth_F0_csu_sf. (IPR038662); ATPase_proteolipid_c-like_dom. (IPR002379); F/V-ATP_Csub_sf. (IPR035921)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5MC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5MC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5MC1** (gene ID: ATP5MC1, UniProt: P05496) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Plan and verification
- Target identity verification: ATP5MC1 (synonym ATP5G1) encodes the mitochondrial ATP synthase Fo subunit c1; UniProt P05496; organism: Homo sapiens. It belongs to the ATPase C chain family and carries the conserved proteolipid c-subunit domains consistent with Fo rotor subunits. This matches the requested protein description and domains and is human-specific, so no symbol ambiguity is apparent (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein and complex: ATP5MC1 encodes the Fo c-subunit 1 of mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (Complex V), a multi-subunit rotary enzyme in the inner mitochondrial membrane that synthesizes ATP using the proton motive force. Human Complex V comprises 18 subunits; MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8 are mtDNA-encoded and the remainder, including ATP5MC1, are nuclear-encoded (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Localization and assembly: ATP5MC1 is an integral membrane proteolipid of the Fo sector that assembles into the rotor c-ring embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane; proton translocation occurs at the interface of the c-ring and subunit a (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Mammalian c-ring stoichiometry: In human/vertebrate ATP synthase, the c-ring contains eight copies of the c-subunit (c8 ring), a key architectural determinant of the H+/ATP coupling ratio (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Catalytic coupling: Protonation/deprotonation of a conserved acidic residue in each c-subunit (canonical Glu/Asp) drives rotation of the c-ring; rotation is mechanically coupled via the central stalk (γ, δ, ε) to conformational changes in F1 that synthesize ATP (luo2020bedaquilineinhibitsthe pages 8-9, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Structural-mechanistic updates: Recent reviews and structural syntheses emphasize a human c8 c-ring and the a–c interface as the proton conduction path; OSCP is the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein interacting with inhibitor-sensitive regions of Complex V (2024 review) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). Molecular dynamics and structural analyses modeling the acidic residue (e.g., cGlu) in the c-subunit clarify proton-binding states during inhibitor engagement and rotation (Luo 2020; provides mechanistic specifics used widely in recent analyses) (luo2020bedaquilineinhibitsthe pages 8-9).
- Disease spectrum synthesis: A 2024 systematic review catalogues variability of clinical phenotypes from isolated ATP synthase defects, spanning encephalo-cardiomyopathies and neurometabolic disease; it highlights that both mtDNA (e.g., MT-ATP6/8) and nuclear genes (including structural subunits and assembly factors such as TMEM70) are implicated (Aug 2024) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32).
- COVID-19–linked regulation: Human omics during SARS-CoV-2 infection show coordinated suppression of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS transcripts; the “ATP5MC1 module” of Complex V was reported down-regulated in human nasopharyngeal samples as viral load rose, with broader and persistent suppression of OXPHOS nuclear transcripts in heart, kidney, and liver autopsies. Some lung autopsy samples showed recovery/induction of structural Complex V genes (including ATP5MC1) post-clearance, indicating tissue- and stage-specific dynamics (Aug 2023) (guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 4-6, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 6-7, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical/biomarker assays for Complex V in human PBMCs: A 2025 protocol suite enables small-scale measurement of Complex V activity and assembly in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using as little as ~2×10^6 PBMCs (~2 ml blood). It combines spectrophotometric and in-gel activities, clear-native gel westerns for assembly, and ΔΨm cytochemistry with TMRM plus oligomycin challenge to infer forward (ATP synthase) versus reverse (ATPase) operation in intact cells (May 2025; methods are readily transferrable to clinical research) (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2). These assays directly probe Fo function targeted by ATP5MC1 and its inhibitor sensitivity.
- Inhibitor mapping and safety pharmacology: Bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline TB drug, inhibits yeast and human mitochondrial ATP synthase by binding the Fo/c-ring region with a site that overlaps canonical Fo inhibitor pockets framed by oligomycin. This informs off-target risk and medicinal chemistry strategies to improve selectivity (Aug 2020; used in ongoing 2023–2024 analyses) (luo2020bedaquilineinhibitsthe pages 8-9).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Assembly factors and c-ring incorporation: Authoritative methodological and clinical reviews emphasize TMEM70 as a central assembly factor whose pathogenic variants cause isolated ATP synthase deficiency; recent complex V method papers add TMEM242 among nuclear factors assisting rotor/c-ring biogenesis and incorporation of subunit c. Together they support a modular assembly model in which proper c-ring integration is rate-limiting and clinically relevant (2024–2025) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 24-26, chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2).
- Clinical variability and genotype–phenotype: The 2024 Physiol Res review concludes that ATP synthase defects present with broad neurologic and cardiometabolic spectra, and that both structural subunits and assembly components contribute; IF1 regulation and OSCP interactions modulate hydrolytic activity and apoptosis susceptibility, adding layers to disease mechanisms (Aug 2024) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32).
- Infection and metabolism interface: The 2023 Sci Transl Med study provides expert synthesis that viral suppression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes shifts metabolism toward glycolysis with organ-specific persistence; the inclusion of ATP5MC1 in regulated modules underscores Complex V as part of the antiviral metabolic program (Aug 2023) (guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 4-6, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Composition: Human Complex V contains 18 subunits; two are mtDNA-encoded (MT-ATP6, MT-ATP8), with ATP5MC1 among the nuclear-encoded Fo subunits (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2).
- Stoichiometry: Human/vertebrate c-ring stoichiometry is reported as c8 (eight copies of ATP5MC1/ATP5MC2/ATP5MC3-type c subunits per ring) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Assay throughput: PBMC Complex V assessments can be performed from ~2×10^6 cells (~2 ml blood), enabling minimally invasive patient studies (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2).
- COVID-19 transcriptional regulation: SARS-CoV-2 infection down-regulates clusters of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes, including an ATP5MC1 gene module in human nasopharyngeal samples; suppression in autopsy heart encompassed “virtually all OXPHOS mRNAs,” while lung showed recovery with viral clearance (Aug 2023; Sci Transl Med; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq1533) (guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 4-6, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 6-7, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 1-2).

Mechanistic details specific to ATP5MC1
- Substrate/transport: The c-subunit forms part of the proton-conducting rotor; each protomer provides a conserved protonatable acidic side chain (modeled as cGlu in mechanistic studies) that transiently binds a proton from the intermembrane space, enabling rotation relative to subunit a and release toward the matrix at the a–c interface (luo2020bedaquilineinhibitsthe pages 8-9, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). 
- Inhibitors: Oligomycin A inhibits Fo proton transfer; in cell-based ΔΨm assays, oligomycin typically hyperpolarizes mitochondria when Complex V is in ATP synthase mode and depolarizes when it is operating in reverse ATPase mode. Bedaquiline can occupy overlapping c-ring inhibitor pockets analogous to oligomycin-sensitive sites, explaining mitochondrial off-target effects (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2, luo2020bedaquilineinhibitsthe pages 8-9). 
- Assembly and quality control: TMEM70 and TMEM242 are implicated in the assembly of the rotor and incorporation of subunit c into mature Complex V; defects in these factors compromise c-ring biogenesis and Complex V stability (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 24-26).

Disease relevance
- Primary ATP synthase disorders: Variants across Complex V—including mtDNA MT-ATP6/8 and nuclear-encoded structural subunits/assembly factors (e.g., TMEM70)—produce severe pediatric encephalo‑cardiomyopathy and broader neurometabolic presentations. Reviews synthesize genotype–phenotype variability and highlight diagnostic value of targeted exome/genome sequencing and functional Complex V assays (Aug 2024) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32).
- Infection-induced bioenergetic remodeling: SARS-CoV-2 induces suppression of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes, including ATP5MC1-module genes in human nasopharyngeal tissue, with tissue-specific persistence or recovery in autopsy organs; these data link ATP synthase subunits to systemic infection responses (Aug 2023) (guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 4-6, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 6-7, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 1-2).

Conclusion
ATP5MC1 encodes a core proteolipid of the Fo motor that forms the human c8 rotor ring, provides the proton-binding site essential for rotary catalysis, and is a locus of inhibition by classical Fo inhibitors. Up-to-date structural, clinical, and systems-biology evidence converges on the centrality of Fo/c-ring biogenesis and regulation—via assembly factors like TMEM70/TMEM242 and context-dependent transcriptional programs (e.g., during SARS-CoV-2 infection)—in determining Complex V function in health and disease. Practical PBMC assays now permit minimally invasive assessment of Complex V activity and assembly in human samples, facilitating translational applications in ATP synthase–related disorders (chau2025smallscaleprotocolsto pages 1-2, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, guarnieri2023coremitochondrialgenes pages 4-6).
