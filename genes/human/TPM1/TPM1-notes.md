# TPM1 (Tropomyosin 1) Notes - ISOFORMS Project

## Key Isoform Biology

TPM1 has **10 named isoforms** with tissue-specific expression patterns.

### Tissue-Specific Isoforms

| Isoform | UniProt ID | Synonym | Tissue | Key Feature |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Isoform 1** | P09493-1 | TPM1alpha, Skeletal | Skeletal muscle | Adult striated muscle |
| **Isoform 2** | P09493-2 | Smooth muscle | Smooth muscle | Vascular, visceral |
| **Isoform 3** | P09493-3 | TM3, Fibroblast | Non-muscle cells | Cytoskeletal function |
| **Isoform 6** | P09493-6 | TPM1kappa | Cardiac | Cardiac-specific |

### Functional Distinctions

**Striated muscle isoforms (1, 6):**
- Regulate actin-myosin interaction in sarcomeres
- Essential for muscle contraction
- Mutations cause cardiomyopathy

**Smooth muscle isoform (2):**
- Different N-terminal sequence
- Expressed in blood vessels, uterus, GI tract
- Regulates smooth muscle contraction

**Non-muscle isoforms (3, etc.):**
- Cytoskeletal organization
- Cell motility
- Different actin binding properties

### Disease Associations

**Cardiomyopathy mutations:**
- CMH3: Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- CMD1Y: Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Mutations affect sarcomere function

UniProt tissue specificity:
> "Isoform 1 is expressed in adult and fetal skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues, with higher expression levels in the cardiac tissues. Isoform 10 is expressed in adult and fetal cardiac tissues, but not in skeletal muscle."

## Expected Annotation Issues

1. **"Muscle contraction"** - true for muscle isoforms, not cytoskeletal
2. **"Sarcomere organization"** - only striated muscle isoforms
3. **"Cytoskeleton organization"** - primarily non-muscle isoforms
4. **"Cardiac muscle function"** - isoforms 1, 6, 10 specifically

## GOA Annotation Count: 55
