description: 'TPM1 (Tropomyosin 1) is a coiled-coil actin-binding protein with 10
  tissue-specific isoforms. ISOFORM BIOLOGY: (1) Isoform 1 (TPM1alpha, P09493-1) is
  expressed in SKELETAL MUSCLE; (2) Isoform 2 is SMOOTH MUSCLE-specific; (3) Isoform
  3 (TM3) is the FIBROBLAST/cytoskeletal form; (4) Isoform 6 (TPM1kappa) is CARDIAC-specific.
  UniProt states "Isoform 1 is expressed in adult and fetal skeletal muscle and cardiac
  tissues. Isoform 10 is expressed in adult and fetal cardiac tissues, but not in
  skeletal muscle." Muscle isoforms regulate actin-myosin interaction in sarcomeres;
  cytoskeletal isoforms organize non-muscle actin. DISEASE: Mutations cause cardiomyopathy
  (CMH3, CMD1Y) affecting sarcomere function. Annotations for "muscle contraction"
  and "sarcomere" apply primarily to muscle isoforms, while "cytoskeleton organization"
  applies more to non-muscle isoforms.'

  review:
    summary: Core function of all TPM1 isoforms. Tropomyosin binds along the length
      of actin filaments in both muscle and non-muscle cells. UniProt states that
      TPM1 binds to actin filaments. This function is conserved across all isoforms
      - muscle isoforms bind thin filament actin while cytoskeletal isoforms bind
      stress fiber actin.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Actin filament binding is the fundamental molecular function of all tropomyosins.
      IBA annotation is appropriate as this function is phylogenetically conserved.
      Supported by functional studies showing TPM1 binds actin filaments in both muscle
      and non-muscle contexts [PMID:12686598].

- name: 1 (Skeletal muscle, TPM1alpha)
  id: P09493-1
  description: >-
    The canonical striated muscle isoform (284 AA). Also called TPM1alpha. Expressed in
    skeletal and cardiac muscle where it regulates actin-myosin interaction during muscle
    contraction. Mutations cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). GO annotations
    for "muscle contraction" and "sarcomere organization" refer primarily to this isoform.
- name: 2 (Smooth muscle)
  id: P09493-2
  sequence_note: VSP_006576, VSP_006578, VSP_006579
  description: >-
    The smooth muscle-specific isoform. Contains alternative exons that confer smooth muscle-
    specific properties. Regulates contraction in blood vessels, intestine, and other smooth
    muscle tissues. Distinct from striated muscle function of isoform 1.
- name: 3 (Fibroblast, TM3)
  id: P09493-3
  sequence_note: VSP_006577, VSP_006579
  description: >-
    A cytoskeletal/non-muscle isoform expressed in fibroblasts. Also called TM3. Functions
    in non-muscle actin cytoskeleton organization rather than muscle contraction. Regulates
    cell morphology, motility, and cytokinesis. GO annotations for "muscle contraction"
    do NOT apply to this isoform.
- name: '4'
  id: P09493-4
  sequence_note: VSP_006577
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform. May have cytoskeletal rather than muscle-specific functions.
- name: '5'
  id: P09493-5
  sequence_note: VSP_017498, VSP_017499
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform. Functional role not well established in the literature.
- name: 6 (10, TPM1kappa)
  id: P09493-6
  sequence_note: VSP_036064
  description: >-
    Also called TPM1kappa. A non-muscle/cytoskeletal isoform. Functions in actin cytoskeleton
    organization in non-muscle cells.
- name: '7'
  id: P09493-7
  sequence_note: VSP_036064, VSP_006579
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform with combined features. Functional role not well established.
- name: '8'
  id: P09493-8
  sequence_note: VSP_047297, VSP_047298, VSP_047299,
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform. Functional role not well established in the literature.
- name: '9'
  id: P09493-9
  sequence_note: VSP_006579
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform. Functional role not well established in the literature.
- name: '10'
  id: P09493-10
  sequence_note: VSP_047299, VSP_047300, VSP_047301
  description: >-
    A less characterized isoform. Functional role not well established in the literature.
