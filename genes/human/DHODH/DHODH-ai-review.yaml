description: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone), mitochondrial (DHODH) is a class 2 flavoenzyme that catalyzes the stereospecific
  oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate, the fourth step and rate-limiting mitochondrial step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.
  The enzyme is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where electrons flow from substrate to the FMN cofactor and
  then to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), generating ubiquinol that feeds the respiratory chain (complex III). This directly couples
  pyrimidine synthesis to mitochondrial electron transport. The enzyme comprises a catalytic C-terminal TIM barrel housing
  FMN and substrate-binding sites, and an N-terminal membrane-associated region with two helices that anchor the protein and
  create a lipophilic ubiquinone-binding tunnel. Biallelic DHODH variants cause Miller syndrome (postaxial acrofacial dysostosis,
  MIM:263750). DHODH is a validated drug target with approved inhibitors (leflunomide/teriflunomide for autoimmune diseases)
  and multiple oncology programs in clinical development.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for the generic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity. This is the correct enzyme activity for
      DHODH, though GO:0106430 (quinone-using) is more specific. Human DHODH is a class 2 enzyme that uses ubiquinone as electron
      acceptor (PMID:8925840, UniProt Q02127 EC 1.3.5.2). IBA annotations are phylogenetically informed and represent a good
      baseline.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct core molecular function. While GO:0106430 (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone) activity) is more specific,
      this generic term is also accurate as DHODH does catalyze oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. The IBA annotation
      is phylogenetically sound and consistent with the literature.

    label: dihydroorotase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: INCORRECT ANNOTATION. This is a different enzyme - dihydroorotase (E.C. 3.5.2.3) catalyzes the cyclization of
      N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate to L-dihydroorotate, which is step 3 of pyrimidine biosynthesis. This activity is part of the
      CAD complex (specifically the DHO domain of CAD) in humans. DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) catalyzes step 4, the
      oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is an erroneous annotation. Dihydroorotase (GO:0004151, EC 3.5.2.3) is a completely different enzyme that
      catalyzes the PREVIOUS step in pyrimidine biosynthesis (ring closure of carbamoyl aspartate). In humans, this activity
      is part of the trifunctional CAD enzyme in the cytosol. DHODH (GO:0004152, EC 1.3.5.2) catalyzes the NEXT step (oxidation
      of dihydroorotate). This annotation likely resulted from name similarity confusion in automated orthology transfer (GO_REF:0000107

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from Ensembl Compara orthology. DHODH produces orotate which is converted to UMP and then can
      be further phosphorylated to UDP. However, DHODH is not directly involved in UDP biosynthesis - it produces a precursor
      that is several enzymatic steps upstream.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: DHODH contributes to UDP biosynthesis indirectly by providing the orotate precursor. However, UDP biosynthesis
      requires several additional enzymatic steps after DHODH action (orotate -> OMP by UMPS -> UMP -> UDP by UMP-CMP kinase).
      This is a downstream consequence rather than a direct function.
