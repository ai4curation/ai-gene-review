## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q02127
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone), mitochondrial; Short=DHOdehase; EC=1.3.5.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:8925840}; AltName: Full=Dihydroorotate oxidase; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DHODH;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase family. Type 2
- **Key Domains:** Aldolase_TIM. (IPR013785); DHO_dehydrogenase. (IPR050074); Dihydroorotate_DH_2. (IPR005719); Dihydroorotate_DH_cat. (IPR005720); Dihydroorotate_DH_CS. (IPR001295)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DHODH" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DHODH' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DHODH** (gene ID: DHODH, UniProt: Q02127) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report on human DHODH (UniProt Q02127)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and classification: Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH; EC 1.3.5.2) is a class 2 DHODH, a monomeric, inner mitochondrial membrane-bound flavoenzyme. It catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of dihydroorotate (DHO) to orotate (ORO), the fourth step and rate-limiting mitochondrial step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Electrons flow from substrate to the FMN cofactor and then to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) within the membrane, generating ubiquinol that feeds the respiratory chain (complex III), thus directly coupling pyrimidine synthesis to mitochondrial electron transport (URLs/DOIs below) (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 13-16, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 13-16, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).
- Structure and domains: The enzyme comprises a catalytic C‑terminal α/β (TIM) barrel that houses the FMN and substrate-binding site, and an N‑terminal membrane-associated region containing two helices that anchor the protein and create a lipophilic ubiquinone-binding tunnel with multiple subsites for quinone and inhibitors. Ser215 acts as a catalytic base in the human enzyme; the catalytic cycle is ping‑pong, with orotate release preceding FMN reoxidation by ubiquinone (mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 13-16, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 13-16). Recent structure‑guided discovery underscores that the inhibitor pocket lies at the N‑/C‑terminal interface near the ubiquinone tunnel and TIM‑barrel junction (Jan 2024; DOI 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01358) (higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2).
- Cellular localization and orientation: Human DHODH is targeted to and embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane; its ubiquinone tunnel is membrane-facing, explaining respiratory chain coupling and drug-binding dependence on membrane lipids (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).
- Pathway context: DHODH links cytosolic steps (CAD complex) to mitochondrial electron transport by providing orotate for UMP synthesis; inhibition depletes UMP/UTP, impairs ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation, and arrests proliferating cells in S-phase (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Structural/mechanistic advances informing drug design
  • Fragment- and structure-based medicinal chemistry has revealed alternative binding poses in the ubiquinone site and strategies to minimize P‑gp efflux for potential brain exposure. DeRatt et al. (Feb 2024, ACS Med. Chem. Lett.; DOI 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.3c00543) reported fragment hits (SPR KD ~130 μM; enzyme IC50 ~82 μM), cocrystal structures (PDB 8VHM/8DHG), and a distinct hydrogen-bonding network to Tyr356/Arg136, with new scaffolds showing low P‑gp efflux (deratt2024discoveryofalternative pages 1-2).
  • Higgins et al. (Jan 2024, J. Chem. Inf. Model.; DOI 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01358) identified 20 unique chemotypes with biochemical IC50 values of 91 nM–2.7 μM; ten reduced MOLM‑13 viability (2.3–50.6 μM), reinforcing de novo pyrimidine dependence in AML and mapping the inhibitor pocket relative to the FMN/TIM‑barrel region (higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2).

- Oncology mechanistic and combination therapy findings
  • Lymphoma: In high-grade B‑cell lymphoma with concurrent MYC and BCL2 rearrangements, brequinar suppressed growth, induced cell-cycle arrest/apoptosis, downregulated MYC and MCL‑1, and synergized with venetoclax to inhibit xenograft growth, rationalizing DHODH+BCL2 co‑targeting (Jun 2024; BMC Cancer; DOI 10.1186/s12885-024-12534-w) (liu2024targetedinhibitionof pages 1-2).
  • Medulloblastoma: Brequinar reduced MYC levels and tumor growth in a zebrafish Group 3 medulloblastoma model, supporting DHODH as a vulnerability in MYC‑driven pediatric brain tumors (Dec 2024; Cancers; DOI 10.3390/cancers16244162) (mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143).
  • Immuno‑oncology: DHODH inhibition (brequinar) upregulated antigen presentation pathway genes and MHC class I on cancer cells in vitro, and combined with dual PD‑1/CTLA‑4 checkpoint blockade to significantly prolong survival in mouse melanoma, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism via P‑TEFb regulation of RNAP II elongation (preprint revised Apr 2024; eLife doi 10.7554/elife.87292.2) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29).
  • Translational/clinical landscape: Contemporary overviews aggregate multiple clinical programs including ASLAN003 (AML; differentiation), BAY 2402234 (Phase 1; glioma surgical window), PTC299 (hematologic/antiviral), and other first‑in‑human DHODH inhibitors; modeling work supports dose selection for emvododstat in AML (curated compendium through 2024 with NCT identifiers) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 25-29, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29).

- Real‑world immunomodulatory agents targeting DHODH
  • Teriflunomide (active metabolite of leflunomide) remains a clinically used DHODH inhibitor in multiple sclerosis and RA; modern reviews of DHODH’s membrane coupling and CoQ tunnel explain the pharmacologic basis and historical teratogenic mechanism relevant to development (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).

3) Current applications and implementations
- Approved/established
  • Leflunomide (RA) and teriflunomide (MS) act (in part) via DHODH inhibition; the enzyme’s mitochondrial CoQ coupling and membrane tunnel underpin their mechanism and inform safety considerations (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).

- Oncology (clinical and translational)
  • AML differentiation therapy: Reviews and trial registries compile that DHODH blockade induces myeloid differentiation across AML subtypes; programs include ASLAN003 and emvododstat, with dose-modeling and clinical investigations ongoing (references and NCTs consolidated in 2024–2025 compendia) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 25-29).
  • Solid tumors and hematologic malignancies: BAY 2402234 (Phase 1) and surgical window studies in glioma; preclinical efficacy in medulloblastoma and lymphoma as above; combinations with BCL‑2 family agents (e.g., venetoclax) and immune checkpoint inhibitors are supported by 2024 studies (mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, liu2024targetedinhibitionof pages 1-2, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143).

- Antiviral and host‑directed therapy
  • Contemporary reviews of DHODH clinical pipelines note antiviral-directed trials (e.g., PTC299; COVID‑19; NCT04439071) and host-targeting rationales, with DHODH positioned as a bottleneck for UTP/CTP synthesis (compiled with NCT links) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 141-143).

- Stem cell manufacturing and safety
  • Selective vulnerability of human iPSCs to DHODH inhibitors (e.g., brequinar) enables purification of mesenchymal stromal cell cultures by eliminating undifferentiated pluripotent contaminants; this provides a practical cell therapy manufacturing control point (study context summarized in 2023–2024 corpus) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Cancer & Metabolism review (2021) synthesizes DHODH’s dual role in pyrimidine synthesis and respiratory chain coupling, its membrane/ubiquinone tunnel pharmacology, and the resurgence of DHODH as an oncology target; these mechanistic insights remain foundational to current drug design and clinical strategies (May 2021; DOI 10.1186/s40170-021-00250-z) (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).
- 2024–2025 translational compendia integrate structural, PK/PD, and clinical trial landscapes across AML and solid tumors, including glioma, and summarize DHODH’s positioning in immuno‑oncology and antiviral pipelines, providing a consolidated expert view with NCT cross‑references (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 25-29, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Enzymology/structural pharmacology (2024):
  • 20 new inhibitors (biochemical IC50: 91 nM–2.7 μM); 10 with cellular activity in MOLM‑13 (2.3–50.6 μM); exemplar cellular IC50 2.3 μM (MOLM‑13) (Jan 2024; DOI 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01358) (higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2).
  • Fragment-based hit (KD ~130 μM; enzyme IC50 ~82 μM) with crystallographic evidence of a novel binding pose in the ubiquinone site and low P‑gp efflux profiles relative to prior leads (Feb 2024; DOI 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.3c00543) (deratt2024discoveryofalternative pages 1-2).
- Oncology models (2024):
  • Lymphoma (HGBCL double‑hit): Brequinar+venetoclax showed synergistic tumor growth inhibition in vivo; brequinar reduced MYC and MCL‑1 expression, counteracting venetoclax resistance mechanisms (Jun 2024; DOI 10.1186/s12885-024-12534-w) (liu2024targetedinhibitionof pages 1-2).
  • Medulloblastoma: Brequinar decreased MYC and inhibited tumor growth in zebrafish Group 3 medulloblastoma (Dec 2024; DOI 10.3390/cancers16244162) (mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143).
  • Immunotherapy synergy: DHODH inhibition increased antigen presentation gene expression and surface MHC I; brequinar combined with anti‑CTLA‑4 plus anti‑PD‑1 significantly prolonged survival in mouse melanoma (revised Apr 2024) (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29).
- Clinical/translational program snapshots with identifiers (as curated 2024–2025):
  • BAY 2402234: Phase 1 (NCT03404726); glioma surgical window (NCT05061251). Emvododstat dose modeling in AML (Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2024). ASLAN003 AML differentiation studies and trials (NCT01992367; NCT03451084). Antiviral PTC299 (e.g., NCT04439071 COVID‑19). Additional first‑in‑human: JNJ‑74856665 (NCT04609826), JBZ‑001 (NCT06801002), AUR108 (NCT05984147). These data points are compiled in the 2024–2025 landscape reviews with URLs/registry links (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 25-29, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29).

6) Human genetics and disease associations
- Miller syndrome (Geneé–Wiedemann; MIM 263750) is caused by biallelic DHODH variants. The original discovery by exome sequencing demonstrated DHODH as the causal gene and highlighted a new role for de novo pyrimidine metabolism in craniofacial/limb development (Nature Genetics, Nov 2010; DOI 10.1038/ng.499) (ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 1-2, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 2-3, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 5-6).
- Follow‑up human genetics defined a clinically and biochemically distinct subgroup of postaxial acrofacial dysostosis due to partial DHODH deficiency, documented compound heterozygous alleles across families, and estimated disease-permissive residual activity ranges (~24–36% of wild-type), with elevated urinary orotate as a biochemical correlate in some cases (Human Mol. Genet., Jun 2012; DOI 10.1093/hmg/dds218) (rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 2-3, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 9-10, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 10-11, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 7-8, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 1-2).

7) Notes on ferroptosis and mitochondrial bioenergetics
- DHODH’s respiratory-chain coupling via ubiquinone and membrane tunnel is well established and central to its physiology and pharmacology (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14). Contemporary oncology studies in 2024 also emphasize mitochondrial consequences of DHODH inhibition (e.g., antigen presentation increases linked to transcriptional elongation stress), but definitive, mitochondria-specific ferroptosis mechanisms for human DHODH should be interpreted in light of primary sources not included here; therefore, this report cites the established ETC coupling and downstream redox/nucleotide effects as the mechanistic basis for many phenotypes (mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).

8) Verification of gene/protein identity (mandated)
- Gene symbol and protein description match: “DHODH” encodes the human mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone), a class 2 enzyme using ubiquinone; literature above consistently describes the same molecule, domains, and localization (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 13-16, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 13-16, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).
- Organism verified: All cited mechanistic/structural/clinical sources explicitly refer to the human enzyme or human-targeted inhibitors (deratt2024discoveryofalternative pages 1-2, higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14).
- Protein family/domains: Class 2 DHODH family; TIM‑barrel catalytic domain and N‑terminal membrane helices forming the ubiquinone tunnel are consistently reported (mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 13-16, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 13-16, higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2).
- Ambiguity check: No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered for non-human orthologs in the curated sources; all disease-genetic evidence refers specifically to human DHODH (ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 1-2, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 2-3, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 2-3, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 9-10).

Conclusions and outlook
Human DHODH (Q02127) is a mitochondrially embedded, ubiquinone-dependent flavoenzyme that furnishes orotate for de novo pyrimidine synthesis and is mechanistically coupled to the respiratory chain. Its membrane-associated ubiquinone tunnel and TIM‑barrel catalytic core define druggable physicochemical constraints that have been leveraged to generate 2024-era chemotypes with nanomolar biochemical potency and cellular activity. Across oncology, DHODH inhibition can induce differentiation (AML), suppress MYC-driven programs (medulloblastoma), reprogram transcription to enhance antigen presentation, and synergize with BCL2 blockade and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical programs continue to mature (e.g., BAY 2402234, ASLAN003, emvododstat), while established immunomodulators (leflunomide/teriflunomide) exemplify long-standing clinical use. Human genetics robustly links biallelic DHODH variants to Miller syndrome, underscoring the developmental requirement for de novo pyrimidines. Together, these data support DHODH as a validated, mitochondria-coupled metabolic target with expanding therapeutic scope in cancer, neurology, immunology, and host-directed antiviral strategies (zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 1-2, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 2-4, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 13-16, mannella2025…technologytransfer pages 13-16, zhou2021dhodhandcancer pages 11-14, deratt2024discoveryofalternative pages 1-2, mannella2025…technologytransfera pages 141-143, liu2024targetedinhibitionof pages 1-2, mannella2025greentechnologytransfer pages 25-29, higgins2024discoveryofnanomolar pages 1-2, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 2-3, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 1-2, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 2-3, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 7-8, ng2010exomesequencingidentifies pages 5-6, rainger2012miller(geneewiedemann)syndrome pages 1-2).
