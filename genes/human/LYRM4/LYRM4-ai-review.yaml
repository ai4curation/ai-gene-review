description: LYRM4 (also known as ISD11) is a small LYR motif-containing protein that
  serves as an essential non-catalytic stabilizing subunit of the cysteine desulfurase
  NFS1 in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. LYRM4 forms
  a heterodimer with mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (NDUFAB1/ACP) and together
  they stabilize NFS1 and regulate its cysteine desulfurase activity. The core ISC
  assembly complex consists of NFS1-LYRM4-NDUFAB1-ISCU, with frataxin (FXN) serving
  as an allosteric activator and FDX2/FDXR providing reducing equivalents. LYRM4 contains
  conserved alpha-helices that form a hydrophobic tunnel accommodating the acyl chain
  of phosphopantetheinylated NDUFAB1, linking mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis to
  Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Mutations in LYRM4 cause combined oxidative phosphorylation
  deficiency 19 (COXPD19), characterized by respiratory distress, hypotonia, and lactic
  acidosis. While primarily mitochondrial, NFS1 and LYRM4 have also been detected
  in the nucleus and cytosol where NFS1 participates in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis.

  review:
    summary: LYRM4/ISD11 is a mitochondrial protein that functions as part of the
      core ISC assembly complex in the mitochondrial matrix. Multiple studies confirm
      mitochondrial localization via immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation

    summary: LYRM4 is essential for iron-sulfur cluster assembly as a stabilizing
      factor for NFS1 cysteine desulfurase. ISD11 depletion leads to decline of the
