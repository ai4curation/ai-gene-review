### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "LYRM4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'LYRM4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **LYRM4** (gene ID: LYRM4, UniProt: Q9HD34) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human LYRM4 (ISD11; UniProt Q9HD34)

Identity verification and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and aliases: LYRM4 encodes a small LYR motif-containing protein also known as ISD11 in humans. It is a member of the mitochondrial LYRM superfamily and functions in the iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster (ISC) assembly machinery. Recent authoritative sources explicitly describe LYRM4 as ISD11 and place it in the mammalian ISC core complex (NFS1–LYRM4–ACP–ISCU) (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2). 
- Organism: Homo sapiens, mitochondrial protein (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: LYRM4 is part of the LYR motif-containing protein family that features an N‑terminal LYR motif and a conserved central triplet of α-helices; LYRM4 (Isd11) is among the most conserved family members and belongs to the Complex1_LYR domain-containing group (inferred by family-wide structural descriptions) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 20-24, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 128-129, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 130-131).

Key concepts and current mechanistic understanding
- Primary role in ISC biogenesis: LYRM4/ISD11 is a non-catalytic, essential accessory subunit of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1. In the de novo ISC pathway, a [2Fe–2S] cluster is assembled on the ISCU scaffold by a multiprotein complex comprising NFS1/LYRM4/ACP (NDUFAB1) with frataxin (FXN) and the ferredoxin/reductase pair (FDX2/FDXR) supplying electrons; HSC20/HSPA9 chaperones then mediate transfer to client carriers such as GLRX5/BOLA3 or to [4Fe–4S] assembly factors (ISCA1/ISCA2/NFU1) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2). Functionally, LYRM4 stabilizes and enables NFS1 catalytic activity and efficient 2Fe–2S synthesis on ISCU (solaveraUnknownyearfunctionalcharacterizationof pages 38-40, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2).
- Complex composition and interactions: The early ISC complex in mammals is best represented as NFS1–LYRM4–mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (mtACP; NDUFAB1)–ISCU, with frataxin as an allosteric effector and electron input via FDX2/FDXR. This composition and the stepwise flow to GLRX5/BOLA3 and NFU1 nodes are supported by recent experimental studies (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: The mammalian ISC machinery, including NFS1 and LYRM4, operates in the mitochondrial matrix. Parallel ISC components can be detected in the cytosol/nucleus for downstream CIA-dependent maturation, but LYRM4/ISD11’s core role is mitochondrial (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2). Older isolated reports of extra-mitochondrial LYRM localization have not been substantiated by recent evidence (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 20-24).

Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Pathway integration and updated ISC wiring: A 2023 study on mitoribosome Fe–S cluster assembly provided an updated, experimentally grounded map of mitochondrial Fe–S biogenesis and delivery, explicitly describing the de novo ISC complex as NFS1/LYRM4/ACP working with ISCU and frataxin, and quantifying dependencies of mitoribosome subunits on specific delivery nodes (GLRX5–BOLA3 and ISCA1–NFU1) (Nucleic Acids Research, Oct 12, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3).
- Human genetics of Fe–S pathways: A 2024 JCI study defined biallelic loss of CIAO1 as a new human disease and, in its mechanistic framework, summarized the mammalian ISC core complex—NFS1 with binding partner LYRM4 (ISD11), mtACP/NDUFAB1, ISCU, and FXN—underscoring the canonical role of LYRM4 in mitochondrial ISC (J Clin Invest, Jun 17, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI179559) (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 2-4). Although this work focuses on the cytosolic CIA pathway, it affirms current consensus regarding LYRM4’s place in mitochondrial ISC.
- Structural insights: Family-wide structural analyses and literature synthesis (2025 review) consolidate that LYRM4 contains a conserved α-helical core forming a hydrophobic tunnel that accommodates the acyl chain of mtACP. This structural arrangement explains the frequently observed heterodimerization of LYRMs with acylated ACP and supports allosteric regulation of LYRM clients by mtACP’s acylation state. The review also collates prior subcomplex structures, including an ACP–ISD11 heterodimer and a human cysteine desulfurase subcomplex with defined acyl‑ACP–ISD11 contacts; comprehensive 2023–2024 cryo‑EM of the full NFS1–LYRM4–ACP–ISCU holocomplex remains represented by subcomplex data and predictive models (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 132-133, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 127-128, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 128-129). In parallel, 2023 mitoribosome cryo‑EM work pinpointed Fe–S sites in mitochondrial ribosomes, reinforcing the biological reach of ISC outputs (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic frameworks: Modern diagnostic evaluation of suspected mitochondrial disorders increasingly incorporates the ISC pathway map placing LYRM4/ISD11 in the core de novo synthesis complex. Silencing experiments in human cells link depletion of ISC factors to impaired mitoribosome stability and mitochondrial protein synthesis, which can inform interpretation of patient fibroblast phenotypes and guide targeted testing of ISC/CIA genes (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2). The JCI 2024 work demonstrates how defining upstream ISC components (including LYRM4 in the NFS1–ISCU complex) helps interpret disorders of downstream CIA maturation and muscle-biopsy phenotypes, suggesting utility for integrated gene panels spanning ISC and CIA modules (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 2-4).
- Pathway-level therapeutic considerations: Although LYRM4 itself has no direct therapy, pathway knowledge connects mtACP acylation and mtFAS status to ISC function. This suggests that perturbations in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) or mtACP phosphopantetheinylation could secondarily impair NFS1–LYRM4 function and Fe–S assembly, informing research strategies in metabolic or neurodegenerative conditions where mtFAS or phosphopantetheinylation is disrupted (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 132-133, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 20-24, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 128-129).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- The 2023 NAR study provides an experimental, system-level perspective that integrates de novo ISC assembly (NFS1/LYRM4/ACP/ISCU/FXN) with delivery nodes (GLRX5–BOLA3; ISCA1–NFU1) and outputs to mitoribosome function, effectively establishing a contemporary reference wiring for mammalian ISC that places LYRM4 centrally as NFS1’s binding partner (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3).
- The 2024 JCI investigation frames LYRM4 within a consensus model for mammalian ISC and emphasizes the coexistence of ISC components in the mitochondrial matrix and in cytosol/nucleus (for CIA-dependent maturation), reinforcing the need to interpret phenotypes in light of compartmentalized Fe–S biogenesis (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2).
- A 2025 synthesis of LYRM family biology argues that LYRM4 is the most conserved LYRM and likely ancestral, with a key regulatory axis through acylated mtACP that couples mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism to ISC activity, respiratory chain complex assembly, and mitoribosome function (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 20-24, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 130-131). While mechanistic details remain under active study, the LYR motif and a conserved downstream phenylalanine (LYR‑F) emerge as critical for ACP engagement and functional output (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 127-128, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 128-129).

Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- Mitoribosome dependency on ISC nodes: In human cell models, silencing of ISC biosynthesis/delivery factors reduced mitoribosome stability and mitochondrial translation; the study mapped that mitoribosomal [2Fe–2S] clusters are supplied via the GLRX5–BOLA3 node and [4Fe–4S] into METTL17 via ISCA1–NFU1 (NAR 2023; specific quantitative readouts include sucrose-gradient fractionation and pulse labeling assays in HEK293T cells and patient fibroblasts) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 3-4, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3).
- CIAO1 disease cohort (for broader Fe–S context): Four unrelated patients carried biallelic CIAO1 variants presenting with proximal/axial weakness, elevated CK, respiratory insufficiency, and deep-brain iron deposition; lentiviral restoration of CIAO1 rescued cellular defects in patient-derived cells, demonstrating causality (JCI 2024; published June 17, 2024) (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 2-4). While not a LYRM4 variant cohort, the study situates LYRM4 in the canonical upstream ISC complex that supports CIA-dependent Fe–S enzyme maturation (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2).

Regulatory features and cross-pathway coupling
- LYR motif and ACP acylation: The LYR motif and adjacent conserved residues mediate binding of acidic mtACP, whose acyl chain inserts into a hydrophobic tunnel in LYRM4’s helical core. The acylation state of mtACP (NDUFAB1) likely acts as an allosteric regulator of LYRM4–NFS1 function, coupling mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis to Fe–S assembly and respiratory/mitoribosomal biogenesis (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 127-128, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 128-129, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 20-24, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 130-131). 
- Interaction dependencies: Experimentally validated and model-supported contacts between LYRM4, NFS1, and mtACP align with prior subcomplex structures (ACP–ISD11 and cysteine desulfurase assemblies), indicating that LYRM4 helps organize the early ISC complex and stabilize NFS1 for cysteine desulfurase activity (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 127-128, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 132-133).

Human disease associations
- Direct LYRM4 genetic disease evidence remains sparse in 2023–2024 primary reports retrieved here; however, curated resources and prior literature associate LYRM4 with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency phenotypes (e.g., COXPD19), and multiple recent studies frame LYRM4 mechanistically upstream of established Fe–S disease genes (e.g., NFU1, BOLA3, GLRX5) (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2). Given its essential role in ISC assembly with NFS1, LYRM4 dysfunction is expected to cause global defects in mitochondrial and CIA-dependent Fe–S client maturation, predicting combined OXPHOS deficiency and multisystem phenotypes similar to other ISC defects (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2). 

Pathway placement and cellular localization summary
- LYRM4 operates in the mitochondrial matrix as the NFS1 binding partner in the de novo ISC complex, with ISCU as scaffold, mtACP/NDUFAB1 as an obligate partner, and FXN/FDX2/FDXR providing allosteric activation and electrons. Output flows through HSC20/HSPA9 to GLRX5/BOLA3 and ISCA1/ISCA2/NFU1 for distribution to 2Fe–2S and 4Fe–4S clients in mitochondria and further to CIA for nucleocytoplasmic enzymes (zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 2-3, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2).

Notes and limitations
- Direct 2023–2024 primary reports of LYRM4 patient variants were not identified in the retrieved corpus; disease links for LYRM4 therefore rely on mechanistic placement, prior literature, and curated associations, whereas 2023–2024 patient-level statistics derive from related ISC/CIA genes (maio2024ciao1lossof pages 1-2). Future incorporation of newly published LYRM4 variant reports would refine genotype–phenotype correlations.
