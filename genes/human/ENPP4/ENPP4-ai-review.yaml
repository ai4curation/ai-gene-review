description: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 4 (ENPP4) is an ecto-enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of diadenosine polyphosphates, particularly Ap3A (diadenosine triphosphate) and Ap4A (diadenosine tetraphosphate). ENPP4 cleaves Ap3A to AMP and ADP, and Ap4A to AMP and ATP. The enzyme functions as a procoagulant on vascular endothelium by promoting platelet aggregation through ADP release from platelet-derived Ap3A. As a type I transmembrane protein, ENPP4 localizes to the plasma membrane with its catalytic domain exposed extracellularly. The enzyme contains a dizinc catalytic center essential for activity. ENPP4 also plays developmental roles in pronephric (embryonic kidney) formation through lipidic signaling involving S1PR5. Unlike ENPP1, ENPP4 has negligible ATP hydrolysis activity due to the absence of a "lysine claw" motif that stabilizes ATP binding.
