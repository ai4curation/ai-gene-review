description: >-
  14-3-3 protein zeta/delta (YWHAZ) is an adapter protein that functions as a dimeric
  scaffold recognizing phosphoserine/phosphothreonine motifs in client proteins. The
  core molecular function is phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-dependent protein binding
  within a conserved amphipathic groove formed by helices C/E/G/I. YWHAZ forms homodimers
  and heterodimers (notably with YWHAE) and primarily localizes to the cytosol, though
  it can shuttle to the nucleus with certain clients. Key functional roles include:
  (1) cytoplasmic sequestration of transcription factors (FOXO family, YAP/TAZ, TFEB);
  (2) regulation of RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling by scaffolding RAF kinases; (3) modulation
  of PI3K-AKT pathway through BAD sequestration and regulation of mTORC1 via raptor binding;
  (4) regulation of cell cycle checkpoints via CDC25 phosphatase binding; (5) protein
  stabilization through chaperone-like activity. The protein binds hundreds of client
  proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner via canonical Mode I (RSXpSXP), Mode II
  (RXY/FXpSXP), and Mode III (C-terminal pS/pT) motifs.

      summary: >-
        YWHAZ is predominantly cytosolic as confirmed by multiple studies and consistent
        with its role as a cytoplasmic scaffold protein that sequesters phosphorylated
        client proteins. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically conserved across the
        14-3-3 family. Deep research (YWHAZ-deep-research-falcon.md) confirms cytoplasmic
        localization as the primary subcellular location.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        Cytoplasmic localization is a core feature of 14-3-3 proteins. The deep research
        states "14-3-3ζ is predominantly cytosolic but shuttles with clients, often
        retaining transcription factors or signaling enzymes in the cytoplasm".

    review:
      summary: >-
        A core function of 14-3-3 proteins is regulating the intracellular localization
        of client proteins, particularly retaining phosphorylated transcription factors
        (FOXO, YAP/TAZ, TFEB) and signaling molecules (BAD, RAF1) in the cytoplasm.
        Deep research (YWHAZ-deep-research-falcon.md) extensively documents this role.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a conserved core function. The deep research confirms "14-3-3ζ sequesters
        phosphorylated BAD (e.g., pSer112/136) to block mitochondrial translocation" and
        "binds FOXO transcription factors to regulate nuclear access". Also documents

        YWHAZ was identified in melanosomes in the proteomic study PMID:17081065. While
        this represents a valid observation, melanosome localization is likely not a
        core function but rather reflects the protein's widespread cytoplasmic distribution
        and potential client interactions in pigment cells.

        The melanosome localization was experimentally observed in proteomic studies
        but does not represent a core localization. YWHAZ is a broadly expressed
        cytoplasmic protein that may be found in various organelles based on client
        interactions.

      YWHAZ forms homodimers as obligate functional units. The dimeric W-shaped
      architecture presents two peptide-binding grooves that can simultaneously
      engage two phosphomotifs, either on the same client or bridging two clients.
      Homodimerization is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-58.
