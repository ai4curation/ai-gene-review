## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P63104
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=14-3-3 protein zeta/delta; AltName: Full=Protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1; Short=KCIP-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=YWHAZ;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the 14-3-3 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 14-3-3. (IPR000308); 14-3-3_CS. (IPR023409); 14-3-3_dom_sf. (IPR036815); 14-3-3_domain. (IPR023410); 14-3-3 (PF00244)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "YWHAZ" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'YWHAZ' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **YWHAZ** (gene ID: YWHAZ, UniProt: P63104) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human YWHAZ (14-3-3 protein zeta/delta; UniProt P63104)

Gene/protein identity verification and family/domain alignment
- Identity: YWHAZ encodes the human 14-3-3 zeta/delta isoform, one of seven conserved mammalian 14-3-3 adaptor proteins. These proteins form obligate dimers and bind client proteins via phosphoserine/phosphothreonine motifs, consistent with the 14-3-3 protein family/domain annotations provided (IPR/PF identifiers). Authoritative reviews explicitly list 14-3-3ζ among the human isoforms and map it to the YWHAZ gene, with structural features characteristic of the family (nine α-helices per monomer, dimerization, conserved peptide-binding grooves) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00370-4, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2024.1286536, Feb 2024) (zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3, abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 1-2).
- Accession: The UniProt accession P63104 for human 14-3-3ζ is consistent with the request context; contemporary literature consistently refers to 14-3-3ζ as the product of YWHAZ and places it within the canonical 14-3-3 structural fold and interaction mode (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00370-4, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2024.1286536, Feb 2024) (zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3, abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 2-3).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Structure and dimerization: Each 14-3-3 monomer comprises nine antiparallel α-helices (αA–αI) and assembles as a symmetric dimer that adopts a flattened W-shaped architecture with two amphipathic peptide-binding grooves; the dimer interface involves N-terminal helices, while the ligand-binding grooves are built primarily from helices C/E/G/I and present both basic (phosphate-coordinating) and hydrophobic contacts (https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2024.1286536, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00370-4, Oct 2024) (abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 2-3, zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3).
- Canonical binding motifs: 14-3-3 proteins recognize phosphorylated linear motifs including Mode I RSXpSXP and Mode II RXY/FXpSXP, as well as C-terminal Mode III pS/pT-X1–2-COOH motifs; structural and biochemical studies confirm phospho-dependent binding in the conserved amphipathic groove (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.220376, Jul 2021; 2024 design review excerpts) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2, gogl2021recognitionofhighrisk pages 4-6, kamayirese2024designofpeptide pages 13-22).
- Cellular localization: 14-3-3ζ (YWHAZ) is predominantly cytosolic but shuttles with clients, often retaining transcription factors or signaling enzymes in the cytoplasm; N-terminal amphipathic elements and ligand occupancy modulate localization and membrane interactions (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00370-4, Oct 2024; preprint synthesis of localization and client retention) (zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3, badhe2025identificationandvalidation pages 1-3).

Signaling pathways and precise biochemical roles
- RAF/MEK/ERK and kinase regulation: 14-3-3 dimers scaffold and regulate RAF family kinases via binding to conserved phosphorylated motifs, influencing RAF activation states and MAPK signaling outputs; structural/biochemical syntheses in 2024 place these interactions in the canonical amphipathic groove context (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 10-11).
- PI3K–AKT and apoptosis control (BAD/FOXO): 14-3-3ζ sequesters phosphorylated BAD (e.g., pSer112/136) to block mitochondrial translocation and apoptosis and binds FOXO transcription factors to regulate nuclear access, integrating AKT-mediated survival signaling (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5242408/v1, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (lim2024ahighthroughputscreening pages 1-5, andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 10-11).
- Hippo (YAP/TAZ): 14-3-3 binds phosphorylated YAP/TAZ, retaining them in the cytoplasm; recent biophysical work identified an allosteric stabilizer that preferentially binds a 14-3-3/TAZ complex, offering a route to tune Hippo signaling by stabilizing this PPI (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2).
- NEDD4-2 E3 ligase regulation: Phosphorylation at multiple sites (e.g., pSer342 and pSer448) on NEDD4-2 recruits 14-3-3, inducing conformational rearrangements that inhibit intramolecular domain–domain contacts and attenuate ligase activity toward substrates such as ENaC, illustrating a precise 14-3-3-mediated allosteric control of an E3 enzyme (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02419-0, Jul 2021) (pohl20211433proteinregulatesnedd42 pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Allosteric PPI stabilization via fragments: A 2024 fragment-based screen discovered a first-in-class allosteric stabilizer for a 14-3-3/TAZ complex that binds between helices 8 and 9, distal to the peptide interface; NMR and crystallography validated binding, exemplifying a new modality to stabilize 14-3-3 PPIs beyond classical fusicoccane scaffolds (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2).
- Molecular glue concepts and natural products: Contemporary reviews and primary studies highlight 14-3-3 PPI stabilization by plant-derived fusicoccanes and related chemotypes (historical), while also emphasizing challenges of complexity and the promise of newer allosteric pockets delineated by fragment screens (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2).
- Disruptor screening in living cells: A 2024 high-throughput BRET assay targeting 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions in cells achieved Z′=0.52, screened 1,971 FDA-approved compounds, identified 101 initial hits, and prioritized terfenadine, penfluridol, and lomitapide as disruptors that induced cell death in colorectal cancer models, establishing a practical, repurposing-oriented pipeline for 14-3-3 PPI disruption (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5242408/v1, Oct 2024) (lim2024ahighthroughputscreening pages 1-5).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Chemical biology toolkits: The 2024 fragment-derived allosteric stabilizer for the 14-3-3/TAZ interaction (validated by DSF, MST, NMR, and crystallography) provides a chemical probe framework for stabilizing Hippo pathway PPIs, enabling functional studies and potentially context-specific therapeutic strategies (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00248, Aug 2024) (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2).
- Screening technologies: Live-cell BRET biosensors for 14-3-3ζ:BAD interactions show feasibility for high-throughput discovery of disruptors among approved drugs, supporting translational repurposing and mechanistic validation in oncology contexts (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5242408/v1, Oct 2024) (lim2024ahighthroughputscreening pages 1-5).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Cross-disease perspectives emphasize 14-3-3 as central, pleiotropic hubs whose isoform-specific targeting must balance efficacy with on-target liabilities, recommending selective modulation of pathogenic PPIs (stabilization or disruption) rather than complete inhibition; structural reviews delineate conserved architecture (dimeric W-shaped scaffold, amphipathic grooves) and motif recognition rules that underlie rational intervention strategies (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-024-00370-4, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2024.1286536, Feb 2024; synthesis highlighting PPI stabilization strategies, 2024) (zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3, abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 2-3, andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data from recent studies
- Live-cell HTS (disruptors): Z′-score 0.52; 1,971 compounds screened; 101 initial hits; multiple validated hits induced cell death in colorectal cancer lines, evidencing tractability of 14-3-3ζ:BAD disruption in a repurposing context (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5242408/v1, Oct 2024) (lim2024ahighthroughputscreening pages 1-5).
- Exosomal biomarker signal: Plasma exosome proteomics in post-stroke cognitive impairment identified significantly elevated YWHAZ (14-3-3ζ) in cases versus controls, with differential expression supported by label-free quantitative proteomics and orthogonal validation, indicating potential utility as a circulating biomarker in neurology (https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.204738, May 2023) (badhe2025identificationandvalidation pages 14-16).

Isoform-specific notes for 14-3-3ζ (YWHAZ)
- Isoform identity: 14-3-3ζ is a distinct human isoform encoded by YWHAZ, displaying subtle ligand preference differences across the family yet retaining the canonical structural fold and phospho-motif recognition; multiple structural analyses (including peptide co-crystals) explicitly visualize 14-3-3ζ dimers engaging phospho-motif clients within the basic amphipathic groove (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.220376, Jul 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2024.1286536, Feb 2024) (gogl2021recognitionofhighrisk pages 4-6, abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 2-3).

Mechanistic and structural evidence (selected primary exemplars)
- 14-3-3ζ–phosphopeptide complex: A 1.9 Å crystal structure of human 14-3-3ζ bound to a phosphorylated HPV18 E6 C-terminal PBM (a Mode III-like motif) demonstrates conserved phosphate coordination in the basic pocket of the amphipathic groove and dimeric binding of two peptides, one per monomer (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.220376, Jul 2021) (gogl2021recognitionofhighrisk pages 4-6).
- 14-3-3–NEDD4-2 regulation: Integrative structural biophysics mapped key 14-3-3-binding phosphomotifs (pSer342, pSer448) and showed that 14-3-3 binding alters NEDD4-2 conformation to reduce activity toward substrates, exemplifying 14-3-3-mediated allostery of an E3 ligase (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02419-0, Jul 2021) (pohl20211433proteinregulatesnedd42 pages 1-2).

Caveats and scope
- Gene symbol ambiguity: YWHAZ is widely and consistently used for human 14-3-3ζ across the cited literature; no conflicting gene symbol usage was identified during this review. Where UniProt accession was needed, we relied on the provided P63104 mapping and cross-checked overall family/domain alignment via recent structural reviews (zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3, abdi20241433proteins—amoonlight pages 2-3).

*Table: Concise table summarizing identity, structure, binding motifs, localization, key pathways/clients, recent chemical biology advances, disease associations, and authoritative sources for human YWHAZ (14-3-3ζ); useful as a rapid reference with citations to the retrieved context.*

Conclusion
YWHAZ encodes the human 14-3-3ζ adaptor, a dimeric scaffold with a conserved amphipathic groove that reads phosphorylated linear motifs (Mode I/II/III) to modulate localization, activity, and stability of diverse client proteins in MAPK, PI3K–AKT, Hippo, and ubiquitin signaling. Recent advances have delivered the first validated allosteric stabilizer of a 14-3-3/TAZ complex and a live-cell HTS platform that yields disruptors of 14-3-3ζ:BAD, showcasing both stabilization and disruption strategies for therapeutic exploration. Emerging biomarker findings (elevated exosomal YWHAZ in post-stroke cognitive impairment) underscore translational potential beyond oncology. Collectively, structural precision, isoform-aware targeting, and pathway-contextualized PPI modulation (stabilize pathogenic loss-of-function PPIs; disrupt pro-survival PPIs) define current best practices for drug discovery on YWHAZ/14-3-3ζ (andlovic2024fragmentbasedinterrogationof pages 1-2, lim2024ahighthroughputscreening pages 1-5, badhe2025identificationandvalidation pages 14-16, zhou2024versatilityof1433 pages 2-3).
