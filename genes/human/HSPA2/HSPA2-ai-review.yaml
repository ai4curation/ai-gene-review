description: >-
  HSPA2 (Heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2) is a member of the HSP70/HSPA
  molecular chaperone family. It functions as an ATP-dependent foldase chaperone,
  assisting in the folding and refolding of proteins through cycles of ATP
  binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release mediated by co-chaperones. HSPA2 is
  constitutively expressed in most tissues, with especially high levels in
  testis and skeletal muscle (PMID:7829106). It plays a pivotal role in
  spermatogenesis and male meiosis (PMID:8622925), and is also implicated
  in proteome protection from stress, suppression of protein aggregation,
  and targeting of misfolded proteins for degradation. HSPA2 has a
  nucleotide-binding domain (NBD/ATPase domain) and a substrate-binding
  domain (SBD), which are allosterically coupled such that ATP hydrolysis
  increases affinity for client proteins.

      the mouse ortholog (P17156) has been annotated to cell surface
      (GO_REF:0000107, Ensembl Compara). UniProt notes that HSPA2 is a component
      of the CatSper complex (by similarity), which is a sperm cell surface ion
      channel complex. The IBA annotation is plausible but plasma membrane

      the K564A mutation abolished methylation. This is a real enzyme-substrate
