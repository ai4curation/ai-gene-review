You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human HSPA2 (UniProt P54652)

1. Target verification (gene/protein identity)

HSPA2 (UniProt accession P54652) encodes “Heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2” (also referred to as “Hsp70-2”), a member of the HSPA/HSP70 family of molecular chaperones in Homo sapiens. Its family/domain architecture is consistent with canonical HSP70s, with an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that has ATPase activity and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) that binds client polypeptides. This domain organization is described in recent primary literature focused on HSPA2-specific biology, supporting that the literature cited here refers to the correct human protein (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2).

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

2.1. What HSPA2 is (molecular chaperone definition)

HSPA2 is a 70-kDa HSP70-family molecular chaperone. In current mechanistic understanding, HSP70-family proteins operate through ATP-dependent cycles: the NBD binds/hydrolyzes ATP, and allosteric coupling to the SBD regulates binding and release of unfolded or partially folded client proteins. In a functional definition used in recent HSPA2-focused work, HSPA/HSP70 proteins support folding/refolding of proteins, prevent aggregation, and can target damaged proteins for degradation (including via ubiquitin–proteasome system or chaperone-mediated autophagy pathways) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2).

2.2. Broad functional categories relevant to functional annotation

Based on recent HSPA2-focused experimental and synthesis literature, HSPA2 is best annotated as:

• ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (protein folding/refolding; proteostasis) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2)
• Germ-cell enriched chaperone linked to spermatogenesis and sperm functional maturation (grassi2022targetedanalysisof pages 1-2)
• Protein that can localize outside the cytosol, including association with extracellular vesicles (EVs), implying roles in extracellular communication/biomarker biology (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10)

2.3. Interaction partners / co-chaperone systems (conceptual context)

HSP70 function is typically modulated by co-chaperones (e.g., J-domain proteins/DNAJs) and adapter proteins that regulate ATPase cycling and client transfer. A 2024 synthesis/bioinformatic analysis lists HSPA2-associated or network-linked proteins consistent with co-chaperone/interactome logic, including DNAJ family members and other HSPs/cofactors (e.g., DNAJB12, STIP1, HSPBP1, HSPA1A, HSPA8, HSP90AA1), and additionally notes HSPA2’s role in spermatogenesis and a proposed interaction with SHCBP1L to support spindle integrity during male meiosis (shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6). While such lists contain inference and require experimental validation in each tissue context, they help define plausible HSPA2 pathway connectivity for annotation purposes (shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6).

3. Molecular function, pathways, and subcellular localization (with evidence)

3.1. Core molecular function (proteostasis; ATPase-driven chaperone cycle)

HSPA2 is an HSP70-family chaperone with the expected NBD ATPase and SBD client-binding architecture, supporting a primary function in ATP-dependent folding/refolding and protein quality control (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2). In functional annotation terms, this places HSPA2 in proteostasis pathways and chaperone-mediated folding networks (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2).

3.2. Subcellular localization — intracellular, surface, and extracellular vesicles

3.2.1. Cytosolic/“intracellular” role

HSPA2 is discussed in the context of canonical intracellular HSP70 chaperoning and proteostasis control (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2). In sperm, HSPA2 has been reported with diverse intracellular regional patterns (head/acrosomal/post-acrosomal/neck/tail), and its redistribution during capacitation has been debated (grassi2022targetedanalysisof pages 1-2).

3.2.2. Extracellular vesicle association (key 2023 development)

A major recent development is direct experimental evidence that HSPA2 is an extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated protein. Sojka et al. (Scientific Reports; publication date March 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31962-5) show that proteotoxic stress (e.g., proteasome inhibition) can shift HSPA2 from intracellular pools to extracellular release in EVs, and that EV-associated HSPA2 is also detectable from non-stressed cancer and normal cells (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 2-3, sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5). This work supports annotating HSPA2 not only as a cytosolic chaperone but also as a protein present in the extracellular compartment via EVs (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10).

Quantitative EV metrics under proteotoxic stress reported by Sojka et al. include: bortezomib (32 nM) increasing extracellular HSPA2 and nearly doubling EV number, with EV mean size ~105.6 ± 0.6 nm and mode ~92.0 ± 5.7 nm (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5). Antibody specificity controls included CRISPR/Cas9 HSPA2 knockout pools and GFP–HSPA2 overexpression to confirm EV association of HSPA2 (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5).

3.2.3. Plasma membrane exposure / extracellular HSP70 context

Although not HSPA2-exclusive, the extracellular HSP70 literature indicates that HSP70-family members can appear at the plasma membrane and/or be released in soluble or EV-associated form, with immunomodulatory consequences in cancer contexts. HSPA2 is specifically named among HSP70 family members found on plasma membrane in the cancer extracellular HSP70 review context (April 2024; Frontiers in Oncology; URL https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1388999) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10).

3.3. Biological processes — male germline and sperm function

3.3.1. Spermatogenesis and sperm functional maturation

A 2022 targeted analysis of HSP70 isoforms in human sperm summarizes the prevailing model that HSPA2 supports spermatogenesis (notably spermatocyte expression supporting meiosis) and post-meiotic sperm remodeling, including cytoplasmic extrusion and plasma membrane remodeling required for zona pellucida binding competence. It also describes reported roles in enabling surface relocation of proteins needed for oocyte zona interaction during capacitation (June 2022; Int J Mol Sci; URL https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23126497) (grassi2022targetedanalysisof pages 1-2).

3.3.2. Hyaluronic acid (HA) binding–based sperm selection (2023 primary evidence with statistics)

Gómez-Torres et al. (Reproductive Sciences; July 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-022-01031-9) quantified HSPA2 immunofluorescence positivity in human sperm (16 normozoospermic samples; ~300 cells/sample/condition; total ~19,200 cells assessed) and linked HSPA2 detection to HA-binding sperm selection:

• HSPA2-positive sperm fractions were 28.6% in uncapacitated sperm (US) and 22.9% in capacitated sperm (CS), with no significant difference (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).
• HA-bound sperm showed substantially higher HSPA2 positivity (68.9%), significantly higher than US/CS (p<0.001) (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).
• HA-unbound sperm showed 29.2% positivity (not different from US/CS; significantly lower than HA-bound, p<0.001) (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

The study further quantified subcellular staining patterns and showed shifts in localization patterns after HA selection, with one pattern (P3) becoming dominant among HA-bound sperm (46.6%) and another (P2) increasing (13.9%; p<0.001 vs US) (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6). The fraction of sperm bound in the HA assay was 21.4 ± 7.4% (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

Interpretation for functional annotation: these data support associating HSPA2 with sperm selection criteria linked to functional maturity (HA-binding competence) and with head-region localization patterns potentially relevant to gamete recognition/fertilization processes (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

3.4. Regulation and proteostasis coupling under stress

Sojka et al. (2023) observed that proteasome inhibition in cancer cell lines reduced cellular HSPA2 protein in a dose-dependent manner without a parallel decrease in HSPA2 mRNA, arguing for post-transcriptional mechanisms, and that the observed intracellular “loss” of HSPA2 was linked to increased extracellular release in EVs (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 2-3). Autophagy/lysosome inhibition did not restore intracellular HSPA2 under those conditions (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 2-3).

4. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

4.1. 2023: HSPA2 as an extracellular vesicle-associated protein

The discovery/validation of HSPA2 in EV cargo using paralog-specific reagents and genetic controls (HSPA2 knockout) provides a mechanistic basis for studying HSPA2 in biofluids (e.g., urine EVs) and in tumor microenvironment communication (March 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31962-5) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5, sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10).

4.2. 2023: Functional stratification of HSPA2-positive sperm by HA selection

The quantitative enrichment of HSPA2-positive cells in HA-bound sperm provides updated evidence connecting HSPA2 detectability/localization with a sperm selection technique used in assisted reproduction settings (July 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-022-01031-9) (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

4.3. 2024: Seminal plasma HSPA2 as a non-invasive biomarker of spermatogenic potential in azoospermia

Fietz et al. (Frontiers in Endocrinology; April 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1327800) profiled seminal plasma proteomes from healthy controls and azoospermic subgroups and identified HSPA2 as a promising biomarker linked to spermatogenic function:

• Study cohorts: healthy controls (HC, n=8), obstructive azoospermia (OA, n=7), non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) with mixed testicular atrophy (MTA, n=8), and NOA with Sertoli cell-only phenotype (SCO, n≈7–8 depending on analysis) (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 1-2, fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5).
• Across 917 quantified proteins, differential abundance criteria were p≤0.05 and fold-change ≥1.5 (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5).
• HSPA2 (UniProt P54652) was more abundant in HC than SCO with fold-change HC/SCO = 7.31 and adjusted p=0.0217 (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5).

This quantitative result is also visible in the paper’s Table 1 (image evidence) (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin media ce6a8253).

4.4. 2024: Circulating HSPA2 and diabetic myocardium — incident heart failure biomarker hypothesis

Conning-Rowland et al. (Cardiovascular Research; August 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvae181) analyzed GTEx RNA-seq myocardial tissue to define diabetes-associated DEGs and validated certain targets at the plasma protein level in UK Biobank proteomics:

• GTEx analysis sample sizes after exclusions: 425 right atrial (RA) and 428 left ventricular (LV) samples (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).
• Diabetes was characterized by higher Hspa2 expression in LV myocardium and directionally concordant higher circulating HSPA2 protein (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).
• Higher circulating HSPA2 (highest quartile vs other quartiles) was associated with impaired LV contractility, higher LV mass, and increased incident heart failure and cardiovascular death (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).

The excerpt available here does not provide hazard ratios or p-values for these associations, so the strongest claim supported by the evidence retrieved is the directionality and existence of reported associations, not their effect sizes (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).

5. Current applications and real-world implementations

5.1. Male infertility diagnostics and decision support for sperm retrieval

A key near-term application is HSPA2 as a seminal plasma biomarker for non-invasive stratification of non-obstructive azoospermia and prediction of testicular sperm retrieval success. Fietz et al. (April 2024) specifically motivated their study by the clinical burden of NOA retrieval rates (~50%) and investigated HSPA2 as a candidate marker of spermatogenic function (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 1-2). Their proteomics and validation strategy supports using HSPA2 measurement alongside other testis/germ-cell proteins to inform whether spermatogenesis is preserved (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 1-2, fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5).

5.2. Assisted reproduction and sperm selection methods

The HA-binding selection approach (often used to enrich sperm with features linked to maturity) is proposed as a context where HSPA2 immunodetection might complement classic semen analysis. The 2023 study’s observation that HA-bound sperm are enriched for HSPA2 positivity supports the practical notion that HSPA2 may be aligned with selection strategies aimed at improving fertilization-relevant sperm properties (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

5.3. Oncology: extracellular/EV HSP70-family biomarker concepts

A 2024 review on extracellular HSP70 in cancer describes extracellular HSP70 forms (membrane-associated, soluble, EV-associated) as potential tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and notes HSPA2 among the HSP70-family members detected at the plasma membrane. While this does not establish HSPA2-specific clinical utility on its own, it positions HSPA2 within the extracellular-HSP70 biomarker/targeting framework in tumors (April 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1388999) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10).

5.4. Cardio-metabolic disease biomarker discovery

The 2024 Cardiovascular Research study suggests circulating HSPA2 may serve as a biomarker of LV remodeling/dysfunction and risk in diabetes, though quantitative performance metrics (e.g., HRs, AUC) are not available in the retrieved excerpt (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).

6. Expert synthesis and analysis (authoritative interpretations)

6.1. Proteostasis-centered view of HSPA2 function

Across recent primary studies, the most defensible “primary function” annotation is that HSPA2 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone supporting proteostasis (folding/refolding and quality control). The EV study’s mechanistic framing explicitly places HSPA2 in the broader proteostasis control machinery and emphasizes that its abundance and localization can be reshaped by proteotoxic stress, including redistribution into extracellular vesicles (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2, sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 2-3).

6.2. Reproductive specialization and measurable phenotypes

In reproduction-focused contexts, HSPA2 is repeatedly treated as a germ-cell enriched chaperone connected to meiosis and sperm surface remodeling, and recent quantitative work ties HSPA2 immunodetection to HA-binding sperm subpopulations. Importantly, HA binding stratifies HSPA2 positivity more strongly than capacitation alone in that dataset, which may imply that HSPA2 exposure/epitope accessibility or localization reflects sperm maturity states enriched by HA selection (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

6.3. Extracellular HSPA2 and biomarker feasibility

The EV-localization evidence provides a plausible biological route for HSPA2 detection in biofluids (e.g., urinary EVs, seminal plasma), consistent with the 2024 seminal plasma study demonstrating large differences (HC/SCO fold change 7.31) in HSPA2 abundance in a clinically relevant setting (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5, fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin media ce6a8253). This convergence supports ongoing development of HSPA2 as a biomarker, while also emphasizing that extracellular detection may represent EV-associated protein rather than only soluble protein (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5, fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5).

7. Key statistics and data points from recent studies (2023–2024)

• EV association under proteotoxic stress: bortezomib (32 nM) increased extracellular HSPA2 and nearly doubled EV number; EV mean size ~105.6 ± 0.6 nm (mode ~92.0 ± 5.7 nm) (Sojka et al., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31962-5) (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5).

• HA selection in human sperm (n=16 donors; ~19,200 sperm scored): HSPA2-positive sperm 68.9% in HA-bound vs 28.6% uncapacitated and 22.9% capacitated; HA-bound sperm fraction 21.4 ± 7.4% (Gómez-Torres et al., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-022-01031-9) (gomeztorres2023molecularchaperonehspa2 pages 4-6).

• Seminal plasma proteomics (Frontiers in Endocrinology, April 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1327800): 917 proteins quantified; HSPA2 HC/SCO fold-change 7.31 with adjusted p=0.0217 (Fietz et al., 2024), visible in Table 1 (fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin pages 3-5, fietz2024proteomicbiomarkersin media ce6a8253).

• Diabetic myocardium transcriptomics (Cardiovascular Research, August 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvae181): GTEx analysis included 425 RA and 428 LV samples; diabetes associated with higher Hspa2 expression in LV and directionally concordant higher circulating HSPA2, and highest-quartile circulating HSPA2 associated with LV dysfunction and increased incident heart failure/cardiovascular death (conningrowland2024thediabeticmyocardial pages 1-3).

8. Limitations of the current evidence set

• Direct enzymology (e.g., measured ATPase rates or client-specific substrate specificity) for human HSPA2 was not captured in the retrieved 2023–2024 excerpts; the ATPase/NBD function is supported via established HSP70 domain/function description in the HSPA2 EV study rather than HSPA2-specific kinetics (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2).

• Several disease/cancer claims are currently best supported at the “HSP70-family/extracellular HSP70” level or at the “HSPA2 is present/trafficked extracellularly” level, rather than as causal HSPA2-specific therapeutic targets with clinical efficacy data, because the most quantitative retrieved cancer-focused HSPA2 data are limited in this evidence set (sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 9-10, sojka2023heatshockprotein pages 3-5).
