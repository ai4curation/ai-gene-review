description: SNORD3A (U3 snoRNA) is a C/D box small nucleolar RNA essential for 
  ribosome biogenesis. Unlike typical C/D box snoRNAs that guide 
  2'-O-methylation, U3 snoRNA guides site-specific cleavage of pre-rRNA through 
  base-pairing interactions. It is a critical component of the SSU-processome 
  complex that directs maturation of 18S rRNA and assembly of the 40S small 
  ribosomal subunit. This gene is also known as U3 snoRNA and is atypical among 
  C/D box snoRNAs because it guides pre-rRNA cleavage rather than 
  2'-O-methylation.
