SNORD3A is a non-coding RNA (snoRNA) gene and does not have a UniProt entry.

Gene Type: OTHER_NCRNA
RNAcentral ID: URS000053962A_9606
Gene Symbol: SNORD3A
Aliases: U3 snoRNA, U3, Small nucleolar RNA U3
Organism: Homo sapiens (Human)
Taxonomy ID: 9606

Non-coding RNAs are not included in UniProt, which is a protein sequence database.
For ncRNA annotation, see SNORD3A-rnacentral.json instead.

The equivalent information for this ncRNA is maintained in:
- RNAcentral database (https://rnacentral.org/rna/URS000053962A/9606)
- Rfam database
- snoDB database

Sequence Length: 217 nucleotides
RNA Type: C/D box snoRNA

Function: U3 snoRNA is essential for ribosome biogenesis, specifically for 
maturation of 18S rRNA through guiding site-specific cleavage of pre-rRNA.
