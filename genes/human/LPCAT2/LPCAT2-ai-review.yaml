description: >-
  LPCAT2 (Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2) is an inducible membrane-bound
  enzyme with dual acyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities. It functions
  primarily in the Lands cycle for phosphatidylcholine (PC) remodeling and in the
  biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). The enzyme catalyzes: (1) the
  conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) to PC using acyl-CoA donors
  (EC 2.3.1.23); (2) the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic
  acid (PA) (EC 2.3.1.51); (3) the acetylation of lyso-PAF to produce PAF using
  acetyl-CoA (EC 2.3.1.67); and (4) plasmalogen synthesis (EC 2.3.1.25). LPCAT2 is
  distinguished from LPCAT1 by being inducible (analogous to COX-2 vs COX-1),
  Ca2+-dependent, and activated by LPS via p38 MAPK pathway in inflammatory cells.
  The enzyme localizes primarily to the ER membrane with 10-30% also found in lipid
  droplets where it contributes to local PC synthesis. Contains EF-hand domains for
  calcium binding and the conserved HXXXXD catalytic motif.

      LPCAT2 has been experimentally demonstrated to have AGPAT activity, converting

- term:

    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:32296183
  review:
    summary: >-
      LPCAT2 was identified as interacting with several proteins (EBP, ERGIC3, HSD17B13,
      KCNJ6, MFSD14B, RETREG3, RHBDD1) in the HuRI human reference interactome study.
      These are high-throughput Y2H interactions.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The "protein binding" term is uninformative and should generally be avoided.
      However, the interactions detected in this high-throughput study may be relevant
      to LPCAT2's function in the ER/lipid droplet. Keep as non-core pending more
      specific characterization of these interactions.

    Inducible lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity (EC 2.3.1.67) converting lyso-PAF
    to platelet-activating factor (PAF) using acetyl-CoA. This Ca2+-dependent,
    LPS-inducible activity distinguishes LPCAT2 from constitutive LPCAT1 (analogous
    to COX-2 vs COX-1). Upon inflammatory stimulation via TLR4/p38 MAPK pathway,
    the enzyme preferentially uses acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis.

    This reacylation step of the Lands cycle maintains membrane phospholipid composition.
    Under resting conditions, LPCAT2 preferentially catalyzes this acyltransferase
    reaction over the acetyltransferase reaction, contributing to membrane biogenesis.
    LPCAT2 also functions on lipid droplets where it catalyzes local PC synthesis.
