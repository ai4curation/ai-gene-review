description: GADD45A (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible 45 alpha) is a multifunctional 18 kDa stress-response
  protein that acts as a critical sensor and mediator of cellular responses to genotoxic and environmental
  stresses. It functions primarily through protein-protein interactions to regulate cell cycle checkpoints
  (G2/M arrest via Cdc2/cyclin B1 inhibition), activate stress-responsive MAPK signaling (p38 and JNK
  pathways via MTK1/MEKK4), promote DNA repair (through PCNA interaction facilitating NER and BER), and
  regulate apoptosis in a context-dependent manner. GADD45A localizes to the nucleus and nuclear speckles,
  where it participates in transcription-coupled processes including active DNA demethylation through
  TET1 recruitment to R-loops.

  review:
    summary: GADD45A is a well-established cell cycle regulator, primarily mediating G2/M arrest through
      inhibition of Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex. GADD45A binds directly to Cdc2 via its central region (aa
      65-84) and inhibits Cdc2 kinase activity by promoting dissociation of the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex
      [PMID:10747892 "GADD45-induced cell cycle G2-M arrest was abolished when its Cdc2 binding motif
      was disrupted"]. IBA annotation is appropriate as this function is conserved across GADD45 family
      members.

  review:
    summary: PMID:10828065 shows GADD45A overexpression can induce apoptosis [PMID:10828065 "ectopic expression
      of... Gadd45 N-terminal peptides... induce apoptosis more efficiently than the full-length proteins"].
      Apoptosis induction is context-dependent and mediated by the N-terminal region. This is a downstream
      effect of GADD45A stress signaling.
