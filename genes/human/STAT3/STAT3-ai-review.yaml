description: STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that
  is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr705) in response to cytokines and growth factors. Upon phosphorylation by JAK
  kinases, STAT3 forms dimers via reciprocal SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions, translocates to the nucleus, binds DNA
  via its DNA-binding domain at GAS (gamma-activated sequence) elements, and regulates transcription of target genes involved
  in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and immune responses. STAT3 is a central mediator of the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway, particularly downstream of IL-6 family cytokines (IL-6, LIF, CNTF, IL-11). The protein contains an N-terminal domain,
  coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker domain, SH2 domain, and C-terminal transactivation domain. Serine phosphorylation
  (Ser727) modulates transcriptional activity and contributes to non-canonical mitochondrial functions (mitoSTAT3). STAT3
  plays critical roles in immune regulation, inflammation, embryonic development, and is frequently constitutively activated
  in various cancers where it promotes oncogenic programs. In neural development, STAT3 promotes gliogenesis and astrocyte
  differentiation.
