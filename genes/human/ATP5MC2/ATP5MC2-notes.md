# ATP5MC2 Gene Review Notes

## Key Point: Identical Mature Protein to ATP5MC1

**ATP5MC2** is one of three paralogous genes (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3) that encode the **identical 51-amino acid mature protein** - subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase. The genes differ only in their mitochondrial targeting sequences.

**See ATP5MC1-notes.md for comprehensive functional details** - all structural, mechanistic, and functional information applies identically to ATP5MC2.

## Gene-Specific Differences

### Targeting Sequence
- **Precursor:** 141 amino acids (vs 136 for ATP5MC1, varies for ATP5MC3)
- **Mature protein:** 51 amino acids (identical across all three paralogs)
- **Targeting sequence:** Different from ATP5MC1 and ATP5MC3
- **Location:** Chromosome 12 (vs chromosome 17 for ATP5MC1)

### Expression and Regulation
From deep research:
- Tissue-specific expression patterns may differ among paralogs
- Different promoter regions → potential for differential regulation
- All three genes provide functional redundancy for c-subunit production

## Functional Summary (Identical to ATP5MC1)

All functional annotations for ATP5MC1 apply to ATP5MC2:

1. **Forms c-ring rotor** - 8-subunit homooctamer in F₀ domain
2. **Proton channel activity** - Glu-59 binds/releases protons
3. **Couples proton gradient to ATP synthesis** - rotary mechanism
4. **Binds cardiolipin** - stabilizes structure
5. **Can form mPTP** - under stress conditions
6. **Participates in cristae organization** - via ATP synthase oligomerization

## References for Functional Annotation

Since mature proteins are identical, all functional studies on "ATP synthase subunit c" apply to ATP5MC2:
- **PMID:37244256** - Human ATP synthase structure (2023)
- **PMID:31652072** - TMEM70 facilitates c-ring assembly
- **PMID:33359711** - TMEM70 oligomeric scaffolds
- **PMID:30530489** - Lys-104 methylation

## Annotation Strategy

For ATP5MC2 review:
1. **ACCEPT** all core functional annotations (same as ATP5MC1)
2. **ACCEPT** localization to mitochondrial inner membrane
3. **ACCEPT** participation in ATP synthase complex
4. **REMOVE** generic "protein binding" from proteome studies
5. **KEEP_AS_NON_CORE** broad parent terms

The functional annotations are identical to ATP5MC1 since the mature protein sequences are identical.

## Core Functions (Same as ATP5MC1)

1. Proton channel activity → proton transmembrane transport
2. Mechanical coupling → proton-motive force-driven ATP synthesis
3. Cardiolipin binding → structural stabilization

## Important Note for Description

The description should mention:
- Part of the three-gene family (ATP5MC1/2/3)
- Identical mature protein
- Different targeting sequence
- Provides functional redundancy
- All mechanistic details same as ATP5MC1
