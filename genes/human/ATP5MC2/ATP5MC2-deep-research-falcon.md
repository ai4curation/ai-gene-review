### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5MC2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5MC2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5MC2** (gene ID: ATP5MC2, UniProt: Q06055) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human ATP5MC2 (UniProt Q06055) — mitochondrial ATP synthase Fo subunit c2

Executive verification and identity
- Gene/protein identity: ATP5MC2 (synonym ATP5G2) encodes a nuclear-encoded proteolipid subunit (subunit c2) of the mitochondrial Fo sector of ATP synthase (Complex V). The protein belongs to the ATPase C chain family and localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane (IMM), consistent with its role in the Fo proton channel. The organismal context is Homo sapiens. These features match the target description provided and the established organization of the mammalian F1Fo-ATP synthase (Complex V) (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Family/domains: Subunit c is a small, highly hydrophobic proteolipid with conserved features of the ATP_synth_F0_c superfamily; it oligomerizes to form the c-ring rotor of the Fo motor that couples proton translocation to rotary torque. Its membrane embedding and association within the Fo sector match domain/family expectations for ATP synthase c-subunits (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Complex V architecture: The mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of a soluble F1 catalytic sector (α3β3γδε) and a membrane-embedded Fo motor that includes subunit a (MT-ATP6), the c-ring (multiple copies of subunit c, encoded in humans by ATP5MC paralogs), and additional small subunits and peripheral stalk components. The central rotor (γδε plus c-ring) turns within the stator (α3β3 and peripheral stalk) to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. The enzyme forms dimers in the IMM and is essential for cellular ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- c-ring stoichiometry and composition: In mammals, the c-ring stoichiometry is eight copies (c8) per rotor. The human structure reviewed in 2024 explicitly indicates a c8 rotor ring that interfaces with subunit a to mediate proton translocation (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Proton translocation mechanism: Proton flow occurs at the interface of subunit a (ATP6) and the c-ring via two offset hydrophilic hemichannels. A conserved acidic side chain in each c-subunit transiently binds and releases protons, enabling stepwise rotation of the c-ring; 360° rotation of the rotor yields three ATP formed by the F1 sector (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5).
- Lipid binding within the c-ring: The inner lumen of the c-ring in mitochondria contains bound phospholipids, consistent with specific lipid–protein interactions stabilizing the ring and possibly modulating mechanics (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6).
- Localization: ATP5MC2 product is embedded in the IMM as part of the Fo rotor; its functional site is thus the mitochondrial inner membrane, at the a–c-ring proton channel interface (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- 2024 disease-focused and structural-context reviews emphasize: (i) the c8 stoichiometry in the human mitochondrial ATP synthase; (ii) the architectural coupling between ATP6 (subunit a) and the c-ring hemichannels that mediate proton translocation; (iii) the role of bound lipids in the c-ring lumen; and (iv) regulatory interactions such as IF1 that prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis when membrane potential is low. These up-to-date syntheses consolidate mechanistic details relevant to ATP5MC2’s role as a c-ring proteolipid (Feb 2024; MDPI IJMS review; Aug 2024; Physiological Research review) (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URLs and dates: Feb 2024 IJMS review https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25042239; Aug 2024 Physiological Research review https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Clinical and mechanistic context updated in 2024: Comprehensive reviews catalog pathogenic variation across ATP synthase genes and assembly factors, reinforcing how defects in Fo components (notably ATP6) alter proton coupling and ATP output and how assembly defects impair holoenzyme function. These reviews frame current thinking on how c-ring composition and its precise coupling with subunit a are central to OXPHOS efficiency and disease (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5).

Primary molecular function and pathway context
- Molecular role: ATP5MC2 encodes one isoform of the Fo c-subunit that polymerizes into the c-ring (c8 in mammals). Each c-subunit provides a conserved acidic residue that cycles between protonated and deprotonated states during transit through the a–c interface; this drives rotary motion of the rotor and thereby ATP synthesis by F1. The protein is thus a core component of the rotary proton motor of Complex V (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Pathway: ATP5MC2 functions in oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport chain Complexes I–IV establish the proton motive force; Complex V consumes it to synthesize ATP). Complex V produces the majority of cellular ATP in human cells; reviews note >90% contribution in many contexts, underscoring the centrality of the Fo motor and its c-ring to bioenergetics (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

Paralogs and paralog-specific insights
- Paralog family: Humans encode three nuclear paralogs for the mitochondrial c-subunit: ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, and ATP5MC3. These encode highly similar proteolipids that assemble into the c-ring. A 2024 review notes that ATP5MC1/2/3 do not show strong tissue-specific expression, suggesting functional redundancy at the level of expression, though specific paralog-biased regulation cannot be excluded (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32).
- Genetic insights in related paralogs: While ATP5MC2-specific pathogenic variants were not highlighted in the 2024 summaries, disease-associated variants have been reported in ATP5MC3 (dystonia/spastic paraplegia) and other Complex V subunits and assembly factors, indicating that perturbation of c-subunit abundance or assembly can produce neurological phenotypes. This provides indirect support for the essential and dosage-sensitive role of c-subunit proteolipids in humans (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32).

Inhibitors and binding sites; applications and implementations
- Oligomycin-class inhibitors: Classic Fo inhibitors (e.g., oligomycin) bind within the Fo region near the a–c interface, blocking proton translocation and thus rotation. Contemporary reviews continue to cite oligomycin as the defining pharmacological tool for Complex V inhibition and for assigning Fo-dependent ATP synthesis in bioenergetic assays, directly implicating the c-ring as part of the drug-binding landscape (2024 review context) (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Lipid modulation: The identification of phospholipids within the c-ring lumen supports a structural role for lipids in rotor stability and raises the possibility of lipid-mediated modulation of Fo mechanics, with implications for assay conditions and potential allosteric targeting (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6).
- Translational considerations: 2024 clinical/disease reviews discuss therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and Complex V regulation (e.g., modulating ATP synthase activity or assembly, or protecting coupling), though most genotype–therapy links concern mtDNA-encoded ATP6/ATP8 or assembly factor disorders. These overviews remain the current reference for translational directions that could indirectly involve the c-ring proteolipids (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32). 

Disease associations and human relevance
- Complex V deficiency and clinical spectra: The 2024 Physiological Research review details the wide clinical variability from isolated ATP synthase defects, spanning mitochondrial encephalo-cardiomyopathies. While the most common genetic causes involve MT-ATP6 (subunit a) and nuclear assembly factors (e.g., TMEM70), the dependency of ATP output on precise a–c-ring coupling highlights how disruptions to c-ring stoichiometry or composition (to which ATP5MC2 contributes) would be expected to impair ATP synthesis efficiency and cellular viability, especially in high-demand tissues (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32). 

Quantitative and structural-statistical details
- Stoichiometry: Human/animal mitochondrial c-ring stoichiometry is c8 (eight c-subunits per ring; mammalian enzyme) (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Catalytic output: One full rotation of the rotor (driven by proton translocation steps at the a–c interface) produces three ATP molecules from F1 catalysis (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6).
- Energy contribution: Complex V typically accounts for the vast majority of cellular ATP generation in respiring human cells (>90%), emphasizing the centrality of Fo c-ring function (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and synthesis
- Consensus view in 2024 expert reviews: The human mitochondrial ATP synthase relies on a precisely tuned coupling between proton flow at the a–c interface and rotor mechanics of the c8 ring. The c-subunit proteolipids (including ATP5MC2) are indispensable structural/functional elements of the Fo motor, with lipid occupancy in the c-ring lumen recognized as a stabilizing architectural feature. Regulatory proteins (e.g., IF1) and assembly factors modulate performance and biogenesis. Clinical variability arising from Complex V defects underscores the sensitivity of this system to perturbations in Fo mechanics, stoichiometry, or assembly (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 5-6, dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5).

Notes on symbol uniqueness and scope
- The gene symbol “ATP5MC2” specifically denotes a human nuclear gene encoding mitochondrial ATP synthase Fo subunit c isoform 2 (also known historically as ATP5G2). No conflicting non-human or unrelated gene usage was identified in the 2024 expert sources cited here; the protein family, localization, and function align with the UniProt-provided identity and domains (dotto2024variantsinhuman pages 2-5, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

Limitations and gaps
- ATP5MC2-specific functional divergence relative to ATP5MC1/ATP5MC3 and ATP5MC2-specific human genetic variation remain less well characterized in the recent reviews summarized here; available evidence emphasizes the shared biophysical role of all three paralogs in forming the c8 rotor ring. New primary studies focusing on paralog-specific regulation or variants may refine this view in the future (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 31-32, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
