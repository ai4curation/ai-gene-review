## Question

Research the ATP5MC2 (Q06055) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **ATP5MC2 (Q06055) gene** encodes a membrane subunit c (subunit 9) of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which is essential for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation[1][3][7].

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Gene Name/Aliases:** ATP5MC2, ATP5G2, ATP Synthase Membrane Subunit C Locus 2, ATPase Subunit C, DCCD-Reactive Proteolipid Subunit[1][3].
- **Protein Product:** ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C2, mitochondrial (UniProt Q06055)[7].
- **Function:** Forms part of the proton channel (F0 domain) of mitochondrial ATP synthase, facilitating proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives ATP synthesis from ADP[1][3][7].

---

### 2. Molecular Function

- **Primary Activity:** **Proton transmembrane transporter activity**—enables movement of protons (H+) across the mitochondrial inner membrane, coupling this flow to ATP synthesis[1][3][7][9].
- **Enzyme Complex:** Component of **Complex V (F1F0 ATP synthase)**, which consists of two domains:
  - **F1:** Soluble catalytic core (ATP synthesis)
  - **F0:** Membrane-spanning proton channel (includes subunit c)[1][3][7]
- **Rotary Mechanism:** The c-ring (composed of multiple subunit c proteins) rotates as protons pass through, driving conformational changes in the F1 domain for ATP production[1][7].

---

### 3. Biological Processes

- **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** Central to the electron transport chain, generating ATP using the proton gradient established by respiratory complexes[1][3][7][9].
- **Mitochondrial Biogenesis:** Involved in pathways regulating mitochondrial formation and function[1].
- **Energy Metabolism:** Critical for cellular energy supply in all tissues, especially those with high energy demands[1][3].

---

### 4. Cellular Localization

- **Subcellular Location:** **Mitochondrial inner membrane**—integral membrane protein forming part of the F0 proton channel[1][3][7][5].
- **Tissue Expression:** Ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels in tissues with high metabolic activity (e.g., heart, muscle, brain)[1][5].

---

### 5. Protein Domains

- **Proteolipid Domain:** Characteristic of subunit c proteins, enabling lipid interaction and proton translocation[1][7].
- **Transmembrane Helices:** Multiple predicted transmembrane regions anchor the protein within the mitochondrial inner membrane[7][5].
- **InterPro Domains:** Contains domains typical of ATP synthase subunit c family, facilitating its role in the rotary proton channel[5][7].

---

### 6. Known Interactions

- **Complex Assembly:** Interacts with other F0 subunits (a, b, d, e, f, g, F6, 8) to form the proton channel[1][3][7].
- **C-ring Formation:** Subunit c proteins oligomerize to form the c-ring, a key rotary element in ATP synthase[7].
- **F1 Domain Coupling:** The rotary action of the c-ring is mechanically coupled to the F1 catalytic domain for ATP synthesis[1][7].

---

### 7. Disease Associations

- **Mitochondrial Disease:** Mutations or dysfunction in ATP5MC2 or related subunits can contribute to mitochondrial disorders, characterized by impaired energy metabolism[1].
- **Cardiomyopathy, Familial Hypertrophic, 16:** ATP5MC2 is associated with this form of inherited heart disease, likely due to its role in cardiac energy metabolism[1].
- **General Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Defects in ATP synthase subunits are implicated in a range of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases[1][3].

---

### 8. Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)

- **Structural Insights:** AlphaFold and other AI-based modeling have refined the predicted structure of ATP5MC2, confirming its transmembrane topology and c-ring assembly[5].
- **Single-cell Expression:** Human Protein Atlas data (2023) shows ATP5MC2 is expressed across diverse cell types, with low cell-type specificity, supporting its fundamental role in cellular metabolism[5].
- **Pathway Integration:** Recent pathway analyses highlight ATP5MC2’s involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and electron transport chain regulation[1].

---

### 9. Expert Opinions and Analysis

- **Essentiality:** Experts consider ATP5MC2 indispensable for ATP production in eukaryotic cells, with its dysfunction leading to severe metabolic consequences[1][7].
- **Redundancy:** Three human genes encode subunit c precursors (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3), all producing identical mature proteins, suggesting evolutionary redundancy for this critical function[1][3].

---

### 10. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Gene Location:** Chromosome 12 (human)[3].
- **Protein Length:** 75 amino acids (Q06055-1 isoform)[7].
- **Expression:** Detected in all major tissues; highest in energy-demanding organs[5].
