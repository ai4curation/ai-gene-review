## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O15126
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1; Short=Secretory carrier membrane protein 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SCAMP1; Synonyms=SCAMP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SCAMP family. .
- **Key Domains:** SCAMP. (IPR007273); SCAMP (PF04144)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SCAMP1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SCAMP1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SCAMP1** (gene ID: SCAMP1, UniProt: O15126) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and scope
We verified the target as human SCAMP1 (UniProt O15126): a tetraspanning integral membrane protein of the SCAMP family with cytosolic N- and C-termini, conserved four-pass membrane core, and N‑terminal cytosolic motifs including NPF repeats and proline-rich segments, consistent with foundational structural/topology studies of SCAMPs (URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; published Sep 2000) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2). We then synthesized functional, mechanistic, and disease-linked evidence with emphasis on precise roles in trafficking and recent findings where available, noting that SCAMP1-specific primary literature in 2023–2024 is limited in the retrieved evidence.

Key concepts and definitions
• Protein family and domains: SCAMPs are evolutionarily conserved secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins; mammalian genomes encode five isoforms (SCAMP1–5). SCAMPs share a central four-transmembrane “core,” minimal luminal loops, and cytosolic N- and C-termini. SCAMP1 (like SCAMP2/3) possesses N‑terminal NPF motifs (EH-binding) and proline-rich segments; an internal amphipathic “E peptide” between TM2–TM3 is conserved and membrane-active. Limited proteolysis and biophysical studies mapped these features and showed both termini are cytosolic (URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2). A family synopsis further highlights NPF–EH interactions (Eps15/intersectin) and E‑peptide function (URL: n/a; 2012) (stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36).
• Cellular localization: SCAMPs concentrate in endomembrane systems that recycle between plasma membrane and internal compartments (early/recycling endosomes, trans‑Golgi network, secretory granules). Live-cell imaging localized GFP‑SCAMP1 to motile early/recycling endosomes with limited constitutive surface exchange (URL: https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.02503; Aug 2005) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2).

Primary functions and mechanisms
• Exocytosis and fusion pore regulation: Overexpression of the SCAMP “E peptide” inhibits dense-core granule release, and SCAMP1 knockout studies indicate altered fusion dynamics with increased transient fusion events, consistent with a role in stabilizing the fusion pore and coordinating compensatory endocytosis after exocytosis (URL: n/a; 2012 review synopsis) (stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36).
• Endocytosis and recycling: SCAMP1 participates in recycling pathways rather than initial clathrin-coated vesicle formation. SCAMP1/2 localize to recycling endosomes, where NPF motifs recruit EH-domain proteins (Eps15/intersectin), facilitating cargo sorting and endosome-to-plasma-membrane traffic. Family-level mechanisms implicate ARF6-regulated steps in endosomal recycling and surface delivery; SCAMP2 has direct ARF6 links and promotes vesicle formation, providing a pathway context applicable to SCAMP1-bearing recycling carriers (URL: https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0071692; Jan 2011) (diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134). Broad endocytosis frameworks place SCAMPs among adaptors/effectors that organize internalization–recycling circuits underlying signaling spatial restriction (URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molonc.2009.05.008; Aug 2009) (diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134, hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2).
• Lipid interactions: The conserved amphipathic segments in SCAMPs (including SCAMP1) bind phospholipid membranes; the inter-TM2/3 segment forms an α-helix on membranes. Electrostatic interactions between SCAMP1/2 cytosolic peptides and PI(4,5)P2 have been reported in family-level analyses, consistent with localization to PI(4,5)P2-rich recycling domains (URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000; and oncology integrative study referencing PI(4,5)P2–E‑peptide interactions, Jan 2021) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 6-10).
• Interaction motifs and partners: SCAMP1 contains multiple NPF motifs in its N‑terminus that bind EH-domain proteins (Eps15, intersectin), linking SCAMP1 to clathrin-associated endocytic scaffolds and to coupling of exo–endocytosis cycles (URL: n/a; 2012) (stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36).

Pathway-level context and signaling/trafficking links
• ARF6–recycling axis: SCAMP family actions in recycling endosomes intersect with ARF6-dependent pathways that control endosome-to-surface traffic and receptor/cargo recycling. Demonstrated mechanistically for SCAMP2 and NHE5 trafficking, this likely delineates the trafficking context for SCAMP1-containing carriers given their co-compartmentalization and shared NPF/EH machinery (URL: https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0071692; Jan 2011) (diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134).
• EGFR and endocytic signaling context: SCAMPs modulate receptor fate by shaping recycling compartments. Family literature indicates that SCAMP-dependent recycling influences signaling outputs (e.g., EGFR), aligning with broader models where endocytosis/recycling define spatial signaling gradients (URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molonc.2009.05.008; Aug 2009; foundational SCAMP family/topology work, Sep 2000) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134).

Current applications, disease associations, and real-world implementations
• Viral infection—HBV restriction factor: Multi‑omics profiling of endocytosis upon HBV infection identified SCAMP1 as differentially regulated at transcriptome, proteome, and ubiquitylome levels. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed SCAMP1 overexpression suppresses HBV RNAs/pgRNA and secreted HBsAg/HBeAg, whereas SCAMP1 knockdown increases viral production. Mechanistically, SCAMP1 inhibits HBV EnhI/Xp, SP1, and SP2 promoter activities and can interact with viral proteins (L and X) in co‑IP assays, suggesting transcriptional suppression and/or trafficking-associated antiviral mechanisms (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042211; Feb 2022) (yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 1-2, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 10-14, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 19-20). These findings propose SCAMP1 as a host restriction factor and a potential target/modulator in HBV research contexts.
• Cancer—pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD): Transcriptomic and clinical analyses show SCAMP1 upregulated in PAAD versus normal tissue, with higher SCAMP1 expression associated with worse overall survival; SCAMP1 emerged as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses in that cohort study (URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202377; Jan 2021) (mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 6-10, mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 14-15). Related literature points to SCAMP1’s involvement in invasion/migration phenotypes across cancers, consistent with its trafficking role (mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 14-15).

Relevant statistics and data
• HBV multi-omics study (HepG2/HepG2.2.15): quantified 273 endocytosis-associated genes (RNA-seq), 190 proteins (proteomics), and 221 ubiquitinated lysines across 77 proteins (ubiquitylome); SCAMP1 was differentially expressed across all three layers. Functional assays reported reductions in HBV secreted proteins upon SCAMP1 overexpression and increases upon knockdown; promoter luciferase assays showed significant inhibition of EnhI/Xp, SP1, SP2 by SCAMP1 (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042211; Feb 2022) (yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 1-2, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 10-14, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 19-20).
• PAAD clinical association: SCAMP1 overexpression in tumor vs. normal and association with poorer overall survival are reported; SCAMP1 and SCAMP5 were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analyses (URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202377; Jan 2021) (mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 6-10).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
• Structural/topological consensus: The 2000 MBoC study provides definitive topology and domain organization for SCAMPs, establishing cytosolic orientation of termini, four TM core, and membrane-active amphipathic elements—features foundational to SCAMP1 mechanism in trafficking and exo–endocytic coupling (URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2).
• Mechanistic consensus: Family synopses emphasize NPF–EH interactions (Eps15/intersectin) as a recurrent mechanism coupling SCAMPs to endocytic/recycling scaffolds and identify the E peptide as a functional regulator of exocytosis and fusion pore dynamics; SCAMP1 knockout phenotypes point to pore stabilization and compensatory endocytosis coupling (URL: n/a; 2012 synopsis) (stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36). Together these support a model in which SCAMP1 acts as trafficking machinery rather than itinerant cargo.

Recent developments (2023–2024) and limitations
• In the evidence retrieved here, SCAMP1-specific primary articles from 2023–2024 were limited. Broad 2024 reviews of lipid modifications and contemporary organelle proteomics support the importance of membrane-embedded adaptors in trafficking but do not provide SCAMP1-specific new mechanisms in this corpus. As such, the most recent SCAMP1-focused functional advances we can cite from the present evidence are the 2022 HBV restriction study and 2021 oncology analyses (yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 1-2, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 10-14, mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 6-10). Additional targeted searching may uncover 2023–2024 SCAMP1-focused mechanistic studies beyond this dataset.

Synthesis—functional annotation for SCAMP1 (human)
• Molecular role: SCAMP1 is a membrane-embedded trafficking factor concentrated in recycling endosomes, trans‑Golgi–derived carriers, and secretory granules. It helps coordinate exocytosis with compensatory endocytosis and supports endosome-to-plasma-membrane recycling. Mechanistically, its N‑terminal NPF motifs recruit EH‑domain scaffolds (Eps15/intersectin), and its conserved amphipathic segments interact with phospholipids (likely PI(4,5)P2‑enriched membranes), aligning SCAMP1 with ARF6‑regulated recycling pathways. Functionally, SCAMP1 contributes to fusion pore stabilization and vesicle cycling, with disease-relevant consequences for receptor signaling and pathogen interactions (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000; https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0071692; Jan 2011) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134, stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36).
• Pathways: SCAMP1 operates in endocytosis/recycling circuits that control plasma-membrane composition and signaling outputs (e.g., EGFR context) and participates in ARF6‑linked recycling from early/recycling endosomes to surface (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000; https://doi.org/10.14288/1.0071692; Jan 2011) (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, diering2011exploringthephysiological pages 130-134).
• Disease/applications: SCAMP1 acts as an HBV host restriction factor by suppressing viral promoter activity and reducing virion components; it is also upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and associates with worse survival, nominating SCAMP1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker and a trafficking node influencing tumor biology (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042211; Feb 2022; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202377; Jan 2021) (yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 1-2, yousaf2022multiomicsanalysisof pages 10-14, mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 6-10, mao2021expressionandprognostic pages 14-15).

Mandatory verification check
• Gene/protein match: SCAMP1 gene symbol and description match UniProt O15126 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1). The organism is Homo sapiens. Family/domain features (SCAMP family; four TMs; cytosolic termini; N‑terminal NPF motifs; amphipathic E peptide) are consistent across cited literature (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, stevens2012geneticanalysisof pages 31-36).

Limitations and next steps
The present evidence corpus contained limited SCAMP1-specific 2023–2024 primary studies. For a forward-looking update, targeted searches of proteomics interactomes, receptor trafficking datasets, and disease-focused cohorts from 2023–2024 may reveal additional mechanistic or translational insights not covered here. Nonetheless, the structural/functional foundation and the 2021–2022 disease studies provide a robust, well-supported functional annotation for human SCAMP1.
