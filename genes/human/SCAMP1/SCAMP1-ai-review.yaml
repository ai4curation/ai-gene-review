description: SCAMP1 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1) is a tetraspanning integral membrane
  protein that functions as a trafficking factor in post-Golgi recycling pathways. The protein contains
  four transmembrane domains with both N- and C-termini exposed to the cytoplasm, N-terminal NPF motifs
  that bind EH-domain proteins (such as Eps15 and intersectin), and a conserved amphipathic E peptide
  between TM2-TM3 that interacts with membranes. SCAMP1 localizes primarily to the trans-Golgi network
  and recycling endosomes, where it participates in shuttling cargo proteins (such as the Na+/H+ exchanger
  NHE7) between these compartments and the plasma membrane. SCAMP1 is involved in coupling exocytosis
  with compensatory endocytosis and may contribute to fusion pore stabilization during regulated secretion.
  The protein interacts with multiple trafficking-associated proteins and has been implicated in neutrophil
  degranulation pathways.

    label: exocytosis
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for exocytosis is well-supported by the role of SCAMPs in regulated secretion
      pathways. Studies have shown that SCAMP proteins, including SCAMP1, participate in dense-core granule
      release and fusion pore dynamics. SCAMP1 localizes to secretory granules and participates in post-Golgi
      vesicle-mediated transport, contributing to exocytotic processes. Deep research (SCAMP1-deep-research-falcon.md)
      cites family-level evidence for SCAMP involvement in exocytosis and fusion pore regulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is consistent with experimental evidence showing SCAMP family involvement
      in exocytosis. The phylogenetic inference is supported by the conserved role of SCAMPs in vesicular
      transport and the conservation of the E peptide domain implicated in fusion pore dynamics. This
      represents a core function of the SCAMP family.

    supporting_text: NPF motifs recruit EH-domain proteins (Eps15/intersectin), and E peptide is conserved and membrane-active
core_functions:
- description: SCAMP1 functions as a trafficking factor that mediates transport of cargo proteins from
    the trans-Golgi network to other cellular destinations including the plasma membrane and recycling
    endosomes. The protein contains NPF motifs that specifically bind EH domains in endocytic scaffold
    proteins, and interacts with cargo proteins like NHE7 through its conserved TM2-TM3 cytoplasmic loop.
    This is supported by experimental evidence showing SCAMP1 regulates trafficking of NHE7 between TGN
    and recycling vesicles (PMID:15840657) and the original characterization of SCAMPs as secretory
    carrier-associated membrane proteins involved in post-Golgi recycling pathways (PMID:9378760).

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise mechanism by which SCAMP1 stabilizes fusion pores during exocytosis, and
    does this involve its amphipathic E peptide?
- question: Does SCAMP1 have cargo specificity, or does it function as a general trafficking factor for
    post-Golgi recycling?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Live-cell imaging of SCAMP1 dynamics during regulated secretion in neuroendocrine cells
    to characterize its role in exocytosis and compensatory endocytosis. Would clarify the temporal relationship
    between SCAMP1 localization and fusion pore dynamics.
- description: Proximity labeling (BioID/APEX) of SCAMP1 to comprehensively identify cargo proteins and
    trafficking machinery that co-localize with SCAMP1 carriers. Would expand understanding of SCAMP1
    cargo specificity and interaction partners beyond NHE7 and CFTR.
