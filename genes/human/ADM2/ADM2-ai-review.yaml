description: >-
  ADM2 (Adrenomedullin-2/Intermedin) encodes a secreted peptide hormone of the
  calcitonin/CGRP superfamily. The 148 amino acid prepro-protein is proteolytically
  processed to generate bioactive C-terminal peptides including IMD1-53, IMD1-47, and
  IMD8-47. ADM2 functions as a ligand for CALCRL/RAMP receptor complexes (AM1, AM2,
  and CGRP receptors), where RAMP identity determines receptor affinity and signaling
  bias. Canonical signaling is via Gs-coupled adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway, with
  additional engagement of Gq/Ca2+, ERK, and NOS/NO pathways. ADM2 acts as a potent
  vasodilator regulating systemic blood pressure, promotes angiogenesis, protects
  endothelial barrier integrity, and has roles in cardiovascular and renal homeostasis.
  It functions primarily in autocrine/paracrine mode with low basal plasma levels.

  - description: >-
      ADM2 is fundamentally a peptide hormone. It is synthesized as a prepropeptide,
      proteolytically processed to bioactive fragments, secreted, and acts on target
      cells through cell surface receptors. This is supported by IBA, IEA, and IDA
      evidence including cryo-EM structures showing ADM2 bound to receptor complexes.
