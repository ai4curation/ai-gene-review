## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P22301
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-10; Short=IL-10; AltName: Full=Cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor; Short=CSIF; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL10;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IL-10 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 4_helix_cytokine-like_core. (IPR009079); IL-10. (IPR000098); IL-10/19/20/24/26. (IPR020443); IL-10_CS. (IPR020423); IL10 (PF00726)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL10" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL10' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL10** (gene ID: IL10, UniProt: P22301) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human IL10 (UniProt P22301)

Identity verification and core definition
- Target match: The gene symbol IL10 encodes human interleukin-10, a soluble, secreted immunomodulatory cytokine also known as cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, produced by multiple leukocyte subsets; this aligns with the UniProt P22301 description and the IL-10 family identity (class-II, four-helix bundle cytokine family) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3, salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2).
- Molecular form: Biologically active IL-10 is a ~36 kDa homodimer stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds; it signals via a heterotetrameric receptor, confirming the family/domain expectations for IL-10-like cytokines (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).

Structure, receptor, and signaling
- Receptor architecture: IL-10 binds a heterotetrameric IL-10 receptor composed of two IL-10RA (IL-10R1; ligand-binding) and two IL-10RB (IL-10R2; shared signal-transducing) chains, predominantly on hematopoietic cells (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3, salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2).
- Proximal signaling: Receptor subunits associate with JAK1 (IL-10RA) and TYK2 (IL-10RB). Ligand engagement activates JAK1/TYK2, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation, STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcription of anti-inflammatory genes (e.g., SOCS3, IL1RN) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2, carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).
- Additional context: The canonical IL-10/STAT3 anti-inflammatory response is a central homeostatic module in macrophages and other myeloid cells; genomic studies map STAT3 target genes downstream of IL-10 and highlight pathway-level regulation (https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elt028, Aug 2013) (hutchins2013theil10stat3mediatedantiinflammatory pages 1-1).

Expression, cellular sources, and localization
- Cellular sources: Initially described as Th2-derived, IL-10 is now known to be produced by diverse myeloid and lymphoid populations, including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4+ T-cell subsets, FOXP3+ Tregs, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, B cells, and neutrophils; certain tumors may also produce IL-10 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2, carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).
- Localization: IL-10 is synthesized as a secreted cytokine and executes its function extracellularly by engaging cell-surface IL-10R on responsive target cells (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).

Primary functions and pathway role
- Principal role: IL-10 is a master anti-inflammatory cytokine that limits duration/intensity of innate and adaptive responses. In myeloid cells it suppresses inflammatory gene programs downstream of TLRs and cytokines, largely via STAT3-dependent induction of negative regulators (e.g., SOCS3) and transcriptional reprogramming (https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elt028, Aug 2013; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (hutchins2013theil10stat3mediatedantiinflammatory pages 1-1, carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).
- Context-dependent immunostimulation: In tumors, IL-10 can directly activate resident or exhausted CD8+ T cells (including STAT1/STAT3 signaling), augment cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production, and synergize with checkpoint blockade—illustrating concentration- and context-dependent pleiotropy within the same receptor pathway (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Cancer immunotherapy translation: A 2023 expert review synthesizes bench-to-bedside progress with pegylated IL-10 (pegilodecakin), noting early signals (e.g., in RCC) but mixed outcomes overall, and motivates engineered IL-10 variants and tumor-targeted delivery to enhance antitumor CD8+ responses while limiting systemic immunosuppression (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2).
- Engineered IL-10 concepts: Recent preclinical work describes IL-10 fusions (e.g., Fc/antibody fusions, bispecifics) and variants with altered IL-10Rβ engagement to bias T-cell–stimulatory outputs and improve pharmacokinetics; these are entering early clinical testing, though clinical efficacy and toxicity need validation (source summarizes preclinical/early clinical directions; interpret with caution and cross-checking) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17061012, Mar 2025) (elshemi2025il10directedcancerimmunotherapy pages 7-8, elshemi2025il10directedcancerimmunotherapy pages 12-14).
- Epigenetic and metabolic control of the IL-10 anti-inflammatory response: Systems-level analyses emphasize IL-10/STAT3 as a core anti-inflammatory transcriptional module in macrophages and outline genome-wide STAT3 targeting; newer work (beyond the core sources here) is actively dissecting epigenetic mechanisms and metabolic reprogramming that sharpen IL-10 responsiveness in myeloid cells (foundational summary) (https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elt028, Aug 2013) (hutchins2013theil10stat3mediatedantiinflammatory pages 1-1).
- Infectious disease and COVID-19 context: Elevated circulating IL-10 correlates with severity and mortality in acute and post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring its use as a biomarker of dysregulated immunity (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).

Current applications and clinical/real-world implementations
- Oncology: Pegilodecakin advanced to multiple trials; reviews describe its capacity to expand intratumoral CD8+ T cells and potential synergy with ICIs, with subsequent mixed clinical outcomes and toxicity concerns; next-generation, targeted IL-10 constructs are in early clinical development to improve the therapeutic index (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17061012, Mar 2025) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2, elshemi2025il10directedcancerimmunotherapy pages 12-14).
- Inborn errors of IL-10 signaling and VEO-IBD: Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in IL10 or IL10R cause severe, very early-onset enterocolitis; this human genetic evidence establishes the nonredundant role of IL-10 in intestinal immune homeostasis and informs definitive therapies (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in IL-10R deficiency—not detailed quantitatively in the sources below) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121, Dec 2024) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 5-7).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Trends in Cancer (2023) frames IL-10 as a nuanced immunotherapy target whose dual myeloid-suppressive and CD8+-stimulatory activities can be exploited with engineered pharmacology and optimized delivery; it emphasizes STAT3-centric signaling via JAK1/TYK2 and context dependence (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2, salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 9-10).
- Frontiers in Immunology (2023) provides a broad, clinically oriented overview of IL-10’s roles in homeostasis, cancer, and infection, detailing molecular identity, receptor composition, and downstream STAT3 signaling and highlighting IL-10 as a biomarker of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).
- Briefings in Functional Genomics (2013) provides foundational mechanistic analysis of the IL-10/STAT3 anti-inflammatory response in macrophages, mapping STAT3 genomic targets and co-factors; it remains a core conceptual reference for pathway-level understanding (https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elt028, Aug 2013) (hutchins2013theil10stat3mediatedantiinflammatory pages 1-1).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data (from recent sources)
- Molecular weight and oligomeric state: Active IL-10 is a soluble ~36 kDa homodimer (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).
- Receptor stoichiometry: Signaling requires a heterotetrameric assembly of 2× IL-10RA and 2× IL-10RB subunits with JAK1/TYK2 coupling, leading to STAT3 activation (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3, salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2).
- Clinical correlation: Elevated IL-10 associates with worse outcomes in acute/post-acute COVID-19 cohorts (qualitative correlation emphasized in review; specific effect sizes vary by study and are not detailed in the cited summary) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3).

Notes on evidence limits (to maintain rigor)
- Some 2025 preclinical/clinical engineering reports summarized above are secondary and flagged as lower-quality; they are included to illustrate directions but should be cross-validated with primary data as it becomes available (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17061012, Mar 2025) (elshemi2025il10directedcancerimmunotherapy pages 12-14, elshemi2025il10directedcancerimmunotherapy pages 7-8).
- Quantitative outcomes for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in IL-10R deficiency, detailed epigenetic mechanisms of IL-10-mediated repression, and large randomized clinical trial metrics for pegilodecakin are not contained within the high-priority 2023–2024 sources retrieved here; these topics warrant targeted review of primary literature.

Conclusion
Human IL10 (P22301) encodes the canonical IL-10 cytokine, a secreted homodimer that signals through IL-10RA/IL-10RB to activate JAK1/TYK2 and STAT3, establishing a central anti-inflammatory program while exerting context-dependent immunostimulatory effects on CD8+ T cells. 2023 analyses emphasize IL-10’s duality and the need for engineered delivery and receptor engagement to harness anti-tumor benefits without systemic immunosuppression. Human genetics definitively place IL-10 signaling as essential for intestinal immune tolerance, explaining monogenic VEO-IBD when defective and motivating curative strategies. As translational efforts advance, precise control of IL-10’s pleiotropy via structure-guided engineering and targeted delivery remains the key frontier (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1161067, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trecan.2023.05.003, Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elt028, Aug 2013) (carlini2023themultifacetednature pages 2-3, salkeni2023interleukin10incancer pages 1-2, hutchins2013theil10stat3mediatedantiinflammatory pages 1-1).
