description: IL-10 (Interleukin-10, also known as Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor/CSIF) is the prototypical
  anti-inflammatory cytokine and founding member of the IL-10 family. It is a secreted homodimeric four-helix-bundle
  cytokine (~36 kDa dimer) that signals through a heterotetrameric receptor complex comprising two IL-10RA
  (ligand-binding) and two IL-10RB (signal-transducing) chains. Receptor engagement activates JAK1 (via
  IL-10RA) and TYK2 (via IL-10RB), leading to STAT3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation,
  and transcription of anti-inflammatory target genes (e.g., SOCS3, IL1RN). IL-10 is produced by multiple
  immune cell types including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Treg),
  B cells, and NK cells. Its principal function is to suppress inflammatory responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production (TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12) in monocytes/macrophages, downregulating MHC class
  II expression and co-stimulatory molecules, and limiting T cell activation. IL-10 also has immunostimulatory
  effects on B cells (promoting proliferation, differentiation, and immunoglobulin production) and CD8+
  T cells in certain contexts. Loss-of-function mutations in IL10 or IL10R cause very-early-onset inflammatory
  bowel disease (VEO-IBD), establishing IL-10 signaling as essential for intestinal immune homeostasis.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for immune response. IL-10 is a central immunomodulatory cytokine involved
      in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The phylogenetic inference is well-supported by extensive
      literature on IL-10 across vertebrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IL-10 is definitively involved in immune response; this is one of its most fundamental roles.
      The IBA annotation is well-supported by conserved function across vertebrate IL-10 orthologs and
      extensive experimental evidence in human, mouse, rat, and zebrafish (PMID:1940799, deep research
      review).

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for cytokine activity. IL-10 is a prototypical cytokine that signals through
      the IL-10 receptor complex to activate JAK-STAT signaling.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytokine activity is the core molecular function of IL-10. It is the founding member of the
      IL-10 cytokine family and signals through its receptor complex to mediate its biological effects.
      This is well-established across all orthologs (PMID:1940799, UniProt P22301).

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for extracellular space localization. IL-10 is a secreted cytokine that functions
      in the extracellular space by binding cell-surface receptors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IL-10 contains a signal peptide (residues 1-18) and is secreted. It functions as a soluble
      homodimer in the extracellular space where it engages the IL-10R complex on target cells (UniProt
      P22301, deep research review).

      to activate STAT3 phosphorylation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core aspect of IL-10 signaling. Binding to IL-10RA/IL-10RB activates JAK1 and TYK2,
      leading to STAT3 phosphorylation, which is the canonical downstream signaling pathway (PMID:16982608,

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the single most characteristic function of IL-10. It suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine
      production, downregulates MHC class II, and limits inflammatory responses. Conserved across vertebrate

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of IL-10. It was originally named Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor

      This is a non-immune pleiotropic effect.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While IL-10 has been reported to have effects on endothelial cells, this is a downstream pleiotropic

  review:
    summary: IEA transfer from mouse Il10 (P18893). IL-10 modulates wound healing by regulating inflammatory
      responses.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IL-10 does modulate wound healing through its anti-inflammatory properties, which is an extension
      of its core immune regulatory function. Keep as non-core since it is a contextual application of
      the core function.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation from PMID:7749983. This paper is about OX40L (TNFSF4), not about IL-10,
      so the reference is misattributed. However, IL-10 signaling through STAT3 does activate transcription
      of target genes, so the annotation itself is not wrong -- it is just a very broad term. Consistent
      with the IEA annotation for the same term which is marked KEEP_AS_NON_CORE.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The reference PMID:7749983 is misattributed (it describes OX40L cross-linking on murine B
      cells, not IL-10). Nevertheless, IL-10 does positively regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II
      via STAT3 signaling (PMID:16982608), so the annotation is biologically correct though overly broad.
      This is consistent with the IEA annotation for the same GO term. Kept as non-core because the term
      does not capture IL-10's specific function.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation for positive regulation of transcription from PMID:17875732. This paper
      showed that tumor Treg cells enable macrophages to produce IL-10 and IL-6, and that tumor macrophages
      stimulate B7-H4 expression in an autocrine manner through IL-10 and IL-6. IL-10 thus indirectly
      promotes transcription of B7-H4 in this tumor microenvironment context.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: PMID:17875732 demonstrates that IL-10 (produced by Treg-stimulated macrophages) stimulates
      B7-H4 expression on macrophages in ovarian carcinoma, which constitutes positive regulation of
      transcription. This is consistent with IL-10's known ability to activate STAT3-dependent gene
      transcription and with the IDA annotation for the same term (GO:0045893) from PMID:16606666, which
      is also marked KEEP_AS_NON_CORE. The transcriptional regulation is a downstream consequence of

  review:
    summary: TAS for negative regulation of MHC class II biosynthesis from PMID:11244051.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IL-10 downregulation of MHC class II expression is a core function, also supported by IDA
      from PMID:1940799 (PMID:11244051, PMID:1940799).

  review:
    summary: IDA for T-helper 1 cell differentiation from PMID:33737461 (ComplexPortal). IL-10 can influence
      Th1/Th2 balance.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IL-10 can influence T helper cell differentiation, particularly by suppressing Th1 differentiation
      through inhibition of IL-12 and IFN-gamma production. The annotation says Th1 differentiation, not
      inhibition of it, so the qualifier from the GOA should be checked. Keep as non-core.

    summary: IGI for positive regulation of immunoglobulin production from PMID:22962438, with genetic
      interaction with IL-6 (P60568).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IL-10 promotes immunoglobulin production by B cells, often in synergy with other cytokines
      like IL-6. This is consistent with IL-10's B cell-stimulatory functions. Keep as non-core.

  title: Human interleukin-10 can directly inhibit T-cell growth
  findings:
  - statement: IL-10 directly inhibits T cell growth (55.4% inhibition with anti-CD3).
    supporting_text: Highly purified peripheral blood T cells containing less than 0.1% CD14+ cells and
      unresponsive to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), were growth-inhibited by IL-10 when stimulated with immobilized
      OKT3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb; 55.4% inhibition).
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: Effect is independent of monocytes.

  title: The apoptosis and proliferation of SAC-activated B cells by IL-10 are associated with changes
    in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 expression
  findings:
  - statement: IL-10 has dual effects on B cells depending on activation state -- apoptosis at initiation
      versus proliferation after pre-activation.
    supporting_text: the addition of IL-10 at the initiation of activation down-regulated Bcl-xL, Bcl-2,
      and Mcl-1 expression. At the same time, B cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptotic cell number
      increased, suggesting the growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B cells.
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: In contrast, IL-10 supported proliferation and differentiation of pre-activated B cells.
    supporting_text: In contrast, IL-10 failed to down-regulate the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression but rather
      augmented the expression of Mcl-1 of B cells after preactivation for 48 hr with SAC and IL-2
