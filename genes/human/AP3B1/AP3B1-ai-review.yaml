description: >-
  AP3B1 encodes the beta-3A subunit (beta3A-adaptin) of the heterotetrameric AP-3 adaptor complex,
  which is a ubiquitously expressed coat protein complex that mediates protein sorting from the
  trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (LROs).
  The AP-3 complex consists of four subunits (beta, delta, mu, sigma) and functions as a clathrin
  adaptor, recognizing dileucine and tyrosine-based sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of
  cargo proteins. AP3B1 is essential for AP-3 complex assembly and membrane recruitment. The
  complex is required for proper trafficking of proteins to melanosomes, platelet dense granules,
  and lysosomes. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in AP3B1 cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
  type 2 (HPS-2), characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, platelet storage pool deficiency
  with bleeding diathesis, and immunodeficiency with neutropenia and recurrent infections.

      AP3B1, as the beta subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, is directly involved in vesicle-mediated
      transport. AP-3 mediates the sorting and trafficking of cargo proteins from the TGN and endosomes

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      AP3B1 is the beta-3A subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-3 adaptor complex. This is
      the defining structural role - without AP3B1, the AP-3 complex cannot assemble or
      function properly.

  - description: >-
      AP-3 recognizes cargo proteins with dileucine or tyrosine-based sorting signals and
      loads them into coated vesicles for transport to lysosomes and LROs. This cargo
      selection function is essential for proper protein sorting to melanosomes and platelet
      dense granules.
