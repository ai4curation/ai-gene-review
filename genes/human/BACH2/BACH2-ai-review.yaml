description: >-
  BACH2 (BTB and CNC homolog 2) is a CNC-bZIP transcription factor that functions primarily
  as a transcriptional repressor in B and T lymphocytes. It contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ
  domain that mediates homodimerization and protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal
  bZIP domain through which it heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins (MAFF, MAFG, MAFK)
  to bind Maf recognition elements (MAREs) in DNA. In B cells, BACH2 maintains the germinal
  center program by repressing PRDM1 (Blimp-1), thereby preventing premature plasma cell
  differentiation and supporting class-switch recombination. In T cells, BACH2 stabilizes
  regulatory T cell (Treg) identity by repressing effector gene programs and promotes
  stem-like/memory CD8+ T cell fates by competing with AP-1 factors at enhancers. BACH2
  undergoes regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling controlled by PI3K-AKT-dependent
  phosphorylation at Ser-521 (promoting cytoplasmic localization) and by oxidative
  stress and SUMOylation (promoting nuclear retention). Haploinsufficiency of BACH2 causes
  BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA/IMD60), and common GWAS variants
  at the BACH2 locus are associated with multiple autoimmune diseases including type 1
  diabetes, multiple sclerosis, celiac disease, and Crohn disease.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation placing BACH2 as a regulator of RNA Pol II transcription,
      inferred from phylogenetic analysis of the CNC-bZIP family. BACH2 is a
      well-established transcriptional regulator that binds MARE elements as a
      heterodimer with small MAF proteins and modulates Pol II-dependent gene
      expression in lymphocytes (PMID:28530713, PMID:27052415).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core function of BACH2. As a bZIP transcription factor, it directly
      regulates Pol II-dependent transcription. The IBA annotation is well supported
      by the phylogenetic relationship of BACH2 to other CNC-bZIP family members
      (NRF2, BACH1, NFE2L1) that all regulate Pol II transcription. The annotation
      is at the right level of generality for an IBA inference since BACH2 can act
      as both repressor and (in some contexts) activator.

      IBA annotation for DNA-binding transcription factor activity (Pol II-specific).
      BACH2 is a bona fide sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that
      modulates Pol II transcription. It primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor,
      though it can also activate transcription in some contexts (UniProt, by similarity).
      Given BACH2's predominant repressor function, a more specific child term
      (GO:0001227, DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase
      II-specific) would be more informative, but the parent term is not wrong.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation is correct and at a reasonable level of specificity since
      the phylogenetic inference groups BACH2 with family members that can act as
      both activators and repressors. BACH2 is primarily a repressor but has been
      reported to also activate in some contexts, so the parent term
      GO:0000981 is defensible.

      Correct and well supported. PMID:27052415 is a comprehensive review of the Bach
      family of transcription factors that clearly describes BACH2 as repressing target

      Both annotations are correct for this core function of BACH2.

      Nuclear localization of BACH2 is well supported by multiple lines of evidence

      Strong experimental evidence (IDA from SELEX) directly demonstrating that

      (BRIDA/IMD60). Patients with heterozygous BACH2 variants showed impaired
      lymphocyte maturation, decreased immunoglobulin production, and autoimmunity,
      demonstrating BACH2 is essential for proper adaptive immune responses.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While BACH2 is clearly required for proper adaptive immune function (as
      demonstrated by the BRIDA phenotype), this is a very broad biological process
      term that describes the downstream consequence of BACH2's transcriptional
      repressor activity rather than its core molecular function. The primary role
      of BACH2 is as a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor; its involvement in
      adaptive immunity is a downstream effect of that core function in lymphocytes.
      Marking as non-core since the annotation is correct but represents a broad
      organismal phenotype rather than a core molecular-level function.

      BACH2 as a DNA-binding TF expected to localize to chromatin when bound to DNA.

      Correct. As a DNA-binding transcription factor, BACH2 localizes to chromatin
      where it binds MARE elements. ChIP-seq studies in lymphocytes have mapped
      BACH2 binding across the genome. The ISA inference from TFClass classification
      is sound.

    BACH2 functions primarily as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional
    repressor. It heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins (MAFK, MAFG, MAFF) via its
    bZIP domain to bind MARE elements and repress target gene transcription. In B cells,
    it represses PRDM1/Blimp-1 to maintain germinal center identity. In T cells, it
    represses effector gene programs (Prdm1, Gata3, Irf4, Gzmb) to stabilize Treg
    identity and promote memory/stem-like CD8+ T cell states. It also represses HMOX1
    in the context of oxidative stress responses.
