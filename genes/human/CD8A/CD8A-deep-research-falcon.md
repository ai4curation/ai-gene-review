## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P01732
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=T-cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha chain; AltName: Full=T-lymphocyte differentiation antigen T8/Leu-2; AltName: CD_antigen=CD8a; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CD8A; Synonyms=MAL;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** CD8_asu. (IPR015468); Ig-like_dom. (IPR007110); Ig-like_dom_sf. (IPR036179); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783); Ig_sub. (IPR003599)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CD8A" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CD8A' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CD8A** (gene ID: CD8A, UniProt: P01732) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human CD8A (UniProt P01732) — Structure, Function, Signaling, and Translational Applications

Publication and identity verification
- Target identity: CD8A encodes the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD8 alpha chain, the α subunit of the CD8 co-receptor (Homo sapiens), a type I membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular Ig-like domain, hinge/stalk, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail that binds Lck (UniProt accession P01732). A 2024 peer‑reviewed synthesis provides updated structural, mechanistic, and translational insight (Frontiers in Immunology, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1412513) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Domain architecture and sequence features:
  - Ectodomain: single Ig-like domain that engages MHC class I (MHC-I) at the α3 domain; high-resolution structures exist for human CD8αα/MHC-I complexes (historic crystallography summarized in the 2024 review) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16).
  - Hinge/stalk: flexible, O-glycosylated, influences orientation and binding; approximate domain boundaries: CD8α hinge 136–182; CD8α TM 183–203; CD8α cytoplasmic tail 204–235. CD8β hinge 139–170; CD8β TM 171–191; CD8β tail 192–210 (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
  - Cytoplasmic tail and the Lck “zinc clasp”: the membrane-proximal CxC motif of CD8α forms a Zn2+-coordinated complex with Lck, recruiting kinase activity to the TCR/CD3 complex. CD8β lacks the CxC motif but is heavily palmitoylated and promotes raft localization that enhances Lck association in the heterodimer (NMR/biophysical evidence summarized) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
- Co-receptor function:
  - CD8 binds MHC-I and stabilizes TCR•pMHC-I, lowering activation thresholds especially for lower-affinity TCRs. CD8 can be dispensable for very high-affinity TCR/pMHC (KD < ~10 µM) but is critical when affinities are weaker (KD > ~30 µM), reflecting cooperative trimolecular TCR–pMHC–CD8 interactions and 2D kinetics at the cell membrane (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).
  - CD8 recruitment of Lck promotes phosphorylation of CD3 ITAMs and activation of ZAP‑70 → LAT/SLP‑76 scaffolds → downstream effector signaling (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Structural-mechanistic updates:
  - Dynamic MHC‑I α3 conformations and peptide/emptiness-dependent states can alter CD8 affinity; hinge glycosylation and stalk geometry modulate coreceptor potency (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
  - Quantitative Lck occupancy on coreceptors remains variable across methods, but CD4 tends to show higher Lck occupancy than CD8αβ; reported ranges in the literature summarized in 2024 review include ~6.8% vs 0.6% and ~100% vs 60% (CD4 vs CD8αβ, respectively), highlighting method-dependence and emphasizing the principle that CD8 recruits Lck less saturatingly than CD4 (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10).
  - Cooperative trimolecular TCR–pMHC–CD8 interactions: two-stage, 2D kinetic models continue to explain antigen discrimination improvements conferred by CD8 (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).
- Isoform biology (CD8αα versus CD8αβ):
  - CD8αβ is the dominant TCR co-stimulator in conventional cytotoxic T cells; raft localization via CD8β palmitoylation contributes to its potency. CD8αα homodimers participate in specialized contexts (e.g., intestinal IELs, NK interactions) and can act as co-repressors in certain receptor systems; comparative functional potency estimates suggest CD8αβ can be orders of magnitude more effective as a co‑stimulator than CD8αα (review summary) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16).
- Checkpoint modulation of co-receptor cooperation:
  - PD‑1 can suppress early TCR recognition by disrupting TCR–pMHC–CD8 cooperativity, contributing mechanistically to its potent inhibitory effects on T cells (Nature Communications, May 2021; remains mechanistically relevant and cited within the 2024 review’s context; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22965-9) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- CAR-T engineering (hinge/transmembrane usage):
  - CD8α hinge and transmembrane (TM) segments are widely used to tune CAR flexibility, expression, and signaling. The 2024 synthesis notes design choices: removing hinge glycines can reduce excessive flexibility; CD8α hinge/TM may reduce activation-induced cell death compared with CD28-derived modules in some contexts. These engineering patterns are standard in second-generation CARs and are actively optimized (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10).
  - Case summaries in 2024–2025 literature (as reviewed) reflect frequent use of CD8 hinge/TM modules across diverse CAR architectures, underscoring CD8A-derived sequences as practical engineering elements (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10).
- Anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies and imaging:
  - Therapeutic and diagnostic anti-CD8 mAbs have functional diversity (blocking/neutralizing/enhancing), with potential immunotoxicity risks necessitating careful epitope/structure guidance. 2023–2024 work includes immunoPET tracers against human CD8 (e.g., 89Zr‑labeled ZED8; 18F‑labeled anti‑CD8 VHH) enabling in vivo CD8+ T-cell imaging in clinical contexts (review cites Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 2023; URLs in review) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2024 Frontiers in Immunology review provides consolidated expert consensus on:
  - CD8 as a dimeric MHC‑I co-receptor whose α-chain tail recruits Lck via a Zn2+‑dependent clasp while β-chain palmitoylation and raft partitioning enhance signaling in the heterodimer (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
  - Conditions under which CD8 is dispensable (very high TCR/pMHC affinity) versus essential (low–medium affinity), clarifying its role in modulating antigen sensitivity (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2).
  - Functional differences between CD8αα and CD8αβ, including specialized roles of CD8αα in mucosal IEL biology and potential co‑repressive interactions with other receptors (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16).
  - Translational opportunities and cautions: CD8-targeted antibodies (for modulation or imaging) and CD8-derived modules in CARs should be guided by structural/biophysical evidence to ensure specificity and safety (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Domain boundaries (human CD8 chains) from curated structural/biophysical synthesis:
  - CD8α hinge 136–182; TM 183–203; cytoplasmic tail 204–235; CD8β hinge 139–170; TM 171–191; tail 192–210 (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
- Lck occupancy variability (illustrative ranges compiled across studies):
  - Example ranges include ~6.8% vs 0.6% and ~100% vs 60% for CD4 versus CD8αβ occupancy, respectively, highlighting method-dependent estimates yet consistently indicating lower average Lck saturation by CD8 compared with CD4 (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10).
- Relative co-receptor potency and raft localization:
  - CD8αβ is reported as a much stronger co-stimulator than CD8αα (on the order of ~100× in some comparative contexts), attributed in part to CD8β-driven palmitoylation and raft recruitment, which enhances effective Lck delivery (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9).
- Affinity regimes and CD8 dependency:
  - CD8 is often dispensable below TCR/pMHC KD ~10 µM but becomes increasingly required as affinity weakens beyond ~30 µM, aligning with kinetic proofreading and cooperative trimolecular models (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).

Functional biology: where, how, and in which pathways CD8A acts
- Cellular localization and expression:
  - CD8A is expressed on αβ T cells forming CD8αβ on most cytotoxic T lymphocytes and as CD8αα on specialized T lymphocytes (e.g., subsets of intraepithelial lymphocytes) and some NK cells, consistent with its roles in cytotoxic immunity and mucosal tolerance/defense (synthesis of human studies in the 2024 review) (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16).
- Biochemical pathway role:
  - CD8A contributes the cytoplasmic tail that directly recruits Lck to TCR/CD3, enabling ITAM phosphorylation, ZAP‑70 recruitment, and LAT/SLP‑76 scaffold assembly, thereby augmenting TCR signal initiation and sensitivity to pMHC‑I (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3).
- Thymic selection and lineage decisions:
  - Historical and comparative data summarized in the 2024 review indicate CD8β’s importance for positive selection of CD8-lineage thymocytes; CD8αα participates in specialized survival/differentiation programs outside classical positive selection, including IEL biology (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16).

Translational notes and implementation guidance
- CAR design using CD8A-derived modules:
  - CD8α hinge/TM modules are common defaults in second-generation CARs; their geometry and flexibility affect synapse formation and tonic signaling. Rational tuning (e.g., hinge length, glycine content) can balance activation and prevent overactivation or AICD, as summarized in 2024 expert synthesis (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10).
- CD8-targeting biologics and imaging:
  - Anti‑CD8 mAbs demand careful epitope and functional characterization to avoid immunosuppression or hypersensitivity. CD8‑directed immunoPET agents (2023) provide real‑time imaging of CD8+ T‑cell trafficking and can aid response assessment (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).

Caveats
- Lck occupancy and isoform-specific contributions are method-dependent; reported numeric ranges should be interpreted in the context of the experimental platform and cell state. CD8’s dispensability at high TCR/pMHC affinity may vary with membrane mechanics and co‑receptor availability (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15).

Summary
Human CD8A (P01732) encodes the α chain of the CD8 co-receptor, whose extracellular Ig domain binds MHC‑I and whose cytoplasmic tail recruits Lck via a Zn2+‑dependent clasp, thereby amplifying TCR signaling. CD8αβ heterodimers are the principal co-stimulators in cytotoxic T cells, with CD8β palmitoylation promoting raft localization and efficient Lck delivery; CD8αα has specialized roles (e.g., IELs) and can be less potent or even co‑repressive in certain contexts. Recent work refines domain boundaries, highlights kinetic regimes where CD8 is essential, clarifies variability in Lck occupancy, and accelerates translational use of CD8A-derived hinge/TM motifs in CAR‑T designs as well as CD8‑targeted immunoPET imaging. These insights collectively cement CD8A’s mechanistic and translational importance in antigen recognition and immune engineering (srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 1-2, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 9-10, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 2-3, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 8-9, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 14-15, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-16, srinivasan2024structurefunctionand pages 15-15).
