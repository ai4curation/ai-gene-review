description: CD8A encodes the alpha subunit of the CD8 glycoprotein, a type I transmembrane co-receptor
  expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes that plays a central role in adaptive immunity. CD8 exists as homodimers
  (CD8aa) or heterodimers with CD8 beta (CD8ab), with heterodimers showing approximately 100-fold greater
  co-receptor activity. The extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain binds the alpha-3 domain of MHC class
  I molecules, while the cytoplasmic tail contains a zinc clasp motif (Cys215/217) that coordinates with
  Lck kinase (Cys20/23), positioning the kinase for phosphorylation of CD3 ITAMs to initiate T cell receptor
  signaling. CD8ab heterodimers localize preferentially to lipid rafts through palmitoylation, enhancing
  signal transduction. CD8 enhances T cell sensitivity to weak TCR-peptide-MHC interactions through affinity
  enhancement and catch-bond mechanics, lowering activation thresholds. Essential for positive selection
  of CD8+ thymocytes and cytotoxic T cell function.
