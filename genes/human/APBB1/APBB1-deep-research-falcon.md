## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O00213
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:581}; AltName: Full=Amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein-binding family B member 1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QXJ1}; AltName: Full=Protein Fe65 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QXJ1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=APBB1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:581}; Synonyms=FE65 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8894693}, RIR {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:581};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** APBB1/2/3. (IPR039576); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PTB/PI_dom. (IPR006020); WW_dom. (IPR001202); WW_dom_sf. (IPR036020)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "APBB1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'APBB1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **APBB1** (gene ID: APBB1, UniProt: O00213) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Identity check: APBB1 (UniProt O00213) encodes FE65, a brain-enriched adaptor protein with an N‑terminal WW domain and two C‑terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, often referred to as PTB1 and PTB2. These features and synonyms (FE65) are consistently reported in the human literature cited below, matching the user-provided UniProt entry and domain annotations. The organism is Homo sapiens (human). (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 1-3, augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)

Comprehensive research report on APBB1 (FE65)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein: APBB1 encodes FE65, a modular scaffolding/adaptor concentrated in neurons. It contains a WW domain and two PTB domains (PTB1, PTB2), enabling assembly of multimolecular complexes. (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 1-3, augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)
  • Domain organization: WW domain binds proline-rich ligands; PTB1/2 bind NPXY/YENPTY motifs; PTB2 mediates high-affinity binding to APP/AICD. (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 1-3, koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10)
- Primary molecular role: non-enzymatic scaffold/adaptor that links the APP intracellular domain (AICD) to nuclear co-regulators (e.g., Tip60/KAT5) and to trafficking and cytoskeletal regulators at membranes and synapses. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13, augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 13-14)
- Canonical complex: AICD–FE65–Tip60 (KAT5) “AFT” complex implicated in nuclear signaling/transcriptional regulation downstream of APP proteolysis. (augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 13-14)

2) Structure and domains (current understanding)
- FE65 architecture: N‑terminal WW domain; C‑terminal PTB1 and PTB2. PTB2 binds the APP YENPTY motif; WW and PTB1 contribute to other interactions and transcriptional activity. (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 1-3, koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10)
- Functional domain requirements for nuclear transactivation: WW+PTB1+PTB2 are required to stimulate APP/AICD-dependent transcription in a Gal4-based system. (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10)

3) Interactions, complexes, and pathways
- APP/AICD binding and nuclear signaling: FE65 interacts with APP via PTB2 and supports AICD-dependent transcription. FE65 forms transcriptional complexes with AICD and Tip60 (KAT5), originally described for AFT complexes; FE65 has dominant roles in APP-related nuclear signaling and can act as a transcriptional regulator/co-regulator. (augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 13-14)
- Tip60/KAT5 linkage: FE65–Tip60 interaction is part of AFT complexes; Tip60 function in these complexes and broader chromatin/DNA damage pathways is discussed in compiled reviews cited within the 2021 synthesis. (augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 13-14)
- Post-translational regulation: Multiple FE65 phosphorylation sites are documented, including Y547 (c-Abl) that modulates APP/FE65-dependent transcription and S610 (SGK1) affecting localization; broader phosphoregulation of FE65 is summarized. (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 13-16)
- Cytoskeletal and synaptic network: FE65 scaffolds actin regulators and synaptic effectors; it couples to Arf6/ELMO1/DOCK1→Rac1→cofilin/Arp2/3 to promote lamellipodia and dendritic spine plasticity; via Mena/profilin/G‑actin, it supports filopodia/spine initiation. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)
- Receptor/trafficking coupling: FE65 binds APP family members with high affinity and can link APP to ApoE receptors (e.g., LRP family), modulating trafficking and processing, implicating roles in endocytosis and receptor-dependent APP handling. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)

4) Subcellular localization and trafficking
- Localization: FE65 is enriched in neuronal growth cones and at pre- and post-synapses, consistent with roles in synaptic plasticity and actin remodeling. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)
- Membrane and nuclear pools: FE65 associates with plasma membrane/APP via PTB2 and translocates to the nucleus; nuclear localization depends on regulated intramembrane proteolysis of APP. Pharmacologic inhibition of γ‑secretase (DAPT) or α‑secretase (e.g., ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X; broad ADAM inhibitor batimastat) reduces nuclear FE65, indicating dependence on APP processing. Phosphorylation in the N-terminus restricts nuclear entry. (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10, koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 11-13)

5) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- APBB1 is a substrate of ALK: Using proximity labeling and validation in neuroblastoma cells, APBB1 was identified as a downstream molecule of receptor ALK and directly phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines, with Y269 a major target; influencing NB-1 cell viability. This expands FE65 regulation by receptor tyrosine kinases with potential oncology relevance. Journal of Biochemistry, Aug 2024; DOI: 10.1093/jb/mvae055; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvae055. (suzuki2024identificationofapbb1 pages 9-9)
- Autophagy linkage (neuronal): A 2025 study reports FE65 interacting with Beclin 1 to enhance PI3KC3‑C1 activity and PI3P production, thereby promoting autophagic nucleation; the authors propose FE65 may bridge APP to autophagy initiation and influence APP routing to autophagosomes. While 2025, it indicates a growing theme of FE65 in degradative trafficking. Biology (MDPI), Jan 2025; DOI: 10.3390/biology14010097; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology14010097. (chan2025beclin1mediatedautophagy pages 14-16, chan2025beclin1mediatedautophagy pages 1-2)
- Proteomics/AD context: Compilations highlight FE65 among proteins interacting with APP and enriched at synaptic/actin interfaces; contemporary integrative proteomics placing APP interactors in amyloid contexts has increasingly noted APBB1/Fe65, but specific 2024 plaque-proteome placement should be interpreted cautiously unless directly validated in the cited datasets. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Neuroscience/AD pathway dissection: Modulating secretase activity alters FE65 nuclear translocation and thus AFT pathway output, a commonly used experimental approach to study APP-dependent transcriptional signaling in neuronal models. PLoS ONE, Mar 2017; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173888. (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10, koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 11-13)
- Oncology signaling: The ALK→APBB1 phosphorylation axis (Y269 and others) suggests FE65 is integrated into RTK signaling in ALK-driven cancers (e.g., neuroblastoma), providing a potential mechanistic link to cell viability. Journal of Biochemistry, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvae055. (suzuki2024identificationofapbb1 pages 9-9)

7) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews synthesize FE65 as a versatile adaptor: FE65 is portrayed as a central scaffold bridging APP to transcriptional co-regulators (Tip60), to receptors regulating trafficking (LRP family), and to actin/synaptic machineries, with pleiotropic yet mechanistically traceable roles via its WW/PTB domains. Cellular and Molecular Biology Letters, Mar 2015; https://doi.org/10.1515/cmble-2015-0002. (chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 1-3, chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 3-6, chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 13-16)
- Actin/synaptic specialization: The 2021 synthesis emphasizes FE65-centred actin regulation pathways (Arf6/ELMO1/DOCK1/Rac1; Mena/profilin) underlying dendritic spine dynamics and plasticity, integrating membrane trafficking and nuclear signaling. Cells, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10071599. (augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13, augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 11-13)

8) Statistics and specific data points
- Secretase dependence: Quantitative subcellular fractionation/imaging demonstrated nuclear FE65 decreases upon γ‑secretase (DAPT) and α‑secretase (ADAM10) inhibition in SH‑SY5Y cells; deletion of PTB2 impairs membrane anchoring/nuclear translocation. PLoS ONE, Mar 21, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173888. (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10, koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 11-13)
- ALK phosphorylation mapping: In-cell and in‑vitro kinase assays identified multiple APBB1 tyrosine sites phosphorylated by ALK, with Y269 a major target; proximity-labeling identified 43 candidate interactors, with APBB1 prioritized and shown to affect NB‑1 cell viability. Journal of Biochemistry, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvae055. (suzuki2024identificationofapbb1 pages 9-9)

Functional annotation summary
- Molecular function: FE65 is a multidomain adaptor/scaffold. It binds APP/AICD (PTB2), recruits/associates with Tip60/KAT5 in AFT complexes for nuclear transcriptional signaling, and scaffolds actin regulators and trafficking receptors at membranes/synapses. It is not an enzyme or transporter; activity derives from modular protein–protein interactions and regulated localization/post‑translational modification. (augustin2021fe65ascaffoldinga pages 13-14, augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13, chow2015fe65rolesbeyond pages 13-16)
- Biological processes: APP processing–coupled nuclear signaling; regulation of gene transcription; endocytic trafficking and receptor-coupled APP processing; synaptic plasticity and actin cytoskeleton remodeling; potentially autophagy control and degradative trafficking (emerging). (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10, augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13, chan2025beclin1mediatedautophagy pages 14-16)
- Cellular localization: cytosol/plasma membrane/endosomes (via APP and receptors), synaptic compartments, and nucleus; nuclear entry depends on APP proteolysis (α/γ secretases) and FE65 domain integrity and phosphorylation state. (koistinen2017nuclearlocalizationof pages 7-10, augustin2021fe65ascaffolding pages 11-13)

Notes on scope and evidence
- Where 2023–2024 items are limited, we have emphasized the 2024 ALK–APBB1 phosphorylation study and retained foundational mechanistic studies and reviews. Some 2025 reports (autophagy) are noted as emergent but should be corroborated by additional independent studies.

Conclusion
APBB1/FE65 is a human neuronal adaptor with WW, PTB1, PTB2 domains that scaffold APP/AICD to nuclear co-regulators (Tip60/KAT5) and to membrane/cytoskeletal machineries. FE65’s nuclear localization and transcriptional effects are tightly coupled to APP proteolysis by α/γ secretases; its synaptic/membrane roles integrate actin remodeling and receptor-dependent APP trafficking. Recent work identifies FE65 as an ALK substrate (Y269 as a major site), expanding its integration with RTK signaling; emerging reports suggest FE65 may also modulate autophagy initiation via Beclin 1, highlighting ongoing diversification of FE65’s functional repertoire in neuronal homeostasis and disease mechanisms.
