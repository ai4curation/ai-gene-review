description: 'APBB1 (Fe65) is a multidomain adaptor protein that functions primarily as a scaffold linking APP (amyloid precursor protein) to nuclear signaling pathways and DNA damage responses. It contains a WW domain and two PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domains. The PTB2 domain binds the APP intracellular domain (AICD), while PTB1 interacts with transcription factors like KAT5/TIP60. Fe65 is normally tethered to the plasma membrane via APP, but under cellular stress translocates to the nucleus where it participates in DNA damage response by binding phosphorylated H2AX (Y142) and recruiting pro-apoptotic factors like JNK1. Fe65 also functions as a transcription coregulator forming complexes with AICD and Tip60 to regulate gene expression. Additionally, Fe65 promotes neurite outgrowth through activation of ARF6-Rac1 signaling upon insulin stimulation.'

    label: DNA damage response
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Fe65 plays a well-documented role in DNA damage response. Under cellular stress, Fe65 is released from APP at the plasma membrane and translocates to the nucleus where it accumulates in the nuclear matrix (PMID:18468999). Fe65 induces gammaH2AX formation and binds specifically to H2AX phosphorylated on tyrosine 142 via its PTB2 domain (PMID:19234442). This binding is critical for recruiting pro-apoptotic factors like JNK1 to sites of DNA damage.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IBA annotation is strongly supported by experimental evidence from multiple studies. PMID:18468999 showed Fe65 translocates to nucleus under stress and induces gammaH2AX formation. PMID:19234442 demonstrated direct binding of Fe65 PTB2 domain to phosphorylated H2AX Y142 and its role in the DNA damage-apoptosis signaling axis.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Fe65 is a canonical adaptor protein with WW and PTB domains that scaffolds multiple protein interactions. It adapts APP to nuclear signaling, links phosphorylated H2AX to JNK1, and connects insulin signaling to ARF6-Rac1 for neurite outgrowth.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Molecular adaptor activity is the core molecular function of Fe65. The protein contains well-characterized WW and PTB domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. PMID:36250347 explicitly describes Fe65 as a neuronal adaptor and demonstrates its adaptor function in linking insulin signaling to ARF6-Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth.

  review:
    summary: Fe65 functions as a transcription coregulator with both coactivator and corepressor activities depending on context.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Fe65 forms transcriptionally active complexes with the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and interacts with KAT5/TIP60.

  review:
    summary: Fe65 binds the intracellular domain of APP (the amyloid-beta precursor protein) via its PTB2 domain. This is a core function conserved across the Fe65 family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Binding to APP is a defining characteristic of Fe65. The PTB2 domain specifically recognizes the YENPTY motif in the APP cytoplasmic tail. Multiple structural and biochemical studies confirm this interaction (PMID:8887653, PMID:18833287). Note that Fe65 binds APP itself, not the cleaved amyloid-beta peptide, but this term captures the functional relationship to APP/amyloid biology.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Fe65 has documented chromatin binding activity (PMID:19343227 shows IDA for chromatin binding) and interacts with histone modifying enzymes (HDAC1, KAT5/TIP60). Fe65 binds phosphorylated H2AX at chromatin. The chromatin regulator UniProt keyword is justified.

    label: apoptotic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping is an over-annotation. Fe65 does not directly execute apoptosis; rather, it REGULATES apoptosis by serving as an adaptor that recruits the pro-apoptotic factor JNK1 to phosphorylated H2AX at DNA damage sites.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Fe65 is not an executioner of apoptosis but rather a regulator. The IDA annotation GO:0043065 (positive regulation of apoptotic process) from PMID:18468999 correctly captures Fe65's role. PMID:19234442 clearly demonstrates that Fe65 functions as an adaptor protein that binds phosphorylated H2AX Y142 and recruits JNK1, thereby promoting the apoptotic response - this is a regulatory role, not direct execution of apoptosis. The parent term GO:0006915 implies direct participation in the apoptotic process, which is misleading.

    label: DNA damage response
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18468999
  review:
    summary: Direct experimental evidence for Fe65 role in DNA damage response through nuclear translocation and gammaH2AX induction.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:18468999 showed Fe65 translocates to nucleus under stress and induces gammaH2AX formation. This is a core function of Fe65 with strong experimental support.
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: PMID:18468999
        supporting_text: In the nucleus, FE65 induced gammaH2AX, which plays an important role in DNA repair as a cellular response by stress-damaged cells.

    label: histone binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:19234442
  review:
    summary: Fe65 binds phosphorylated histone H2AX (Y142) via its PTB2 domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:19234442 demonstrated Fe65 binds specifically to H2AX phosphorylated on Y142. GST pull-down assays showed direct interaction between Fe65 PTB2 domain and H2AX. This is a key molecular function in the DNA damage-apoptosis signaling axis.

    label: positive regulation of apoptotic process
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18468999
  review:
    summary: Fe65 positively regulates apoptosis by acting as an adaptor that recruits pro-apoptotic factor JNK1 to phosphorylated H2AX at DNA damage sites.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the CORRECT annotation for Fe65's role in apoptosis - it REGULATES apoptosis rather than directly executing it. PMID:18468999 showed FE65 deregulated from APP induces apoptosis. PMID:19234442 demonstrated the mechanism - Fe65 binds phosphorylated H2AX Y142 and recruits JNK1, promoting apoptotic response. This is the appropriate term (not GO:0006915 apoptotic process).
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: PMID:18468999
        supporting_text: FE65 deregulated from APP induces apoptosis
      - reference_id: PMID:19234442
        supporting_text: knockdown of Fe65 strongly inhibited this interaction

    label: signal transduction
  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:8894693
  review:
    summary: Very broad annotation for signal transduction based on early Fe65 characterization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Fe65 participates in signal transduction through its adaptor function (APP signaling, insulin signaling to ARF6-Rac1). However, this term is too broad to be informative. More specific BP terms (DNA damage response, positive regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of neuron projection development) better capture Fe65's signaling roles.

    label: axonogenesis
  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:12843239
  review:
    summary: NAS annotation for axonogenesis based on Fe65 localization in growth cones.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: PMID:12843239 showed Fe65 localizes to growth cones and lamellipodia, suggesting a role in neurite growth. However, the evidence is based on localization rather than direct functional demonstration. The more specific GO:0010976 (positive regulation of neuron projection development) with IDA evidence better captures Fe65's neurite outgrowth function.
- term:
    id: GO:0030027
    label: lamellipodium
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:12843239
  review:
    summary: Fe65 localizes to lamellipodia in neuronal growth cones.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:12843239 demonstrated Fe65 concentrates in actin-rich lamellipodia within growth cones. This is consistent with its role in actin-based membrane motility and neurite extension.
- term:
    id: GO:0030426
    label: growth cone

  original_reference_id: PMID:12843239
  review:
    summary: Direct experimental evidence for Fe65 localization to neuronal growth cones.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:12843239 showed Fe65 and APP localize to growth cones both in vitro and in vivo. This is direct experimental evidence supporting growth cone localization.

    id: GO:0045202
    label: synapse
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:12843239
  review:
    summary: Fe65 localizes to synapses where it associates with APP and Rab5-containing organelles.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:12843239 demonstrated Fe65 and APP interact in nerve terminals and associate with Rab5-containing synaptic organelles. This synaptic localization supports Fe65's potential role in synapse modification.
