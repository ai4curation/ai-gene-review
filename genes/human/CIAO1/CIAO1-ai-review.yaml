description: CIAO1 (Cytosolic Iron-sulfur Assembly protein 1) is a WD40-repeat beta-propeller
  protein that serves as a core component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (CIA) targeting
  complex (CTC). CIAO1 functions together with MMS19 and CIAO2B (FAM96B) to form the
  late-acting CIA machinery that recognizes apo-client proteins and facilitates the
  transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters to cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins. CIAO1 also
  forms an alternative complex with CIAO2A (FAM96A) that specifically matures cytosolic
  aconitase/IRP1 and stabilizes IRP2 for iron homeostasis regulation. The CIAO1-CIAO2
  interface provides a client recognition surface that binds a C-terminal tripeptide
  motif (TCR motif) present on a substantial subset of CIA clients. Key clients of
  the CIA machinery include DNA replication and repair enzymes (POLD1, XPD/ERCC2,
  RTEL1), translation machinery (ABCE1), and metabolic enzymes (DPYD). Biallelic loss-of-function
  variants in CIAO1 cause Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 10 (MMDS10),
  a neuromuscular disorder characterized by proximal muscle weakness, respiratory
  insufficiency, learning difficulties, and compromised activities of nucleocytoplasmic
  Fe-S enzymes.

  review:
    summary: CIAO1 is a core component of the CIA targeting complex that mediates
      Fe-S cluster transfer to cytosolic and nuclear client proteins. The IBA annotation
      from phylogenetic inference is strongly supported by multiple human studies
      demonstrating CIAO1's essential role in Fe-S protein maturation (PMID:23891004,
      PMID:22678361, PMID:22678362, PMID:38950322).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly captures CIAO1's central role in the CIA pathway.
      Multiple primary studies confirm CIAO1 functions in iron-sulfur cluster assembly
      by facilitating cluster transfer to cytosolic-nuclear Fe-S proteins (PMID:23891004).
      Loss of CIAO1 results in compromised biogenesis of Fe-S enzymes like POLD1 and
      DPYD (PMID:38950322).

  review:
    summary: CIAO1 is part of the MMXD complex (MMS19-MIP18-XPD) which localizes to
      the mitotic spindle during mitosis and is implicated in chromosome segregation
      (PMID:20797633). However, this appears to be a secondary role related to its
      function in maturing Fe-S proteins like XPD rather than a direct role in the
      segregation machinery.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While CIAO1's involvement in chromosome segregation via the MMXD complex
      is documented (PMID:20797633), this is likely an indirect consequence of its
      role in maturing Fe-S cluster-containing proteins such as XPD that are required
      for proper chromosome segregation. The core function of CIAO1 is in Fe-S cluster
      assembly/transfer.

  review:
    summary: The original 1998 CIAO1 paper identified it as a WT1-interacting protein
      that modulates WT1 transactivation activity. However, this was before CIAO1's
      primary role in Fe-S cluster assembly was understood. The effect on transcription
      is likely indirect through Fe-S protein maturation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While CIAO1 was originally identified as interacting with WT1 and modulating
      its transcriptional activity (PMID:9556563), this is now understood as a secondary/indirect
      effect. CIAO1's primary function is in the CIA pathway for Fe-S cluster assembly.
      The transcriptional effects may relate to Fe-S cluster-dependent transcription
      factors or chromatin modifiers.

core_functions:
- description: CIAO1 is a core component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA)
    targeting complex that facilitates transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters to cytosolic
    and nuclear Fe-S proteins. Multiple independent studies confirm this role (PMID:22678361,
    PMID:22678362, PMID:23891004, PMID:23585563, PMID:38950322). Loss of CIAO1 results
    in compromised Fe-S protein maturation.
