## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O00483
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cytochrome c oxidase subunit FA4 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Complex I-MLRQ; Short=CI-MLRQ; AltName: Full=Cytochrome c oxidase subunit NDUFA4; AltName: Full=NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase MLRQ subunit;
- **Gene Information:** Name=COXFA4 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:7687}; Synonyms=NDUFA4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the complex IV COXFA4 subunit family.
- **Key Domains:** B12D. (IPR010530); B12D (PF06522)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "COXFA4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'COXFA4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **COXFA4** (gene ID: NDUFA4, UniProt: O00483) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein/gene: COXFA4 (synonym NDUFA4) encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit FA4, a small inner-membrane protein belonging to the Complex IV COXFA4 subunit family (B12D/IPR010530/PF06522 per UniProt). Functional studies established it as a bona fide subunit of Complex IV rather than Complex I, with roles in maintaining Complex IV levels/activity and participation within CIV-containing respirasomes. (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 2-4, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 1-2)
- Complex and reaction: Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) catalyzes electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to O2, pumping protons to drive ATP synthesis. NDUFA4 is not the catalytic subunit but contributes to structural integrity/efficiency of CIV. Knockdown of NDUFA4 reduces CIV abundance/activity and disrupts supercomplex organization without impairing Complex I, supporting a structural/auxiliary role. (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 2-4)
- Localization/topology: NDUFA4 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein associated with Complex IV and respirasomes. It is detergent-labile during purification, which historically led to its absence from isolated COX structures. (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6)

2) Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- In situ structural placement: High-resolution in situ cryo-EM of mammalian respiratory supercomplexes (Nature, May 2024) identified NDUFA4 density within CIV-containing assemblies (I1III2IV1/2, etc.), establishing its presence in native respirasomes and supporting models of CIV architecture and membrane organization. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07488-9 (park2026onthefeasibility pages 13-14)
- Regulation by C15ORF48/miR-147: In gut epithelium, the C15ORF48/miR-147 axis post-transcriptionally and post-translationally silences NDUFA4; miR-147-3p targets the 3′UTR while C15ORF48 protein induces proteasome-independent degradation. NDUFA4 loss reduces baseline and maximal respiration and alters innate immune signaling, linking CIV composition to immunometabolism. URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2315944121 (xiong2024theepithelialc15orf48mir147ndufa4 pages 6-7)
- Human genetics update: A 2024 case identified a homozygous ~12.9 kb deletion spanning NDUFA4 in a child with Leigh-like syndrome; patient fibroblasts showed significantly reduced CIV activity, confirming NDUFA4 loss-of-function as an ultra-rare cause of isolated CIV deficiency (MC4DN21). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15040500 (misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 1-2, misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 4-7)

3) Function and pathway context
- Primary role in Complex IV: While not catalytic, NDUFA4 supports CIV function/biogenesis and supercomplex stability. RNAi knockdown specifically reduces CIV levels and activity and impairs respirasome organization; these effects are rescued by exogenous NDUFA4. This positions NDUFA4 as an accessory/structural subunit critical for full CIV function. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.015 (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 2-4, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 1-2)
- Assembly context: Recent assembly studies of human CIV implicate auxiliary assembly factors (e.g., TIM8A/TIM8B/TIM13) and place NDUFA4 within the maturation steps occurring after COX2 module formation toward mature CIV. Although not an assembly factor per se, NDUFA4 features in interaction networks of late CIV maturation. URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (park2026onthefeasibility pages 13-14)

4) Subcellular localization and membrane topology
- NDUFA4 is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and associates with CIV in respirasomes. Blue-native electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation showed co-migration and association with CIV and CI+III2+IVn supercomplexes, but not with isolated CI, and its association is sensitive to detergent (e.g., DDM >1.5%). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.015 (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 2-4)
- In situ cryo-EM provides orthogonal support, detecting NDUFA4 density in native mammalian supercomplexes in mitochondria. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07488-9 (park2026onthefeasibility pages 13-14)

5) Structural placement and stoichiometry
- Structural evidence: In situ maps assign NDUFA4 within CIV modules of supercomplexes; prior biochemical work explains its absence from some detergent-purified CIV structures due to detergent lability. Together, these establish its structural incorporation in human CIV under native conditions. (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, park2026onthefeasibility pages 13-14)

6) Regulation and dynamics
- C15ORF48/miR-147 axis: miR-147-3p directly targets NDUFA4 3′UTR; C15ORF48 protein promotes proteasome-independent degradation of NDUFA4, remodeling CIV to adjust epithelial immunometabolism. This provides a mechanistic basis for cell-state–dependent tuning of CIV composition via NDUFA4. URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2315944121 (xiong2024theepithelialc15orf48mir147ndufa4 pages 6-7)

7) Human genetics, phenotypes, and disease relevance
- Loss-of-function: Homozygous deletion of NDUFA4 causes isolated CIV deficiency with Leigh-like presentation; reduced COX activity is documented in patient fibroblasts. Diagnostic implication: include COXFA4/NDUFA4 in CIV deficiency panels and consider copy-number analysis. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15040500 (misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 1-2, misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 4-7)
- Historical link: The NDUFA4-to-CIV reassignment prompted reclassification of NDUFA4 as a candidate gene for CIV deficiencies, a view borne out by subsequent human-variant reports. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.015 (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 1-2)

8) Current applications and implementations
- Diagnostics: The 2024 case underscores the utility of WGS for detecting structural variants in NDUFA4 and supports measuring COX activity in patient fibroblasts as a functional correlate. Laboratory purification conditions should account for NDUFA4 detergent sensitivity when assaying CIV composition. (misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 1-2, misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 4-7, balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6)
- Research/therapeutic angles: The C15ORF48/miR-147–NDUFA4 axis suggests potential for modulating CIV composition and immunometabolism; genetic or pharmacologic targeting of this axis may influence epithelial inflammation and metabolic tone. URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2315944121 (xiong2024theepithelialc15orf48mir147ndufa4 pages 6-7)

9) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Detergent sensitivity: DDM concentrations above ~1.5% disrupt NDUFA4–CIV interaction in biochemical preparations, explaining prior structural absence; knockdown experiments in HeLa demonstrated reduction of CIV activity and loss of supercomplexes, and rescue by myc-NDUFA4. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.015 (balsa2012ndufa4isa pages 4-6)
- Human deletion: A single homozygous ~12.9 kb deletion (chr7p21.3; flanked by Alu elements with a 337 bp Alu-derived insertion) produced significantly reduced COX activity in fibroblasts (p = 0.005), defining NDUFA4 loss as an ultra-rare cause of MC4DN21. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15040500 (misceo2024biallelicndufa4deletion pages 4-7)
- Cellular bioenergetics: NDUFA4 knockout in epithelial models lowers baseline and maximal respiration and shifts cells toward glycolysis, supporting a role in sustaining oxidative metabolism under inflammatory cues. URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2315944121 (xiong2024theepithelialc15orf48mir147ndufa4 pages 6-7)

Expert analysis
The weight of evidence places COXFA4/NDUFA4 as an accessory/structural Complex IV subunit essential for optimal CIV activity and for maintaining respirasome architecture. The 2024 in situ structures provide native-context validation of its incorporation into CIV assemblies. Regulatory remodeling by the C15ORF48/miR-147 axis highlights physiological plasticity of CIV composition, linking NDUFA4 levels to immunometabolic outcomes in epithelia. Clinically, while NDUFA4 loss-of-function appears ultra-rare, inclusion in diagnostic gene panels and careful structural-variant analysis are warranted; functional assays of CIV in patient cells remain informative. Together, these advances refine our mechanistic and translational understanding of NDUFA4 in human mitochondria.
