description: >-
  Cytochrome c oxidase subunit FA4 (COXFA4/NDUFA4), a small (~9.4 kDa, 81 aa) nuclear-encoded
  single-pass transmembrane protein that is a structural subunit of Complex IV (cytochrome c
  oxidase) in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Originally misclassified as a Complex I
  (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) accessory subunit, NDUFA4 was reclassified as the 14th
  subunit of Complex IV by Balsa et al. (2012, PMID:22902835), based on proteomic, genetic,
  evolutionary, and biochemical analyses showing that NDUFA4 deletion does not perturb Complex I
  but instead reduces Complex IV levels and activity. This reclassification was structurally
  confirmed by Zong et al. (2018, PMID:30030519), who resolved the 3.3 Angstrom cryo-EM
  structure of intact 14-subunit human Complex IV from the supercomplex I1III2IV1, placing
  NDUFA4 at the dimeric interface of previously reported CIV crystal structures. NDUFA4 is
  detergent-labile (dissociates in >1.5% DDM), explaining its absence from earlier CIV purified
  structures. As a Complex IV subunit, it contributes to the terminal step of the electron
  transport chain -- the reduction of molecular oxygen to water using electrons from cytochrome c,
  coupled with proton pumping across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Loss-of-function mutations
  in NDUFA4 cause mitochondrial Complex IV deficiency nuclear type 21 (MC4DN21), presenting as
  Leigh-like syndrome with reduced COX activity in patient fibroblasts. The protein is regulated
  post-transcriptionally and post-translationally by the C15ORF48/miR-147 axis in gut
  epithelium, linking CIV composition to immunometabolism.

      Complex IV pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane coupled to

      (catalytic core subunits MT-CO1/2/3 perform that), but as a structural subunit
      it is required for complex integrity and optimal activity. The IEA annotation

  review:
    summary: >-
      PMID:16729965 (Lamhonwah and Tein 2006) is about OCTN1 (organic cation/carnitine
      transporter) localization to mitochondria. While this study may have incidentally
      identified NDUFA4 in mitochondrial fractions, the paper is primarily about OCTN1.
      The mitochondrial localization of NDUFA4 is well-established from other sources.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although the cited reference focuses on OCTN1, the mitochondrial localization of
      NDUFA4 is robustly supported by multiple independent lines of evidence including
      the cryo-EM structure (PMID:30030519), immunofluorescence (GO_REF:0000052), and
      proteomics (PMID:34800366). The broad mitochondrion term is valid.

  review:

      This annotation reflects the outdated classification of NDUFA4 as a Complex I
      subunit. PMID:9878551 (Loeffen et al. 1998) reported cDNA sequences for nuclear
      encoded CI subunits including NDUFA4, based on the now-incorrect assumption that
      NDUFA4 was a Complex I component. Balsa et al. (2012) subsequently demonstrated
      that NDUFA4 is not involved in the NADH-to-ubiquinone electron transport step.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Incorrect annotation based on historical misclassification. NDUFA4 is not a
      Complex I subunit and does not participate in mitochondrial electron transport
      from NADH to ubiquinone. Balsa et al. (2012) showed "Deletion of NDUFA4 does
      not perturb CI." The correct process annotation is GO:0006123 (mitochondrial
      electron transport, cytochrome c to oxygen), which is already annotated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      As a structural subunit of Complex IV, NDUFA4 contributes to cytochrome-c oxidase
      activity. Balsa et al. (2012) showed that knockdown of NDUFA4 reduces CIV activity.
      Following GO annotation conventions for complex subunits (contributes_to qualifier),
      NDUFA4 should be annotated to the molecular function of the complex it enables.
      This annotation is present in UniProt GO cross-references but is missing from the
      GOA file.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      NDUFA4 is a subunit of Complex IV whose primary molecular function is cytochrome-c
      oxidase activity (GO:0004129). Following the pattern established for other CIV
      subunits like COX5B (P10606), which is annotated to GO:0004129, NDUFA4 should
      have this molecular function annotation. Balsa et al. showed NDUFA4 knockdown
      reduces CIV activity, and mutations cause MC4DN21 with reduced COX activity.
      Note this should use the contributes_to qualifier since NDUFA4 is a structural
      subunit, not the catalytic core.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      Structural subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex IV (cytochrome c
      oxidase) required for complex maintenance and optimal cytochrome-c oxidase activity.
      NDUFA4 is a single-pass transmembrane protein that occupies the position at the
      dimeric interface of CIV crystal structures, supporting the monomeric form of
      intact 14-subunit Complex IV within respirasomes. Knockdown reduces CIV levels and
      activity; loss-of-function mutations cause isolated CIV deficiency (MC4DN21).

      stabilization, such as modulating proton pumping efficiency or electron transfer

    hypothesis: >-
      NDUFA4 modulates CIV catalytic properties beyond simply maintaining complex
