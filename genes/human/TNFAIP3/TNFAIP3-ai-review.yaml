description: >-
  TNFAIP3 (also known as A20) encodes a 790-amino acid ubiquitin-editing enzyme that serves
  as the central negative feedback regulator of NF-kB signaling. The protein has a dual enzymatic
  architecture: an N-terminal OTU (ovarian tumor) domain (aa 92-263) with cysteine-type deubiquitinase
  activity (catalytic residues Cys103, His256), and seven C-terminal A20-type zinc finger domains
  (ZnF1-7). The OTU domain removes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from key signaling adaptors
  (RIPK1, TRAF6, NEMO/IKBKG, MALT1), while ZnF4 mediates E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that adds
  K48-linked chains to target substrates (notably RIPK1) for proteasomal degradation. ZnF7 binds
  linear (M1-linked) polyubiquitin chains non-catalytically, contributing to IKK complex inhibition.
  A20 is an NF-kB-inducible gene, forming a negative feedback loop that terminates inflammatory
  signaling downstream of TNFR1, TLR2/3/4/5, NOD1/2, and CD40 receptors. It also suppresses
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation and modulates RIPK1-dependent cell death checkpoints.
  A20 functions in the cytoplasm at receptor-proximal signaling complexes, with some localization
  to the nucleus and lysosomes. It forms a complex with TAX1BP1, RNF11, and ITCH for efficient
  NF-kB termination. Heterozygous loss-of-function variants cause A20 haploinsufficiency (HA20),
  an early-onset autoinflammatory disease with Behcet-like features. Common variants at the
  TNFAIP3 locus are associated with susceptibility to SLE, RA, and IBD.

      detected in the nucleus by immunofluorescence (PMID:11463333). The IDA annotation from

  review:

      IEA based on InterPro A20-type zinc finger domain mapping to DNA binding. This is
      misleading. A20 zinc fingers bind ubiquitin, not DNA. The original A20 name "putative

      has been demonstrated. A20 functions entirely through ubiquitin editing in the cytoplasm.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Incorrect annotation. A20 zinc fingers are A20-type zinc fingers specialized for
      ubiquitin binding, not DNA binding. No experimental evidence supports DNA binding
