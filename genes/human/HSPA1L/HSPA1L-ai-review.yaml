description: >-
  HSPA1L (Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-like, also known as HSP70-Hom) is a constitutively
  expressed member of the HSP70/HSPA family of molecular chaperones. It is approximately
  90% identical in sequence to the stress-inducible HSPA1A. Unlike HSPA1A, HSPA1L is not
  induced by heat shock (PMID:1700760) and is notably enriched in testis/spermatids
  (PMID:9685725). As an ATP-dependent foldase chaperone, HSPA1L assists in protein folding
  and refolding through cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release, mediated by
  co-chaperones. It has been shown to refold heat-denatured luciferase and to suppress
  polyglutamine aggregation (PMID:21231916). HSPA1L also functions as a positive regulator
  of PRKN (Parkin) translocation to damaged mitochondria, requiring both its ATPase and
  substrate-binding domains as well as its EEVD co-chaperone interaction motif
  (PMID:24270810). The protein is located in the MHC class III region on chromosome 6.

      IBA annotation for nuclear localization of HSPA1L based on phylogenetic inference
      across HSP70 family members. Cytosolic HSP70 family members are known to undergo
      nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. While HSPA1L is constitutively expressed rather than
      stress-inducible (PMID:1700760), as an HSP70 family member it retains the same
      domain architecture as HSPA1A enabling nuclear import. The Reactome pathway
      R-HSA-5082356 includes HSPA1L in a nuclear context for HSF1-mediated gene
      expression. The IBA is well-supported phylogenetically with evidence from

      HSPA1L is a cytosolic HSP70 family member. Hageman et al. (2011) state that
      "most of the corresponding proteins are localized in the cytosol"
      (PMID:21231916). HSPA1L has direct experimental evidence (IDA) for cytosol
      localization from the same study. The cytoplasm annotation is a broader parent

      the plasma membrane, particularly in the context of immune signaling and
      antigen presentation. However, there is no direct experimental evidence for
      HSPA1L specifically at the plasma membrane. The IBA is phylogenetically derived

      Plasma membrane localization has been documented for some HSP70 family members,

      localization a peripheral rather than core aspect of its function. The
      phylogenetic inference is valid but this is not a primary localization for HSPA1L.
