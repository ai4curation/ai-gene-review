## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P34931
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-like; Short=Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1L; AltName: Full=Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-Hom; Short=HSP70-Hom; AltName: Full=Heat shock protein family A member 1L;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HSPA1L;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Heat_shock_70_CS. (IPR018181); HSP70_C_sf. (IPR029048); HSP70_peptide-bd_sf. (IPR029047); Hsp_70_fam. (IPR013126)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HSPA1L" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HSPA1L' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HSPA1L** (gene ID: HSPA1L, UniProt: P34931) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation and translational relevance of human HSPA1L (UniProt P34931)

1. Target identity verification (critical)
HSPA1L (heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1 like) is a human Hsp70-family paralog encoded in the MHC class III region on chromosome 6 and located in close genomic proximity to the inducible paralogs HSPA1A and HSPA1B (reported as within ~14 kb, reverse orientation), consistent with the UniProt entry P34931 and canonical Hsp70 architecture. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18, shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6)

2. Key concepts and current understanding
2.1 What HSPA1L is (definitions)
HSPA1L is part of the HSP70 family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that stabilize proteins against aggregation, promote folding of nascent polypeptides, and support refolding or triage (degradation) of misfolded proteins. (shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6, melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6)

2.2 Canonical Hsp70/HSPA1L mechanism: ATPase-driven chaperone cycle
Mechanistically, Hsp70 proteins comprise two principal domains: (i) an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD; ATPase domain) that binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and (ii) a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) that binds exposed hydrophobic peptide segments in client proteins. An interdomain linker and ATP-driven allostery couple nucleotide state to substrate affinity: ATP binding promotes an “open” SBD lid conformation permissive for substrate binding; ATP hydrolysis (ADP state) promotes SBD lid closure and higher client affinity; nucleotide exchange resets the cycle to favor substrate release. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6)

2.3 Co-chaperones that regulate Hsp70/HSPA1L activity
The Hsp70 cycle is regulated by co-chaperones:
• J-domain proteins (Hsp40/JDPs) stimulate ATP hydrolysis and deliver substrates.
• Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) accelerate ADP→ATP exchange to trigger client release; NEF families include BAG proteins and Hsp110-type NEFs. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6)
In neuronal heat-stress models, co-chaperones that modulate Hsp70 cycling (e.g., DNAJB1 as a J-domain protein; BAG3 and HSPH1/Hsp110 as NEF-type factors) were discussed in the context of the induced chaperone response that includes HSPA1L. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18)

2.4 Subcellular localization: what can be concluded for HSPA1L specifically
Direct subcellular fractionation/localization experiments specific to HSPA1L were not found in the retrieved 2023–2024 primary papers; thus localization must be stated cautiously. Family-level reviews emphasize that cytosolic Hsp70s can relocalize to the nucleus under acute stress, reflecting a dynamic stress response; HSPA1L is generally treated as a cytosolic Hsp70 paralog in the contexts retrieved here. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6, singh2025hsp70amultifunctional pages 2-4)

3. Gene- and protein-level functional evidence for HSPA1L
3.1 Core function as an Hsp70 chaperone (direct statements in retrieved literature)
A 2024 HSP70-family analysis explicitly attributes to HSPA1L: “stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and organelles.” (shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6)

3.2 Protein features, domains, and predicted PTM landscape (supporting annotation)
A 2024 in silico study reports HSPA1L length 641 aa and molecular weight ~70.4 kDa and provides predicted phosphorylation sites (multiple serine and threonine positions) consistent with regulatory phosphorylation being common among Hsp70 family members. These data are computational (not wet-lab validated in that study) but help frame hypotheses for regulation. (shriya2024bioinformaticsanalysisand pages 4-6)

3.3 Interaction network / pathway context (HSPA1L-centered evidence)
In a 2023 human neuron proteotoxic stress model, HSPA1L was included in a co-expression/network analysis with predicted co-expressing interactors including PRKN (Parkin) and STUB1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase/co-chaperone), linking HSPA1L to protein quality control pathways that interface with ubiquitination and mitophagy/autophagy. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 15-17)

4. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
4.1 HSPA1L in neuronal heat-induced proteotoxic stress (2023)
In heat-stressed human neuronal models (SH-SY5Y and differentiated SH-SY5Y), HSPA1L was among five Hsp70-family members reported as stress-induced. HSPA1L protein was detected only in SH-SY5Y and differentiated SH-SY5Y, with induction ~2.5–3.5-fold (higher in differentiated neurons). Temporal dynamics indicated gene expression maxima ~1 h post-stress and protein maxima ~5–6 h, aligning with an acute heat-shock response. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18)
Interpretation: these results support that HSPA1L participates in the inducible proteostasis response in at least some neuronal contexts, with potentially cell-state-dependent induction magnitude. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18)

4.2 Epitranscriptomic regulation and fibrosis context (2024): METTL3–m6A axis and HSPA1L
In corneal injury/fibrosis contexts, Hspa1l/HSPA1L expression was reported to decrease after alkali burn at later time points (days 14 and 21), and in cultured human keratocytes after TGF-β1 stimulation (noted decreases at 24 h and significant declines for HSPA1B/HSPA1L at 48 h). The authors predicted eight potential m6A sites in HSPA1L RNA. Silencing METTL3 increased HSPA1B/HSPA1L mRNA and increased HSP70 protein, partially reversing the TGF-β1-associated decreases, and was associated with reduced fibrotic markers (e.g., COL3A1, α-SMA, fibronectin) under TGF-β1 stimulation. (jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 6-9, jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 9-11)
Figure-level evidence: Figure 7 shows restoration of HSPA1L/HSPA1B mRNA levels under METTL3 knockdown plus TGF-β1, and a corresponding increase in HSP70 protein signal. (jing2024silencingmettl3increases media 26951e8d)
Interpretation: these data position HSPA1L (together with HSPA1B) as part of a stress/chaperone counter-response to profibrotic TGF-β signaling, potentially modulated through m6A-related RNA regulation. (jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 9-11, jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 6-9)

4.3 Human genetic and proteogenomic causal-inference signals (2024)
4.3.1 Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC): plasma HSPA1L as an inversely associated protein
A 2024 proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study identified HSPA1L among six plasma proteins associated with LUSC risk. In the discovery analysis, HSPA1L showed OR = 0.47 (95% CI 0.34–0.65; P = 4.89×10^-6), consistent with an inverse (protective) association; replication across multiple datasets yielded a combined OR ≈ 0.51 (95% CI 0.41–0.63; P = 5.92×10^-10). The study used pQTL instruments from UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and deCODE genetics, and LUSC GWAS summary statistics from ILCCO with replication in FinnGen and another GWAS dataset. (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 4-7, wang2024causalassociationsof pages 1-2)
Caveat: another part of the paper’s results reports an SMR/HEIDI-derived inverse estimate for HSPA1L (OR = 0.33; P = 4.73×10^-7) but notes lack of Bayesian colocalization support (PPH4 < 0.001), underscoring uncertainty about shared causal variants despite MR association. (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 7-8)

4.3.2 Ankylosing spondylitis (AS): circulating HSPA1L as an inversely associated protein with colocalization
A 2024 proteome-wide MR analysis for AS nominated HSPA1L among 18 circulating proteins of interest. HSPA1L showed a strong inverse MR association in Table 1: beta = −2.424 (SE 0.305; P = 1.76×10^-15), OR = 0.0886 (95% CI 0.0487–0.1609). Colocalization analysis provided substantial support for a shared signal at the locus (PPH4 ≈ 0.743). Phenome-wide follow-up suggested possible pleiotropy, with HSPA1L also associated with increased rheumatoid arthritis risk in their PheWAS context. (zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 5-6, zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 6-8)
Interpretation: while not a mechanistic study, this strong MR + colocalization evidence suggests that genetically predicted circulating HSPA1L levels may mark (or mediate) pathways influencing AS risk, and flags the need to resolve directionality/pleiotropy experimentally. (zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 5-6, zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 6-8)

5. Current applications and real-world implementations
5.1 Biomarker/target candidacy (inference from 2024 MR studies)
The 2024 MR studies provide a data-driven rationale for considering plasma HSPA1L as a biomarker candidate (and potential therapeutic target) in:
• LUSC risk stratification or mechanistic studies of tumor susceptibility (inverse association across cohorts). (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 4-7, wang2024causalassociationsof pages 1-2)
• Ankylosing spondylitis risk biology and biomarker discovery, supported by both MR significance and colocalization. (zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 5-6, zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 6-8)
These are not clinical-grade implementations yet: MR provides causal-inference hypotheses requiring validation in prospective cohorts and functional studies. (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 8-10)

5.2 Reproductive genetics: association with idiopathic male infertility
A case–control study in an Iranian population (308 idiopathic infertile men; 208 fertile controls) reported significant associations between HSPA1L rs2227956 and infertility. Compared to TT genotype, CT showed OR = 2.049 (95% CI 1.337–3.139; P = 0.001) and CC showed OR = 3.028 (95% CI 1.100–8.332; P = 0.032). In a dominant model (TC+CC), OR = 2.160 (95% CI 1.440–3.240; P < 0.001), and the C allele showed OR = 2.023 (95% CI 1.418–2.886; P < 0.001). (kohan2019hspa1landhspa1b pages 17-20, kohan2019hspa1landhspa1b pages 6-11)
Interpretation: these results support that germline variation in HSPA1L can associate with infertility risk in at least one cohort, consistent with HSPA1L’s reported testis-relevant expression in some contexts and its chaperone role in proteostasis. Replication across ancestries and mechanistic genotype-to-phenotype work are needed. (kohan2019hspa1landhspa1b pages 17-20)

6. Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative synthesis)
6.1 HSPA1L as a specialized paralog within a modular Hsp70 network
A 2024 review emphasizes that Hsp70 function is inherently networked: ATPase-driven folding decisions depend on modular engagement with J-domain proteins (substrate scanning/delivery) and NEFs (release/turnover), as well as C-terminal EEVD-mediated cofactor docking. This conceptualization implies that HSPA1L function cannot be fully interpreted from sequence alone; context-specific co-chaperone availability and stress conditions likely drive functional specialization among paralogs. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6)

6.2 Interpreting “protective” MR associations for a chaperone
The inverse MR associations of circulating HSPA1L with both LUSC and AS suggest two plausible (non-exclusive) expert interpretations: (i) higher circulating HSPA1L might reflect a systemic proteostasis/immune state that reduces disease susceptibility, or (ii) HSPA1L may be a correlated surrogate for a causal pathway near its pQTL locus. Wang et al. explicitly highlight limitations such as pleiotropy, reliance on existing databases, and limited colocalization support for some proteins, reinforcing the need for mechanistic validation. (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 8-10, wang2024causalassociationsof pages 7-8)

7. Key statistics and data summary (recent studies emphasized)
• Neuronal heat stress induction (2023): HSPA1L protein induction ~2.5–3.5-fold in SH-SY5Y / differentiated SH-SY5Y; gene expression peak ~1 h; protein peak ~5–6 h. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18)
• Corneal fibrosis/keratocytes (2024): HSPA1L decreases with TGF-β1 and after alkali burn time points; METTL3 silencing restores HSPA1L/HSPA1B mRNA and increases HSP70 protein, with reduced fibrosis markers under TGF-β1. (jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 6-9, jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 9-11, jing2024silencingmettl3increases media 26951e8d)
• LUSC MR (2024): discovery OR 0.47 (95% CI 0.34–0.65; P=4.89×10^-6); combined replication OR ~0.51 (95% CI 0.41–0.63; P=5.92×10^-10). (wang2024causalassociationsof pages 4-7, wang2024causalassociationsof pages 1-2)
• AS MR (2024): OR 0.0886 (95% CI 0.0487–0.1609; P=1.76×10^-15); colocalization PPH4 ~0.743. (zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 5-6, zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 6-8)
• Male infertility genetics (2019): rs2227956 CT vs TT OR 2.049 (95% CI 1.337–3.139; P=0.001); CC vs TT OR 3.028 (95% CI 1.100–8.332; P=0.032); dominant (TC+CC) OR 2.160 (95% CI 1.440–3.240; P<0.001). (kohan2019hspa1landhspa1b pages 17-20)

8. Practical functional annotation (conservative, evidence-weighted)
Molecular function: ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (Hsp70 family) that binds exposed hydrophobic segments of client proteins via an SBD and uses ATP binding/hydrolysis in its NBD to regulate client affinity, promoting folding/refolding and limiting aggregation; interacts with co-chaperone systems (J-domain proteins; NEFs such as BAG/Hsp110 families) that determine folding vs degradation outcomes. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6, alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18)
Primary biological processes: protein folding/proteostasis under stress; adaptation to proteotoxic stress (neuronal heat stress induction); potential involvement in fibrotic stress responses through epitranscriptomic regulation of chaperone expression (METTL3–m6A axis in keratocytes). (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 17-18, jing2024silencingmettl3increases pages 9-11)
Cellular localization: best supported here at a family level as a cytosolic Hsp70 paralog with stress-responsive relocalization possible; direct HSPA1L-specific localization experiments were not identified in the retrieved set. (melikov2024heatshockprotein pages 5-6, singh2025hsp70amultifunctional pages 2-4)
Disease relevance: supported by (i) strong MR associations with AS and LUSC risk (circulating protein level), and (ii) a population genetic association between HSPA1L coding variation and idiopathic male infertility risk. (zhang2024geneticassociationsin pages 5-6, wang2024causalassociationsof pages 4-7, kohan2019hspa1landhspa1b pages 17-20)

Limitations of this report (evidence gaps)
Within the retrieved corpus, direct biochemical measurements specific to HSPA1L (ATPase kinetics, client repertoire, high-confidence direct binding partners, or subcellular localization by microscopy/fractionation) were limited; many mechanistic claims must therefore be made at the Hsp70-family level and applied to HSPA1L by paralog inference. Additionally, MR associations provide strong statistical evidence but limited mechanistic resolution and may be influenced by pleiotropy or locus architecture; functional validation is needed.
