description: >-
  POLDIP2 (also known as PDIP38) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that interacts with
  DNA polymerase delta (via p50/POLD2 subunit) and PCNA to coordinate DNA replication and
  translesion synthesis. It functions as a processivity factor that enhances the catalytic
  efficiency and processivity of multiple DNA polymerases (Pol delta, Pol eta, Pol lambda,
  and PRIMPOL) during bypass of oxidative DNA lesions such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine
  (8-oxoG) and abasic sites. POLDIP2 has dual subcellular localization: it is predominantly
  mitochondrial where it associates with the mitochondrial DNA nucleoid and mtSSB (SSBP1),
  but a fraction is nuclear where it participates in DNA damage tolerance. Contains an
  ApaG domain (C-terminal) and a hemimethylated DNA-binding-like domain. POLDIP2 has
  dual roles - (1) Core DNA replication/repair function through polymerase interaction and
  translesion synthesis in nucleus, and (2) Mitochondrial function through nucleoid
  association. Secondary roles in vascular biology via NOX4/ROS signaling are downstream
  effects rather than core molecular functions. All three GO:0005515 (protein binding)
  annotations were removed as uninformative - they should be replaced with the more specific
  GO:0070182 (DNA polymerase binding) which accurately describes the class of protein
  interactions.

      POLDIP2 localizes to both mitochondria and nucleus. PDIP38 was initially identified
      as a binding protein to nuclear DNA polymerase delta [PMID:16428295]. Nuclear
      localization is consistent with its role in interacting with nuclear DNA polymerase
      delta and PCNA.

      IBA annotation is well-supported. PMID:16428295 confirms POLDIP2 was identified

      This annotation is based on the presence of a hemimethylated DNA-binding-like domain
      (IPR011722). While the domain architecture suggests potential DNA binding, there is
