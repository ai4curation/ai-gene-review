  IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8, also known as ICSBP) is a transcription factor
  of the IRF family
  that binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE), EICE (ETS-IRF composite
  elements with PU.1),
  and AICE (AP-1-IRF composite elements with BATF/JUN). It functions as both a transcriptional
  activator and
  repressor depending on context and binding partners. IRF8 is essential for myeloid
  and dendritic cell lineage
  specification, particularly for the development of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional
  DC1s (cDC1s).
  It regulates interferon and TLR signaling pathways and controls MHC class II antigen
  processing genes.
  Loss-of-function mutations cause immunodeficiency with dendritic cell and monocyte
  deficiency.

      label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase 
        II-specific
    description: >-
      IRF8 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that binds ISRE,
      EICE, and AICE
      regulatory elements to control gene expression.
  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0001227
      label: DNA-binding transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase 
        II-specific
    description: >-
      IRF8 acts as a transcriptional repressor of interferon-inducible genes, maintaining
      submaximal
      activity that can be relieved by interferon treatment.

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0000981
      label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase 
        II-specific
    description: >-
      IRF8 is essential for the development of conventional DC1 (cDC1) and plasmacytoid
      DC (pDC)
      populations. Human and mouse deficiency causes absence of these cell types.

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0000981
      label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase 
        II-specific
    description: >-
      IRF8 is required for pDC development, the major producers of type I interferons.

      label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase 
        II-specific
    description: >-
      IRF8 mediates cellular responses to IFN-gamma by translocating to the nucleus
      and
      regulating target gene expression.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the specific enhancer elements and chromatin 
      accessibility changes controlled by IRF8 in human DC progenitors?
  - question: How do IRF8 interactions with different partners (PU.1 vs BATF) 
      determine activator vs repressor function?
  - question: What is the relationship between IRF8 and MHC class II antigen 
      processing gene regulation in human DCs?

      monocyte-derived DCs with and without IFN-gamma stimulation
