# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q02556
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interferon regulatory factor 8 {ECO:0000305}; Short=IRF-8; AltName: Full=Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1460054}; Short=H-ICSBP {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1460054}; Short=ICSBP {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1460054};
- **Gene Information:** Name=IRF8 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:21524210, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:5358}; Synonyms=ICSBP1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1460054};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IRF family. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-
- **Key Domains:** Interferon_reg_fac_CS. (IPR019817); Interferon_reg_fact_DNA-bd_dom. (IPR001346); Interferon_reg_factor-3. (IPR019471); SMAD-like_dom_sf. (IPR017855); SMAD_FHA_dom_sf. (IPR008984)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IRF8" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IRF8' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IRF8** (gene ID: IRF8, UniProt: Q02556) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human IRF8 (UniProt Q02556)

Gene/protein verification and identity
- Symbol and accession: IRF8 (also ICSBP/ICSBP1), Homo sapiens; structural analyses in 2024 B‑cell lymphoma study explicitly reference the human protein model AF‑Q02556‑F1 (UniProt Q02556), confirming the correct gene/protein identity (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk2091). The study aligns the IRF8 DNA‑binding domain (DBD) to DNA‑bound IRF3, supporting conserved IRF DBD features (helix–turn–helix fold) (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2).
- Domains/family: IRF8 is an IRF family transcription factor with an N‑terminal DBD and a C‑terminal IRF‑association domain (IAD) that mediates protein–protein interactions and dimerization; it binds ISRE, EICE (PU.1–IRF), and AICE (AP‑1–IRF) composite motifs (reviewed 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0000000000000763) (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4). Structural/biophysical inferences in lymphoma models corroborate DBD function and pathogenic impacts of DBD/IAD mutations on promoter binding (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18).
- Cellular localization: IRF8 acts as a nuclear transcription factor in hematopoietic/myeloid lineages and microglia, with well‑characterized nuclear DNA binding and enhancer occupancy (e.g., CUT&RUN in microglia) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.25.546453) (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5).

Primary molecular functions and mechanisms
- DNA binding and motif grammar: IRF8 binds ISRE sequences and composite elements EICE (with PU.1/ETS) and AICE (with AP‑1 family members, e.g., BATF/JUN); the IAD supports partner‑selection that determines activation vs repression (https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0000000000000763) (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4). In B‑cell lymphoma, pathogenic IRF8 mutants reduce promoter occupancy at CD74 and HLA‑DM, impairing MHC‑II antigen processing (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk2091) (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18).
- Chromatin and enhancer programming: In mice, low IRF8 expression emerges in LMPPs, epigenetically opening enhancers of dendritic‑cell (DC) lineage genes; loss of Irf8 collapses cDC1/pDC differentiation while biasing granulopoiesis (https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-06-857789) (kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 1-5, kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 8-12). In postnatal microglia, IRF8 binds enhancers with Sall1 and PU.1 in a stepwise fashion after birth, configuring microglia‑specific chromatin landscapes; deletion disrupts microglial identity programs (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.25.546453) (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5).

Pathways and cellular roles
- Interferon and TLR signaling: IRF8 participates in type I/II interferon and TLR pathways; through PU.1/AP‑1 partnerships, it induces IFNγ‑responsive genes and orchestrates myeloid lineage decisions (reviewed 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0000000000000763) (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4).
- Hematopoiesis and lineage choice: IRF8 is essential for mononuclear phagocyte specification, promoting monocyte/DC programs and repressing neutrophil differentiation (in part by countering C/EBPα). Irf8–/– mice accumulate neutrophil‑like cells and lose pDCs and CD8α+ cDC1s; early IRF8 expression in LMPPs epigenetically biases toward cDC1 fate (Blood 2019) (kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 1-5, kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 8-12, johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4). In human immunodeficiency due to IRF8 variants, absent circulating pDCs and reduced IL‑12/IFN‑γ responses underscore IRF8’s role in DC‑dependent cytokine circuits (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1654617) (chiang2025casereporta pages 9-10, chiang2025casereporta pages 1-2).
- Microglia: IRF8 is highly expressed in microglia, directing enhancer configuration and maintaining microglial identity; postnatal deletion induces disease‑associated microglia‑like gene signatures and reduces plaque interactions in a 5xFAD context (bioRxiv 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.25.546453) (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5).

Disease links and human genetics
- Inborn errors of immunity (monogenic): Pathogenic IRF8 variants (biallelic recessive or dominant‑negative) cause dendritic‑cell/monocyte deficiency and Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), with clinical features including absent pDCs, impaired IL‑12/IFN‑γ production, neutrophil skewing, and broad infectious susceptibility (Frontiers in Immunology 2025 case report and referenced literature) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1654617) (chiang2025casereporta pages 9-10, chiang2025casereporta pages 1-2).
- Autoimmune disease genetics (2023–2024): IRF8 is implicated by GWAS and functional genomics in systemic sclerosis (SSc). A 2024 Japanese‑led GWAS and meta‑analysis identified IRF8‑related regulatory elements in B cells (e.g., a cis‑regulatory SNP rs10917688 in LD with FCGR/FCRL signal; enrichment of IRF8‑binding sites improves PRS fit) (Nature Communications 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44541-z). Contemporary reviews summarize IRF8 SSc associations, enhancer dysregulation, and cell‑type chromatin interactions (Journal of Molecular Pathology 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jmp5010008) (mennella2024theroleof pages 7-9, mennella2024theroleof pages 11-13).
- Cancer biology (antigen presentation and immune evasion): Recurrent IRF8 mutations in diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (DLBCL) disrupt CD74 and HLA‑DM expression, selectively dampening CD4+ T‑cell activation and remodeling the tumor microenvironment (mouse models and human DLBCL deconvolution) (Science Advances 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk2091) (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18). These data mechanistically link IRF8 dysfunction to MHC‑II antigen processing defects and immune escape.

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Transcription factor–mediated reprogramming to cDC1‑like APCs: Forced expression of PU.1–IRF8–BATF3 (PIB) reprograms diverse human and mouse tumor cell lines (36 lines) into cDC1‑like tumor‑APCs within nine days, restoring endogenous antigen presentation on MHC‑I, enabling cross‑presentation to naïve CD8+ T cells, and promoting tumor‑infiltrating lymphocyte activation. Tumor‑APCs exhibit reduced tumorigenicity; intratumoral administration delays tumor growth and improves survival, synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade in mice (Science Immunology 2023; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.add4817) (zimmermannova2023restoringtumorimmunogenicity pages 1-3).
- DC‑targeted therapy in lung tumors: DC‑therapy (Flt3L + αCD40) expands cDC1 and reduces CD8 exhaustion in murine lung cancer; a cDC1 transcriptional signature that includes Batf3 and Irf8 stratifies responses, underscoring IRF8‑dependent cDC1 biology as a therapeutic axis (Nature Communications 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46685-y) (zimmermannova2023restoringtumorimmunogenicity pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and mechanistic analyses (authoritative sources)
- Hematopoiesis/IFN circuitry: A 2023 expert review details IRF8’s domain architecture, composite motif usage (ISRE/EICE/AICE), and partner‑dependent lineage control in myeloid cells; it integrates enhancer logic at the Irf8 locus (e.g., +56 kb site) and places IRF8 at the intersection of IFNγ, TLR, and AP‑1/ETS programs (https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0000000000000763) (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4).
- DC ontogeny and epigenetics: Single‑cell and ATAC‑seq data show IRF8 primes DC enhancers in LMPPs and is necessary for cDC1/pDC output; these mechanistic data remain a reference for IRF8’s role in early DC lineage specification (Blood 2019; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2018-06-857789) (kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 1-5, kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 8-12).
- Microglia epigenome: Postnatal enhancer programming by IRF8 establishes microglial identity and regulates disease‑associated gene programs (bioRxiv 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.25.546453) (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5).

Relevant statistics and data points
- Reprogramming efficacy: PIB reprogramming was demonstrated across 36 cancer cell lines; cDC1‑like features emerged within nine days, with in vivo tumor‑growth delay and survival benefit, and synergy with checkpoint inhibitors (Sci Immunol 2023) (zimmermannova2023restoringtumorimmunogenicity pages 1-3).
- B‑cell lymphoma immune evasion: IRF8 mutants reduced CD74 and HLA‑DM transcription and impaired CD4 activation in murine models; tumors exhibited increased burden and depletion of effector lymphocytes with Treg/Tfh increases, revealing functional consequences of IRF8 loss on antigen processing/presentation (Sci Adv 2024) (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2).
- DC lineage bias: IRF8+ LMPPs preferentially yield cDC1, while Irf8–/– LMPPs fail to generate cDC1 and instead produce neutrophils, indicating early chromatin‑level priming by IRF8 (Blood 2019) (kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 1-5, kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 8-12).
- Immunodeficiency readouts: A 2025 case with de novo heterozygous IRF8 c.1182dup variant had absent circulating pDCs and reduced IL‑12p70 and IFN‑γ secretion; findings align with prior dominant‑negative IRF8 cases and the spectrum of IRF8‑related inborn errors of immunity (Front Immunol 2025) (chiang2025casereporta pages 9-10, chiang2025casereporta pages 1-2).
- Systemic sclerosis genetics: 2024 GWAS identified an Asian lead signal in FCGR/FCRL with LD to a cis‑regulatory element for IRF8; prioritizing IRF8‑binding SNPs in B cells improved PRS performance in meta‑analysis, implicating IRF8‑centered regulation in SSc susceptibility (Nat Commun 2024) (mennella2024theroleof pages 7-9).

Focused functional annotation
- Primary function: IRF8 is a nuclear transcriptional regulator, not an enzyme/transport protein. Its biochemical specificity is encoded by its DBD/IAD and by partner selection (PU.1/BATF/JUN), enabling binding to ISRE/EICE/AICE elements to activate or repress lineage‑ and stimulus‑specific gene programs (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4).
- Subcellular and tissue context: Predominantly nuclear in hematopoietic cells (monocytes, macrophages, DCs, B‑cell subsets) and CNS microglia; functions at cis‑regulatory modules (enhancers/promoters) to configure chromatin accessibility and transcription (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5, kurotaki2019epigeneticcontrolof pages 1-5).
- Pathways: Orchestrates interferon and TLR responses (type I/II IFN genes), IL‑12 production and downstream IFN‑γ circuits in antigen‑presenting cells; in B cells influences GC programs and MHC‑II antigen processing through control of CD74/HLA‑DM (johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2).

Notes on diagnostic markers and IHC
- In surgical pathology, IRF8 is widely used as a nuclear marker of myeloid/DC lineage in marrow and lymphoid tissues, but specificity varies by context. While it is commonly positive in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and BPDCN, it is not specific when used alone; panels incorporating lineage‑defining markers are recommended (AJCP 2023 study on pDC/BPDCN immunophenotypes; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqac174). (This paragraph is included for context; sensitivity/specificity metrics derive from the cited 2023 study.)

Key recent developments (2023–2024)
- Tumor cell reprogramming to cDC1‑like APCs via PU.1–IRF8–BATF3 (PIB) as a therapeutic concept with demonstrated in vivo efficacy and checkpoint synergy (Sci Immunol 2023) (zimmermannova2023restoringtumorimmunogenicity pages 1-3).
- Mechanistic cancer immunology: IRF8 mutations in DLBCL as a driver of MHC‑II antigen‑processing defects and immune escape (Sci Adv 2024) (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2, qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18).
- Microglia enhancer programming and identity maintenance by IRF8, with functional consequences in neurodegeneration models (bioRxiv 2024) (saeki2024irf8configuresenhancer pages 1-5).
- SSc genetics: cross‑population GWAS/meta‑analysis highlighting IRF8‑centered regulatory architecture in B cells and improved PRS when prioritizing IRF8‑binding SNPs (Nat Commun 2024) (mennella2024theroleof pages 7-9).

Real‑world and translational outlook
- Biomarker/diagnostics: IRF8 immunostaining supports identification of myeloid/DC lineages in hematopathology but should be interpreted in panels due to limited specificity in some entities; IRF8 mutation testing may inform immune‑evasion mechanisms in B‑cell lymphomas (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 1-2).
- Therapeutics: DC‑axis therapies that expand/activate cDC1 (Flt3L + αCD40) leverage IRF8‑dependent cDC1 biology; TF‑based reprogramming (PIB) represents a platform for restoring tumor immunogenicity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade in preclinical models (zimmermannova2023restoringtumorimmunogenicity pages 1-3).

Ambiguity check and alignment with UniProt record
- The literature above explicitly concerns human IRF8 and mouse ortholog in mechanistic studies; the 2024 lymphoma paper employs the human model AF‑Q02556‑F1, matching UniProt Q02556. Reported domains (DBD, IAD) and IRF‑family membership align with the UniProt description. No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified (qiu2024irf8mutantbcell pages 17-18, johnson2023interferonregulatoryfactor8dependent pages 3-4).
