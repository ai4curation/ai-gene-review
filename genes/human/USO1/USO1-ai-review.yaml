description: 'General vesicular transport factor p115 that regulates SNARE complex
  assembly during ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion. Functions as a homodimeric peripheral
  membrane protein with a novel alpha-solenoid globular head domain (12 armadillo-like
  repeats), an extended coiled-coil dimerization domain, and a C-terminal acidic region
  that binds Golgi matrix proteins. Recruited to COPII vesicles and early Golgi cisternae
  by Rab1-GTP. Recent studies (2024) demonstrate the essential cellular function is
  SNARE complex assembly regulation, not vesicle tethering - the monomeric globular
  head domain alone can rescue uso1 deletion. Binds monomeric SNAREs (Sec22b, Bet1,
  Bos1) to promote cognate trans-SNARE complex formation. Also functions in Golgi
  organization, mitotic spindle assembly via gamma-tubulin interaction, and retrograde
  COPI vesicle trafficking. Membrane association regulated by phosphorylation at Ser942.
  Essential for cell viability.

      primarily in ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport and intra-Golgi retrograde transport.
      While transcytosis involves vesicular transport across cells, there is no direct
      experimental evidence that USO1 functions specifically in transcytosis. The
      core function is ER-Golgi trafficking, not transcellular transport. This annotation
      may represent over-inference from general vesicular transport function. Recommend

  title: Phosphorylation of the vesicle docking protein p115 regulates its association
    with the Golgi membrane.
  findings:
  - statement: p115 is phosphorylated in cell cycle-specific manner - phosphorylated
      in interphase but not mitosis
    supporting_text: was found to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle-specific manner;
      it was found phosphorylated in interphase but not in mitotic cells
  - statement: During interphase, phosphorylated form found exclusively in cytosol,
      unphosphorylated form associates with Golgi membranes
    supporting_text: During interphase, however, two forms of p115 were detected in
      the cells; the phosphorylated form was found exclusively in cytosol, whereas
      the unphosphorylated form was associated with membranes, mostly of the Golgi
      complex.
  - statement: Phosphorylation site identified as Ser942 in C-terminal acidic domain
    supporting_text: Mutational analysis revealed that the phosphorylation site of
      p115 was the Ser942 residue in the C-terminal acidic domain.
  - statement: S942A mutant shows markedly increased Golgi membrane association
    supporting_text: A mutant with a single substitution of Ser942 --> Ala markedly
      increased its association with the Golgi membrane.
  - statement: S942D mutant shows decreased membrane association
    supporting_text: Another mutant with Ser942 --> Asp was able to associate with
      the membrane, although at a decreased level
  - statement: Phosphorylation of Ser942 regulates p115-Golgi membrane interaction
    supporting_text: these results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser942 at the
      C-terminal acidic domain regulates the interaction of p115 with the Golgi membrane

core_functions:
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0000149
    label: SNARE binding
  description: Core molecular function - USO1 directly and selectively binds monomeric
    SNARE proteins including Sec22b (v-SNARE), Bet1 and Bos1 (t-SNAREs). Does not
    bind assembled SNARE complexes. This selective binding channels SNAREs toward
    productive cognate complex formation and enables USO1 to regulate SNARE complex
    assembly, which is the essential cellular function based on recent genetic and
    biochemical studies.

      in deep research files and USO1-notes.md
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0031267
    label: small GTPase binding
  description: Core molecular function - USO1 binds Rab1-GTP through two sites (H1
    tether repeat in globular head and CC1 coiled-coil). Highly specific for GTP-bound
    active Rab1. This interaction mediates recruitment to COPII vesicles and ERGIC/cis-Golgi
    membranes, positioning USO1 at sites of vesicle fusion where it can regulate SNARE
    complex assembly.

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: Golgi ribbon formation
  proposed_definition: The assembly and organization of individual Golgi stacks into
    an interconnected ribbon structure characteristic of mammalian cells, positioned
    near the microtubule-organizing center.
  justification: USO1 is essential for formation and maintenance of the mammalian
    Golgi ribbon structure through its CC4 domain and interactions with GM130 and
    giantin. Current GO term "Golgi organization" (GO:0007030) is too broad. A specific
    term for ribbon formation would better capture this specialized organizational
    process.
- proposed_name: regulation of cognate SNARE pairing
  proposed_definition: Any process that modulates the selectivity or rate of formation
    of cognate (productive) SNARE combinations while preventing non-cognate (nonproductive)
    SNARE interactions.
  justification: USO1 specifically promotes formation of cognate SNARE complexes (e.g.,
    Sec22b+Bet1+Bos1+Syntaxin5) while showing selectivity against non-cognate combinations.
    This regulatory specificity is a distinct aspect of SNARE complex assembly regulation
    that merits its own term.
suggested_experiments:
- experiment_type: Structure determination
  hypothesis: 'The E6K and G540S mutations in the USO1 globular head domain that enhance
    Bos1 binding create new or strengthen existing interaction surfaces for SNARE
    binding.

    '
  description: 'Determine crystal or cryo-EM structure of wild-type and mutant (E6K,
    G540S) USO1 globular head domains in complex with Bos1 Qa-SNARE or other cognate
    SNAREs. Compare binding interfaces and affinities. This would reveal the structural
    basis for SNARE selectivity and how USO1 promotes cognate SNARE pairing.

    '
- experiment_type: SNARE assembly kinetics
  hypothesis: 'USO1 accelerates the rate of cognate SNARE complex formation while
    inhibiting or having no effect on non-cognate SNARE combinations.

    '
  description: 'In vitro reconstitution assay measuring SNARE complex assembly kinetics
    with and without USO1, using purified components. Compare assembly rates for cognate
    (e.g., Sec22b+Bet1+Bos1+Syntaxin5) versus non-cognate SNARE combinations. Use
    FRET or other real-time readouts to quantify assembly kinetics.

    '
- experiment_type: Separation of function mutagenesis
  hypothesis: 'SNARE assembly and vesicle tethering functions can be genetically separated
    through domain-specific mutations.

    '
  description: 'Create USO1 mutants that selectively disrupt tethering (e.g., GM130/giantin
    binding mutants, coiled-coil deletions) versus SNARE binding (e.g., SNARE-binding
    site mutations in GHD). Test rescue of uso1 deletion and specific trafficking
    defects. This would definitively establish which functions are essential versus
    accessory.

    '
- experiment_type: Live cell imaging of SNARE dynamics
  hypothesis: 'USO1 increases the dwell time or concentration of monomeric SNAREs
    at fusion sites prior to SNARE complex assembly.

    '
  description: 'Use super-resolution microscopy and/or single-molecule tracking to
    visualize dynamics of fluorescently-tagged SNAREs and USO1 at ER-Golgi interface.
    Compare SNARE localization, clustering, and mobility in wild-type versus USO1-depleted
    cells. This would reveal how USO1 spatially organizes SNAREs for productive complex
    formation.
