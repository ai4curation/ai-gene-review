## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene USO1 (O60763) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Overview of USO1 and its Protein Product (p115)  
**USO1** (HGNC symbol for **“USO1 vesicle transport factor”**) is a human gene encoding the protein commonly known as **p115**, or *General Vesicular Transport Factor p115* ([research.bioinformatics.udel.edu](https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/entry/O60763/#:~:text=UniProt%20AC%20%2F%20UniProt%20ID,Human%29%20PRO)). This protein was originally identified in yeast (Uso1p) and is highly conserved in eukaryotes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=The%20tethering%20factor%20p115%20,terminal%20domain%20of%20p115%20as)). Human p115 is a large coiled-coil **peripheral membrane protein** of approximately 959 amino acids (~115 kDa for the homodimer) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=p115%2FUSO1%20%20,natal)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). It operates as a homodimer and is often described as having a “myosin-shaped” architecture, with an **N-terminal globular head domain**, a long **coiled-coil rod domain** that mediates dimerization, and a short **acidic C-terminal tail** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). USO1 is ubiquitously expressed across tissues (e.g. high in thyroid and testis), reflecting its fundamental role in secretory trafficking ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=Expression%20Ubiquitous%20expression%20in%20thyroid,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). Major known aliases for USO1 include **VDP** (*vesicle docking protein*), **TAP** (*transcytosis-associated protein*), and “**vesicle docking protein homolog (yeast)**,” underscoring its role in vesicle tethering and its conservation from yeast to humans ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=USO1#:~:text=,2)). 

**Key Concept – Membrane Tethering:** p115 is a **vesicle tethering factor** that facilitates the docking of transport vesicles to their target membranes within the early secretory pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). Unlike enzymes, p115 does not catalyze a chemical reaction; rather, it functions as a **structural adaptor** or scaffold that physically links membranes to promote vesicle fusion. The current understanding is that p115 plays a central role in **ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport**, capturing incoming vesicles and holding them near the Golgi membrane until SNARE proteins can mediate fusion ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). In practical terms, USO1/p115 is essential for maintaining efficient protein and lipid trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and between Golgi cisternae. Its activity is critical for normal cellular secretory function, and loss of p115 leads to severe trafficking defects and disorganization of Golgi structure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). In the sections below, we delve into the **structure, localization, primary function, regulatory mechanisms, and pathways** involving USO1, and we highlight **recent research (2020–2024)** on its roles and significance. Citations to primary literature and authoritative reviews are provided throughout to support each statement.

# Structure and Localization of p115  
**Domain Organization:** The p115 protein consists of distinct domains that underlie its function. The **N-terminal portion** (~1–300 amino acids) contains *armadillo/HEAT* repeat motifs (an **armadillo-fold**) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=head%20region,like%20repeats%20%28pfam00514%29.%20Links)). This globular head domain is conserved but was long of unknown function; newer evidence suggests it mediates interactions beyond vesicle tethering (e.g. binding to cytosolic factors) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=dimerization%2C%20and%20a%20short%20C,like%20repeats%20%28pfam00514%29.%20Links)). The **central region** of p115 is a lengthy coiled-coil that forms an elongated rod; this region self-associates into an anti-parallel homodimer, effectively creating a **dumbbell-shaped dimer** with two globular heads and a rod-like tail ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). The coiled-coil is subdivided into at least four segments (CC1–CC4) based on sequence homology. Importantly, specific coiled-coil segments mediate binding to other proteins: for example, the **first coiled-coil (CC1)** and the **fourth coiled-coil (CC4)** of p115 can bind to specific ER–Golgi SNARE proteins ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=deletion%20mutants%2C%20we%20show%20that,mediated%20membrane%20tethering)). The extreme **C-terminal tail** (~30 amino acids) of p115 is highly acidic and is crucial for tethering activity ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). This tail region is responsible for binding the target membrane “*golgin*” proteins (such as GM130) and vesicle-associated coiled-coil proteins (such as giantin), as described below ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). 

**Subcellular Localization:** USO1-encoded p115 localizes to the **cytoplasmic face of membranes in the early secretory pathway**. During interphase, p115 **cycles between the cytosol and the Golgi apparatus** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). It is predominantly found at the **cis-Golgi network and ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)**, including on vesicular carriers that shuttle between ER and Golgi ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,During%20the%20interphase)). Because p115 lacks any transmembrane region, it associates peripherally: in its active, dephosphorylated state, p115 binds to Golgi membranes, whereas phosphorylation causes it to dissociate back into the cytosol ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=recycles%20between%20the%20cytosol%20and,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Feb%202014)). High-resolution microscopy studies have shown p115 concentrated at **Golgi rims and vesicle clustering sites** near ER exit sites ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,During%20the%20interphase)). In fact, small GTPases of the Rab family help target p115 to these locations: the **Rab1 GTPase** (previously called Ras-associated protein 1) specifically **recruits p115 to ER-derived vesicles** (COPII-coated vesicles) at ER exit sites ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). This recruitment localizes p115 to sites where nascent vesicles bud from the ER, positioning it to capture those vesicles upon their arrival at the Golgi. p115 is thus often found at the interface of ER exit sites and the cis-Golgi.  

Notably, p115’s distribution changes during the cell cycle. In **mitosis**, the Golgi apparatus disassembles and p115 disperses; interestingly, a fraction of p115 relocalizes to the **spindle poles** during mitosis ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=and%20%CE%B3TuRC%20,Whereas%20the)). This mitotic relocalization is mediated by the N-terminal armadillo domain of p115 binding to **γ-tubulin** complexes, which are key microtubule nucleation factors ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)). Through this interaction, p115 contributes to **non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs)** at the Golgi in interphase, and it associates with centrosomal structures in mitosis ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)). In summary, under normal interphase conditions p115 is primarily a **Golgi-localized peripheral membrane protein** (with rapid on-and-off membrane cycling), whereas during mitosis it transiently adopts a spindle pole localization, reflecting its regulatory interactions with the cytoskeleton.

# Role in Vesicle Tethering and Membrane Trafficking  
The primary function of USO1/p115 is to act as a **vesicle tethering factor** in the early secretory pathway. Tethering factors ensure that transport vesicles are correctly docked to their target membrane before SNARE-mediated fusion occurs. p115 is considered a **“general” vesicle transport factor** because it is required at multiple steps of membrane traffic, especially **ER-to-Golgi transport and intra-Golgi transport** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,During%20the%20interphase)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). It does **not** have enzymatic activity or cargo specificity; instead, it recognizes membrane-bound partner proteins to form a physical bridge between a vesicle and the target compartment. 

**Mechanism of Tethering:** Classic studies in mammalian cells and yeast revealed that p115 bridges vesicles to the Golgi by simultaneously binding factors on both membranes. On the **Golgi side**, p115 interacts with **GM130 (Golgin-95/GOLGA2)**, a coiled-coil Golgi matrix protein anchored to the cis-Golgi membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). On the **vesicle side**, p115 binds to **giantin (GOLGB1)**, a long coiled-coil protein that can be carried by Golgi-derived vesicles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). This trimeric complex – GM130–p115–giantin – forms a *tethering bridge* that holds the vesicle at the Golgi surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). Sönnichsen et al. first demonstrated in 1998 that p115 and these golgins form a complex required for Golgi vesicle docking ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). The **acidic tail of p115** is critical for these interactions: it directly binds a coiled-coil region of giantin on the vesicle and also binds GM130 on the Golgi membrane ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). By connecting giantin and GM130, p115 helps maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi and ensures vesicles (particularly **COPI-coated vesicles**) are tethered in place for fusion ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=protein%20,detected)). Indeed, biochemical assays have confirmed that p115 can simultaneously bind GM130 and giantin, forming a “tentacle”-like link between two membranes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)).

In the context of **anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport**, p115 collaborates with **Rab1** and other factors. Rab1 in its GTP-bound form localizes to COPII vesicles budding from the ER and **recruits p115 onto these vesicles** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). Once the vesicle arrives at the Golgi vicinity, p115 (on the vesicle) can engage GM130 (on the cis-Golgi), thereby tethering the vesicle at the Golgi membrane ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). This mechanism effectively *“programs” budding COPII vesicles for fusion* with Golgi by pre-loading them with the tethering machinery ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=10903204%20%20,2000)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). Moyer et al. (2001) showed that a Rab1–p115–GM130 complex is required for efficient tethering of ER-derived vesicles to the cis-Golgi ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=11285137%20%20,2002)). Consistently, **depletion or inactivation of p115 causes accumulation of cargo in ER-derived vesicles** that fail to fuse, as observed both in cell culture and whole organisms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=The%20tethering%20factor%20p115%20,terminal%20domain%20of%20p115%20as)). For example, C. elegans embryos lacking p115 activity accumulate secretory yolk proteins in the body cavity and show ER/Golgi retention of cargo receptors, phenotypes consistent with blocked vesicle fusion ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=The%20tethering%20factor%20p115%20,terminal%20domain%20of%20p115%20as)).

**SNARE Complex Assembly:** Beyond simply holding vesicles near the Golgi, p115 actively contributes to the next step: assembling the **SNARE complex** that drives membrane fusion. p115 has been shown to bind directly to multiple ER–Golgi SNARE proteins via its coiled-coil domains ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=deletion%20mutants%2C%20we%20show%20that,mediated%20membrane%20tethering)). Specifically, the **CC1 region of p115** has a weak homology to SNARE motifs and can bind to SNAREs on the target membrane (t-SNAREs like syntaxin 5) ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=WE%20%20,2002)), while another region (CC4) can bind vesicle SNAREs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=deletion%20mutants%2C%20we%20show%20that,mediated%20membrane%20tethering)). This multivalent binding may help align the SNAREs from vesicle (v-SNAREs) and Golgi (t-SNAREs) into the proper complex (sometimes termed a **“cis-SNARE complex”** when formed prior to membrane fusion) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). Shorter et al. (2002) demonstrated that p115 catalyzes **SNAREpin assembly** after the initial tethering: p115 first brings Golgi golgins together, and then facilitates the pairing of SNARE proteins, thereby accelerating vesicle fusion ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=WE%20%20,2002)). In essence, p115 acts as a platform that coordinates tethering with the molecular fusion machinery. The outcome is efficient docking and fusion of incoming vesicles, delivering their cargo into the Golgi. 

**Pathways and Processes:** The activity of p115 is indispensable for multiple transport steps:  
- **ER to Golgi transport:** p115 is critical for forward trafficking of proteins from the ER. Genetic interference (siRNA or temperature-sensitive mutations) leads to a blockade of ER export and collapse of Golgi function ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,During%20the%20interphase)). In mammalian cells, p115 is required for the formation of the **Golgi ribbon** structure from ER-Golgi intermediate elements, as it helps tether vesicular and tubular intermediates during Golgi assembly ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=H2%29%20within%20the%20N,Shorter%20et%20al)).  
- **Intra-Golgi and retrograde transport:** p115’s interaction with COPI vesicles suggests it also functions in **retrograde trafficking** (Golgi-to-ER or intra-Golgi movement). It is required for **inter-cisternal Golgi transport** – the exchange of material between Golgi cisternae to maintain Golgi homeostasis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=dimerization%2C%20and%20a%20short%20C,like%20repeats%20%28pfam00514)). For example, in cell-free systems p115 is necessary for transferring cargo between successive Golgi compartments ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/pfam04869#:~:text=dimerization%2C%20and%20a%20short%20C,like%20repeats%20%28pfam00514)).  
- **Golgi biogenesis and maintenance:** Because p115 tethers membranes, it contributes to the overall integrity of the Golgi. Silencing p115 in cultured cells causes the Golgi to fragment or disperse into vesicles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). Conversely, during post-mitotic Golgi reassembly, p115 is one of the key factors (along with GM130 and GRASP65) that *relink* Golgi fragments into a unified ribbon ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,During%20the%20interphase)). These roles place p115 at the heart of Golgi morphogenesis.  

Experimentally, the **essential nature** of USO1/p115 is well documented. In mice, a knockout of USO1 leads to early embryonic lethality, with embryos failing shortly after the blastocyst stage (around E3–E8.5) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=maintaining%20Golgi%20architecture%20as%20well,2012)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=p115%2FUSO1%20%20,natal)). The few cells observed in those mutants showed disrupted Golgi architecture, underscoring how vital p115-mediated tethering is for cell viability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=maintaining%20Golgi%20architecture%20as%20well,2012)). Even in conditional or partial knockdowns, cells often exhibit **Golgi disorganization, secretion defects, and growth arrest** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). Thus, the consensus from functional studies is that **p115 is indispensable for secretory trafficking and Golgi structure** across eukaryotes.

# Regulation and Interaction Partners of p115  
**Recruitment by Rab GTPases:** A key regulator of p115 is **Rab1**, a small GTP-binding protein that operates at ER–Golgi interfaces. Active Rab1 (Rab1–GTP) on ER-derived vesicles serves as a signal to **recruit p115 from the cytosol to the vesicle membrane** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). This recruitment is part of a larger “tethering complex”: Rab1–GTP binds not only p115 but also *Golgi-side factors* like GM130 and the golgin tethering complex **GRASP65 (GORASP1)** ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=RAB1%3AGTP%20binds%20USO1%20and%20GORASP1%3AGOLGA2)) ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=11285137%20%20,2002)). Reactome pathway reconstructions show a specific step where **Rab1:GTP binds USO1 (p115) and GM130/GRASP65** at the Golgi membrane, initiating the tethering of an incoming vesicle ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=11285137%20%20,2002)). The dependence on Rab1 explains why loss of Rab1 function phenocopies p115 loss – both result in ER-to-Golgi traffic jams. Other Rabs might also interact with p115 (for instance, Rab2 has been implicated in Golgi trafficking), but Rab1 is the best-characterized direct recruiter ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=11285137%20%20,2002)). 

**Phosphorylation Cycling:** p115’s association with membranes is **controlled by phosphorylation**. During interphase, p115 is largely dephosphorylated and stays bound to Golgi membranes; when phosphorylated (on specific serine/threonine sites), it releases from membranes into the cytosol ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=recycles%20between%20the%20cytosol%20and,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Feb%202014)). One well-known regulatory event occurs in **mitosis**: the mitotic kinase CDK1/cyclin B phosphorylates GM130 on serine-25, which in turn **prevents p115 from binding GM130** ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=WE%20%20,2002)). This disrupts the p115–GM130 tethering and contributes to **Golgi disassembly at prophase**, a normal step in cell division. p115 itself is also a phosphoprotein; casein kinase II and other kinases can phosphorylate p115 and modulate its activity ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=reassembly%20after%20mitosis%20,tubulin%20to)). For instance, studies indicate that **p115’s ability to bind GM130 and giantin is phosphorylation-dependent** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=reassembly%20after%20mitosis%20,tubulin%20to)). Brandon et al. (2003) showed that p115 phosphorylation status changes its membrane affinity ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=reassembly%20after%20mitosis%20,tubulin%20to)). Thus, cells regulate p115 by kinase signaling to toggle its tethering function on or off as needed (e.g., switching off tethering during mitosis, or possibly modulating tethering during signaling events).

**SNARE and Co-factor Interactions:** p115 interacts with numerous other proteins in the trafficking machinery. As mentioned, it binds directly to **SNARE proteins** such as the Golgi t-SNARE **syntaxin 5 (STX5)** and the vesicle v-SNARE **GOS-28 (GOSR2)** ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=WE%20%20,2002)). These interactions occur via the coiled-coil domains (the CC1 and CC4 regions function as SNARE-binding motifs) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328511/#:~:text=deletion%20mutants%2C%20we%20show%20that,mediated%20membrane%20tethering)). By binding SNAREs, p115 likely stabilizes them in a complex-ready state. Additionally, p115 has been found to associate with multi-subunit tethering complexes. For example, it can interact with subunits of the **COG complex** (another tethering complex involved in retrograde Golgi trafficking) and with **Sec34/35**. However, the most prominent partners remain the Golgi matrix “golgin” proteins (GM130, giantin) and the ER-Golgi SNAREs. 

**Emerging Interactions – Sec16A:** A very recent finding (2023–2024) expanded p115’s interaction network to the ER exit sites. Sec16A is a large scaffolding protein that defines ER exit sites for COPII vesicle budding. New evidence suggests the **head domain of p115 can bind directly to Sec16A** ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2025.10.16.682774#:~:text=proteins%20to%20promote%20membrane%20fusion,of%20the%20early%20secretory%20pathway)). Specifically, researchers identified a conserved motif in the unstructured N-terminus of Sec16A that interacts with p115’s globular head ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2025.10.16.682774#:~:text=proteins%20to%20promote%20membrane%20fusion,of%20the%20early%20secretory%20pathway)). Mutations in p115 that disrupt Sec16-binding were shown to reduce secretory traffic efficiency, implying this interaction is functionally important ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2025.10.16.682774#:~:text=organises%20ER%20sites%20and%20promotes,of%20the%20early%20secretory%20pathway)). This discovery hints at p115 potentially linking **ER vesicle formation with Golgi tethering** in a spatially coordinated way. In other words, a subset of p115 molecules might “reach back” to ER exit sites via Sec16A, helping organize the early secretory pathway on a larger scale ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2025.10.16.682774#:~:text=the%20unstructured%20N,of%20the%20early%20secretory%20pathway)). While this idea is still under investigation (reported in a 2025 preprint), it underscores how p115 is centrally positioned in the secretory pathway, touching both vesicle biogenesis and vesicle docking steps.

**Other Regulatory Proteins:** p115’s function is also modulated by **proteins like GRASP65/55** (Golgi stacking proteins) and other golgins. For instance, GRASP65 works with p115 in Golgi stack reformation; p115 binding to GM130 is more effective when GM130 is part of the larger GRASP65 complex ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=RAB1%3AGTP%20binds%20USO1%20and%20GORASP1%3AGOLGA2)). Additionally, calcium and calmodulin have been reported to bind p115 in some studies, suggesting calcium signaling might influence tethering events (though the physiological significance remains to be fully clarified). 

In summary, p115 acts as a hub, interacting with GTPases (Rab1), long coiled-coil tether proteins (GM130, giantin), coat proteins at ER exit sites (Sec16A), and the SNARE fusion machinery. These interactions are tightly regulated by post-translational modifications and the cell cycle stage, ensuring that p115 tethers vesicles at the right time and place.

# Role in Golgi Architecture and Cell Cycle Progression  
Beyond vesicle trafficking per se, USO1/p115 has critical roles in maintaining **Golgi structure** and coordinating it with the cell cycle. The Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells is normally organized into a ribbon of interconnected stacks near the nucleus. This architecture depends on matrix proteins and tethering factors to hold the stacks together. **p115 is essential for Golgi ribbon integrity** – it links membranes both laterally and across cisternae. When p115 is depleted, the Golgi ribbon breaks into dispersed mini-stacks or vesicles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). Alvarez et al. (2001) first showed that p115 knockdown causes the loss of the perinuclear Golgi ribbon, phenocopying the effects of brefeldin A (a drug that collapses the Golgi) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). Mechanistically, the p115/GM130/giantin tether complex is thought to underpin the structural linkage of cis-Golgi elements ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). Without p115, cisternal membranes cannot properly tether, leading to Golgi fragmentation and functional impairment of the secretory pathway.

During the **cell cycle**, the Golgi undergoes dramatic changes, and p115 is a key player in these events. In late G2 phase, the Golgi starts to “unlink” into discrete stacks, and then in mitosis it disassembles into vesicles and tubules (the “Golgi haze”). p115, together with GM130, is one of the targets of mitotic kinases that cause this disassembly. As noted above, phosphorylation of GM130 in mitosis prevents p115 from tethering cisternae together ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=WE%20%20,2002)). Consistently, cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable GM130 mutant maintain Golgi tethering (and experience a delay in Golgi breakdown) until p115 is experimentally removed. Once cells exit mitosis, **p115 is required for Golgi reassembly**: it helps re-tether the Golgi membranes that were separated. Shorter and Warren (1999) demonstrated that adding p115 to mitotic Golgi fragments in vitro promoted their fusion into intact Golgi stacks ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,tubulin%2C%20a%20component%20of%20%CE%B3TuSC)). In living cells, p115 quickly relocalizes to Golgi membranes during telophase, concurrent with dephosphorylation of GM130, to reform the Golgi ribbon ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=p115%20is%20a%20peripheral%20membrane,tubulin%2C%20a%20component%20of%20%CE%B3TuSC)). Therefore, **p115 orchestrates Golgi inheritance** each division, ensuring daughter cells re-establish a functional Golgi.

Intriguingly, p115’s role extends to coordinating the Golgi with the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is particularly important in interphase cells. The **Golgi apparatus can serve as an MTOC (microtubule-organizing center)**, especially in cells like fibroblasts where non-centrosomal microtubules emanate from the Golgi. p115 is a crucial factor in this process: it binds **γ-tubulin via its N-terminus and recruits γ-tubulin ring complexes to the Golgi membrane** in interphase ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)). The interaction involves p115’s N-terminal armadillo-like domain attaching to γ-tubulin complexes that are associated with GM130 ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)). Studies by Rivero and colleagues (e.g. 2009, 2011) showed that depletion of p115 or GM130 reduces the nucleation of microtubules at the Golgi, whereas overexpression of p115 can increase Golgi-based microtubule growth ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Linstedt%20et%20al,Whereas%20the)). This function links secretory trafficking with cell polarity and migration, since Golgi-originating microtubules help direct secretory vesicles toward the leading edge in motile cells. During mitosis, as noted, p115 itself localizes to spindle poles (the main MTOCs) through γ-tubulin binding ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=and%20%CE%B3TuRC%20,Whereas%20the)). Although dispensable for spindle assembly, this localization may help ensure that, upon mitotic exit, p115 is well positioned to capture Golgi membranes and also possibly to assist in re-establishing microtubule arrays at the Golgi in G1. In summary, **p115 integrates Golgi structure with microtubule organization**, highlighting its broader structural role beyond vesicle tethering.

# Biological Pathways Involving USO1/p115  
Given its central role in trafficking, p115 is involved in several fundamental **cellular pathways**: 

- **Constitutive Secretory Pathway:** USO1 is a core component of the pathway delivering newly synthesized proteins from the ER → Golgi → secretory vesicles → cell surface or extracellular space. The **Reactome database** places p115 in the pathway steps “ER to Golgi transport” and “Golgi vesicle tethering” as a crucial factor for vesicle docking ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=11285137%20%20,2002)). Virtually all secreted or membrane proteins rely on p115-dependent steps during their journey through the Golgi. 

- **Retrograde Traffic to ER:** p115 also participates in the retrieval of escaped ER proteins and recycling of SNAREs from the Golgi back to the ER (often via COPI vesicles). It has been implicated in **COPI-mediated retrograde transport**, working alongside the COG complex to tether retrograde carriers at the ER or ERGIC. This ensures recycling of ER chaperones and maintenance of ER protein localization. 

- **Golgi–to–Endosome Trafficking:** While p115 is primarily associated with early secretory trafficking, some evidence suggests it may influence transport from the Golgi to endosomal compartments. High-throughput interaction and localization studies (e.g., global proteomics and Gene Ontology annotations) have linked USO1 to processes like **Golgi to endosome transport** and even **autophagosome assembly** ([www.genome.jp](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?uniprot%3AO00189=#:~:text=...GO%3A0005802%3B%20C%3Atrans,GO%3A0006895%3B%20P%3AGolgi%20to%20endosome%20transport)). The connection to autophagy is not fully direct, but since autophagosomes can originate from ER–Golgi membranes, loss of p115 might indirectly impair the formation of these structures (for example, by disorganizing the membrane supply needed for autophagosome biogenesis). Indeed, cells lacking p115 show broad trafficking defects that can impact lysosomal delivery and autophagy flux (an area of ongoing research). 

- **Signaling Pathways:** By itself, p115 is not a signaling molecule, but proper secretory function is often required for signaling receptors to reach the cell surface. Interestingly, a few studies have noted that p115 can affect specific signaling cascades inside cells. For instance, in multiple myeloma cancer cells, overexpression of USO1 was found to **enhance ERK (MAP kinase) pathway activity**, possibly by increasing the secretion of autocrine growth factors or the cell-surface expression of signaling receptors ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Jin%2C%20Y,012)). This ties p115 to signaling outcomes, albeit indirectly, through its effect on protein trafficking. In addition, the structural integrity of the Golgi (which p115 helps maintain) is known to modulate certain signaling pathways (such as mTOR and GSK3 signaling) that sense Golgi status; disruptions in p115 could therefore send aberrant signals that the cell interprets as stress.

In summary, USO1/p115 is a linchpin of the **early secretory and Golgi trafficking pathways**. Virtually any cellular process that depends on proper protein secretion or membrane transport (from neurotransmission to plasma membrane receptor recycling) can be affected by p115 dysfunction. The precise role of p115 in any specialized pathway (e.g. insulin secretion, immune cell antigen presentation) will be through its fundamental activity in vesicle tethering at the ER/Golgi interface.

# Clinical and Research Significance  
Because USO1 encodes an essential housekeeping protein, **heritable mutations in USO1** are exceptionally rare or incompatible with life – consistent with the early embryonic lethality observed in knockout mice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=maintaining%20Golgi%20architecture%20as%20well,2012)). To date, there are no well-documented congenital human diseases caused by germline USO1 loss-of-function, likely because such mutations would arrest development. However, emerging research has linked alterations in USO1 expression to **cancer biology** and identified p115 as a potential vulnerability in certain tumors.

Several studies in the last decade found that **USO1 is upregulated in multiple cancers**, and that cancer cells can be unusually dependent on p115. For example, Jin and Dai (2016) reported that USO1 was overexpressed in **multiple myeloma** cells and that it promoted tumor progression by activating the ERK signaling pathway ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=Jin%2C%20Y,012)). Silencing USO1 in those myeloma cells led to reduced proliferation, indicating p115 might support the high secretory demands or signaling needs of cancer cells. Similarly, a 2015 study showed that **knockdown of USO1 in colon cancer cells** inhibited their proliferation and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic angle in targeting the secretory pathway for cancer treatment ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L2517%20Lentivirus,z)). More recently, Jaiswal et al. (2021) conducted a focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen in **B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)** and found USO1 to be a critical “druggable” vulnerability in this cancer subtype ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2024.1513472/full#:~:text=et%20al.%20%282021%29.%20Focused%20CRISPR,w)). Disrupting USO1 in B-ALL cells caused a significant reduction in cell growth and increased cell death ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=dependencies%20on%20several%20genes%20including,cells%20revealed%20alterations%20in%20pathways)). The same study showed USO1 expression is directly upregulated by the oncogenic MLL-AF4 fusion protein in aggressive leukemias, explaining why those leukemia cells have heightened reliance on p115 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=USO1%20is%20directly%20regulated%20by,AF4)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=USO1%20depletion%20alters%20B,proliferation%2C%20survival%20and%20cell%20cycle)). Notably, USO1 was not identified as an essential gene in normal cells by broad CRISPR screens (e.g., in the DepMap database), yet it is indispensable in certain cancer cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%20be%20%E2%80%9Ccommon,designing%20primers%20for%20the%20regulatory)). This difference suggests that some cancers acquire a particular dependency on robust secretory function – a phenomenon termed “non-oncogene addiction.” Thus, **p115 is being investigated as a possible anti-cancer target**, where inhibitors of p115 function might selectively impact tumor cells that cannot compensate for its loss ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=dependencies%20on%20several%20genes%20including,cells%20revealed%20alterations%20in%20pathways)). This is an active area of research, and any therapeutic strategy would have to carefully balance the essential role of p115 in normal cells.

Beyond cancer, the involvement of p115 in Golgi structure and vesicle trafficking makes it relevant to various diseases that feature Golgi dysfunction or protein misfolding. For instance, certain neurodegenerative diseases and skeletal dysplasias are linked to Golgi fragmentation phenotypes; while USO1 mutations haven’t been directly implicated, the pathways it governs are often disrupted in those conditions. Additionally, p115 has come onto the radar in virology: some viruses hijack the secretory pathway, and interestingly, a recent proteomic study found that the **SARS-CoV-2 N protein can bind p115** (identified via an interaction screen) ([www.reactome.org](https://www.reactome.org/content/detail/interactor/O60763#:~:text=P0DTC9%20%20,)). The significance of this viral interaction is still unclear, but it raises the possibility that viruses might target p115 to modulate host vesicle traffic for their benefit.

From a research standpoint, p115 is also used as a **marker and tool** in cell biology. Antibodies against p115 are commonly used to stain the Golgi apparatus in imaging experiments (because p115 decorates the Golgi rims) ([www.ptglab.com](https://www.ptglab.com/products/USO1-Antibody-13509-1-AP.htm?srsltid=AfmBOooewwjC3o_zwvjzzrk-gqvUMZJ68dxn4l2-Onhazz9e1KYDry0T#:~:text=...,p115%2C%20USO1%20transfected%20HeLa%20cells)). Functionally, p115 and its yeast counterpart Uso1p have been invaluable in reconstitution experiments: for example, adding recombinant p115 to cell-free systems can restore ER-to-Golgi transport, confirming its sufficiency in tethering ([reactome.org](https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-5694418#:~:text=through%20the%20Golgi%20apparatus%20in,2000)). The protein’s biochemical properties (a long flexible dimer with multiple binding sites) make it a model for studying how **tethering factors and SNAREs cooperate**, an area of intense research in membrane biology. Recent structural biology efforts (e.g., cryo-EM of tethering complexes) are beginning to elucidate how p115’s coiled-coil regions engage SNARE complexes at the molecular level, which could open avenues for drug design targeting these interactions.

**Statistics and Data:** By the numbers, USO1/p115 interacts with a large network of proteins. BioGRID and other databases report over 200 physical interaction partners for p115 in human cells ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/114173/summary/homo-sapiens#:~:text=USO1%20Result%20Summary%20,com%2C%20All%20Rights%20Reserved)), reflecting its central networking role at the Golgi. USO1 gene expression data show it is rather uniformly expressed; it does not tend to be mutated frequently in populations (no common loss-of-function variants are noted in gnomAD, for instance, consistent with it being essential). On the cellular level, p115 molecules are abundantly present – estimated at a few hundred thousand copies per human cell – ensuring that numerous vesicles can be tethered simultaneously. When p115 is experimentally knocked down by ~90%, cells struggle to compensate: secretory cargo transport rates drop dramatically (often measured by delayed Golgi arrival of reporter proteins), and Golgi cisternae lose alignment ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=dependencies%20on%20several%20genes%20including,cells%20revealed%20alterations%20in%20pathways)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)). These quantitative observations underscore p115’s role as a *workhorse of the early secretory pathway*.

# Conclusion  
In conclusion, **USO1 (gene)** encodes **p115 (protein)**, a master regulator of vesicle trafficking and Golgi organization in human cells. **Functionally**, p115 serves as a **structural tether** that docks transport vesicles to the Golgi, working in concert with Rab GTPases, golgin coiled-coil proteins (GM130, giantin), and SNAREs to ensure efficient membrane fusion ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=membrane%20and%20dissociates%20from%20the,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=Golgi%20structure%20%28Alvarez%20et%20al,that%20USO1%2Fp115%20is%20critical%20for)). The **primary role** of p115 is not catalytic but architectural – it creates physical links that maintain the flow of cargo through the secretory pathway and preserve Golgi integrity. It carries out this role at the **cytoplasmic face of the ER–Golgi interface**, cycling on and off membranes depending on the phosphorylation state and cell cycle stage ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=8615#:~:text=Summary%20The%20protein%20encoded%20by,Alternative%20splicing%20results%20in%20multiple)). p115 is integral to **ER-to-Golgi transport, intra-Golgi trafficking, and post-mitotic Golgi reassembly**, with its loss causing severe disruption to these processes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=The%20golgin%20Uso1p%2Fp115%20is%20a,caused%20Golgi%20disruption%20and%20early)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4770024/#:~:text=maintaining%20Golgi%20architecture%20as%20well,2012)). 

Decades of research, from early biochemical assays to modern genetic screens, all converge on the view that **USO1/p115 is essential for cell viability and secretory function**. Recent studies (2020–2024) have expanded our understanding by revealing new interactions (e.g., with Sec16A at ER exit sites ([sciety.org](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2025.10.16.682774#:~:text=proteins%20to%20promote%20membrane%20fusion,of%20the%20early%20secretory%20pathway))) and highlighting p115’s importance in disease contexts (such as cancer cell survival ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8222245/#:~:text=dependencies%20on%20several%20genes%20including,cells%20revealed%20alterations%20in%20pathways))). Going forward, p115 remains a subject of intense interest – both as a model for membrane tethering mechanisms and as a potential target to modulate secretion in diseases. In summary, **USO1/p115’s broader structural role** is to connect and coordinate key elements of the secretory pathway, ensuring that the journey of proteins from the ER to their final destination is smooth and orderly, thereby upholding the secretory and organizational infrastructure fundamental to eukaryotic cell life.
