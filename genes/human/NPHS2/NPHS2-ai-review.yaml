description: >-
  Podocin is a critical scaffolding protein of the slit diaphragm in kidney podocytes.
  It belongs to the stomatin/band-7 protein family and contains a PHB (prohibitin homology)
  domain. Podocin adopts a hairpin-like membrane topology with both N- and C-termini
  facing the cytoplasm. It functions as a lipid raft organizer that recruits nephrin,
  neph1, CD2AP, and TRPC6 into specialized membrane microdomains at the slit diaphragm.
  Podocin binds cholesterol through its PHB domain and regulates mechanosensitive TRPC6
  channel activity. It serves as an essential linker between slit diaphragm components
  and the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in NPHS2 cause autosomal recessive steroid-resistant
  nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, demonstrating its
  crucial role in glomerular filtration barrier function.

      Podocin is a membrane-associated protein that localizes to the plasma membrane
      of podocytes at the slit diaphragm. The IBA annotation is well-supported by
      phylogenetic inference and extensive experimental evidence demonstrating plasma
      membrane localization [PMID:11786407].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Podocin is clearly established as a plasma membrane protein in podocytes. The deep
      research confirms that podocin is an integral membrane protein with a hairpin-like
      topology that positions both N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm while the central
      hydrophobic region associates with the plasma membrane [PMID:11786407]. UniProt also
      annotates isoform 1 to the cell membrane. This is a core localization for podocin function.

      The ER annotation is based on UniProt subcellular location vocabulary mapping.

      This annotation represents a trafficking/biosynthesis location rather than the

      at the slit diaphragm, which is where podocin performs its core scaffolding function.
      The ER localization is specifically for isoform 2 according to UniProt. Disease-causing

      Evidence from pull-down assays demonstrating podocin interacts with NEPH1 family
      proteins through their C-terminal domain.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The generic protein binding term is uninformative for podocin which is known to
      function as a scaffolding protein with specific interactions with nephrin, neph1,
      CD2AP, and TRPC6. These interactions should be captured by more specific MF terms
      if available, or the scaffolding role should be represented in BP annotations.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The original cloning paper [PMID:10742096] correctly identified podocin as an
      integral membrane protein belonging to the stomatin family, which are characteristically
      plasma membrane-associated proteins. This has been validated by subsequent
      experimental studies.

      Podocin functions as a structural scaffold at the slit diaphragm, organizing
      lipid raft microdomains and recruiting key proteins. This molecular function
      annotation captures podocin's essential role.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Podocin's primary molecular function is as a structural scaffolding protein at
      the slit diaphragm. It does not have enzymatic activity but rather serves to
      organize the multiprotein complex at the slit diaphragm. The deep research
      extensively documents this scaffolding role.

      Podocin binds cholesterol through its PHB domain, which is essential for lipid
      raft organization and TRPC6 channel regulation.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Multiple studies have demonstrated that podocin directly binds cholesterol through
      residues in the PHB domain. This cholesterol binding is functionally critical for
      organizing lipid raft microdomains at the slit diaphragm and for proper regulation
      of the TRPC6 channel.
