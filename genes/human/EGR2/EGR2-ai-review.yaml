description: >-
  EGR2 (also known as Krox-20) is a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor belonging to the
  early growth response (EGR) family. Its primary, best-characterized function is as a master
  transcriptional regulator of myelination in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system,
  where it activates myelin structural genes (MPZ, PMP22, GJB1, MAG) in cooperation with SOX10.
  EGR2 binds GC-rich consensus DNA sequences through three C2H2 zinc finger domains and recruits
  the corepressors NAB1 and NAB2 to modulate transcriptional output. It also has an experimentally
  demonstrated E3 SUMO ligase activity, catalyzing SUMO1 conjugation to its own NAB coregulators
  via interaction with UBC9 (PMID:21836637). EGR2 plays critical roles in hindbrain segmentation
  (specifying rhombomeres 3 and 5 through regulation of HOX genes) and in immune tolerance
  (T cell anergy, NK cell dysfunction). Mutations in EGR2, particularly in the zinc finger domains,
  cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and congenital
  hypomyelinating neuropathy.

        EGR2 is a nuclear C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that binds GC-rich EGR
        motifs and recruits NAB1/2 to activate or repress target genes, serving as a master
        regulator of myelin programs in Schwann cells and a node in immune tolerance and
        dysfunction circuits.

    Positive regulation of Schwann cell myelination: EGR2 is a master regulator of peripheral
    nervous system myelination. It promotes Schwann cell differentiation from the premyelinating
    to the myelinating state, activating myelin structural genes (MPZ, PMP22, GJB1, MAG)
    cooperatively with SOX10 and lipid biosynthesis genes (SCD5, CYP51A1, HMGCR) with SREBF2.
    Loss-of-function mutations cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D, Dejerine-Sottas
