description: >
  Stomatin (STOM/EPB72/Band 7.2b) is a 31-kDa integral membrane-associated scaffolding protein
  of the SPFH (stomatin-prohibitin-flotillin-HflK/C) superfamily. The protein contains a
  characteristic Band-7/SPFH domain and forms homo-oligomeric complexes (9-12 monomers) that
  organize cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid rafts). Stomatin
  is palmitoylated at Cys-30 and Cys-87, anchoring it to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma
  membrane via an intramembrane hydrophobic segment (residues 26-54). The protein is abundantly
  expressed in erythrocyte membranes and platelets, where it associates with transporters and
  ion channels including GLUT1 (SLC2A1), anion exchanger 1 (AE1/SLC4A1), and aquaporin-1.
  Stomatin positively regulates AE1-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity through direct
  protein-protein interaction, and modulates GLUT1 substrate preference toward
  L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) during erythroid maturation. Loss of stomatin in hereditary
  stomatocytosis (stomatin-deficient cryohydrocytosis) is associated with RBC cation leak
  and hemolytic anemia. Stomatin also modulates acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) activity,
  functioning as an ion channel inhibitor in the broader context of mechanosensation and
  chemosensation.

      Stomatin regulates ASIC2 and ASIC3 channel activity according to UniProt functional

      stomatin-domain proteins modulate acid-sensing ion channels in sensory signaling
      contexts [PMID:31949695, Carattino & Montalbetti 2020]. This represents a core
