## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8N138
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ORM1-like protein 3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ORMDL3;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ORM family. .
- **Key Domains:** ORMDL. (IPR007203); ORMDL (PF04061)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ORMDL3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ORMDL3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ORMDL3** (gene ID: ORMDL3, UniProt: Q8N138) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human ORMDL3 (UniProt Q8N138)

Verification of target identity and nomenclature
- Gene/protein match: ORMDL3 (ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3) corresponds to a 153–amino-acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored, multi-pass transmembrane protein encoded at chromosome 17q21, consistently described in recent reviews and disease-focused analyses, aligning with the UniProt-provided identity and nomenclature (human; ORM family) (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 1-2, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4). Zhang 2023 explicitly notes “human ORMDL3… 153 amino acids… ER-anchored transmembrane protein,” and places it in the 17q21 asthma risk locus with GSDMB and ZPBP2 (Chinese Medical Journal Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine; online 14 Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pccm.2023.08.001) (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 1-2). Malicevic 2024 similarly describes ORMDL3 as an ER-resident multi-pass protein of the ORMDL family at 17q21 (Journal of Biotechnology and Biomedicine; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.26502/jbb.2642-91280167) (malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4). Demkova 2024 places ORMDL3 within the conserved ORM/ORMDL family (yeast ORM1/2; mammalian ORMDL1–3) (Frontiers in Immunology; 25 Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1376629) (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary role: ER-resident regulator of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis via direct inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid production; ORMDL3 is a regulatory subunit of the SPT complex (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6). Recent structural and mechanistic syntheses emphasize that ORMDL3 regulates SPT through direct physical association and ceramide-dependent feedback (BioEssays; 3 Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.70036) (mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6).
- Feedback mechanism: Ceramide binds to the human SPT–ORMDL complex to signal elevated sphingolipid levels; this promotes ORMDL-mediated SPT inhibition, forming a homeostatic negative-feedback loop (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6). Mutations in conserved sites (e.g., ORMDL3 Asn13) reduce ceramide responsiveness, supporting the model (mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6).
- Additional cellular roles: ORMDL3 perturbs ER Ca2+ homeostasis (reported interaction with SERCA), activates components of the unfolded protein response (UPR; especially ATF6, PERK–eIF2α), and intersects with autophagy and inflammasome signaling (malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4). In airway and immune cells, ORMDL3 influences ICAM1 expression, eosinophil activation/trafficking, and airway smooth muscle proliferation and Ca2+ oscillations (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4).
- Localization/topology: Conserved ER membrane protein, multi-pass transmembrane, acting in cis at the ER where SPT resides (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority; 2025 select)
- Mechanistic regulation of SPT and ceramide feedback: Contemporary structural/mechanistic review consolidates that ORMDL3 is embedded in the SPT complex, with the ORMDL N-terminus occluding the SPT substrate site and ceramide binding modulating inhibition sensitivity—detailing a multilayered control of sphingolipid biosynthesis (BioEssays 2025; https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.70036) (mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6).
- Immune homeostasis and lymphocyte development: In mice, simultaneous deletion of Ormdl1 and Ormdl3 disrupts blood and splenic immune cell homeostasis, with elevated sphingolipid production in bone marrow and spleen; B-cell developmental defects were intrinsic (competitive bone marrow transplantation) (Frontiers in Immunology 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1376629) (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14).
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) perspective: Network and literature synthesis highlights ORMDL3 as a central hub linking ER stress/UPR, autophagy, inflammasome signaling (NLRP3), oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction; the review argues ORMDL3 is a rational therapeutic target in IBD (Journal of Biotechnology and Biomedicine 2024; https://doi.org/10.26502/jbb.2642-91280167) (malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 10-12, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4).
- Innate immune signaling and oncology: ORMDL3 negatively regulates type I IFN signaling by binding MAVS and promoting proteasome-mediated RIG-I degradation through disrupting USP10–RIG-I interaction; ORMDL3 inhibition enhanced anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses in syngeneic mouse models (eLife; Version of Record 24 Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.101973.3) (zeng2025ormdl3restrainstype pages 1-2).
- Asthma genetics and translational framing: 2023 review positions ORMDL3 among top GWAS-implicated asthma genes with therapeutic potential, summarizing functional roles across airway structural and immune cells (Chinese Medical Journal Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pccm.2023.08.001) (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Pharmacogenomics of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) response: A pediatric biobank study reported that combined rare+common variants at the GSDMB/ORMDL3 locus were associated with ICS response (defined as ED visits/hospitalizations over one year) in White children in the discovery cohort (PrecisionLink Biobank: N=91 White; p=0.003) and replicated in the BIG Initiative (N=83 White; p=0.02) using region-based SKAT tests adjusted for age, sex, BMI with Bonferroni correction (0.05/12=0.004) (Genes; published 28 Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15040420) (voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 1-2, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 2-4). Secondary single-variant analyses (PrecisionLink White) identified nominal associations for intronic SNPs such as rs4065275 (beta 1.33, SE 0.53, p=0.01), rs2290400 (beta 1.07, SE 0.48, p=0.02), rs36000226 (beta 0.93, SE 0.42, p=0.03), among others; the joint signal appeared polygenic across multiple intronic SNPs (voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 4-5, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 5-7). Limitations include small sample sizes (especially Black children in PrecisionLink, N=20) and EHR-derived outcomes (voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 5-7).
- Clinical correlates of expression (asthma control, FeNO): In 97 children (59 asthmatic; 38 controls), ORMDL3 expression was 6.74-fold higher in poorly controlled asthma (ACT ≤15) versus well controlled (ACT ≥20) with significant difference for ΔCq (p=0.015), and ΔCq correlated negatively with ACT (p=0.003, r=-0.418); FeNO >25 ppb associated with a 2.93-fold higher ORMDL3 expression (p≈0.051) (Northern Clinics of Istanbul; online 28 Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.14744/nci.2023.22120) (almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 4-6, almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 1-2). GSDMB expression tracked similarly (11.74-fold higher at low ACT; ΔCq correlation p=0.016, r=-0.345) and strongly correlated with ORMDL3 expression (r=0.80, p<0.001) (almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Mechanistic expert synthesis: BioEssays 2025 provides an authoritative, mechanism-centric review consolidating cryo-EM and mutational evidence for ORMDL3-regulated SPT inhibition and ceramide feedback, placing ORMDL3 as an integral regulatory subunit of the SPT complex that enforces homeostasis of sphingolipid biosynthesis (https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.70036) (mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6).
- Disease-focused expert framing: Zhang 2023 argues ORMDL3 is a high-potential asthma therapeutic target based on replicated 17q21 genetics and multi-system functional evidence across airway epithelium and immune compartments (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pccm.2023.08.001) (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 1-2). Malicevic 2024 designates ORMDL3 as a hub gene linking ER stress/UPR and inflammatory/autophagy pathways, supporting therapeutic exploration in IBD (https://doi.org/10.26502/jbb.2642-91280167) (malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 10-12, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Pediatric ICS response pharmacogenomics: GSDMB/ORMDL3 region-based association in White children—PrecisionLink discovery N=91 White (p=0.003) with replication in BIG N=83 White (p=0.02). Single-SNP examples: rs4065275 beta 1.33 (SE 0.53; p=0.01); rs2290400 beta 1.07 (SE 0.48; p=0.02); rs36000226 beta 0.93 (SE 0.42; p=0.03) (Genes; 28 Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes15040420) (voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 4-5, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 1-2).
- Pediatric asthma control and biomarkers: In 59 asthmatic children vs 38 controls, ORMDL3 expression increased 6.74-fold at ACT ≤15 vs ≥20 (p=0.015); ΔCq–ACT correlation r=-0.418 (p=0.003). FeNO >25 ppb had ~2.93-fold higher ORMDL3 (p≈0.051). FeNO correlated negatively with ACT (r=-0.56, p<0.0001) (Northern Clinics of Istanbul; 28 Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.14744/nci.2023.22120) (almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 4-6, almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 1-2).
- Mouse immunology and lipids: Ormdl1/Ormdl3 double deletion reduced immune cell content in blood/spleen, with strongly increased sphingolipid production in spleen and bone marrow; B-cell defects were cell intrinsic (Frontiers in Immunology; 25 Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1376629) (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14).

Functional mechanism and pathway placement
- Biochemical function: ORMDL3 is a non-enzymatic transmembrane regulator that inhibits SPT within the ER, implementing ceramide-responsive negative feedback to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis (demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6). This places ORMDL3 at the very entry point of de novo sphingolipid synthesis, upstream of ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate pools that influence cell signaling and membrane composition (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6).
- Cellular compartment: ER membrane; multi-pass topology consistent with direct association to ER-localized SPT and modulation of ER Ca2+ handling and UPR (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4).
- Pathways: Sphingolipid metabolism (SPT–ORMDL3 complex; ceramide feedback), ER stress/UPR (ATF6, PERK–eIF2α; IRE1/NF-κB links), calcium homeostasis (SERCA interaction), autophagy (Beclin-1 regulation), inflammasome (NLRP3 via TXNIP and ER–mitochondria contacts), and innate antiviral signaling (RIG-I/MAVS axis) (mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4, zeng2025ormdl3restrainstype pages 1-2).

Caveats and open questions
- Pharmacogenomic signals at GSDMB/ORMDL3 for ICS response are promising but derive from modest sample sizes and EHR-defined outcomes; effect estimates are preliminary and race-stratified replication remains limited (voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 1-2, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 5-7). Expression–phenotype associations in pediatric asthma suggest utility as biomarkers of poor control, but larger, longitudinal cohorts and standardized protocols are needed to validate thresholds and clinical integration (almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 1-2).

Conclusion
Human ORMDL3 (Q8N138) is a conserved, multi-pass ER membrane regulator that gates SPT activity and enforces ceramide-dependent feedback across sphingolipid biosynthesis. Recent work consolidates its mechanistic role in SPT inhibition and extends ORMDL3’s functional reach to ER calcium/UPR–autophagy–inflammasome networks and to innate immunity via RIG-I turnover. Translationally, ORMDL3 remains a priority target candidate in asthma (17q21) with early pharmacogenomic signals for pediatric ICS response, and is emerging as a hub candidate in IBD. Future directions include structure-guided modulation of the SPT–ORMDL interface, selective interference with ceramide sensing, and evaluation of ORMDL3-targeted approaches to fine-tune sphingolipid flux and immune signaling in airway and intestinal disease (zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 3-4, demkova2024simultaneousdeletionof pages 14-14, mahawar2025intricateregulationof pages 4-6, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 10-12, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 4-6, zhang2023fromgeneidentifications pages 1-2, malicevic2024modulationoforosomucoidlike pages 3-4, zeng2025ormdl3restrainstype pages 1-2, almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 4-6, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 2-4, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 4-5, almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 1-2, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 1-2, voorhies2024gsdmbormdl3rarecommonvariants pages 5-7, almacıoglu2023associationofchildhood pages 7-9).
