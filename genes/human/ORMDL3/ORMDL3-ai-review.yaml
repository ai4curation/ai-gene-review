description: >-
  ORMDL3 (ORM1-like protein 3) is a conserved, multi-pass transmembrane protein
  of 153 amino acids that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It
  functions as a ceramide-sensitive regulatory subunit of the serine
  palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex (SPTLC1/SPTLC2/ssSPTa/ORMDL3), the enzyme
  that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in de novo sphingolipid
  biosynthesis. ORMDL3 acts as a negative regulator of SPT: its N-terminus
  physically occludes the substrate entry tunnel of SPT, and this inhibitory
  conformation is stabilized by ceramide binding, thereby implementing a
  homeostatic negative feedback loop that maintains sphingolipid levels.
  Structurally resolved by cryo-EM, ORMDL3 has four transmembrane helices and a
  cytoplasmic N-terminal ceramide-sensing region. The 17q21 locus containing
  ORMDL3 is the strongest and most replicated genetic risk locus for childhood
  asthma. Beyond sphingolipid regulation, ORMDL3 has been implicated in ER
  stress/UPR signaling, ER calcium homeostasis, and autophagy regulation in
  immune cells, though these may represent downstream consequences of altered
  sphingolipid metabolism rather than independent molecular functions.

    label: enzyme inhibitor activity

  original_reference_id: PMID:33558761
  review:
    summary: >-
      ORMDL3 functions as a direct inhibitor of the SPT enzyme by physically
      occluding the substrate entry tunnel through its N-terminus. Cryo-EM
      structures at 2.6 Angstrom resolution show that ORMDL3 blocks the
      substrate-binding tunnel and competes with substrate binding. This is the
      primary molecular function of ORMDL3.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      ORMDL3 has no MF annotation other than the uninformative protein binding.
      The structural and biochemical evidence clearly demonstrates that ORMDL3
      functions as an enzyme inhibitor of SPT. This is the core molecular
      function of the protein.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:37308477
  review:
    summary: >-
      Xie et al. 2023 demonstrated that ceramide binds to the N-terminus of
      ORMDL3, stabilizing an inhibitory conformation. Key residue Asn13 is
      critical for ceramide binding; N13A mutation disrupts ceramide
      responsiveness. Cryo-EM structures resolved the ceramide-bound SPT-ORMDL3
      complex.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Ceramide binding is a critical molecular function of ORMDL3 that enables
      the homeostatic feedback loop. This is structurally and mutagenetically

        binding site for the suppression of SPT activity.

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:20182505
  review:
    summary: >-
      Breslow et al. 2010 established that ORM/ORMDL proteins are negative
      regulators of sphingolipid biosynthesis. RNAi knockdown of all three
      ORMDL genes in HeLa cells increased ceramide levels three-fold,
      demonstrating the negative regulatory role. This term captures the
      specific directionality of ORMDL3's regulatory function better than the
      more general terms currently annotated.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This term specifically captures ORMDL3's role as a negative regulator of
      sphingolipid biosynthesis, which is more precise than the existing
      GO:0030148 (sphingolipid biosynthetic process) annotation. The current
      GO annotations lack a biological process term that specifies the negative
      regulatory direction.

  title: ORMDL/serine palmitoyltransferase stoichiometry determines effects of ORMDL3 expression on sphingolipid biosynthesis.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      ORMDLs and SPT form stable complexes in human cells. ORMDL is normally
      expressed in functional excess relative to SPT, meaning ORMDL3
      overexpression does not further suppress biosynthesis. The relationship
      between ORMDL3 expression and sphingolipid levels is complex and
      stoichiometry-dependent.
    supporting_text: >-
      We determined that ORMDL is expressed in functional excess relative to
      SPT at normal levels of expression. ORMDLs and SPT form stable complexes
      that are not increased by elevated ORMDL3 expression.

    Negative regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity as a
    ceramide-sensitive regulatory subunit of the SPT holoenzyme complex.
    ORMDL3 physically occludes the SPT substrate entry tunnel through its
    N-terminus, competing with substrate binding (PMID:33558761). Ceramide
    binding to the ORMDL3 N-terminus (Asn13-dependent) stabilizes this
    inhibitory conformation, implementing homeostatic feedback control of
    de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis (PMID:37308477).
