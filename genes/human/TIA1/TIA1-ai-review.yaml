description: 'TIA1 is an RNA-binding protein containing three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal glutamine-rich prion-like domain. It functions as a master regulator of gene expression by controlling alternative splicing through U1 snRNP recruitment to weak 5'' splice sites followed by U-rich sequences, nucleating stress granules under cellular stress, and repressing translation by binding AU-rich elements in mRNA 3''UTRs. TIA1 plays critical roles in apoptosis regulation, stress response, and immune cell function.'

  review:
    summary: TIA1 is extensively validated as a regulator of alternative splicing through phylogenetic inference and multiple experimental studies
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of TIA1, well-supported by both IBA inference and extensive experimental evidence. TIA1 binds to U-rich sequences downstream of 5' splice sites and recruits U1 snRNP to regulate alternative splicing of multiple genes including Fas, CFTR, COL2A1, and FGFR2.

  review:
    summary: TIA1 acts as an adaptor between RNA and U1 snRNP components, bridging RNA recognition and protein recruitment
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This accurately captures TIA1's dual role of binding pre-mRNA via its RRM domains while simultaneously interacting with U1 snRNP components (particularly U1-C) to facilitate spliceosome assembly. This adaptor function is central to how TIA1 promotes U1 snRNP recruitment to weak splice sites.

  review:
    summary: Too general; TIA1's binding specificity is better captured by more specific RNA binding terms
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct (TIA1 does bind nucleic acids including RNA and has been shown to bind DNA in COL2A1 genomic DNA), this term is too broad and uninformative. The more specific 'RNA binding' (GO:0003723) better represents TIA1's primary molecular function, which is extensively characterized for RNA. Note that TIA1 can also bind DNA but this appears to be a minor function.

    summary: TIA1 was originally identified in cytotoxic granules and promotes apoptosis through splicing regulation
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: TIA1 plays a role in apoptosis through multiple mechanisms - it was originally identified as inducing DNA fragmentation in target cells, and it regulates alternative splicing of the Fas receptor to promote the membrane-bound apoptotic form. However, this may be more of a context-dependent function rather than a core constitutive function.

  review:
    summary: Early characterization as poly(A) binding protein
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The original paper characterized TIA1 as a polyadenylate-binding protein based on sequence similarity to poly(A)-binding proteins. While TIA1's binding is more accurately described as U-rich/AU-rich element binding, it can bind poly(A) sequences and this represents the historical characterization of the protein.
