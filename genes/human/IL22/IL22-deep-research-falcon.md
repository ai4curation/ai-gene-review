## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9GZX6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-22; Short=IL-22; AltName: Full=Cytokine Zcyto18; AltName: Full=IL-10-related T-cell-derived-inducible factor; Short=IL-TIF; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL22; Synonyms=ILTIF, ZCYTO18; ORFNames=UNQ3099/PRO10096;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IL-10 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 4_helix_cytokine-like_core. (IPR009079); IL-10_CS. (IPR020423); IL-22. (IPR020453); IL22 (PF14565)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL22" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL22' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL22** (gene ID: IL22, UniProt: Q9GZX6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human IL-22 (IL22; UniProt Q9GZX6)

Identity verification and scope
- Gene/protein check: The request targets human IL-22 (IL22; UniProt Q9GZX6), a secreted IL-10 family cytokine with a four-helix bundle fold. Literature consistently identifies IL-22 as an IL-10 family cytokine acting primarily on non-hematopoietic epithelial and parenchymal cells, matching the UniProt family/domain context and organism (Homo sapiens) provided. Foundational reviews and disease-focused summaries align on receptor usage, signaling, and epithelial tropism (publication URLs and dates below) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1, mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 2-4, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Cytokine family and structure: IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family; it is an α-helical, secreted cytokine that targets epithelial barriers (International Immunology, Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1).
- Receptor composition and target-cell restriction: IL-22 signals via a class II cytokine receptor heterodimer composed of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2 (IL-10Rβ). IL-22R1 expression is largely restricted to non-hematopoietic cells (e.g., intestinal epithelium, keratinocytes, hepatocytes), explaining tissue-targeted effects (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929) (mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 2-4, mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 7-9).
- Signaling: Engagement of IL-22R1/IL-10R2 activates JAK1 and TYK2, dominantly signaling through STAT3, with context-dependent activation of STAT1/STAT5. STAT3 drives epithelial survival, proliferation, and repair programs (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Cellular sources: Principal producers include adaptive Th22 and Th17 CD4+ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILC3/LTi-like), with contributions from γδ T cells and NK/NKT cells; AHR and IL-23–related circuits regulate production depending on tissue and inflammation (Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001; Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1, mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 2-4).
- Localization and regulation: IL-22 is secreted and acts on nearby epithelial/parenchymal targets. Activity is buffered by a high-affinity soluble decoy receptor, IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP/IL22RA2), which neutralizes IL-22 and is dynamically regulated in gut inflammation (Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929; IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Core epithelial/repair functions: IL-22 induces antimicrobial peptides (e.g., Reg, β-defensins), mucins, and tight-junction/barrier programs; it stimulates epithelial proliferation and wound healing in gut and skin and promotes hepatocyte survival via STAT3 (Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001; Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-4).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 emphasis)
- IBD and mucosal immunity: A 2024 review synthesizes 2022–2024 studies, reaffirming IL-22’s epithelial-repair actions via JAK1/TYK2→STAT3 and detailing IL-22BP as a physiological antagonist that can blunt IL-22-driven mucosal healing. It highlights context-dependent outcomes (protective in acute injury; potential inflammation/proliferation if dysregulated) and emerging mechanistic insights (Paneth cell support; impacts on epithelial differentiation and mucin biology) (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Liver disease and biomarkers: Reviews in 2024 discuss IL-22 as part of biomarker panels and as a therapeutic pathway in liver failure and alcoholic hepatitis, reflecting its hepatocyte-protective, anti-apoptotic STAT3 programs; they note evaluation of IL-22–based interventions and prognostic value of interleukins including IL-22 (World Journal of Clinical Cases, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v12.i27.6045) ().
- MASLD/MASH: A 2024 review underscores a largely protective signature for IL-22 in metabolic liver disease models and discusses translational testing of IL-22 as a therapeutic strategy in MASLD, contrasting it with pro-fibrogenic IL-17 effects (Frontiers in Immunology, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437046) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1).
- Extraintestinal/oncology context: 2024 analyses explore IL-22 in tumor microenvironments (e.g., lung cancer), consolidating receptor biology and potential biomarker/therapeutic targeting roles, though clinical utility remains investigational (Heliyon, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35901) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3).

Current applications and real-world/translational implementations
- Antagonism in atopic dermatitis (AD): Phase 2 data (NCT01941537) for the anti–IL-22 monoclonal antibody fezakinumab (ILV-094) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD reported differential outcomes over time. Mean SCORAD change at Week 12: −13.8 with fezakinumab vs −8.0 with placebo (p=0.134); at Week 20: −18.8 vs −11.7 (p=0.049), indicating a later emerging separation. This trial enrolled 60 adults (Biomolecules, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15060838). While published in 2025, it synthesizes earlier trial results and translational analyses that inform 2023–2024 clinical thinking. Safety details were not provided in the excerpt; biomarker-responder signatures (e.g., “fezakinumab response” subsets) have been discussed in the AD translational literature and reviews (lo2025advancingtherapeuticstrategies pages 8-10).
- Agonism in GI and liver indications: Contemporary reviews (2024) describe the rationale and ongoing clinical exploration of long-acting IL-22 fusion proteins (e.g., IL-22–Fc formats) to enhance epithelial repair in ulcerative colitis and to protect hepatocytes in alcoholic hepatitis/acute-on-chronic liver contexts; they emphasize STAT3-mediated cytoprotective programs and the need to mitigate epithelial hyperproliferation risks by dose/regional targeting (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121; World Journal of Clinical Cases, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v12.i27.6045; Frontiers in Immunology, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437046) (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Consensus on epithelial tropism and duality: Authoritative reviews emphasize IL-22’s dual nature—protective in acute epithelial injury through antimicrobial induction and proliferation, yet potentially pathogenic with chronic overexpression (psoriasiform changes, context-dependent inflammation). This duality supports a precision approach: antagonize in diseases of epithelial hyperproliferation (e.g., subsets of AD/psoriasis), and agonize in barrier failure and hepatocellular injury (Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001; Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929; IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-4, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Regulatory buffering by IL-22BP: Experts highlight IL-22BP as a critical tissue checkpoint that can be induced during inflammation (e.g., by TNF) to limit IL-22’s reparative STAT3 signaling; therapeutic strategies must consider IL-22BP dynamics to avoid blunting desired repair or, conversely, to restrain excessive proliferation (Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929; IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Tissue-selective targeting and safety: Recent analyses argue for cell- or organ-targeted IL-22 agonists and careful patient selection for antagonists (e.g., AD endotypes), acknowledging risks of epithelial hyperplasia and theoretical neoplasia with prolonged STAT3 activation. This is consistent with historic transgenic and mechanistic data (Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001; Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- AD antagonism (fezakinumab/ILV-094): Phase 2 randomized trial (adults, n=60). SCORAD change: Week 12 −13.8 vs −8.0 (p=0.134); Week 20 −18.8 vs −11.7 (p=0.049). Interpretation: modest, delayed clinical separation; responder stratification remains an active area for biomarker-led selection (Biomolecules, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15060838) (lo2025advancingtherapeuticstrategies pages 8-10).
- IBD and barrier metrics: 2024 synthesis reiterates STAT3-centric epithelial responses (tight junction reinforcement, antimicrobial peptides, mucins) as measurable pharmacodynamic endpoints for IL-22 agonism, with IL-22BP levels and epithelial program readouts as translational biomarkers (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Liver disease: 2024 liver-focused reviews note exploration of IL-22 in prognostic biomarker panels for liver failure and emphasize evaluation of IL-22–based interventions in alcoholic hepatitis/related conditions; clinical endpoints typically include MELD/Lille scores and short-term mortality/organ function in these indications (World Journal of Clinical Cases, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v12.i27.6045) ().

Functional annotation summary (mechanisms, processes, localization)
- Primary function: IL-22 is a secreted cytokine messenger from Th22/Th17/ILC3 and related lymphocytes that signals via IL-22R1/IL-10R2 on non-hematopoietic epithelial/parenchymal cells to activate JAK1/TYK2→STAT3 and related pathways. This induces antimicrobial, mucus, tight-junction, and proliferative/repair programs that restore barrier integrity and support tissue survival, particularly in gut, skin, lung, and liver (2011–2012 mechanistic foundation; 2024 updates) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1, mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 2-4, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Cellular/cellular-compartment localization: Secreted; acts on epithelial targets (keratinocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, airway epithelium) and parenchymal cells such as hepatocytes. Notably, hematopoietic cells generally lack IL-22R1, conferring tissue selectivity (Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929) (mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 2-4, mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 7-9).
- Pathway role: A type-3 immunity effector that complements IL-17 biology; IL-22’s dominant output is epithelial protection/repair, counterbalanced by IL-22BP and context-specific cytokine milieus (e.g., IL-17A/IFN-γ can modulate outcomes) (Sep 2012; https://doi.org/10.1002/ibd.22929; Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437046) (mizoguchi2012healingofintestinal pages 7-9, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1).

Major disease areas (representative evidence)
- IBD (UC/CD): Elevated IL-22 in active disease; protective epithelial repair vs potential chronic proinflammatory effects are context-dependent; IL-22BP induction can hinder mucosal healing, suggesting therapeutic windows for agonism or IL-22BP modulation (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010121) (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 7-9, aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11).
- Atopic dermatitis/psoriasis: IL-22 drives keratinocyte hyperplasia and barrier dysfunction in subsets; anti–IL-22 therapy shows signals in severe AD populations with late divergence, motivating biomarker-led patient selection (Int Immunol, Mar 2011; https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxr001; Biomolecules, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15060838) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3, lo2025advancingtherapeuticstrategies pages 8-10).
- Alcoholic hepatitis/acute liver failure spectrum and MASLD/MASH: Preclinical and translational analyses position IL-22 as hepatoprotective via STAT3; 2024 reviews document ongoing evaluation and biomarker roles (World Journal of Clinical Cases, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v12.i27.6045; Frontiers in Immunology, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437046) (zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 1-1).
- Neuro/oncology exploratory contexts: Associations with glial activation and tumor microenvironments are reported but remain investigational for clinical translation (Frontiers in Pharmacology, Sep 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.958022; Heliyon, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35901) (chen2022interleukin22and pages 1-2, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3).

Notes on limitations and data gaps
- While 2023–2024 reviews and analyses provide strong mechanistic and translational grounding, head-to-head and large late-phase clinical data in IL-22 agonism (e.g., epithelial indications) remain limited in the excerpts retrieved here. Reported AD antagonism results (fezakinumab) suggest modest but potentially endotype-specific efficacy, underscoring the importance of biomarker-led trial designs and endpoint timing (lo2025advancingtherapeuticstrategies pages 8-10). Future targeted-delivery approaches and careful attention to IL-22BP and STAT3-driven proliferation risks are recurrent expert themes (aebisher2024keyinterleukinsin pages 9-11, zenewicz2011recentadvancesin pages 3-3).
