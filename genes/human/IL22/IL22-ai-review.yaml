description: Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a secreted cytokine of the IL-10 family that
  plays critical roles in innate immunity, tissue repair, and inflammation at barrier
  surfaces. Unlike most cytokines, IL-22 acts primarily on non-immune cells (epithelial
  cells, hepatocytes) through the IL-22R1/IL-10RB receptor complex, activating JAK-STAT
  signaling to promote antimicrobial defense, epithelial proliferation, and tissue
  regeneration. IL-22 is produced mainly by activated T cells (Th17/Th22) and innate
  lymphoid cells (ILC3) in response to infection and inflammation. Its activity is
  tightly regulated by the soluble antagonist IL-22BP (IL-22RA2), creating a balanced
  system essential for maintaining barrier integrity while preventing excessive tissue
  responses.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Cytokine activity is a well-established core molecular function of IL-22.
      Multiple lines of evidence confirm IL-22 functions as a secreted signaling molecule
      that binds to cell surface receptors (IL-22R1/IL-10RB) to mediate intercellular
      communication. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from well-characterized
      orthologs across vertebrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IL-22 is definitively a cytokine - it is a secreted protein that signals
      through specific receptors to mediate immune and tissue responses. This is supported
      by extensive structural, biochemical, and functional studies since its discovery
      in 2000. The protein binds IL-22R1 with high affinity and signals through JAK-STAT
      pathways, fulfilling all criteria for cytokine activity.

  review:
    summary: IL-22 is definitively localized to the extracellular space as a secreted
      cytokine. The protein contains a signal peptide (aa 1-33) that directs it through
      the secretory pathway, and mature IL-22 functions in the extracellular environment
      where it binds to receptors on target cells. The IBA annotation is well-supported
      by phylogenetic conservation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IL-22 is a secreted protein that functions in the extracellular space.
      Multiple structural and functional studies confirm its extracellular localization,
      including crystal structures of IL-22 bound to its receptor and functional assays
      showing it acts on cell surface receptors. This is a core aspect of IL-22 biology.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IL-22 has complex, context-dependent effects on inflammation. While it
      can have anti-inflammatory effects through tissue protection and barrier maintenance,
      it also has well-documented pro-inflammatory activities in many contexts, particularly
      in autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The negative
      regulation annotation captures only one aspect of IL-22 function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: IL-22 has dual pro- and anti-inflammatory effects depending on context.
      In acute injury, it promotes tissue repair and can limit inflammation through
      barrier protection. However, in chronic inflammation (psoriasis, IBD), IL-22
      often drives pathogenic inflammation. A more accurate annotation would be "regulation
      of inflammatory response" (GO:0050727) or maintaining both positive and negative
      regulation terms to capture this duality.

    summary: Signal transduction is too general a term for IL-22. While IL-22 does

      this annotation lacks specificity. More precise terms describing IL-22 receptor

  review:
    summary: IL-22 specifically binds to the IL-22 receptor complex composed of IL-22R1
      (IL-22RA1) and IL-10RB (IL-10R2). This is a core molecular function that has
      been extensively characterized through structural and biochemical studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Interleukin-22 receptor binding is a defining molecular function of IL-22.
      The protein binds with high affinity to IL-22R1 and forms a signaling complex
      with IL-10RB. This specific receptor binding activity distinguishes IL-22 from
      other IL-10 family members and is essential for all IL-22 biological functions.
