description: 'Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a secreted cytokine of the IL-10 family that plays critical roles in innate immunity, tissue repair, and inflammation at barrier surfaces. Unlike most cytokines, IL-22 acts primarily on non-immune cells (epithelial cells, hepatocytes) through the IL-22R1/IL-10RB receptor complex, activating JAK-STAT signaling to promote antimicrobial defense, epithelial proliferation, and tissue regeneration. IL-22 is produced mainly by activated T cells (Th17/Th22) and innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in response to infection and inflammation. Its activity is tightly regulated by the soluble antagonist IL-22BP (IL-22RA2), creating a balanced system essential for maintaining barrier integrity while preventing excessive tissue responses.'

  review:
    summary: 'Cytokine activity is a well-established core molecular function of IL-22. Multiple lines of evidence confirm IL-22 functions as a secreted signaling molecule that binds to cell surface receptors (IL-22R1/IL-10RB) to mediate intercellular communication. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from well-characterized orthologs across vertebrates.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'IL-22 is definitively a cytokine - it is a secreted protein that signals through specific receptors to mediate immune and tissue responses. This is supported by extensive structural, biochemical, and functional studies since its discovery in 2000. The protein binds IL-22R1 with high affinity and signals through JAK-STAT pathways, fulfilling all criteria for cytokine activity.'

    summary: 'IL-22 has complex, context-dependent effects on inflammation.
