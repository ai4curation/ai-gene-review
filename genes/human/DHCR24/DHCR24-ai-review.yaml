description: DHCR24 encodes Delta(24)-sterol reductase (also known as seladin-1),
  the terminal enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis that catalyzes the reduction of
  the delta-24 double bond of sterol intermediates, primarily converting desmosterol
  to cholesterol. The enzyme is FAD-dependent, requires NADPH as a cofactor, and is
  localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. DHCR24 also confers neuroprotection
  against oxidative stress and amyloid-beta toxicity. Mutations in DHCR24 cause desmosterolosis,
  a rare autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis characterized by
  multiple congenital anomalies and elevated desmosterol levels.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for cytoplasm is questionable. While DHCR24 may have some
      cytoplasmic presence, all experimental evidence from multiple studies consistently
      shows primary localization to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with its catalytic
      domain facing the cytoplasm [PMID:11007892, PMID:22010141]. The cytoplasmic
      annotation likely reflects the cytoplasmic orientation of the catalytic domain
      rather than true cytoplasmic localization.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is misleading as it suggests cytoplasmic localization
      when the protein is actually an integral ER membrane protein with a cytoplasmic-facing
      catalytic domain. The UniProt record and experimental evidence clearly establish
      ER membrane as the primary localization [PMID:11007892, PMID:22010141].

        of ER, whereas the predicted transmembrane (TM) domain-deleted DHCR24 mutation
        is localized to the cytoplasm. The change of DHCR24 localization suggests
        that the N-terminal TM domain is essential for the ER membrane targeting of
        DHCR24.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for steroid metabolic process is accurate. DHCR24 is a
      key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, which is part of steroid metabolism.
      The annotation is at an appropriate level of specificity given that cholesterol
      is the precursor for all steroid hormones.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DHCR24 clearly participates in steroid metabolism through its essential
      role in cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol is both a steroid itself and the
      precursor for all steroid hormones. The IBA annotation is well-supported by
