description: 'NEUROG2 encodes neurogenin-2, a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
  transcription factor that is the predominant neurogenin in mammalian cortical neurogenesis.
  The protein functions in the nucleus where it binds E-box DNA motifs (CANNTG), with
  preference for CAT-containing E-boxes, forming heterodimers with E-proteins to activate
  transcription. NEUROG2 drives neuronal fate commitment and differentiation by directly
  activating key neurogenic target genes including Dll1, Dll3, Rnd2, Neurod1, Neurod2,
  and Lhx2. The protein exhibits context-dependent chromatin binding and pioneer-like
  activity that is modulated by phosphorylation at T149, which acts as a rheostat
  between chromatin remodeling and transactivation functions. In cortical progenitors,
  NEUROG2 is enriched in intermediate progenitors where it initiates neuronal differentiation
  programs. Its activity is suppressed by LHX2 in progenitors to regulate proper dendritic
  morphogenesis. NEUROG2 displays human-specific regulatory programs including activation
  of PPP1R17 and ECM genes. It is also upregulated in MYCN-driven neuroendocrine prostate
  cancer where it becomes essential for maintaining neuroendocrine differentiation.'

        function as a sequence-specific transcription factor that drives RNA 
        polymerase II-mediated transcription. Deep research confirms NEUROG2 
        binds E-box motifs and activates neurogenic gene expression programs

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: glutamatergic neuron differentiation
    proposed_definition: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell 
      acquires specialized features of a glutamatergic neuron, an excitatory 
      neuron that uses glutamate as its primary neurotransmitter.
    justification: NEUROG2 is known to specify excitatory glutamatergic neuron 
      fate in cortex, but this specific function is not captured in existing 
      annotations. A more specific term than general neuron differentiation 
      would capture this cell type-specific function.

        supporting_text: "NEUROG2 is the predominant neurogenin in cortical neurogenesis
          driving excitatory neuron differentiation programs."
  - proposed_name: negative regulation of glial cell differentiation
    proposed_definition: Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the 
      frequency, rate or extent of glial cell differentiation.
    justification: Proneural factors like NEUROG2 promote neuronal fate while 
      suppressing glial fate in neural progenitors. This reciprocal regulation 
      is an important aspect of NEUROG2 function not represented in current 
      annotations.
suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the functional significance of the NEUROG2-PFDN5 
      interaction identified in the HuRI interactome?
  - question: Are there specific E-protein partners (e.g., TCF3, TCF4, TCF12) 
      that preferentially heterodimerize with NEUROG2 in cortical progenitors?
  - question: How do the human-specific NEUROG2 targets (PPP1R17, ECM genes) 
      contribute to human cortical expansion?
  - question: What is the mechanism by which LHX2 suppresses NEUROG2 expression 
      in progenitors?
  - question: Does NEUROG2 regulate astrocyte versus neuron fate decisions, and 
      if so, through what molecular mechanism?
  - question: What are the specific glutamatergic neuron subtypes generated by 
      NEUROG2 in different cortical layers?
