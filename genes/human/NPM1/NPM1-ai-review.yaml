description: >-
  Nucleophosmin (NPM1/B23) is an abundant, multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein
  involved in ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, histone chaperoning, protein
  chaperoning, cell proliferation, genomic stability, and regulation of tumor suppressors
  p53/TP53 and ARF. It functions as a pentamer/decamer and shuttles between the nucleolus,
  nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. NPM1 acts as a histone chaperone for core histones H3, H2B,
  and H4, and also exhibits broader molecular chaperone activity preventing protein
  aggregation and promoting refolding of denatured proteins. It serves as a rate-limiting
  nuclear export chaperone for ribosomal subunits. Mutations in NPM1 exon 12 causing
  aberrant cytoplasmic localization are among the most common genetic alterations in acute
  myeloid leukemia (AML). NPM1 is also involved in the NPM1-ALK fusion oncogene in
  anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962).
      The annotation is based on PMID:10211837 (Szebeni & Olson, 1999), which demonstrated
      that NPM1/B23 has genuine molecular chaperone activities including both holdase
      (anti-aggregation) and foldase (refolding) functions using multiple protein substrates.
      B23 inhibited aggregation of HIV-1 Rev protein, protected LADH, carboxypeptidase A,
      citrate synthase, and rhodanese from thermal aggregation, preserved LADH enzyme activity
      during heat stress, and promoted restoration of LADH activity after guanidine-HCl
      denaturation. It preferentially bound denatured substrates and exposed hydrophobic
      regions when complexed with denatured proteins. The demonstrated refolding activity
      (foldase function) best maps to GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone). UniProt also
      classifies NPM1 with the keyword "Chaperone" and describes it as acting "as a
      chaperonin for the core histones H3, H2B and H4" (citing PMID:16107701). The histone
      chaperone activity is separately supported by PMID:11602260, which showed NPM1 binds
      histones (preferentially H3), mediates nucleosome formation, and decondenses sperm
      chromatin, and is better captured by GO:0140713 (histone chaperone activity). Since
      the evidence in PMID:10211837 specifically demonstrates protein folding chaperone
      activity (not just binding to unfolded proteins), MODIFY to GO:0044183 is appropriate.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is scheduled for obsolescence (go-ontology#30962). The obsoletion notice
      specifies that annotations should be redirected to either GO:0044183 (protein folding
      chaperone, i.e. foldase) or to a holdase chaperone term. PMID:10211837 demonstrates
      that NPM1 has both holdase activity (preventing aggregation of multiple substrates)
      and foldase activity (promoting restoration of LADH activity after guanidine-HCl
      denaturation). Since GO:0044183 captures the foldase/refolding function and NPM1
      clearly promotes refolding, this is the most appropriate replacement. Additionally,
      the histone chaperone function of NPM1 (PMID:11602260, PMID:16107701) is a distinct
      activity best captured by GO:0140713, which should be proposed as a NEW annotation.
