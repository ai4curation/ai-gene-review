description: >-
  COPG2 encodes gamma-2-COP (gamma2-COP), a subunit of the heptameric COPI (coat protein complex I)
  coatomer. The COPI complex mediates retrograde vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and intra-Golgi transport. COPG2 is a paralog of COPG1 (gamma1-COP),
  sharing approximately 80% sequence identity. The gamma subunit resides in the gamma/zeta adaptor
  subcomplex (F-subcomplex) that connects ARF1-GTP to the coat and participates in vesicle formation.
  Studies show that gamma2/zeta1 coatomer is preferentially incorporated into a specific population
  of COPI vesicles. While functionally redundant with COPG1 for basic COPI functions, COPG2 appears
  to play a more general housekeeping role, whereas COPG1 has specialized functions in neuronal
  differentiation.

    summary: >-
      COPG2/gamma2-COP is a core structural component of the COPI vesicle coat. The protein
      is part of the gamma/zeta adaptor subcomplex within the heptameric coatomer. Studies
      show gamma2-COP forms COPI-like complexes that can substitute for gamma1-COP
      [PMID:11056392, PMID:14729954].

      This is the core cellular component for COPG2. The protein is an integral part of the

  review:
    summary: >-
      COPI vesicles are transported along microtubules between compartments. However, COPG2
      functions as a structural coat component rather than directly mediating microtubule-based
      transport, which is carried out by motor proteins.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

      While COPI vesicles do travel along microtubules (as documented in Reactome pathway
      R-HSA-6809003), COPG2 is part of the vesicle coat structure, not a motor protein.
      The annotation reflects an indirect role as a component of transported vesicles.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    COPG2 encodes gamma-2-COP, a structural subunit of the COPI coatomer complex that
    mediates retrograde vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic
    reticulum and intra-Golgi transport. As part of the gamma/zeta adaptor subcomplex,
    COPG2 participates in ARF1-GTP-dependent membrane recruitment, coat assembly, and
    vesicle formation. The gamma2/zeta1 coatomer isoform is preferentially incorporated
    into a specific population of COPI vesicles.
