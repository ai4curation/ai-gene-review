## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P13984
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=General transcription factor IIF subunit 2; AltName: Full=General transcription factor IIF 30 kDa subunit; AltName: Full=Transcription initiation factor IIF subunit beta; Short=TFIIF-beta; AltName: Full=Transcription initiation factor RAP30;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GTF2F2; Synonyms=RAP30;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TFIIF beta subunit family. .
- **Key Domains:** TFIIF_beta. (IPR003196); TFIIF_beta_HTH. (IPR040450); TFIIF_beta_N. (IPR040504); TFIIF_interaction. (IPR011039); WH-like_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036388)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GTF2F2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GTF2F2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GTF2F2** (gene ID: GTF2F2, UniProt: P13984) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target as Homo sapiens GTF2F2 (gene symbol matches UniProt P13984) encoding the ~30-kDa TFIIF beta subunit historically termed RAP30, which heterodimerizes with RAP74 (GTF2F1) to form general transcription factor TFIIF in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) machinery. Reviews and structural studies centered on human/mammalian systems use the RAP30/RAP74 nomenclature and place TFIIF within the human/mammalian pre-initiation complex (PIC), consistent with the UniProt description and family/domain expectations that include a winged-helix/HTH-like DNA-binding region in the RAP30 subunit (GTF2F2) (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8) (archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-2, malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and complex composition: TFIIF is a heterodimer of RAP30 (GTF2F2/TFIIF-β) and RAP74 (GTF2F1/TFIIF-α). TFIIF associates with Pol II and participates as a core general transcription factor required for promoter-specific initiation. RAP30 is the smaller ~30-kDa subunit; RAP74 is ~74 kDa (Archuleta 2024; Malik & Roeder 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9) (archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-2, malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3).
- Domain architecture (GTF2F2): RAP30/TFIIF-β contains a C-terminal winged-helix (WH)/helix–turn–helix-like DNA-binding module that contributes to protein–DNA contacts and PIC stabilization; a distinct N-terminal region mediates protein interactions (summarized in Archuleta 2024 and conserved across eukaryotes) (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8).
- Placement and contacts in the human/mammalian PIC: High-resolution cryo-EM structures of the mammalian PIC show TFIIF bound near the Pol II cleft; crosslinking/structural mapping positions RAP30 just downstream of TBP on promoter DNA, and RAP74 upstream of the TSS, with TFIIF contacting Pol II subunits (Rpb1/Rpb2/Rpb9 regions) and stabilizing promoter DNA topology (Aibara et al., Nature 2021; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8).
- Core functions: TFIIF recruits/guides Pol II into the TBP–TFIIA–TFIIB promoter complex, suppresses nonspecific DNA binding, stabilizes the PIC, promotes promoter opening with TFIIE/TFIIH, and functions as an early elongation factor by suppressing abortive initiation, helping align the nascent 3′ end to prevent backtracking, and facilitating transition to productive elongation (Malik & Roeder 2023; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 8-9).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- PIC assembly and promoter opening: Contemporary reviews synthesize cryo-EM and single-molecule work showing TFIIF’s cooperative role with TFIIB in assembling the cPIC and recruiting TFIIE and TFIIH; TFIIH XPB translocase then opens DNA around the TSS. TFIIF is implicated in the topology changes that accompany opening and initiation-to-elongation transition (Malik & Roeder 2023; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 4-5).
- High-resolution mammalian PIC structures: The Nature 2021 study provides 2.5–2.9 Å structures of closed/open promoter complexes containing human GTFs plus mammalian Pol II, defining interfaces and DNA opening steps; these placements underpin current 2023–2024 models where TFIIF stabilizes the open DNA and contacts Pol II surfaces near the cleft (Aibara et al., 2021; summarized in Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8).
- Pausing and early elongation: 2024 reviews emphasize pervasive promoter-proximal pausing (+30 to +75 nt) and the regulated pause-release via P-TEFb; TFIIF contributes to early elongation by suppressing abortive cycles and stabilizing the RNA 3′ end in the active site, functionally coupling PIC output to pausing dynamics (Lewis 2024; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105705; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 8-9).
- RNA-mediated repression and TFIIF domains: A 2025 mechanistic study shows noncoding Alu RNA binds within the Pol II cleft and that distinct domains of TFIIF modulate repression, reinforcing that TFIIF’s structural elements directly tune initiation topology and Pol II engagement (Tlučková et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol, online 6 Jan 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01448-7) (tluckova2025mechanismofmammalian pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Structural placement and assembly rules are being used to interpret genome-wide functional genomics and to design reconstitution assays for human transcription, with TFIIF abundance and integrity affecting TFIIE/TFIIH incorporation and promoter opening kinetics (Malik & Roeder 2023; Aibara 2021) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8) (malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2).
- Pausing-aware therapeutic strategies: Reviews highlight how modulation of pause-release kinases (e.g., CDK7/CDK9) and co-factors influences PIC output; because TFIIF helps bridge initiation and early elongation, pharmacological perturbations that shift Pol II pausing states likely alter TFIIF–Pol II functional coupling (Lewis 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105705) (lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2).
- Chemoproteomic interactomes: Under BET inhibitor treatment, proteomic datasets identify Pol II transcription complexes, including GTF2F1/2 family members, within BRD4-associated networks, underscoring TFIIF’s presence in drug-perturbed chromatin assemblies (bioRxiv preprint posted 10 Nov 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566482) (nallur2023thebetinhibitors pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Nature Reviews Genetics (2023) frames the PIC as the principal control node and details TFIIF’s role in recruiting Pol II and enabling TFIIE/TFIIH function, integrating structural and genomic studies; this is a widely cited authoritative perspective (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9) (malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3).
- Biomolecules (2024) review synthesizes TFIIF’s structural placement, RAP30 WH-domain DNA contacts, and early-elongation roles, offering mechanistic rationales for how TFIIF reduces abortive initiation and backtracking (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 8-9, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 4-5).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Mammalian PIC structural resolutions: 2.5–2.9 Å for core PIC and 2.9–4.0 Å for TFIIH modules in closed/open promoter complexes (Aibara et al., 2021) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2).
- Pausing prevalence: 20–70% of active genes harbor promoter-proximal paused Pol II, with release dependent on P-TEFb; pausing region typically +30 to +75 nt downstream of TSS (Lewis 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105705) (lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2).
- APA dynamics involving GTF2F2: Single-cell 3′-end transcriptomics across 19,973 lymphoid cells detected dynamic APA, with GTF2F2 exhibiting stage-synchronous APA changes across differentiation (Qiang et al., 2024; online 9 Jul 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjae027) (qiang2024singlecelllandscapeof pages 1-2).
- Cancer-linked observations: Single-cell and functional assays in ovarian cancer report that GTF2F2 knockdown in ES-2 cells suppresses migration and invasion and shifts EMT markers (E-cadherin up; N-cadherin down), suggesting pro-EMT activity in this model (Du et al., Journal of Ovarian Research, 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-025-01686-3) (du2025singlecellrnasequencing pages 1-2).

Detailed functional annotation for GTF2F2 (TFIIF-β/RAP30)
- Molecular function and interactions: As part of TFIIF, GTF2F2 binds Pol II and joins RAP74 (GTF2F1) to suppress nonspecific DNA binding, stabilize TBP–TFIIA–TFIIB promoter assembly, and aid recruitment of TFIIE/TFIIH. It contacts Pol II near the cleft and interfaces with TFIIEβ and TFIIB to stabilize single-stranded promoter DNA within the cleft. RAP30’s WH-domain mediates DNA binding and contributes to start-site positioning (Malik & Roeder 2023; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8, sharma2024thegeneraltranscription pages 14-15).
- Role in promoter opening and start-site selection: TFIIF is recruited with Pol II after TBP–TFIIA–TFIIB, then TFIIE and TFIIH assemble; XPB-mediated DNA opening near the TSS proceeds with TFIIF securing DNA and Pol II cleft conformation. Structural mapping places RAP30 downstream of TBP and RAP74 upstream of the TSS, supporting a role in start-site selection and promoter DNA wrapping (Aibara 2021; Archuleta 2024; Malik & Roeder 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8, malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3).
- Early elongation and pausing: After initiation, TFIIF remains associated in early transcription, enhances formation of the first phosphodiester bonds, prevents backtracking, and promotes transition into productive elongation, thereby counteracting abortive initiation and shaping promoter-proximal pausing outcomes (Archuleta 2024; Lewis 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105705) (archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 8-9, lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2).
- Post-translational regulation context: While direct site-specific PTMs on GTF2F2 were not delineated in the surveyed sources, multiple PTMs (CTD phosphorylation by CDK7/9; O-GlcNAcylation on Pol II machinery) regulate PIC function, pausing, and elongation, and thus indirectly modulate TFIIF-containing complex activity and occupancy (Lewis 2024; Malik & Roeder 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105705; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-023-00630-9) (lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2, malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization: Nuclear, chromatin-associated; localized at core promoters within the PIC and detectable in early elongation complexes by structural and biochemical criteria (Aibara 2021; Archuleta 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03554-8; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14020176) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 1-2).

Recent disease-relevant observations
- Immune differentiation: GTF2F2 shows stage-synchronous alternative polyadenylation shifts across human lymphoid differentiation, indicating regulated 3′UTR isoform usage in hematopoiesis (Qiang et al., 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjae027) (qiang2024singlecelllandscapeof pages 1-2).
- Cancer biology: In an ovarian cancer single-cell and functional study, GTF2F2 was identified as a gene of interest; siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced migration/invasion and modulated EMT markers, nominating GTF2F2-linked transcriptional programs as potential contributors to tumor progression in that model (Du et al., 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-025-01686-3) (du2025singlecellrnasequencing pages 1-2).
- Drug-perturbed chromatin networks: Proteomic analyses under BET inhibitors detect GTF2F complex proteins within BRD4-linked interactomes, consistent with TFIIF’s integration into transcriptional and chromatin regulatory assemblies that are drug sensitive (bioRxiv 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566482) (nallur2023thebetinhibitors pages 1-3).

*Table: Concise table summarizing GTF2F2 (TFIIF‑β/RAP30) functions, domains, structural placement in the Pol II PIC, regulatory context, and disease-related observations with source citations for 2021–2025 studies.*

Limitations and open questions
- Essentiality/CRISPR dependency: The sources surveyed here did not provide definitive genome-wide CRISPR dependency statistics specifically for GTF2F2; while core Pol II machinery is commonly required for viability in many contexts, dedicated human essentiality datasets should be consulted for quantitative calls.
- Direct PTMs on GTF2F2: Recent reviews emphasize PTMs on Pol II and associated factors, but site-resolved PTMs on GTF2F2 were not detailed; targeted proteomics could clarify post-translational regulation of RAP30.

Conclusion
Collectively, convergent structural (mammalian PIC cryo-EM) and mechanistic (biochemical, single-molecule) evidence define human GTF2F2 (RAP30/TFIIF-β) as the DNA-binding, stabilizing, and Pol II-guiding component of TFIIF that is essential for productive PIC assembly, promoter opening, start-site selection, and the handover into early elongation against the background of regulated promoter-proximal pausing. Recent work ties GTF2F2-linked complexes to drug-responsive chromatin networks and reveals dynamic 3′UTR usage across human hematopoiesis, while functional cancer data suggest potential relevance to tumor cell invasive behavior in specific models (Aibara 2021; Malik & Roeder 2023; Archuleta 2024; Lewis 2024; Qiang 2024; Du 2025) (aibara2021structuresofmammalian pages 1-2, malik2023regulationofthe pages 1-3, archuleta2024mechanismsandfunctions pages 7-8, lewis2024theroleof pages 1-2, qiang2024singlecelllandscapeof pages 1-2, du2025singlecellrnasequencing pages 1-2).
