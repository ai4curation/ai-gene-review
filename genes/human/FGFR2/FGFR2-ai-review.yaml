description: >-
  FGFR2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2) encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase
  that mediates FGF signaling in development, tissue repair, and homeostasis.

  CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative splicing of exon IIIb vs IIIc in the third
  Ig-like domain creates isoforms with MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE ligand specificities:

  (1) FGFR2IIIb (P21802-3, KGFR) is expressed in EPITHELIAL cells and binds FGF1,
  FGF3, FGF7 (KGF), and FGF10. FGF7 and FGF10 bind ONLY to IIIb.

  (2) FGFR2IIIc (P21802-1, BEK) is expressed in MESENCHYMAL cells and binds FGF1,
  FGF2, FGF4, FGF6, and FGF9. FGF2 binds preferentially to IIIc.

  This isoform switching enables PARACRINE signaling between epithelium and mesenchyme:
  mesenchyme produces FGF7/10 to signal to epithelial IIIb, while epithelium produces
  FGF2/4 to signal to mesenchymal IIIc. Critical for limb development, lung branching
  morphogenesis, and wound healing.

  Additional isoforms: Secreted/soluble forms (P21802-14, P21802-19) may act as
  decoy receptors. Numerous other splice variants exist with various domain combinations.

  Cancer relevance: IIIb-to-IIIc isoform switching accompanies epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and correlates with metastatic potential in some cancers.

      summary: >-
        PMID:21412257 shows miR-125b modulates keratinocyte proliferation by
        targeting FGFR2. Knockdown of FGFR2 by miRNA reduces proliferation,
        suggesting FGFR2 normally promotes (not inhibits) keratinocyte proliferation.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        This annotation appears incorrect. The paper shows that FGFR2 knockdown
        reduces keratinocyte proliferation, meaning FGFR2 positively regulates
        proliferation. The annotation should be GO:0050679 (positive regulation
        of epithelial cell proliferation) rather than negative regulation.
