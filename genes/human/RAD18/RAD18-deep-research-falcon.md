1. **Check if the gene symbol "RAD18" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RAD18' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RAD18** (gene ID: RAD18, UniProt: Q9NS91) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human RAD18 (UniProt Q9NS91)

Verification and identity
- Gene/protein: RAD18 (RNF73), human E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase; UniProt Q9NS91. Recent human studies consistently examine RAD18 as the principal E3 ligase catalyzing PCNA Lys164 monoubiquitination in DNA damage tolerance pathways, matching the UniProt description and domain architecture, with no conflicting gene symbol usage detected (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2, chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Primary biochemical function: RAD18 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that, with its E2 partner RAD6, catalyzes monoubiquitination of the replication clamp PCNA at Lys164, initiating translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and coordinating downstream damage tolerance decisions. This modification recruits TLS polymerases (e.g., REV1/Polη) and can be extended to K63-linked chains for template switching, linking to recombination-based bypass and fork protection (Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports; Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 10-11, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.
- Core domains and roles: RAD18 contains a catalytic RING domain (E3 function), a UBZ domain that binds ubiquitin and contributes to damage-site targeting, a SAP domain implicated in DNA/chromatin binding, and a PCNA-interacting motif (PIP) recently mapped adjacent to Ser403; the PIP-like region mediates RAD18–PCNA interaction and is subject to regulation (May 2024; Cell Death & Disease; Mar 2024; EMBO Journal) (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2, chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9.

Localization and pathway context
- Cellular localization: RAD18 accumulates at stalled replication forks and at RPA-coated ssDNA regions during replication stress; it is also recruited to nascent strand gaps where it ubiquitinates PCNA to enable TLS-mediated gap filling. RAD18’s activity influences replication fork stability, and at telomeres (ALT cells), ATR-modulated RAD18 activity controls PCNA ubiquitination to preserve telomere integrity (Mar 2024; EMBO Journal; Jul 2024; Nature Communications; Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports) (chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2, xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 5-7). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591.
- Pathway roles: RAD18 is central to DNA damage tolerance (DDT). PCNA K164 monoubiquitination triggers TLS polymerase engagement; subsequent K63-linked polyubiquitination coordinates template switching and fork remodeling, which support fork stability and damage bypass. RAD18 also participates in crosstalk with the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway (FANCD2/FANCI ubiquitination and chromatin loading) and HR-associated mechanisms, thereby shaping repair pathway choice during replication stress (Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports; Mar 2024; EMBO Journal; May 2024; Cell Death & Disease) (xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 10-11, chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y.

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- ATR constrains RAD18 activity at forks and telomeres: ATR phosphorylates RAD18 at Ser403 adjacent to a PIP motif, weakening RAD18–PCNA interaction and limiting PCNA monoubiquitination. This prevents excessive SLX4 accumulation at stalled forks and protects fork integrity; in ALT cells, this preserves telomere stability. ATR inhibition (VE‑821) or knockdown increases PCNA monoubiquitination after HU, aphidicolin, or UV (Mar 2024; EMBO Journal) (chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9.
- O-GlcNAcylation tunes RAD18’s recruitment and activity: Human RAD18 is O-GlcNAcylated at Ser130/Ser164/Thr468. These modifications promote RAD18 accumulation at damage sites and enable CDC7-dependent RAD18 Ser434 phosphorylation, which supports damage-induced PCNA monoubiquitination, Polη focus formation, and TLS efficiency. Mutating these sites (S130A/S164A/T468A) reduces PCNA monoubiquitination, impairs Polη foci, and increases UV sensitivity; O-GlcNAcylation also enhances RAD18’s contribution to HR through RAD51C/ubiquitin interactions and RAD51 loading, reducing CPT hypersensitivity (May 2024; Cell Death & Disease) (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y.
- PARP10 recruits RAD18 to gaps for REV1-dependent filling: PARP10 interacts with RAD18 and recruits it to nascent ssDNA gaps, leading to PCNA monoubiquitination and REV1 recruitment for gap filling in G2. PARP10’s catalytic activity and PIP-box-mediated interaction with PCNA are required; in BRCA-deficient cells, PARP10 is hyperactive, and its inactivation increases gap accumulation and cytotoxicity (Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.
- Alternative E3 for PCNA in unperturbed replication: BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitinates PCNA independently of RAD18 under unperturbed conditions to prevent ssDNA gaps and promote continuous DNA synthesis, indicating PCNA ubiquitination control extends beyond the canonical RAD18–RAD6 axis (May 2024; Nature Communications) (salaslloret2024brca1bard1ubiquitinatespcna pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48427-6.

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting of RAD18/RAD6 axis and associated regulators: Reviews highlight the RAD18–RAD6 pathway as a tractable therapeutic target for modulating DDT and replication fork stability. Overexpression of RAD18 is reported across several cancers and is linked to therapy resistance phenotypes; efforts include targeting E2/E3 interfaces and deubiquitinases such as USP1 that counteract PCNA-Ub (Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports) (xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 10-11, xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 18-19). URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591.
- Vulnerabilities in BRCA-deficient settings: The RAD18-dependent gap-filling axis (via PARP10→RAD18→PCNA-Ub→REV1) mitigates nascent strand gaps in BRCA-deficient cells; inhibition of PARP10 or disruption of RAD18 recruitment sensitizes these cells, suggesting combination strategies with DNA damaging agents (Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- A 2023 expert review synthesizes how ubiquitination, including RAD18-mediated PCNA modification, orchestrates replication fork stabilization and DDT signaling, emphasizing translational opportunities in oncology by modulating E2/E3/DUB activities and repair-pathway crosstalk (Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports) (xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 10-11, xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 5-7, xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 18-19). URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591.
- Primary 2024 studies deliver mechanistic consensus: ATR acts as a brake on RAD18 at stalled forks and ALT telomeres; O-GlcNAc/PTM crosstalk tunes RAD18’s recruitment and function; and PCNA ubiquitination can be executed by BRCA1/BARD1 in the absence of stress, refocusing the field on the context-specific regulation of PCNA-Ub beyond the canonical RAD18 pathway (Mar–Jul 2024; EMBO Journal; Cell Death & Disease; Nature Communications) (chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2, salaslloret2024brca1bard1ubiquitinatespcna pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48427-6.

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- ATR inhibition elevates PCNA K164 monoubiquitination in multiple stress contexts (HU, aphidicolin, UV), consistent with ATR’s S403 phosphorylation limiting RAD18–PCNA binding (Mar 2024; EMBO Journal) (chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9.
- Defined genotoxic conditions used for gap-induction and repair: PARP10→RAD18 axis tested under 0.4 mM hydroxyurea and 150 μM cisplatin; PARP10 catalytic activity and PCNA interaction are required for REV1 recruitment and gap filling (Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.
- RAD18 PTM mutants alter sensitivity and repair outputs: An O-GlcNAc-deficient RAD18 mutant (S130A/S164A/T468A) reduces damage-induced PCNA monoubiquitination, impairs Polη focus formation, and increases cellular sensitivity to UV; O-GlcNAcylation promotes RAD18’s contribution to HR, lowering CPT hypersensitivity via improved RAD51 loading (May 2024; Cell Death & Disease) (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y.
- Cell-type specific roles in recombination control: RAD18 loss elevates hyper-recombination phenotypes (sister chromatid exchange, gene conversion) in some human cell lines (e.g., HCT116) and these effects are linked to defective PCNA K164 ubiquitination, underscoring context-specific RAD18 functions (Jan 2025; Biomolecules) (rogers2025celltypespecific pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15010150.

Mechanistic synthesis: substrate specificity and reaction
- Enzymatic reaction: RAD18 transfers ubiquitin from E2 RAD6 to PCNA (Lys164), predominantly forming mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (mUb-PCNA) that acts as a platform for TLS polymerases; RAD18 thereby controls the switch from replicative to specialized polymerases at damaged templates and in post-replicative gap filling (Oct 2023; Bioscience Reports; Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (xia2023implicationsofubiquitination pages 10-11, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20222591; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.
- Recruitment logic: RAD18 is targeted to sites of replication stress by RPA-coated ssDNA and by adapter/regulator proteins such as PARP10. ATR signaling modulates RAD18–PCNA interaction via S403 phosphorylation to prevent over-ubiquitination and excessive SLX4 accumulation, preserving fork/telomere integrity in ALT contexts (Mar 2024; EMBO Journal; Jul 2024; Nature Communications) (chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00066-9; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50429-3.
- PTM crosstalk: O-GlcNAcylation of RAD18 (S130/S164/T468) facilitates subsequent CDC7-dependent S434 phosphorylation, supporting optimal PCNA monoubiquitination and efficient TLS/HR (May 2024; Cell Death & Disease) (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06700-y.
- Alternative E3 activity on PCNA: In unperturbed replication, BRCA1/BARD1 can ubiquitinate PCNA independently of RAD18 to prevent replication-associated ssDNA gaps, indicating layered control of PCNA ubiquitination in different cellular contexts (May 2024; Nature Communications) (salaslloret2024brca1bard1ubiquitinatespcna pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48427-6.

Notes on ambiguity and domain alignment
- The literature surveyed explicitly studies human RAD18 and is consistent with the UniProt entry (RING-type E3 ligase; UBZ, SAP domains; and a functional PIP motif proximal to S403). No conflicting gene symbol usage or organism mismatch was found in recent sources (ma2024rad18oglcnacylationpromotes pages 1-2, chen2024atrlimitsrad18mediated pages 1-2, khatib2024parp10promotesthe pages 1-2).
