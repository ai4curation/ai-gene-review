description: >-
  RAD18 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase (EC 2.3.2.27) that functions as a central
  regulator of DNA damage tolerance (DDT).
  In complex with its E2 partner RAD6 (UBE2A/UBE2B), RAD18 catalyzes monoubiquitination
  of PCNA at Lys164, which is the
  key initiating event for translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). This modification recruits
  Y-family TLS polymerases
  (e.g., POL eta) to stalled replication forks, enabling bypass of DNA lesions. RAD18
  contains functional domains including
  a RING finger (E3 ligase catalytic activity), UBZ domain (ubiquitin binding/damage
  site targeting), SAP domain
  (DNA/chromatin binding for recognition of forked/ssDNA), and a PIP-like motif for
  PCNA interaction. RAD18 also
  participates in error-free template switching via K63-linked PCNA polyubiquitination
  and exhibits crosstalk with
  the Fanconi anemia pathway and homologous recombination.
