description: 'GCH1 encodes GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1, EC 3.5.4.16), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis
  of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). GTPCH1 catalyzes the conversion of GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, releasing formate
  and pyrophosphate. The enzyme requires zinc for catalytic activity and functions as a homodecameric complex (dimer of pentamers).
  BH4 is an essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan
  hydroxylase) involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, and for all nitric oxide synthase isoforms. Mutations in GCH1 cause
  dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD/DYT5) and BH4-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia. Recent evidence also implicates GCH1/BH4 in
  ferroptosis suppression through its radical-trapping antioxidant function.

  description: 'The primary molecular function of GCH1 is GTP cyclohydrolase I activity (EC 3.5.4.16), catalyzing the conversion
    of GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate as the first and rate-limiting step in de novo tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis.
    GTPCH1 is primarily localized in the cytosol and requires zinc for catalytic activity. BH4 is a critical cofactor for
    aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (PAH, TH, TPH) and all nitric oxide synthase isoforms.
