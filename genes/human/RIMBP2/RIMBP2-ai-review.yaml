description: >-
  RIMS-binding protein 2 (RIM-BP2) is a presynaptic active zone scaffold protein that
  plays a
  central role in coordinating synaptic vesicle release machinery with voltage-gated
  calcium
  channels. RIMBP2 contains three SH3 domains and three fibronectin type III (FN3)
  domains,
  which mediate interactions with RIM proteins, Munc13-1, Bassoon, and voltage-gated
  calcium
  channel alpha subunits (Cav2.1/Cav2.2 at conventional synapses; Cav1.3 at ribbon
  synapses).
  Through these interactions, RIMBP2 functions as a bifunctional linker that tethers
  calcium
  channels to vesicle release sites, thereby establishing the tight calcium-secretion
  coupling
  required for efficient neurotransmitter release. RIMBP2 also promotes synaptic vesicle
  priming
  via recruitment and stabilization of Munc13-1 at the active zone. The protein localizes
  to
  presynaptic active zone nanoclusters and is essential for setting release probability
  and
  maintaining fast vesicle replenishment, particularly at mossy fiber synapses and
  auditory
  ribbon synapses where high-fidelity transmission is required.

      summary: >-
        This IBA annotation derives from phylogenetic inference based on the PANTHER
        classification.
        RIMBP2 is indeed involved in synaptic transmission as a core active zone scaffold
        protein.
        However, the term "neuromuscular synaptic transmission" (GO:0007274) is overly
        specific for
        this broadly expressed synaptic scaffold. RIMBP2 functions at multiple synapse
        types including
        hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, CA3-CA1 synapses, and auditory ribbon synapses,
        not
        exclusively at neuromuscular junctions. The deep research indicates RIMBP2
        is "present at
        conventional AZs and ribbon synapses" and functions at "mossy-fiber (hippocampal
        MF)" and
        "CA3-CA1" synapses. A more accurate annotation would be the parent term for
        general synaptic
        transmission or a term capturing presynaptic active zone function.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        While RIMBP2 participates in synaptic transmission, the term "neuromuscular
        synaptic
        transmission" is too specific. Literature evidence demonstrates RIMBP2 function
        at multiple
        central nervous system synapse types. Grauel et al. (2016) studied RIMBP2
        at hippocampal
        synapses, Brockmann et al. (2019) demonstrated its role at mossy fiber synapses,
        and Butola
        (2017) characterized its function at auditory endbulb synapses. A more appropriate
        term would
        capture the general role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis regulation.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This IEA annotation is derived from UniProt subcellular location vocabulary
        mapping.
        UniProt indicates RIMBP2 localizes to "Cell membrane" and "Synapse" with the
        note
        "Synaptic plasma membrane." While technically correct that RIMBP2 is associated
        with
        plasma membrane, this term is too general and does not capture the specific
        localization
        to the presynaptic active zone. A more informative cellular component annotation
        would be
        GO:0048786 "presynaptic active zone" which precisely describes where RIMBP2
        carries out
        its function.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        The plasma membrane annotation is accurate but insufficiently specific. RIMBP2
        localizes
        specifically to presynaptic active zone nanoclusters, not the general plasma
        membrane.
        The deep research states RIMBP2 "resides in nanoclusters at presynaptic active
        zones" and
        "is presynaptic and concentrated in the active zone in nanoclusters adjacent
        to release
        sites." A more specific CC term would better describe its localization.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This IEA annotation derives from UniProt subcellular location mapping. The
        annotation
        is correct but could be made more specific. RIMBP2 is indeed located at synapses,
        but
        specifically at the presynaptic active zone compartment. The term "synapse"
        encompasses
        both pre- and postsynaptic components, while RIMBP2 function and localization
        is
        exclusively presynaptic. Given the availability of GO:0048786 "presynaptic
        active zone"
        which is a more precise child term, this general annotation is acceptable
        but redundant
        if the more specific term is used.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        While a more specific term (presynaptic active zone) would be preferable,
        keeping this
        broader term is acceptable as it is not incorrect. The annotation captures
        the synaptic
        localization of RIMBP2. UniProt annotation and literature both confirm synaptic
        localization. Since the proposed modification of GO:0005886 to GO:0048786
        would provide
        the specific presynaptic localization, retaining this broader term provides
        complementary
        information without redundancy issues.
