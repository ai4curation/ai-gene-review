description: >-
  NDUFV1 encodes the 51 kDa flavoprotein subunit of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone
  oxidoreductase (Complex I, EC 7.1.1.2). It is a core catalytic subunit located in
  the N-module at the matrix-facing tip of the peripheral (hydrophilic) arm. NDUFV1
  contains the FMN cofactor that serves as the primary electron acceptor from NADH,
  initiating electron transfer through a chain of iron-sulfur clusters toward ubiquinone.
  NDUFV1 also harbors one [4Fe-4S] cluster (N3) that participates in the electron relay.
  The reduced FMN site is also the predominant source of reactive oxygen species (superoxide/H2O2)
  produced by Complex I. NDUFV1 is part of the flavoprotein (FP) subcomplex together with
  NDUFV2 and NDUFV3. Biallelic mutations in NDUFV1 cause mitochondrial Complex I deficiency,
  nuclear type 4 (MC1DN4), typically presenting as Leigh syndrome with leukodystrophy,
  myoclonic epilepsy, and progressive neurodegeneration.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation that NDUFV1 is part of respiratory chain complex I. This is a core
      structural annotation. NDUFV1 is one of the 45 subunits of mammalian Complex I,
      specifically located in the flavoprotein (FP) subcomplex of the N-module at the
      tip of the peripheral arm (PMID:28844695, PMID:12611891). The cryo-EM structure
      of the human respiratory megacomplex directly resolved NDUFV1 within Complex I
      (PMID:28844695). The phylogenetic inference is well-supported by multiple lines

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for the specific biological process of electron transport from NADH
      to ubiquinone in mitochondria. NDUFV1 is the entry point for this process: NADH
      donates electrons to FMN bound in NDUFV1, and then electrons pass along a chain
      of iron-sulfur clusters to the terminal acceptor ubiquinone (PMID:28844695). The

      IEA annotation inferred from GO:0008137 (NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone activity)
      via logical inference. Complex I couples electron transfer to proton translocation
      across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, the proton pumping activity is
      carried out by the membrane arm of Complex I (the P-module), not by the peripheral
      arm where NDUFV1 resides. NDUFV1 is in the N-module performing electron transfer,
      while the proton channels are formed by ND subunits (ND1, ND2, ND4, ND5) in the
      membrane arm (PMID:30030361).

    reason: >-
      While Complex I as a whole does perform proton transmembrane transport, NDUFV1 is
      located in the peripheral arm far from the proton-translocating membrane domain.
      The annotation is not wrong at the complex level, but it is imprecise when applied
      to this specific subunit. The proton translocation is mechanistically coupled to
      electron transfer but performed by a different structural module. Keep as non-core.

      NDUFV1 is part of Complex I which is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
      However, NDUFV1 itself is a peripheral membrane protein facing the matrix, not an
      integral membrane protein. UniProt indicates matrix-side peripheral localization

      is an inner membrane complex.

      reaction catalyzed by the entire Complex I holoenzyme. NDUFV1 contributes to this
      activity by providing the NADH oxidation/FMN reduction step, but the full reaction
      from NADH to ubiquinone involves the entire electron relay chain across multiple
      subunits plus proton translocation by the membrane arm (PMID:28844695). The qualifier
      should ideally be 'contributes_to' rather than 'enables' for this complex-level

      arm that performs proton translocation. Unlike Complex II (which does not pump protons
      at all), Complex I does pump protons, so NDUFV1 indirectly contributes to PMF
      generation. But the annotation is imprecise for this specific subunit. The SDHA review
      correctly removed the equivalent annotation for SDHA/Complex II because Complex II
      does not pump protons. For NDUFV1/Complex I, the situation is different since Complex I
      does pump protons, but NDUFV1's electron transfer role is mechanistically separated
      from the proton pumping in the membrane arm.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Complex I as a whole contributes to the proton motive force and thus ATP synthesis,
      but NDUFV1 specifically performs electron transfer in the N-module peripheral arm,
      not proton translocation. The annotation is not wrong at the complex level, but it
      is imprecise for this subunit. Keep as non-core since NDUFV1's direct role is
      electron transfer, with proton pumping being a mechanistically coupled but
      structurally distinct function of the membrane arm.

      Electron transfer activity is a core molecular function of NDUFV1. The FMN cofactor
      accepts electrons from NADH and transfers them to the [4Fe-4S] cluster N3, continuing
      to the downstream Fe-S chain. This is the subunit-specific MF of NDUFV1 and is
      missing from the current annotation set. Analogous to SDHA's IBA annotation for
      GO:0009055.

  description: >-
    NDUFV1 is the catalytic flavoprotein subunit of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone
    oxidoreductase (Complex I). It contains a covalently bound FMN cofactor and one
    [4Fe-4S] cluster (N3). NDUFV1 enables NADH dehydrogenase activity (GO:0003954)
    by oxidizing NADH at the FMN site, and enables electron transfer activity (GO:0009055)
    by passing electrons through its [4Fe-4S] cluster to the downstream Fe-S relay in
    NDUFS1. It contributes to the overall NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity
    (GO:0008137) of the full Complex I holoenzyme, which couples electron transfer to
    proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDUFV1 is located in
    the N-module at the matrix-facing tip of the peripheral arm of Complex I
    (GO:0045271), embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (GO:0005743). The
    biological process is mitochondrial electron transport, NADH to ubiquinone
    (GO:0006120). FMN binding (GO:0010181), NAD binding (GO:0051287), and [4Fe-4S]
    cluster binding (GO:0051539) are core cofactor-binding functions essential for
    catalysis.
