### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NDUFV1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NDUFV1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NDUFV1** (gene ID: NDUFV1, UniProt: P49821) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human NDUFV1 (UniProt P49821), the 51 kDa FMN-binding subunit of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. It resides in the matrix-facing (peripheral) arm within the NADH dehydrogenase (N-) module and catalyzes NADH oxidation at an FMN cofactor, initiating electron transfer to a chain of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters toward ubiquinone. This identity, location, and role are supported by recent structural and mechanistic literature focused on mammalian complex I and disease models (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report

1. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular function and reaction. Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) oxidizes NADH and reduces ubiquinone, coupling this redox chemistry to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons flow from NADH to FMN bound in NDUFV1, then through ~7 Fe–S clusters to reduce ubiquinone at the distal site; this process contributes substantially to proton motive force that drives ATP synthesis (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2). In mammalian complex I, NDUFV1’s FMN cofactor is the primary NADH-accepting site and sits at the top of the hydrophilic peripheral arm (matrix side) within the N-module (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- Localization and structural placement. NDUFV1 is embedded in the matrix-facing peripheral arm (hydrophilic domain) of complex I, specifically in the N-module where NADH oxidation occurs. The N-module includes NDUFV1 together with NDUFV2, NDUFS1, NDUFA2, and NDUFV3; NDUFV1 lies proximal to other catalytic and assembly-adjacent subunits (e.g., NDUFS6/NDUFA12) in mammalian assemblies (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4). The holoenzyme has an L-shaped architecture with a membrane arm that performs proton translocation and a peripheral arm for electron transfer (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34821-5) (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2).
- Domains and cofactors. NDUFV1 binds FMN as the primary electron acceptor for NADH and harbors canonical motifs that support NADH/FMN and Fe–S relay connectivity at the N-module interface (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2). This arrangement supports a Rossmann-like NADH interaction at the FMN site and positions NDUFV1 to initiate the electron relay to the Fe–S chain in adjacent core subunits (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- Reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the FMN site. Reduced FMN in the peripheral arm is a predominant site of superoxide and H2O2 formation by complex I; ROS production is generally accepted to originate at the FMN and has been quantified in vitro (approx. 0.1–2% of NADH oxidation leading to ROS under assay conditions). At high exogenous H2O2, selective damage to a proximal Fe–S cluster (N1b on the NuoG homolog) can occur without large loss of NADH→Q activity, indicating the relay can bypass certain clusters (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34821-5) (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2).

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Structural/disease-context insights. Cryo-EM of a mammalian complex I disease model defines the N-module’s loose association in assembly-defective states and places NDUFV1 with its FMN cofactor at the apex of the hydrophilic arm, initiating electron transfer to the Fe–S chain that terminates at cluster N2 near the ubiquinone site. The study emphasizes N-module composition and its interfaces with NDUFS6 and NDUFA12 during assembly and maturation (posted July 25, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- Mechanism and ROS. A 2023 study demonstrated that H2O2 can selectively oxidatively damage the binuclear Fe–S cluster N1b in bacterial complex I, while the NADH→Q electron transfer can remain largely intact due to bypass routes; it reiterates that ROS originate at reduced FMN near the Fe–S relay—principles that map to the conserved architecture including human NDUFV1’s FMN site (May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34821-5) (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2).
- Contemporary reviews. A 2024 review synthesizes structural and mechanistic advances in complex I across taxa, highlighting the FMN site (51 kDa subunit homologous to NDUFV1) as the entry point for electrons from NADH, with downstream Fe–S relay to Q reduction and proton translocation coupling (Dec 14, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2). Although cross-species, the architecture and chemistry are conserved and explicitly discussed for mammalian enzymes.

3. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic genomics in Leigh syndrome cohorts. Large national cohorts implement next-generation sequencing (NGS) to resolve the wide genetic heterogeneity of Leigh syndrome (LS), including nuclear-encoded complex I subunits like NDUFV1. A 2023 Portuguese LS spectrum cohort (n=40) reports 12 nuclear-DNA positive cases and emphasizes NGS-driven expansion of the LS spectrum and improved diagnostic sensitivity (published July 27, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14081536) (baldo2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2). A 2023 Russian cohort (n=219) details molecular defects and clinical features, reporting NDUFV1 among detected nuclear LS genes using NGS workflows; they underscore multimodal “omics” approaches (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) to pinpoint causes in difficult cases (published Jan 13, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021597) (kistol2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2).
- Enzymology and transcriptomics in practice. Case-based and literature-synthesis evidence emphasizes that, while enzymology (e.g., complex I activity in muscle or fibroblasts) remains informative, comprehensive molecular testing (WES/WGS) and, where indicated, RNA-seq can reveal cryptic splice defects even when enzymatic assays are inconclusive—practical implications for NDUFV1 differential diagnosis (2024 case report with literature context; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.71127) (finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 1-2, finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 7-8).

4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Architecture-function consensus. Authoritative reviews and structural analyses converge that NDUFV1 is the FMN-containing 51 kDa core subunit of the N-module at the matrix-exposed tip of complex I’s peripheral arm, where hydride transfer from NADH to FMN occurs before electrons traverse the Fe–S chain toward Q. This conceptual framework underlies interpretations of assembly defects, disease mechanisms, and inhibitor interactions (2023–2024 reviews and preprints: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2).
- ROS and vulnerability analysis. Experimental work supports the FMN site as the principal ROS source and suggests that certain Fe–S clusters may be differentially susceptible to oxidants, with potential implications for pathology and bioenergetic control; these conclusions are anchored in conserved features adjacent to NDUFV1’s FMN (May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34821-5) (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2).

5. Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- Leigh syndrome burden and cohorts. LS is a leading pediatric mitochondrial encephalopathy; a national Portuguese series reports 40 LS-spectrum positive cases (28 mtDNA, 12 nDNA), demonstrating the diagnostic shift to NGS (July 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14081536) (baldo2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2). A Russian multi-center cohort analyzed 219 LS patients and identified pathogenic variants across abundant LS genes; NDUFV1 appears among detected nuclear complex I genes in their diagnostic yield (Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021597) (kistol2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2).
- NDUFV1 variant and phenotype summaries. A 2024 case report compiles clinical features from 44 patients with NDUFV1-associated LS: frequent findings include spasticity (24/44), hypotonia (13/44), psychomotor regression (17/44), nystagmus (11/44), optic atrophy (6/44), and myopathy (13/44), with rapid progression often observed. Reported variant classes include missense and splice-site changes, frequently compound heterozygous, with systemic involvement documented in some cases (e.g., cardiac conduction defects, pulmonary hypertension) (Oct 9, 2024; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.71127) (finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 6-7, finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 1-2).

Functional annotation summary for NDUFV1 (Human)
- Primary role: FMN-dependent NADH oxidation at the N-module entry point of mitochondrial complex I; initiates electron transfer to Fe–S clusters en route to ubiquinone, supporting proton pumping and ATP synthesis coupling (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- Substrate/cofactors: Substrate NADH; cofactor FMN at NDUFV1; downstream electron carrier chain of Fe–S clusters culminating at N2 before ubiquinone reduction (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2).
- Localization: Mitochondrial matrix-facing peripheral arm (hydrophilic domain) within the N-module of complex I (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- Pathways: Oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport, ROS generation control at FMN site (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34821-5; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2).
- Disease: Biallelic NDUFV1 variants cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency with Leigh/Leigh-like syndromes; recent cohorts and case syntheses demonstrate spectrum and frequency of neurologic/systemic findings; diagnosis relies on NGS with potential RNA-seq for splice defects (https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14081536; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021597; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.71127) (baldo2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2, kistol2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2, finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 1-2).

Notes and limitations
- EC classification of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is well-established in databases; the recent primary/review sources above delineate the chemistry and architecture but do not themselves explicitly state the EC number in the cited passages. Therefore, the reaction and role are described without asserting the EC numeral beyond what is supported by the provided sources (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 1-2, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4).
- While broad mitochondrial reviews exist (e.g., 2024 overviews), this report emphasizes 2023–2024 sources that directly support NDUFV1’s function, structure, ROS role, and clinical relevance in LS cohorts and case compilations (strotmann2023h2o2selectivelydamages pages 1-2, baldo2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2, kistol2023leighsyndromespectrum pages 1-2, finsterer2024leighsyndromecaused pages 1-2).
