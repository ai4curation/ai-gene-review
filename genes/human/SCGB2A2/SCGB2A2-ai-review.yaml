description: SCGB2A2 (mammaglobin-A) is a small secreted secretoglobin (lipophilin subfamily)
  that forms disulfide-linked complexes and is highly expressed in mammary gland tissue.
  As a secreted secretoglobin, it is expected to bind hydrophobic ligands in extracellular
  fluids, although specific ligands and direct biochemical activity remain poorly defined.
existing_annotations:

    label: extracellular space
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SCGB2A2 is a secreted protein; extracellular space annotation is appropriate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Secreted secretoglobins function in the extracellular milieu.

    label: androgen receptor signaling pathway
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: No direct evidence links SCGB2A2 to androgen receptor signaling.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Neither UniProt nor the deep research summary provides evidence for androgen receptor
      pathway involvement; this appears to be an over-annotation for a secreted secretoglobin.

  review:
    summary: Secreted protein localized to the extracellular region.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: High-throughput interactome study does not provide gene-specific evidence for SCGB2A2.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The cached PMID:25416956 text is a global interactome map without SCGB2A2-specific
      interaction evidence, so this annotation cannot be verified from the publication.

  review:
    summary: Secretoglobin family members are reported to bind steroid-like ligands.
    action: NEW
    reason: Family-level evidence supports hydrophobic ligand binding as a molecular function.
