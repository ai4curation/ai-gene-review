description: >-
  AFAP1L1 is an adaptor/scaffold protein of the AFAP family that links actin cytoskeleton
  structures to signaling pathways at invadosomes and podosomes. It contains two PH domains,
  a proline-rich SH3-binding motif, a leucine-zipper/coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal
  actin-binding region. AFAP1L1 binds cortactin (CTTN) via its proline-rich motif and localizes
  to invadosomes, podosomes, and stress fibers. It functions as an adaptor that promotes
  formation of actin-rich degradative structures supporting cell migration and invasion.
  In cancer, AFAP1L1 promotes EMT and metastasis via a VAV2-CDC42-ITGA5/integrin signaling axis.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is from a high-throughput interactome study. The term "protein binding"
      is uninformative and should be replaced with more specific molecular function terms.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Per GO curation guidelines, "protein binding" (GO:0005515) is too vague and does not
      convey meaningful functional information. AFAP1L1's known binding partners include
      cortactin (via SH3 domain interaction) and VAV2. More informative annotations would be
      SH3 domain binding (GO:0017124) to capture its proline-rich motif-mediated interactions.
