description: >-
  AFAP1L1 is an adaptor/scaffold protein of the AFAP family that links actin cytoskeleton
  structures to signaling pathways at invadosomes and podosomes. It contains two PH domains,
  a proline-rich SH3-binding motif, a leucine-zipper/coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal
  actin-binding region. AFAP1L1 binds cortactin (CTTN) via its proline-rich motif and localizes
  to invadosomes, podosomes, and stress fibers. It functions as an adaptor that promotes
  formation of actin-rich degradative structures supporting cell migration and invasion.
  Phosphorylation by Src family kinases creates docking sites for downstream effectors:
  pY136 binds Vav2 (a Rho GTPase GEF) and pY566 binds Nck2 (an actin-nucleating adaptor).
  In cancer, AFAP1L1 promotes EMT and metastasis via a VAV2-CDC42-ITGA5/integrin signaling axis.
  AFAP1L1 also regulates pathological angiogenesis through the YAP-DLL4-NOTCH signaling
  axis under hypoxic conditions, where HIF-1alpha directly activates AFAP1L1 transcription.

    summary: >-
      AFAP1L1 contains a proline-rich SH3-binding motif (DLPPPLPNKP) that mediates its
      interaction with cortactin SH3 domain with approximately 9-fold higher affinity
      compared to cSrc. This is a core molecular function distinguishing AFAP1L1 from AFAP1.

    reason: >-
      PMID:21333378 directly demonstrates that the SH3 binding motif of AFAP1L1 interacts
      with the SH3 domain of cortactin, and does so more efficiently than with cSrc. The
      cyberian deep research quantifies this as approximately 9-fold higher affinity for
      cortactin, which distinguishes AFAP1L1's function from AFAP1.
