## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8TED9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1; Short=AFAP1-like protein 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=AFAP1L1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AFAP. (IPR030113); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849); PH (PF00169)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AFAP1L1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AFAP1L1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AFAP1L1** (gene ID: AFAP1L1, UniProt: Q8TED9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research report: AFAP1L1 (Actin filament-associated protein 1-like 1; UniProt Q8TED9) in Homo sapiens

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: AFAP1L1 is a human AFAP family adaptor protein closely related to AFAP1, with conserved modular domains including two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a proline-rich SH3-binding motif, a leucine-zipper/coiled-coil region, and an actin-binding region; it localizes to invadosomes/podosomes and binds cortactin, distinguishing it from AFAP1 which preferentially binds Src SH3 (human data) (snyder2011; URL: https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.3379, 2011) (snyder2011anewmember pages 26-30, snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, snyder2011anewmember pages 1-6). Recent clinical work explicitly studies AFAP1L1 in human gastric cancer, corroborating human identity and disease relevance (Sun et al., 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-03871-8) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).
- Domain-context verification: SH3-mediated interactions with proline-rich motifs and their roles in signaling and cytoskeletal regulation are broadly and recently reviewed (Mehrabipour et al., 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12162054; Jasemi et al., 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13020195) (mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Definition and family: AFAP1L1 is one of three vertebrate AFAP family proteins (AFAP1, AFAP1L1, AFAP1L2/XB130) that act as adaptor/scaffold proteins linking actin cytoskeleton structures to signaling pathways, especially at invadosomes/podosomes, structures implicated in extracellular matrix degradation and invasion (snyder2011) (snyder2011anewmember pages 17-22, snyder2011anewmember pages 1-6).
- Domain architecture and interaction logic: AFAP1L1 contains two PH domains (PH1, PH2), a proline-rich SH3-binding motif, putative SH2-binding tyrosines, a leucine-zipper/coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal actin-binding region; its SH3-binding motif sequence aligns better with cortactin SH3 recognition than canonical Src SH3 motifs (snyder2011) (snyder2011anewmember pages 26-30, snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94). SH3 domains in general are ~60-residue β-barrel modules that selectively bind proline-rich motifs (PRMs), coordinating assembly of signaling complexes in motility and polarity; recent systematic reviews catalog 298 SH3 domains in 221 human proteins and delineate selectivity landscapes, underscoring the importance of PRM sequence context in interaction specificity (Mehrabipour et al., 2023; Jasemi et al., 2024) (mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).
- Primary functional role: AFAP1L1 functions as a cytoskeletal adaptor that localizes to invadopodia/podosomes, binds cortactin, and promotes formation of actin-rich degradative structures, supporting cell migration/invasion programs (snyder2011) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94). In cancer cells, AFAP1L1 supports EMT and invasive signaling via a VAV2→CDC42→ITGA5/integrin pathway, consistent with a role at adhesion/cytoskeletal interfaces (Sun et al., 2023) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Oncogenic mechanism in gastric cancer (GC): AFAP1L1 is significantly upregulated in GC relative to normal gastric tissue, uniquely predicts poor prognosis among AFAP family members, and is an independent risk factor. Mechanistically, AFAP1L1 interacts with the GEF VAV2 to activate CDC42, resulting in increased ITGA5 expression and activation of integrin signaling, promoting proliferation, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (Journal of Translational Medicine, 2023-01-23; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-03871-8) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).
- SH3 domain biology updates enabling AFAP1L1 inference: Comprehensive 2023–2024 analyses refine understanding of SH3–PRM specificity and functional classification, supporting the concept that AFAP1L1’s proline-rich motif can specify distinct interactors (e.g., cortactin) compared with other AFAP family members. These reviews provide frameworks to predict PRM-binding partners and highlight SH3 roles in cytoskeletal regulation and vesicle trafficking, relevant to invadosome function (Cells 2023-08-17; Cells 2024-01-10) (mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker and prognostic utility in GC: AFAP1L1 overexpression serves as a prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes and an independent risk factor in GC, and functional validation in cell and mouse models supports its candidacy as a therapeutic target (Sun et al., 2023) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).
- Mechanism-based therapeutic hypotheses: The AFAP1L1–VAV2–CDC42–ITGA5 axis and localization to invadopodia/integrin-rich adhesions suggest intervention points in integrin signaling and Rho GTPase pathways; targeting SH3–PRM interactions (e.g., cortactin SH3) is a conceptual strategy informed by recent SH3 domain druggability reviews (Sun et al., 2023; Mehrabipour et al., 2023; Jasemi et al., 2024) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2, mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Invadosome-centric adaptor role: Experimental localization and binding to cortactin position AFAP1L1 as an invadosome/podosome adaptor distinct from AFAP1, with propensity to assemble actin remodeling complexes that support ECM degradation and invasion (snyder2011) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, snyder2011anewmember pages 1-6).
- Src-pathway context across AFAP family: Authoritative reviews of Src substrates recognize AFAP1L1 among AFAP family links to Src signaling; while AFAP1 classically binds Src SH3 and is a substrate/activator, AFAP1L1’s distinct SH3 motif supports alternative SH3 partners (e.g., cortactin), situating AFAP1L1 in Src-adjacent cytoskeletal signaling rather than direct Src activation (Oncogene review; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2013.416) (snyder2011anewmember pages 17-22).
- SH3 domain landscape: Recent expert syntheses emphasize that SH3 domain selectivity and PRM context drive pathway-specific assembly of complexes, aligning with AFAP1L1’s defined PRM deciding cortactin preference and invadosome localization (Cells 2023–2024) (mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data
- Expression/prognostic statistics in GC: AFAP1L1 is the only AFAP family member significantly upregulated in GC; only AFAP1L1 predicts poor prognosis and acts as an independent risk factor. Functional assays demonstrate increased proliferation, migration, invasion in vitro, and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo upon AFAP1L1 expression; mechanistic assays verify interaction with VAV2, CDC42 activation, and ITGA5/integrin pathway induction (Sun et al., 2023; publication date 2023-01-23; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-03871-8). Exact hazard ratios or effect sizes are not provided in the retrieved excerpt, but the study reports independent risk factor status and comprehensive functional validation (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).
- Domain/interaction evidence: Direct binding of AFAP1L1 to cortactin via SH3 motif preference (biochemical pulldown and co-IP) and localization to invadosomes/podosomes (fluorescence microscopy) provide experimental evidence for cellular localization and adaptor function (snyder2011; URL: https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.3379) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, snyder2011anewmember pages 1-6).
- SH3 domain system data: The human proteome includes 298 SH3 domains in 221 proteins; binding affinities across SH3–PRM pairs span sub-micromolar to ~100 μM, supporting graded selectivity and transient complex formation, pertinent to AFAP1L1’s PRM-driven interactions at actin structures (Cells 2023–2024; URLs above) (mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

Functional annotation: mechanism, pathways, and localization
- Biochemical class: adaptor/scaffold protein, non-enzymatic. AFAP1L1 does not catalyze an enzymatic reaction; it organizes complexes via modular domains (PQ-rich SH3-binding, PH, coiled-coil, actin-binding) (snyder2011; SH3 reviews) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).
- Principal interactors: cortactin (SH3-mediated; experimental binding); VAV2 (GEF; co-IP/functional linkage); CDC42 (activated downstream); ITGA5/integrin signaling (upregulated/activated) (snyder2011; Sun 2023) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).
- Pathways: invadosome/invadopodia assembly and ECM degradation; integrin–focal adhesion signaling; Rho-family GTPase signaling (CDC42) via VAV2; Src-adjacent cytoskeletal regulation through SH3-mediated networks (Sun 2023; snyder2011; SH3 reviews) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2, snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: actin stress fibers and cortical actin; invadosomes/podosomes/invadopodia; likely at sites of dynamic adhesion and ECM remodeling (snyder2011; Sun 2023 contextual mentions of invadopodia) (snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2).

Comparative and structural inference
- Family-based inference supports that AFAP1L1 possesses PH domains implicated in membrane/cytoskeletal interfaces and a leucine-zipper/actin-binding C-terminus for actin association, consistent with adaptor roles coordinating membrane-proximal signaling and actin remodeling at invadosomes (snyder2011; SH3 domain reviews) (snyder2011anewmember pages 26-30, snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2).

Limitations and evidence gaps
- While the 2023 GC study establishes a robust oncogenic role and mechanism for AFAP1L1, quantitative survival metrics (HRs) are not available in the retrieved excerpt. Additional recent disease-specific studies beyond GC were not retrieved here; however, earlier work indicates AFAP1L1 upregulation in certain brain tumors and localization compatible with invasive behavior (2011 thesis) (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2, snyder2011anewmember pages 1-6).

Conclusion
AFAP1L1 (Q8TED9) is a human adaptor/scaffold protein of the AFAP family that organizes actin- and adhesion-associated signaling complexes at invadosomes/podosomes. It binds cortactin via a proline-rich SH3-binding motif, contains two PH domains and a leucine-zipper/actin-binding region, and participates in invadopodia formation and invasive behavior. Recent evidence in gastric cancer identifies AFAP1L1 as an independent prognostic factor and mechanistic driver of EMT and metastasis via a VAV2→CDC42→ITGA5/integrin axis. Contemporary SH3 domain literature supports the specificity logic underlying AFAP1L1’s interactions and provides a framework for therapeutic targeting of adaptor-mediated complexes in invasive cancers (sun2023afap1l1promotesgastric pages 1-2, snyder2011anewmember pages 62-70, snyder2011anewmember pages 89-94, mehrabipour2023asystematiccompilation pages 1-2, snyder2011anewmember pages 17-22).
