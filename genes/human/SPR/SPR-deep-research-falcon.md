## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P35270
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Sepiapterin reductase; Short=SPR; EC=1.1.1.153 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10350607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11443547};
- **Gene Information:** Name=SPR;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sepiapterin reductase family. .
- **Key Domains:** Biopterin_syn/organic_redct. (IPR051721); NAD(P)-bd_dom_sf. (IPR036291); SDR_fam. (IPR002347); Sepiapterin_red. (IPR006393); adh_short (PF00106)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SPR" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SPR' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SPR** (gene ID: SPR, UniProt: P35270) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status (abbreviated)
- We verified identity and pathway context for human SPR (P35270) and compiled targeted evidence from 2023–2024 sources on mechanism, disease relevance, and translational developments. Key claims below are grounded in the cited items.

Comprehensive research report: human SPR (UniProt P35270)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and biochemical role: SPR encodes sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153), a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase that catalyzes the terminal reductions in de novo and salvage biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). In de novo synthesis, GTP is converted via GCH1 and 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTS) to 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin, which SPR reduces through 1′- and 2′-oxo-tetrahydropterin intermediates to BH4. In the salvage route, sepiapterin is converted via SPR-dependent steps to BH2/BH4. Alternative aldo-keto/carbonyl reductases can form 1′/2′-oxo intermediates, but interconversion and completion of the terminal steps are uniquely dependent on SPR, explaining tissue- and species-dependent redundancy. These features place SPR as the final dedicated reductase in the GCH1–PTS–SPR axis that sets cellular BH4 levels for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases (NOS) (review synthesis; mechanistic details summarized in 2023 perspective). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1173599 (May 2023) (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
- Structural/enzymatic family: SPR is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and uses reduced nicotinamide cofactors in its reductive catalysis; its positioning in BH4 biosynthesis is consistently depicted alongside GCH1 and PTS in contemporary ferroptosis and neuroscience reviews (general pathway context). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01197-5 (Feb 2023); https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.37.20230224 (Mar 2024) (, ).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Peripheralized SPR inhibition for analgesia: A 2023 review marshals preclinical and human genetic data that excessive peripheral BH4 drives pain hypersensitivity and argues that peripherally restricted SPR inhibitors could reduce pain while sparing central monoamine synthesis. The review integrates evidence that BH4-pathway upregulation in injured DRG neurons and immune cells (mast cells, macrophages, T cells) contributes to nociception, and that reducing BH4 in these peripheral compartments alleviates neuropathic, inflammatory, and postoperative pain phenotypes. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1173599 (May 2023) (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
- Mast cell BH4–serotonin axis in postoperative pain: 2024 Science Immunology work shows that mast cells supply BH4 (via Gch1) to support serotonin production by Tph1 after surgical injury; mast-cell-specific ablation of Gch1 or Tph1 reduces postoperative hypersensitivity. The study references pharmacological SPR inhibition (e.g., QM385) as a BH4-pathway tool and implicates neuroimmune substance P–driven BH4/serotonin release. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adh0545 (Aug 2024) (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
- BH4–ferroptosis connection highlighting GCH1–PTS–SPR axis: Multiple 2023–2024 reviews on ferroptosis summarize BH4 as an endogenous, GPX4-independent lipid antioxidant system; BH4 biosynthesis by GCH1–PTS–SPR is depicted as a ferroptosis defense module. These works explicitly place SPR at the terminal step of BH4 production in these antioxidant programs. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01197-5 (Feb 2023); https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.37.20230224 (Mar 2024) (, ).
- Brain BH4 replenishment with sepiapterin: A 2024 preprint re-evaluates peripheral sepiapterin and reports dose-dependent brain BH4 elevation to 3–4× baseline for >6 hours at practical doses, arguing for BBB permeation and cellular uptake of sepiapterin under threshold dosing conditions. URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4111864/v2 (Oct 2024) ().

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical diagnostics and care for SPR deficiency (SRD): Contemporary clinical guidance (GeneReviews update, 2025) and a 2024 peer-reviewed case report detail that SRD typically lacks hyperphenylalaninemia and is therefore usually missed by standard newborn screening. Diagnosis relies on CSF neurotransmitter/pterin profiling—low HVA and 5-HIAA, normal-to-slightly increased neopterin, and elevated total biopterin, BH2, and sepiapterin—and molecular confirmation of biallelic SPR variants. Standard-of-care therapy emphasizes levodopa (with carbidopa/benserazide) and often adjunctive 5-HTP; early initiation improves outcomes. URLs: NCBI Bookshelf GeneReviews entry “Sepiapterin reductase deficiency” (updated Sep 18, 2025; accessible overview at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/); https://doi.org/10.1159/000534587 (Nov 2024) (friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencyb pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencya pages 1-3, erdal2024sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-2).
- Genomic implementation: Targeted NGS/tNGS workflows for hyperphenylalaninemia now include BH4-pathway genes and SPR in the differential to discriminate PAH vs. non-PAH causes and to streamline BH4 disorder diagnosis. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11071899 (Jul 2023) ().

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Pain and safety rationale for SPR inhibitors: Experts argue that peripheral SPR inhibition may provide a “therapeutic window” by reducing excessive BH4 in peripheral nociceptors and immune cells while avoiding CNS BH4 rundown that risks monoamine deficiency, citing human genetics (e.g., GCH1/SPR deficiency phenotypes), cell-specific BH4 compensation, and salvage-route redundancy. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1173599 (May 2023) (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
- Clinical consensus on SRD management: Authoritative clinical summaries emphasize that SRD is an autosomal recessive BH4 deficiency with predominant CNS monoamine deficiency, recommend CSF-guided titration of levodopa and consideration of 5-HTP, and caution about agents that impair BH4 or monoamine pathways (e.g., methotrexate, nitrous oxide). NCBI Bookshelf (updated 2025) (friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencyb pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencya pages 1-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- Case counts: A 2024 peer-reviewed case report notes SRD has been described in “nearly 60 cases so far,” underscoring rarity and diagnostic challenges outside specialized testing. URL: https://doi.org/10.1159/000534587 (Nov 2024) (erdal2024sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-2).
- Biochemical diagnostics: Characteristic CSF profile—decreased HVA and 5-HIAA with elevated BH2/sepiapterin; urine sepiapterin can be increased—reinforced by GeneReviews updates (2025) and the 2024 case, consistent across cohorts. NCBI Bookshelf; https://doi.org/10.1159/000534587 (friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencyb pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencya pages 1-3, erdal2024sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-2).
- Effect sizes in pain models: Reviews collate that genetic or targeted knockdown of BH4-pathway enzymes in peripheral neurons/mast cells reduces postoperative and inflammatory pain behaviors; mechanistically, mast-cell-specific Gch1 or Tph1 deletion substantially reduces postoperative hypersensitivity, identifying the mast cell BH4–serotonin axis as a driver. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adh0545 (Aug 2024); synthesis in https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1173599 (May 2023) (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
- Brain BH4 augmentation by sepiapterin: Preclinical dosing achieved 3–4× baseline brain BH4 for over 6 hours following peripheral administration above a defined threshold, supporting translational potential while highlighting saturability/transport constraints. URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4111864/v2 (Oct 2024) ().

6) Pathways, mechanism, and cellular context
- Pathway integration: SPR operates downstream of GCH1 and PTS in de novo BH4 biosynthesis and participates in BH4 salvage from sepiapterin; BH4 is then consumed by tyrosine/tryptophan/phenylalanine hydroxylases and NOS, and is regenerated by QDPR (DHPR) with DHFR participating in BH2→BH4 reduction—a network represented in 2023–2024 ferroptosis/neurovascular reviews. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01197-5 (Feb 2023); https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.37.20230224 (Mar 2024) (, ).
- Relation to ferroptosis: The GCH1–PTS–SPR axis supplies BH4 as an endogenous inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, functioning alongside GPX4, FSP1–CoQ10, and DHODH–CoQH2 systems; increasing BH4 or preserving the pathway resists ferroptosis, while inhibition sensitizes to lipid-ROS. URLs: https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.37.20230224 (Mar 2024); https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01197-5 (Feb 2023) (, ).

7) Subcellular localization
- Contemporary disease- and pathway-focused sources consistently treat SPR as a cytosolic enzyme operating in the soluble BH4 biosynthetic machinery with GCH1 and PTS; while explicit localization assays are not the focus of the 2023–2024 items, the enzyme’s integration in cytosolic BH4 production for cytosolic hydroxylases/NOS is implied in these reviews. URLs: https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.37.20230224 (Mar 2024); https://doi.org/10.1007/s10571-022-01197-5 (Feb 2023) (, ).

8) Clinical genetics and counseling for SRD
- Genetics: SRD is autosomal recessive; biallelic pathogenic variants in SPR at 2p13.2 cause decreased BH4 synthesis and CNS accumulation of BH2 and sepiapterin. Carrier status is presumed in parents; once familial variants are identified, carrier, prenatal, and preimplantation testing are feasible. URL: NCBI Bookshelf GeneReviews (updated 2025) (friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencyb pages 15-18, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencya pages 15-18, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 15-18).
- Treatment guidance and precautions: Titrated levodopa (with decarboxylase inhibitor) is first-line; 5-HTP is often added. GeneReviews advises avoiding drugs that impair BH4 or monoamine metabolism (e.g., methotrexate, nitrous oxide, dopamine antagonists) during management. NCBI Bookshelf (updated 2025) (friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiency pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencyb pages 1-3, friedman2025sepiapterinreductasedeficiencya pages 1-3).

Quality note on identity verification and ambiguity
- The gene symbol SPR in this report refers to Homo sapiens sepiapterin reductase (UniProt P35270), an SDR-family NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase catalyzing the terminal steps of BH4 biosynthesis/salvage. All cited sources are consistent with this identity; no conflicting gene symbols from other organisms were used (cronin2023peripheralizedsepiapterinreductase pages 3-4).
