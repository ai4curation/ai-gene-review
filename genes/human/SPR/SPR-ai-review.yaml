description: Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is a short-chain 
  dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family enzyme that catalyzes the terminal 
  reduction steps in the de novo and salvage biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4). In the de novo pathway, SPR reduces 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin through
  1'-oxo and 2'-oxo intermediates to BH4. In the salvage pathway, it reduces 
  sepiapterin to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2). BH4 is an essential cofactor for 
  aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan 
  hydroxylases) and nitric oxide synthases. SPR deficiency causes 
  DOPA-responsive dystonia with monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency without 
  hyperphenylalaninemia. The enzyme is a cytosolic homodimer that uses NADPH as 
  cofactor.

    review:
      summary: This is the core molecular function of SPR. The enzyme catalyzes 
        the NADP+-dependent reduction of sepiapterin and related pteridine 
        substrates. PMID:1883349 cloned human SPR and established it as "an 
        enzyme involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis." UniProt confirms 
        EC 1.1.1.153 with experimental evidence and kinetic characterization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation precisely describes the core enzymatic function of
        SPR. The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic analysis and 
        confirmed by extensive experimental evidence including kinetic 
        characterization.

    review:
      summary: SPR catalyzes the terminal reduction steps in BH4 biosynthesis, 
        making this the core biological process. The deep research confirms SPR 
        operates downstream of GCH1 and PTS in de novo BH4 biosynthesis and 
        participates in BH4 salvage from sepiapterin. SPR deficiency causes BH4 
        deficiency leading to dopamine and serotonin deficiencies 
        (PMID:11443547).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is the primary biological process in which SPR functions. As 
        the terminal reductase in BH4 biosynthesis, this annotation is accurate 
        and represents the core function. Well supported by IBA phylogenetic 
        evidence and extensive literature.

      summary: IEA based on UniProt keyword KW-0560 (Oxidoreductase). SPR is 
        indeed an oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.153), catalyzing NADPH-dependent

        specific GO:0004757 (sepiapterin reductase activity).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While this term is much less specific than GO:0004757, it is not 
        incorrect. SPR is an oxidoreductase. The more specific term (sepiapterin

    review:

        study. SPR is primarily a cytosolic enzyme and mitochondrial 
        localization is not the primary site of function. This may represent 
        detection in a comprehensive proteomics survey rather than functional 
        mitochondrial localization.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: SPR is well-established as a cytosolic enzyme (UniProt, IDA 
        evidence). The mitochondrial detection in this HTP study may be due to 
        contamination or minor dual localization but does not represent the 
        primary functional compartment. BH4 biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol. 
        This annotation could be misleading about primary localization.

        synthesis in human platelets. The study demonstrated functional BH4 
        synthesis in platelets and discussed its importance for NO synthase 
        activity. BH4 is an essential cofactor for NOS enzymes. However, SPR 
        does not directly synthesize NO - it synthesizes BH4 which is required 
        as a cofactor by NOS.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: This annotation represents an indirect relationship. SPR 
        synthesizes BH4, which is required as a cofactor for NOS. SPR does not 
        directly participate in NO biosynthesis. The annotation is somewhat 
        over-extended. The core function is BH4 biosynthesis. If the connection 
        to NO synthesis is to be retained, it should be as a more general 
        regulatory term or kept as non-core.

    review:
      summary: TAS annotation based on the cloning paper. The paper noted

        GO:0008106 refers to a different enzymatic activity (alcohol 
        dehydrogenase converting ethanol to acetaldehyde), not sepiapterin 
        reductase activity. This appears to be an incorrect mapping.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: This is an incorrect annotation. SPR does not have alcohol 
        dehydrogenase activity as defined by GO:0008106 (primary alcohols to 
        aldehydes). SPR is specifically a sepiapterin reductase (EC 1.1.1.153), 
        not an alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.2). The original paper mentions 
        sequence homology to SDR family members but does not demonstrate alcohol
