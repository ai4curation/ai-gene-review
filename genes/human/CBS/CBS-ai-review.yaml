description: >-
  Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a PLP- and heme-containing enzyme (EC 4.2.1.22) that catalyzes
  the first and rate-limiting step of the transsulfuration pathway, condensing L-serine with
  L-homocysteine to form cystathionine. CBS is unique among PLP-dependent enzymes in also binding
  a b-type heme cofactor that functions as a redox sensor. The enzyme is allosterically activated
  by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding to its C-terminal regulatory domain containing tandem CBS
  (Bateman) motifs. CBS forms filamentous assemblies that are allosterically tunable by SAM.
  Alternative reactions can generate H2S through condensation of cysteine with homocysteine.
  CBS deficiency causes classical homocystinuria, characterized by hyperhomocysteinemia with
  multi-system manifestations including vascular, ocular, skeletal, and neurological complications.

      CBS activity is the defining function of this enzyme. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cystathionine beta-synthase activity (EC 4.2.1.22) is the core enzymatic function of CBS.
      The enzyme catalyzes the PLP-dependent condensation of L-serine and L-homocysteine to form
      cystathionine. This is the canonical, rate-limiting step of the transsulfuration pathway.
      IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference across multiple organisms.

      CBS activity is regulated under hypoxic conditions via heme-mediated gas sensing.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      CBS heme can bind gaseous ligands (NO, CO, O2) and the nitrite reductase activity
      may be relevant under hypoxic conditions. This represents regulatory biology
      and non-core function.

    summary: >-
      Study showing CBS deficiency leads to increased DNA damage due to elevated
      homocysteine.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This annotation reflects that CBS deficiency causes DNA damage, likely due to
      homocysteine accumulation and oxidative stress. The 'DNA protection' annotation
      captures the consequence that functional CBS protects DNA indirectly by
      maintaining low homocysteine levels. This is a downstream pleiotropic effect.
