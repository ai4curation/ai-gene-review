## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P35520
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cystathionine beta-synthase {ECO:0000305}; EC=4.2.1.22 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20506325, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23974653, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23981774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25044645}; AltName: Full=Beta-thionase; AltName: Full=Serine sulfhydrase;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CBS;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the cysteine synthase/cystathionine beta-
- **Key Domains:** CBS_C. (IPR046353); CBS_dom. (IPR000644); CBS_dom_sf. (IPR046342); Cys_Synth/Cystath_Beta-Synth. (IPR050214); Cysta_beta_synth. (IPR005857)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CBS" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CBS' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CBS** (gene ID: CBS, UniProt: P35520) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity and symbol verification: The target is human cystathionine beta‑synthase (CBS), UniProt P35520. Recent structural and mechanistic papers explicitly describe human CBS as a PLP- and heme‑binding enzyme that catalyzes the first, committing step of reverse transsulfuration, confirming the gene symbol “CBS,” organism Homo sapiens, and the domain/family assignments including the C‑terminal Bateman (CBS) domains that mediate allostery (see below) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3).

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions, current understanding
- Primary function and reaction: Human CBS (EC 4.2.1.22) catalyzes the condensation of L‑serine and L‑homocysteine to form cystathionine and H2O, the first and rate‑limiting step of the reverse transsulfuration pathway that disposes of homocysteine and provides cystathionine for downstream cysteine and glutathione synthesis (reviewed), with capacity for alternative reactions that can generate H2S under certain substrate conditions (e.g., with cysteine) (Beard & Bearden 2011, American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology, Jan 2011; URL: https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00598.2010) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3, beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 1-2).
- Pathway context: Reverse transsulfuration connects the methionine cycle to cysteine/glutathione biosynthesis; CBS removes homocysteine (toxic at elevated levels) while contributing to protective outputs (cysteine and H2S) (Beard & Bearden 2011; URL above) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3, beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 1-2).
- Domain architecture: Human CBS comprises an N‑terminal heme‑binding region, a central PLP‑dependent catalytic domain, and a C‑terminal regulatory domain formed by tandem CBS (Bateman) motifs that bind S‑adenosyl‑L‑methionine (SAM/AdoMet), an allosteric activator (Ignoul & Eggermont 2005, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, Dec 2005; URL: https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00282.2005) (ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3). High‑resolution cryo‑EM further delineates the domain boundaries and regulatory loop (residues ~516–525) (McCorvie et al. 2024, Nature Communications, Feb 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.15.528523) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2).
- Cofactors: CBS is unusual among PLP enzymes in also binding a b‑type heme cofactor (heme ligated by Cys52/His65) that participates in redox sensing; CBS activity is modulated by gaseous ligands (NO/CO) and nitrite/nitrosyl interactions with heme, integrating redox and metabolic control (Roman et al. 2023, J Biol Chem, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105449) (roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 14-15).
- Allosteric regulation by SAM: SAM binds the Bateman domain, increasing catalytic activity by approximately 2–3 fold and inducing large conformational changes that relieve regulatory autoinhibition; disease mutations in the interdomain linker can abrogate SAM responsiveness (Ignoul & Eggermont 2005; Roman et al. 2023; URLs above) (ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Filamentous assemblies and allostery: Cryo‑EM structures of full‑length human CBS revealed that the enzyme polymerizes into filaments in both basal and SAM‑bound states, mediated by a conserved regulatory‑domain loop. In the basal state, regulatory domains occlude catalytic sites yielding low‑activity filaments with three dimers per turn; SAM binding produces high‑activity filaments with two dimers per turn and a SAM‑stabilized core of regulatory domains with flexible catalytic domains. Filamentation stabilizes CBS and increases cooperativity of SAM activation; polymerization is nutrient‑responsive in cells (McCorvie et al. 2024, Nat Commun, Feb 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.15.528523) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2).
- Disease mutations impairing allostery: Clinical variants in the catalytic–regulatory linker (e.g., K384E/N, M391I) reduce higher‑order oligomerization/filament formation, decrease basal activity, and render the enzyme unresponsive to or inhibited by SAM, implicating perturbed interdomain communication in pathogenesis (Roman et al. 2023, J Biol Chem, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105449) (roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 14-15).
- Self‑association diversity across mammals and variants: Biochemical and biophysical analyses show full‑length human CBS and homocystinuria variants form enzymatically active high‑molecular‑weight assemblies consistent with filaments; engineered Bateman‑domain deletions instead favor stable tetramers/octamers. Human liver lysates contain active high‑MW CBS aggregates, whereas mouse do not, highlighting species‑specific self‑association driven by Bateman‑domain interactions (Lee et al. 2024, Protein Science, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5223) (lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).
- Updated integration of heme/redox regulation: Contemporary analyses synthesize evidence that the CBS heme is a redox sensor; NO and CO binding to ferrous heme suppress activity and intersect with SAM regulation, while nitrite reductase activity of CBS can inhibit H2S biogenesis under some conditions (Roman et al. 2023; URL above) (roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 14-15).

3) Enzymatic specificity, H2S production, and localization
- Substrate specificity: The canonical reaction uses L‑serine and L‑homocysteine to produce cystathionine. Alternative CBS reactions (e.g., β‑replacement using L‑cysteine and L‑homocysteine) contribute to enzymatic H2S generation under appropriate substrate availability, complementing CSE/MPST pathways (Beard & Bearden 2011; URL above) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3, beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 1-2).
- H2S production routes and vascular relevance: CBS contributes to H2S formation during transsulfuration in tissues and even in human serum, linking homocysteine disposal to H2S‑mediated cytoprotection; impaired CBS (deficiency) alters H2S outputs and is associated with vascular complications (Beard & Bearden 2011; URL above) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 1-2).
- Cellular/tissue localization: Human liver lysates contain active high‑molecular‑weight CBS assemblies, confirming hepatic expression and in‑tissue assembly; species differences (human versus mouse) in self‑association have been demonstrated (Lee et al. 2024; URL above) (lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).

4) Structural and oligomeric states
- Modular quaternary structures: Classical views posited an active tetramer with a protease‑resistant catalytic dimer upon regulatory truncation. New cryo‑EM and biophysical work demonstrate concentration‑dependent formation of high‑molecular‑weight filaments that are catalytically active and allosterically tunable by SAM, alongside engineered constructs that stabilize tetramers/octamers when Bateman elements are altered (McCorvie et al. 2024; Lee et al. 2024; URLs above) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2, lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2, beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3).
- Allosteric architecture: The Bateman domain senses SAM and controls occlusion/unmasking of the catalytic domain active sites within filaments, providing a structural basis for positive cooperativity and nutrient sensing (McCorvie et al. 2024; URL above) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2).

5) Regulation: metabolites, cofactors, and redox signals
- SAM: Positive allosteric activator via binding to the Bateman domain; increases activity and induces large conformational shifts; mutations in the linker/Bateman interfaces can abolish activation (Ignoul & Eggermont 2005; Roman et al. 2023; URLs above) (ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2).
- PLP (vitamin B6): Essential catalytic cofactor for the β‑replacement reaction mechanism. CBS function depends on adequate B6 availability, coupling nutritional status to transsulfuration flux (reviewed) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3).
- Heme and gaseous ligands: The b‑type heme acts as a redox/gas sensor; NO and CO binding to reduced heme inhibit activity; SAM affects gas binding equilibria; CBS also shows nitrite reductase activity that can suppress H2S output (Roman et al. 2023; URL above) (roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 14-15, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2).

6) Human genetics, disease associations, and real‑world implementations
- Classical homocystinuria (HCU) due to CBS deficiency: CBS is the sole route for terminal homocysteine removal in transsulfuration; deficiency causes familial hyperhomocysteinemia with multi‑system manifestations (thromboembolism, lens dislocation, neurodevelopmental issues, skeletal disease). The CBS gene resides on 21q22.3; >150 mutations are reported. Two common missense alleles historically highlighted are I278T (often B6‑responsive) and G307S (often B6‑nonresponsive) (Beard & Bearden 2011; URL above) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3).
- Epidemiology and clinical chemistry: Prevalence estimates range from ~1/100,000 in the U.S. to as high as ~1/1,800 in Qatar; untreated total plasma homocysteine can exceed 200 μM versus normal ~5–15 μM (Lee et al. 2024; URL above) (lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).
- Treatment paradigms and implementations: Management includes pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation to enhance residual PLP‑dependent activity in responsive genotypes, betaine to drive remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, folate and B12 for remethylation support, and dietary methionine restriction with cysteine supplementation; neonatal screening and B6‑responsiveness stratify care. The methionine‑loading test can probe transsulfuration capacity and vascular risk better than fasting Hcy in some contexts (Beard & Bearden 2011; URL above) (beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 2-3, beard2011vascularcomplicationsof pages 1-2).
- Proteostasis and degradation of pathogenic variants: In human cell models lacking endogenous CBS, common HCU missense variants display reduced cellular stability versus wild‑type, increased ubiquitin‑proteasome pathway degradation, and variable impairments in oligomerization, activity, and SAM responsiveness. Proteasome inhibition increased half‑life and activity of selected mutants, and ERAD inhibition partially rescued activity, informing potential pharmacologic chaperone/proteostasis strategies (Mijatovic et al. 2024, Protein Science, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5123) (lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).

7) Expert opinions and synthesis
- Integration of filamentation into regulation: The discovery that CBS assembles into allosterically switchable filaments reframes CBS regulation as a polymerization‑coupled allostery system, with nutrient/SAM status and redox/gaseous signals (via heme) jointly tuning flux through reverse transsulfuration and H2S output. This provides a mechanistic substrate for context‑dependent CBS contributions to redox homeostasis and signaling (McCorvie et al. 2024; Roman et al. 2023; URLs above) (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 14-15).
- Clinical implications: Variant‑specific disruptions of interdomain communication and proteostasis likely explain heterogeneity in B6 responsiveness and disease severity. Targeting CBS assembly states, enhancing PLP loading, stabilizing regulatory interfaces, or modulating heme‑gas interactions may represent therapeutic avenues in homocystinuria and potentially in diseases of aberrant H2S signaling (Roman et al. 2023; Mijatovic et al. 2024; URLs above) (roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).

8) Relevant statistics and data
- Activity modulation: SAM increases human CBS activity approximately two- to three‑fold in biochemical assays and relieves regulatory autoinhibition (historical biochemical consensus) (Ignoul & Eggermont 2005; URL above) (ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3).
- Prevalence and biochemical thresholds: HCU prevalence ~1/100,000 (U.S.) to ~1/1,800 (Qatar); untreated tHcy often >200 μM; normal plasma tHcy ~5–15 μM (Lee et al. 2024; URL above) (lee2024impactofprimary pages 1-2).

Notes on symbol specificity
- The gene symbol CBS is unambiguous here: all cited 2023–2024 mechanistic/structural and clinical papers explicitly reference human cystathionine β‑synthase (CBS; UniProt P35520), with the canonical PLP catalytic core, b‑type heme cofactor, and C‑terminal Bateman domain allostery, matching the UniProt description and domain annotations provided (mccorvie2024architectureandregulation pages 1-2, roman2023diseasecausingcystathionineβsynthase pages 1-2, ignoul2005cbsdomainsstructure pages 2-3).
