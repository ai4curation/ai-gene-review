## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P01106
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Myc proto-oncogene protein; AltName: Full=Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 39; Short=bHLHe39; AltName: Full=Proto-oncogene c-Myc; AltName: Full=Transcription factor p64;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MYC; Synonyms=BHLHE39;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** bHLH_dom. (IPR011598); HLH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036638); Myc-LZ. (IPR003327); Myc_transcription_factors. (IPR050433); Tscrpt_reg_Myc. (IPR002418)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MYC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MYC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MYC** (gene ID: MYC, UniProt: P01106) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Plan and verification. We verified the target: Homo sapiens MYC (UniProt P01106) encodes the Myc proto-oncogene protein, a nuclear bHLH–leucine zipper transcription factor that heterodimerizes with MAX to bind E-box DNA elements and can repress via MIZ1; it contains conserved Myc boxes and is regulated by a T58/S62 phosphodegron recognized by FBXW7 (issa2024genomicdependenciesin pages 31-35, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 11-11, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-14).

Comprehensive research report

1. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and domains: MYC is a human bHLH-LZ transcription factor with an N-terminal transactivation domain harboring conserved Myc boxes (MBI–MBIV) and a C‑terminal bHLH‑LZ that mediates MAX dimerization and sequence-specific DNA binding to E-boxes (canonical CACGTG) at promoters and enhancers/super-enhancers (issa2024genomicdependenciesin pages 31-35, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7).
- Partners and DNA binding: MYC forms obligate heterodimers with MAX to bind E-box motifs; it can also interact with MIZ1 to repress transcription of cell-cycle inhibitors, integrating activation and repression programs in the nucleus (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 11-11).
- Cellular localization and function: MYC acts in the nucleus as a transcriptional amplifier influencing cell-cycle progression, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolic programs; it engages basal transcription machinery (e.g., TBP, P-TEFb) and enhancer architecture (super-enhancers) (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 11-11).
- Post-translational regulation and turnover: Phosphorylation at Ser62 and Thr58 forms a phospho-degron; GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation primes FBXW7 recognition and ubiquitin–proteasome degradation, tightly controlling MYC stability (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-14, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-15).

2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- MYC condensates and phase separation: Emerging work shows that phase separation of Myc/N‑Myc can modulate target-selective transcriptional programs, linking intrinsically disordered regions and condensate biology to MYC-driven gene control (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-15). While functional consequences are still being refined, these studies support a condensate-based layer of MYC regulation that may intersect with enhancer topology.
- Pan-cancer dependencies and translational maps: Recent efforts to translate cell-line essentiality into patient tumors have produced translational dependency maps connecting gene dependencies to TCGA tumors; MYC-associated programs emerge as core vulnerabilities across cancers, providing a framework for clinical prioritization (issa2024genomicdependenciesin pages 127-129). 
- Synthetic lethality via nucleocytoplasmic transport in MYC-high HCC (2024): A genome-wide CRISPR screen in a MYC-driven hepatocellular carcinoma model identified 1,808 MYC synthetic-lethal (MYC‑SL) genes with a prominent nucleocytoplasmic transport node; inhibiting Exportin‑1 (XPO1) caused marked tumor regression in a MYC-transgenic HCC model and reduced growth in HCC PDXs, with XPO1 high expression correlating with poor prognosis specifically in MYC‑high HCC (Nature Communications, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45128-y) (deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 1-2, deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 7-8).
- Regulatory RNAs and PTM crosstalk: Recent syntheses underscore long noncoding RNA effects on MYC expression/activity and SUMO–CDK9 axis crosstalk affecting transcriptional amplification, reflecting multilayered post-transcriptional and PTM control of the MYC network (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-15).

3. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Direct MYC inhibitors: Omomyc/OMO‑103. A first-in-human Phase 1 trial (Nature Medicine, Feb 2024; NCT04808362) tested OMO‑103 (91 aa Omomyc-derived miniprotein). Twenty-two patients enrolled; of 19 evaluable, 12 reached the predefined 9-week assessment; eight had stable disease and one achieved a 49% tumor-volume reduction; most adverse events were grade 1 infusion reactions. Pharmacokinetics showed a ~40 h serum half-life; recommended Phase 2 dose: 6.48 mg/kg (DL5). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-02805-1 (garralda2024myctargetingby pages 1-2).
- Indirect strategies and synthetic-lethal targeting: XPO1 inhibition as a MYC‑SL approach in MYC‑high HCC demonstrates in vivo tumor regression and PDX growth inhibition, nominating nucleocytoplasmic transport as a druggable MYC dependency (Nature Communications 2024: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45128-y) (deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 1-2, deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 7-8). Reviews catalog indirect modalities, including BET and CDK9 inhibitors, and emergent degraders/PROTACs directed at MYC or its co-dependencies (Frontiers in Oncology, 2023: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2023.1142111) (weber2023strategiestotarget pages 1-3). Additional overviews summarize PROTAC and epigenomic strategies in early clinical testing (yu2025rethinkingmycinhibition pages 4-5).
- Ongoing/announced trials: The Omomyc program continues into disease-focused studies following NCT04808362; multiple early-phase efforts explore indirect MYC suppression (e.g., BET/CDK9) and MYC‑centric degraders as summarized in recent reviews (garralda2024myctargetingby pages 1-2, yu2025rethinkingmycinhibition pages 4-5).

4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative trial report: Nature Medicine’s Phase 1 OMO‑103 publication provides clinical-grade evidence of feasibility, tolerability, target engagement, and preliminary antitumor activity for direct MYC inhibition in solid tumors (garralda2024myctargetingby pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic consensus syntheses: Contemporary reviews detail MYC’s multi-modal regulation as a nuclear bHLH-LZ factor integrating activation via MAX and repression via MIZ1, with critical control by phospho‑degron/FBXW7 pathways and engagement with enhancer architecture and transcriptional machinery (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 11-11). 
- Translational dependency and SL analysis: Nature Communications (2024) offers high-quality experimental evidence that MYC‑high tumors depend on nucleocytoplasmic transport, providing a practical therapeutic entry point (deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 1-2, deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 7-8).

5. Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- OMO‑103 (Phase 1): 22 patients enrolled; 19 evaluable; 12 reached 9-week assessment; 8/12 stable disease; 1 patient with 49% volume reduction; RP2D 6.48 mg/kg; serum t1/2 ~40 h; common TRAEs grade 1 infusion reactions (garralda2024myctargetingby pages 1-2).
- MYC dysregulation prevalence (HCC and general): The MYC network is altered in >70% of HCC; MYC overexpression contributes to >50% of human cancers overall, underscoring pan-cancer centrality (deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 1-2).
- Scope of MYC regulation: MYC/MAX binding regulates on the order of >11% of human genes (genome-wide mapping/E-box occupancy estimates), illustrating its broad transcriptional reach (issa2024genomicdependenciesin pages 31-35).

Mechanistic placement in pathways and subcellular localization
- Primary role: Nuclear transcription factor that directly binds E-box motifs as a MYC:MAX heterodimer to activate genes involved in cell-cycle progression, biomass accumulation (ribosome biogenesis), and metabolism; represses via MIZ1 complexes, balancing proliferative outputs (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 6-7, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 11-11, issa2024genomicdependenciesin pages 31-35).
- Regulation by PTMs: MYC protein stability is determined by sequential Ser62/Thr58 phosphorylation, promoting FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-14, jha2023mycfunctionand pages 14-15). This turnover gate keeps oncogenic thresholds and creates pharmacologic opportunities via E3 ligase axes.

Clinical and translational implications
- Direct MYC inhibition is now clinically feasible (OMO‑103), with early signals of disease stabilization and acceptable safety; defining biomarkers of benefit will be critical in Phase 2 (garralda2024myctargetingby pages 1-2).
- Indirect targeting of MYC dependencies (e.g., XPO1) is supported by in vivo efficacy, particularly in MYC‑high contexts such as HCC, suggesting patient selection by MYC activity may optimize responses (deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 1-2, deutzmann2024nucleartocytoplasmic pages 7-8).
