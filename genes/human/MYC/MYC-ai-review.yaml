description: MYC (c-Myc) is a nuclear bHLH-leucine zipper transcription factor 
  and major proto-oncogene that regulates cell growth, proliferation, 
  metabolism, and apoptosis. MYC functions primarily through obligate 
  heterodimerization with MAX to bind E-box DNA motifs (CACGTG) at promoters and
  enhancers, activating transcription of target genes involved in cell cycle 
  progression, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolic programs. MYC can also repress
  transcription via interaction with MIZ1 (ZBTB17). The protein contains 
  N-terminal transactivation domains with conserved Myc boxes (MBI-MBIV) and a 
  C-terminal bHLH-LZ domain for dimerization and DNA binding. MYC stability is 
  regulated by a phosphodegron at T58/S62 recognized by the E3 ligase FBXW7 for 
  ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. MYC is deregulated in over 50% of 
  human cancers and regulates approximately 11% of human genes.

    review:
      summary: MYC binds E-box DNA sequences (CACGTG) in promoters and enhancers
        as a heterodimer with MAX to regulate transcription. This is a 
        well-established core function supported by extensive structural and 
        functional evidence.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: E-box binding and sequence-specific DNA recognition at RNA Pol II 
        promoters is a core molecular function of MYC, essential for its role as
        a transcriptional regulator. IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound.
