# ATP6V0C: The Essential Proteolipid Subunit of Vacuolar H+-ATPase and Its Role in Cellular Acidification and Homeostasis

## Summary

ATP6V0C, encoding the 16 kilodalton proteolipid subunit c of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, represents a critical component of the cellular proton pumping machinery with profound implications for organellar acidification, membrane trafficking, metabolic regulation, and neurological function[2][7]. Located on human chromosome 16p13.3, this three-exon gene encodes a 155 amino acid transmembrane protein that forms the essential catalytic core of the V-ATPase's integral V0 domain, serving as the primary proton-conducting pore through which H+ ions traverse cellular membranes[2][7]. The ATP6V0C subunit functions as a critical element of the c-ring structure within the V0 domain, a rotary mechanism that converts ATP hydrolysis energy into an electrochemical gradient for proton translocation across lysosomal, endosomal, and synaptic vesicle membranes[2][3]. Beyond its canonical role in organelle acidification, ATP6V0C participates in diverse cellular processes including autophagy regulation, metabolic sensing through mTORC1 signaling, cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, and neurotransmitter loading in synaptic vesicles[5][12][15]. Recent discoveries linking ATP6V0C variants to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay, and intellectual disability have firmly established this gene as an important human disease locus[2][31][34], while emerging evidence reveals its unexpected roles in metabolic adaptation, viral pathogenesis, and tumor microenvironment acidification[5][28][45]. This comprehensive report explores the structure, function, regulation, and disease relevance of ATP6V0C, integrating biochemical, cellular, and genetic evidence to illuminate this essential component of the cellular proton pump.

## Structural Architecture and Positioning Within the V-ATPase Complex

The vacuolar H+-ATPase represents one of the most complex and highly conserved molecular machines in eukaryotic biology, comprising two functionally and structurally distinct domains: the peripheral V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and catalysis, and the integral V0 domain accountable for proton translocation across biological membranes[2][6][41]. The ATP6V0C subunit occupies a uniquely critical position within this complex architecture as a core component of the proteolipid ring structure of the V0 domain, which forms the rotary axis essential for the enzyme's function[3][8][20]. The human V-ATPase comprises thirteen distinct subunits in total, encoded by twenty-three different genes, with this genetic redundancy permitting the assembly of tissue-specific V-ATPase isoforms adapted to particular cellular compartments and physiological requirements[2][7]. The V0 domain itself consists of six different subunits designated a, c, c', c'', d, and e, with ATP6V0C encoding the major c-subunit, which polymerizes with ATP6V0B (encoding the c'' subunit) to form the functional proteolipid ring[2][3][41].

The molecular architecture of the c-ring demonstrates remarkable structural organization, with the archetypal composition consisting of nine copies of the ATP6V0C c-subunit together with a single copy of the ATP6V0B c'' subunit, forming a ten-membered ring structure embedded within the lipid bilayer[3][8][20]. This particular stoichiometry appears to be conserved across mammalian systems, though some variation exists among different organisms and cellular contexts[3][20][32]. Each ATP6V0C subunit possesses four transmembrane helical domains and contains a buried glutamic acid residue at position 139 (p.E139) that proves absolutely critical for the proton translocation mechanism[2][7][8][20]. This conserved glutamic acid undergoes sequential protonation and deprotonation cycles during proton transport, accepting protons from the cytoplasmic hemichannel and releasing them into the luminal hemichannel through conformational coupling with the subunit a protein of the V0 domain[8][20][41]. The critical importance of this residue becomes evident from the observation that point mutations such as p.E139A completely abolish V-ATPase activity[10]. The transmembrane topology of ATP6V0C places its N and C termini on the luminal side of the membrane, with the four transmembrane domains arranged to orient the proton-translocating glutamic acid in an optimal position for interacting with the arginine residue (p.R735) in the ATP6V0A subunit that serves as the essential counterpart in the proton translocation mechanism[2][7][8].

Recent structural studies employing high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy have begun to illuminate the precise three-dimensional organization and conformational dynamics of the ATP6V0C-containing V-ATPase complex[47][56]. The c-ring structure, including ATP6V0C, sits immediately adjacent to the subunit a protein, with which it forms the actual proton-conducting pathway through its rotation during catalytic turnover[8][41]. The arrangement of the proteolipid subunits around the ring appears to be highly organized and functionally optimized, with the placement of ATP6V0C relative to ATP6V0B (c'') and other c subunits critically determining proper assembly and function[3][8]. Structural modeling suggests that transmembrane domain 4 of ATP6V0C maintains critical spatial proximity to transmembrane domain 2 of ATP6V0B, suggesting that the interaction between these adjacent subunits plays an important role in stabilizing the ring structure and positioning the proton-translocating residues appropriately[8][10][20]. Furthermore, the proteolipid ring exists in dynamic rotational states during catalytic turnover, with recent cryo-EM studies revealing that ATP6V0C and its ring partners adopt distinct conformational states depending on whether the complex is actively translocating protons or in a resting state[38][47][56].

## Molecular Mechanism of Proton Translocation and Rotary Catalysis

The ATP6V0C-containing V-ATPase operates through an elegant rotary mechanism fundamentally distinct from other proton pumps, in which ATP hydrolysis in the V1 domain drives mechanical rotation of the c-ring composed of ATP6V0C and other proteolipid subunits relative to the stationary subunit a within the V0 domain[2][13][41][45]. This rotary mechanism represents one of the most remarkable examples of biological energy transduction, directly coupling chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work and ultimately to electrochemical gradient establishment[13][41][47]. The mechanistic details of this process have been elucidated through a combination of biochemical characterization, single-molecule rotation experiments in both yeast and mammalian systems, and increasingly high-resolution structural determination by cryo-EM approaches[13][47][56]. Understanding the precise role of ATP6V0C within this mechanical framework requires careful consideration of how its structural features enable and facilitate proton movement during rotary catalysis.

The proton translocation pathway itself comprises two critical hemichannels, one facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and one facing the luminal side, both formed through interactions between the subunit a protein and the rotating c-ring containing ATP6V0C[8][17][41]. As the c-ring rotates, the buried glutamic acid residues of ATP6V0C and its partner proteolipid subunits sequentially come into alignment with these hemichannels, enabling stepwise proton binding, movement, and release[8][17][20][41]. The process begins when a proton enters the cytoplasmic hemichannel and binds to the glutamic acid of an ATP6V0C molecule as it passes through the channel; the protonated carboxyl group remains attached to the subunit as the ring rotates because of the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer, which prevents deprotonation[8][41]. As continued rotation brings the protonated ATP6V0C molecule toward the luminal hemichannel, it encounters a critical conserved arginine residue (p.R735) within subunit a that stabilizes the glutamic acid in its charged form, promoting deprotonation and release of the proton into the luminal hemichannel[8][17][41]. The continued rotation then positions the now-deprotonated ATP6V0C glutamic acid back toward the cytoplasmic hemichannel, where it becomes available for rebinding another proton[8][17][41].

The stoichiometry of proton translocation relative to ATP hydrolysis represents a fundamental parameter determining the energetic efficiency of the pump and the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient it can establish[13][32][47]. Studies of V-ATPase and its F-ATPase relatives have demonstrated that the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per complete rotation of the c-ring correlates with the stoichiometry of the ring structure itself[32][47]. For the ten-membered c-ring typical of mammalian V-ATPases (containing nine ATP6V0C subunits plus one ATP6V0B subunit), the enzyme typically translocates approximately ten protons per three ATP molecules hydrolyzed, which corresponds to one complete rotation of the c-ring per three ATP hydrolysis events in the V1 domain[13][47]. This represents a remarkably efficient energy conversion, with each ATP hydrolysis event driving a 120-degree rotation of the rotor complex and translocating multiple protons across the membrane[13][47].

The ATP6V0C subunit also plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical properties of the c-ring rotation, as the glutamic acid residue and the overall hydrophobic environment of the transmembrane domains influence both the proton binding affinity and the mechanical torque generated during rotation[8][20]. The four transmembrane helical domains of ATP6V0C create a steric and electrostatic environment essential for properly orienting the proton-translocating glutamic acid and positioning it for optimal interaction with the subunit a arginine residue[8][20]. Moreover, the relative arrangement of ATP6V0C within the ring structure places certain spacing constraints on how the protonatable residues are distributed around the ring circumference, which appears to coordinate the timing of proton binding and release with mechanical rotation[3][8][20].

## Cellular Localization, Tissue Distribution, and Organellar Targeting

The ATP6V0C subunit, as an integral component of the V0 domain, participates in the targeting and localization of the entire V-ATPase complex to specific cellular compartments, and its expression patterns vary across tissues reflecting the distinct acidification requirements of different cell types and organelles[2][5][15][22]. In most mammalian cells, V-ATPases containing ATP6V0C localize predominantly to intracellular compartments including lysosomes, endosomes, secretory vesicles, and Golgi-derived transport vesicles, where they perform the essential function of maintaining an acidic microenvironment necessary for proper organellar function[5][15][18]. Within neurons, ATP6V0C becomes particularly enriched in synaptic vesicles, where V-ATPases create the proton electrochemical gradient essential for the antiporter-mediated loading of neurotransmitters into these compartments[2][18][44]. The targeting of ATP6V0C-containing V-ATPases to these specific organelles occurs through a complex process involving tissue-specific isoforms of the subunit a protein (ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0A2, ATP6V0A4) that determine subcellular localization[15][17].

Beyond its canonical intracellular localization, ATP6V0C can localize to the plasma membrane in certain cell types under specific physiological conditions, where it participates in extracellular acidification and other plasma membrane-related functions[15][28][37][46]. In osteoclasts, plasma membrane V-ATPases containing ATP6V0C contribute to the acidification of the resorption lacunae beneath bone-resorbing cells, enabling the demineralization of bone matrix[15]. Similarly, in renal intercalated cells and epididymal clear cells, ATP6V0C-containing V-ATPases traffick to the apical plasma membrane in response to physiological signals regulating acid-base balance and sperm maturation[15][17]. The regulation of plasma membrane trafficking of ATP6V0C-containing complexes involves intricate signaling mechanisms including PKA-mediated phosphorylation, AMPK-dependent modulation, and bicarbonate-sensing pathways, allowing these specialized cells to rapidly adjust V-ATPase localization in response to changing metabolic and acid-base conditions[17][48].

Recent evidence indicates that ATP6V0C expression levels and localization also respond to nutrient availability and metabolic status, suggesting an adaptive mechanism whereby cells modulate proton pumping capacity in response to changing energetic demands[24][45][54]. In cancer cells, increased ATP6V0C expression and enhanced targeting to both intracellular acidic compartments and the plasma membrane support the elevated metabolic demands and invasive phenotype characteristic of malignant transformation[5][25][37][45][51]. The availability of tissue-specific isoforms of interacting subunits, along with post-translational modifications of ATP6V0C itself, provides multiple levels of regulation enabling cells to adjust V-ATPase function and localization to match specific cellular contexts and physiological demands.

## Functional Roles in Lysosomal Acidification and Autophagy Regulation

The primary function of ATP6V0C within the context of cellular physiology centers on its absolutely essential role in maintaining the highly acidic pH of lysosomes, typically maintained at pH 4.5-5.0, which proves critical for the activity of the entire complement of lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, nucleases, and lipases[5][12][15][43]. The broad majority of lysosomal enzymes exhibit optimal catalytic activity in this acidic pH range, with many requiring pH below 5.0 for efficient substrate hydrolysis[43]. ATP6V0C, as the core proton-conducting component of the lysosomal V-ATPase, directly enables this acidification through its role in the rotary proton pump mechanism[5][12][15][43]. The functional importance of this activity becomes starkly evident in cells in which ATP6V0C function has been disrupted, where impaired lysosomal acidification results in dramatic accumulation of undigested autophagic substrates, reduced hydrolytic enzyme activity, and compromised cellular homeostasis[5][12][21].

Beyond simple acidification, ATP6V0C participates critically in the broader process of autophagy, one of the most important cellular catabolic pathways for recycling damaged organelles and proteins[5][12][15]. During macroautophagy, cellular components become enclosed within double-membraned autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where the enclosed contents are degraded[5][15][21]. The ATP6V0C-dependent acidification of autolysosomes proves essential not only for providing the optimal pH for hydrolase activity but also for proper regulation of the autophagic process itself[5][12][21][24]. Recent research has revealed that ATP6V0C participates in more nuanced roles within the autophagy-lysosome pathway beyond simple pH maintenance, including direct scaffolding functions that facilitate autophagosome-lysosome fusion[54]. In a striking demonstration of these scaffolding functions, ATP6V0C was shown to bridge key SNARE proteins (STX17 and VAMP8) essential for membrane fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, with this function appearing separable from the acidification-dependent aspects of ATP6V0C activity[54].

The regulation of autophagy itself appears intimately connected to ATP6V0C function and V-ATPase assembly status, with the enzyme serving as a key nexus point for nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation[15][24][43]. Under conditions of nutrient abundance, particularly high amino acid availability, the V-ATPase complex (including ATP6V0C) experiences a regulatory dissociation whereby the V1 and V0 domains separate, reducing proton pumping activity and in turn modulating autophagy[15][24][43]. This dissociation mechanism allows cells to fine-tune autophagy flux in response to nutrient availability, conserving energy during periods of metabolic sufficiency while maintaining active degradative capacity during nutrient scarcity[15][24][43]. The precise molecular mechanisms coordinating ATP6V0C-dependent lysosomal acidification with these regulatory dissociation events remain incompletely understood but clearly represent a critical nexus for metabolic homeostasis.

## Regulation of mTORC1 Signaling and Metabolic Sensing

Beyond its direct role in lysosmal acidification, ATP6V0C functions as a critical component of the cellular nutrient-sensing machinery, particularly through its involvement in amino acid-dependent activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of anabolic metabolism and autophagy[15][17][24]. The V-ATPase, including its ATP6V0C component, localizes to the lysosomal membrane where it assembles into a signaling complex with mTORC1 and its upstream regulators, collectively termed the "lysosomal signaling hub"[15][24]. In this context, V-ATPase-dependent lysosomal acidification and perhaps more importantly the assembly status of the V-ATPase complex itself, contributes to the regulation of mTORC1 localization and activity in response to amino acid availability[15][24]. When amino acids become available intracellularly, through either exogenous uptake or from lysosomal degradation products, mTORC1 becomes activated and phosphorylates downstream targets including ULK1, suppressing autophagy initiation[15][24].

The relationship between ATP6V0C function and mTORC1 regulation appears more complex than previously recognized, as disruption of V-ATPase function can paradoxically activate certain aspects of mTORC1 signaling despite impairing amino acid uptake[24]. Studies employing genetic approaches to selectively disrupt V-ATPase assembly have demonstrated that loss of functional V-ATPase, including ATP6V0C, does not simply suppress mTORC1 activity as would be predicted from a simple nutrient starvation response[24]. Instead, the loss of V-ATPase leads to altered patterns of mTORC1 phosphorylation at different substrate sites, suggesting that V-ATPase regulates multiple upstream nodes of mTORC1 signaling[24]. This complexity likely reflects the fact that V-ATPase participates in both direct amino acid sensing through the KICSTOR and other protein complexes and indirect effects on amino acid availability through lysosomal degradation and nutrient absorption[15][24].

ATP6V0C also participates in the regulation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), another critical metabolic sensor that responds to energy depletion, through mechanisms that remain not fully characterized but that likely involve pH-dependent effects and the assembly status of the V-ATPase complex[15][46][57]. AMPK antagonizes mTORC1 signaling and promotes catabolic processes including autophagy, making the interplay between V-ATPase-dependent mTORC1 and AMPK signaling central to metabolic adaptation[15][24][46]. The ability of cells to sense nutrient availability and energy status through ATP6V0C-dependent mechanisms represents one of the critical homeostatic functions of this subunit beyond simple proton pumping.

## Post-Translational Regulation and V-ATPase Assembly

ATP6V0C, as an integral membrane protein component of the V-ATPase, undergoes multiple layers of post-translational regulation affecting its synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and stability, all of which modulate V-ATPase function in response to cellular demands[38][56][57]. The assembly of the V0 domain containing ATP6V0C occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires specialized chaperone proteins including Vma12p, Vma21p, and Vma22p in yeast systems, with mammalian homologs playing analogous roles[38][56][59]. These dedicated assembly factors facilitate the proper folding of ATP6V0C, ensure its correct integration into the growing c-ring structure, and importantly mediate quality control mechanisms to prevent misfolded or partially assembled V-ATPases from reaching cellular acidic compartments where inappropriate proton pumping could prove detrimental[38][56]. The interaction between ATP6V0C and these assembly factors appears highly regulated, with the chaperones dissociating from assembled V0 only after productive complex formation and perhaps following subsequent assembly with the V1 domain[38][56][59].

The reversible association and dissociation of the V1 and V0 domains, with ATP6V0C remaining as a component of the membrane-bound V0, represents a critical regulatory mechanism whereby cells rapidly modulate V-ATPase activity in response to nutrient availability and metabolic status[15][43][57]. During glucose deprivation in yeast, approximately 70% of V-ATPase complexes rapidly dissociate into their component domains, reducing proton pumping and conserving ATP[15][43][57]. In mammalian systems, glucose starvation paradoxically appears to enhance V-ATPase assembly through AMPK and PI3K/Akt signaling mechanisms, suggesting distinct regulatory logic in different cell types and metabolic contexts[15][57]. The dissociation and reassembly of V1/V0 complexes occurs through mechanisms involving the release and reuptake of the regulatory V1C subunit, which plays a central coordinating role in mediating the V1-V0 interaction[15][43][57].

Beyond gross assembly and disassembly, ATP6V0C undergoes site-specific post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation, all of which appear to modulate its function and stability[57]. The glycosylation of ATP6V0C and associated subunits affects both the assembly of the V-ATPase and its trafficking to appropriate cellular destinations, with disruptions in glycosylation impairing V-ATPase localization to lysosomes[57]. Ubiquitination of ATP6V0C, mediated by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases including RNF182, targets the protein for proteasomal degradation, providing a mechanism for adjusting V-ATPase abundance in response to cellular signals[19]. The identification of RNF182 as an ATP6V0C-targeting E3 ligase has suggested a role for dynamic regulation of V-ATPase levels in neuronal physiology, as RNF182 itself shows upregulation in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue[19]. Phosphorylation of ATP6V0C and associated V-ATPase subunits by PKA modulates the trafficking of V-ATPase-containing vesicles and the recruitment of the complex to the plasma membrane in specialized cells such as renal intercalated cells[15][17][48].

## Pathogenic ATP6V0C Variants and Neurodevelopmental Disease

The discovery that heterozygous point mutations in ATP6V0C cause a previously unrecognized neurodevelopmental syndrome represents one of the most significant recent contributions to understanding this gene's importance in human health and disease[2][31][34]. In 2023, Mattison and colleagues published a landmark study describing twenty-seven patients carrying heterozygous missense variants in ATP6V0C who presented with a remarkably consistent clinical phenotype characterized by developmental delay, early-onset epilepsy, and intellectual disability[2][31][34]. The clinical presentation of this novel ATP6V0C-associated neurodevelopmental disorder demonstrates striking consistency across multiple unrelated families and populations, with developmental delay evident from infancy or early childhood, seizures typically manifesting within the first two years of life, and intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe[2][31][34]. Additional neurological features reported in the ATP6V0C variant cohort include corpus callosum hypoplasia and cardiac abnormalities in some affected individuals, suggesting broader developmental consequences of impaired V-ATPase function[2][31].

The genetic variants identified in affected patients predominantly clustered within transmembrane domains, with a remarkable enrichment observed within the fourth transmembrane domain of ATP6V0C[2][10]. This specific enrichment within TM4, which participates in interactions with the ATP6V0A subunit during proton translocation, suggested that the patient variants specifically disrupt the critical interaction between ATP6V0C and ATP6V0A necessary for proper proton pumping[2][10]. In silico modeling studies examining the structural consequences of patient variants predicted that these mutations would significantly impair the precise geometric relationship between the glutamic acid of ATP6V0C (p.E139) and the arginine of ATP6V0A (p.R735) that mediates proton release during the rotation cycle[2][10]. These computational predictions proved highly consistent with subsequent functional studies.

The functional consequences of patient variants were validated through multiple experimental approaches employing yeast, fly, and worm models, demonstrating the convergent evidence for pathogenicity and mechanism[2][31]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, patient variants were tested using complementation of yeast vma3Δ mutants (vma3 being the yeast ortholog of ATP6V0C), with the assays measuring both proton pumping capacity through LysoSensor fluorescence and indirect growth assessments on high-osmolarity media requiring functional V-ATPase[2][10]. The majority of patient variants exhibited substantially reduced LysoSensor fluorescence signal, indicating impaired proton translocation, and many showed reduced growth in high salt media, confirming that these variants produce dysfunctional V-ATPases[2][10]. In Drosophila melanogaster, pan-neuronal knockdown of the ATP6V0C ortholog (Vha16-3) resulted in increased duration of seizure-like behavior evoked by neural stimulation, directly demonstrating a link between ATP6V0C loss of function and seizure predisposition[2][31][42]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, expression of selected patient variants led to observable motor dysfunction, reduced growth, and shortened lifespan, indicating organism-level consequences of impaired ATP6V0C function[2][31].

The molecular mechanism underlying the neurodevelopmental phenotype in patients with ATP6V0C variants likely centers on the critical importance of V-ATPase function in synaptic vesicle acidification and neurotransmitter loading[2][18][31]. Synaptic vesicles depend absolutely on V-ATPase-generated proton gradients to load classical neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, and monoamines through vesicular monoamine transporters and other H+-coupled antiporters[2][18][44]. Any impairment in ATP6V0C function would predictably reduce synaptic vesicle acidification, compromise neurotransmitter loading, and ultimately impair synaptic transmission, providing a plausible mechanistic basis for both the seizure phenotype and broader neurological dysfunction[2][18][31][44]. The seizure susceptibility may additionally relate to potential effects on GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, which depends critically on proper GABA loading into synaptic vesicles[2][31]. Furthermore, the broader intellectual disability phenotype might reflect more widespread effects of impaired V-ATPase function on dendritic spine development, synaptic plasticity, and circuit formation, processes all dependent on proper vesicular trafficking and acidification[2][31][34].

## ATP6V0C in Cancer and the Tumor Microenvironment

ATP6V0C has emerged as an important mediator of cancer cell biology, with elevated expression and altered regulation of this subunit contributing to multiple hallmarks of malignant transformation including enhanced invasiveness, increased metastatic potential, metabolic reprogramming, and chemoresistance[5][25][37][45][46][51]. The role of ATP6V0C in cancer appears multifaceted, reflecting both the intrinsic metabolic requirements of rapidly proliferating tumor cells and their specific adaptations to hostile microenvironments characterized by hypoxia, nutrient limitation, and immune surveillance[5][25][28][45][46]. In numerous cancer types, elevated ATP6V0C expression correlates directly with invasiveness and metastatic potential, with particularly striking evidence emerging from prostate cancer studies demonstrating that highly metastatic prostate cancer cell lines express substantially higher levels of ATP6V0C protein compared to non-metastatic counterparts[37]. This expression correlation suggests a specific selective pressure favoring ATP6V0C upregulation during the process of malignant progression and metastatic dissemination.

The enhanced invasiveness imparted by elevated ATP6V0C expression operates through multiple interconnected mechanisms, with one particularly important pathway involving extracellular acidification and the degradation of extracellular matrix[5][25][37][46][51]. Tumor cells depend critically on maintaining relatively alkaline intracellular pH despite high rates of glycolytic metabolism that generates substantial intracellular acid; they achieve this through enhanced ATP6V0C-dependent proton extrusion to the extracellular space[5][25][46][51]. This extracellular acidification activates matrix metalloproteinases and other proteolytic enzymes that degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix, facilitating tumor cell invasion and dissemination[5][25][37]. Knockdown or inhibition of ATP6V0C in highly invasive cancer cell lines substantially reduces both the activity of secreted matrix metalloproteinases (particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9) and the invasive and migratory capacity of these cells, establishing a functional link between ATP6V0C expression and the invasive phenotype[37][46][51]. Moreover, the interaction between ATP6V0C and tumor metastasis suppressor proteins such as LASS2/TMSG1 appears to regulate V-ATPase activity with direct consequences for tumor cell behavior[5][37]. Silencing of ATP6V0C specifically inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion through mechanisms that appear to operate at least partially through LASS2/TMSG1-independent pathways, suggesting that ATP6V0C controls invasion through multiple regulatory nodes[37].

Beyond its effects on matrix degradation and invasion, ATP6V0C participates in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, particularly in the context of aerobic glycolysis and the Warburg effect[45][46][51]. In esophageal cancer cells, ATP6V0C directly interacts with pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a key glycolytic enzyme and known regulator of cancer metabolism[45][51]. The ATP6V0C-PKM2 interaction promotes PKM2 phosphorylation at tyrosine 105, an important post-translational modification that enhances PKM2 dimer formation and nuclear translocation[45][51]. Nuclear PKM2 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, enhancing the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) target genes involved in glycolytic enzyme expression and metabolism[45][51]. This ATP6V0C-PKM2-HIF-1 axis directly enhances the expression of critical glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase 2 (HK2), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), enolase 1 (ENO1), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), with depletion of ATP6V0C reducing the expression of this entire cohort of glycolytic genes and substantially impairing glucose metabolism[45][51]. These metabolic effects of ATP6V0C depletion directly impact cancer cell proliferation and survival, as the reduction in glucose metabolism and ATP production creates a state of bioenergetic insufficiency that triggers multiple pro-apoptotic pathways[45][51].

ATP6V0C also participates in chemoresistance of cancer cells through its role in intracellular pH homeostasis and the sequestration of chemotherapeutic agents into acidic compartments[5][25]. Many chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly weak base compounds, become preferentially accumulated in acidic intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes through pH-dependent trapping mechanisms[5][25]. Tumor cells with enhanced ATP6V0C expression and elevated V-ATPase activity maintain more acidic intracellular vesicles, promoting sequestration of weak base chemotherapeutic agents away from their nuclear and cytoplasmic targets, thereby conferring chemoresistance[5][25]. Moreover, elevated V-ATPase activity supports the high energy demands required for active drug efflux through multidrug resistance transporters, further contributing to chemoresistance[5][25].

The role of ATP6V0C in the acidic tumor microenvironment has become increasingly recognized as a critical component of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance[28][46]. Extracellular acidification, driven substantially by ATP6V0C-dependent V-ATPase activity at the plasma membrane of tumor cells and supporting cells within the tumor stroma, profoundly inhibits anti-tumor immune responses[28]. Acidic pH in the tumor microenvironment directly impairs the function of infiltrating T cells, suppressing their proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity[28]. Additionally, the acidic tumor microenvironment favors differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages toward the pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype, which promotes tumor growth and inhibits immune responses[28]. Remarkably, pharmacological strategies to increase tumor microenvironment pH, including treatment with sodium bicarbonate, have shown promise in enhancing T cell infiltration and improving immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in preclinical models[28]. These observations raise the possibility that ATP6V0C inhibition or modulation might represent a strategy to normalize tumor microenvironment pH and enhance immunotherapy efficacy.

## Interactions with Bacterial and Viral Pathogens

ATP6V0C has emerged as an unexpected target of multiple pathogenic microorganisms that have evolved mechanisms to manipulate or exploit V-ATPase function to facilitate their pathogenic strategies[5][9][26][27][29]. The bacterial pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis and septicemia, produces a type III secretion effector protein designated VepA that directly targets ATP6V0C to trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization and host cell death[5][26][29]. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that VepA specifically binds to ATP6V0C and through this interaction induces rupture of lysosomal membranes, releasing lysosomal contents including proteolytic enzymes into the cytoplasm and triggering caspase-independent cell death[26][29]. This mechanism appears to represent a virulence strategy whereby the pathogen directly triggers host cell death, potentially facilitating bacterial escape and dissemination from infected cells[26][29]. The identification of ATP6V0C as the specific cellular target of VepA reveals an unexpected vulnerability of the host cell to bacterial manipulation of V-ATPase function and suggests that variations in ATP6V0C expression or function might influence individual susceptibility to Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection[26][29].

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has also been shown to manipulate ATP6V0C-dependent V-ATPase function through multiple mechanisms, particularly through the viral accessory protein Vpu[5][9][27]. Vpu promotes the degradation of tetherin (also known as BST-2), a cellular restriction factor that inhibits the release of HIV-1 virions from infected cells by tethering nascent virions to the cell surface[5][9][27]. The mechanism by which Vpu-mediated tetherin degradation depends on ATP6V0C involves the sequestration of tetherin in acidic endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where it becomes inaccessible for interaction with viral particles[9][27]. ATP6V0C overexpression has been shown to enhance the sequestration of tetherin in CD63-positive late endosomal and LAMP-1-positive lysosomal compartments, demonstrating a direct role for ATP6V0C in this process[9][27]. Notably, the stabilization of tetherin by ATP6V0C overexpression occurs without inducing general tetherin degradation, suggesting that ATP6V0C facilitates sequestration of tetherin rather than promoting its proteasomal or lysosomal catabolism[9][27]. This requirement for ATP6V0C in HIV-1 replication and Vpu function may represent an exploitable vulnerability of the virus to ATP6V0C inhibition, potentially offering therapeutic strategies to restrict viral replication[9][27].

Beyond direct targeting by pathogenic factors, ATP6V0C and V-ATPase function more broadly participate in critical aspects of host antiviral immunity including autophagy, endosomal acidification, and presentation of pathogen-associated antigens through major histocompatibility complex pathways[5]. Many viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to antagonize V-ATPase function to evade host immune responses, suggesting that ATP6V0C represents a critical nexus point where host and viral pathogenic strategies intersect[5][9]. The targeting of ATP6V0C by multiple unrelated pathogens strongly suggests evolutionary conservation of this vulnerability and highlights ATP6V0C as an important emerging therapeutic target for infectious disease.

## Conclusion and Future Perspectives

ATP6V0C, the 16 kilodalton proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase V0 domain, emerges from contemporary research as an essential component of cellular homeostasis with ramifications extending far beyond its canonical role in organellar acidification. The fundamental function of ATP6V0C—serving as the proton-translocating core of the V-ATPase rotary mechanism—depends critically on its specific structural features, particularly the conserved glutamic acid at position 139 that undergoes reversible protonation and deprotonation during the mechanical rotation of the c-ring. Yet this basic bioenergetic function serves as the foundation for extraordinarily diverse cellular processes including autophagy regulation, metabolic sensing through mTORC1 and AMPK signaling, synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter loading, and intracellular pH homeostasis[2][5][12][15][18][21][45]. The discovery that heterozygous ATP6V0C variants cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by early-onset epilepsy and intellectual disability has firmly established this gene as an important human disease locus and revealed the critical importance of V-ATPase function in neurological development and function[2][31][34].

The emerging roles of ATP6V0C in cancer biology present both a challenge and an opportunity, as the heightened expression and activity of ATP6V0C in malignant cells contributes to invasiveness, metastatic potential, and therapeutic resistance through multiple mechanisms including extracellular acidification, metabolic reprogramming, and creation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment[5][25][28][37][45][46]. The manipulation of ATP6V0C and V-ATPase function by pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including the deadly pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus and the pandemic pathogen HIV-1, underscores the critical vulnerabilities created by dependence on ATP6V0C function for essential cellular processes[5][9][26][27][29]. These diverse roles of ATP6V0C across physiological and pathological contexts position this protein as a particularly promising target for therapeutic intervention in multiple disease states, from neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy to cancer, infectious disease, and age-related neurodegeneration.

Future research directions should prioritize deeper mechanistic understanding of how ATP6V0C variants impair V-ATPase function at the molecular level and how such impaired function translates into the observed neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The emerging understanding of ATP6V0C's role in metabolic signaling through mTORC1 and AMPK presents opportunities to understand how altered V-ATPase function might perturb metabolic homeostasis with consequences for neurodevelopment and cancer progression. The identification of ATP6V0C as a target of pathogenic factors merits continued investigation into the molecular details of these interactions and the potential for targeting ATP6V0C or its interactions as anti-infective strategies. Finally, the possibility that selective modulation of ATP6V0C function or ATP6V0C-interacting partner proteins might enable therapeutic enhancement of immune responses against cancer or infectious pathogens represents an intriguing therapeutic avenue warranting clinical investigation.
