description: >-
  ATP6V0C encodes the 16 kDa proteolipid subunit c of the V0 domain of vacuolar H+-ATPase
  (V-ATPase).
  This small (155 amino acid) integral membrane protein with four transmembrane helices
  is a core
  structural component of the proton-conducting c-ring rotor. Nine copies of ATP6V0C
  assemble with
  one copy of ATP6V0B (subunit c'') to form the complete c-ring within the V0 membrane
  domain.
  The c-ring rotates during ATP hydrolysis by the V1 domain, enabling proton translocation
  across
  membranes via a conserved glutamate residue (E139) that serves as the proton-binding
  site.
  ATP6V0C-containing V-ATPases acidify lysosomes, endosomes, Golgi, synaptic vesicles,
  and
  secretory granules, and in specialized cells (osteoclasts, kidney intercalated cells)
  also
  function at the plasma membrane. ATP6V0C is the binding target of the V-ATPase inhibitor
  bafilomycin A1. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in ATP6V0C cause early-onset epilepsy
  with
  or without developmental delay (EPEO3, OMIM 620465).

        ATP6V0C is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane helices that

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is INCORRECT for ATP6V0C. V-ATPases are proton PUMPS that
        use ATP hydrolysis
        to drive proton transport, not ATP synthases that use proton gradients to
        synthesize ATP.
        This is a common confusion arising from structural similarity between V-ATPases
        and F-ATPases.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        V-ATPases function in the OPPOSITE direction to ATP synthases. V-ATPases hydrolyze
        ATP to
        pump protons, creating acidification. F-ATP synthases use proton gradients
        to synthesize ATP.
        While the two enzyme families are evolutionarily related and share structural
        features,
        their functions are distinct. ATP6V0C is exclusively a component of V-ATPases.

      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        V-ATPase function is required for autophagy because lysosomal acidification
        is needed for
        autophagosome-lysosome fusion and cargo degradation. However, this is an indirect
        effect
        of the core acidification function rather than direct regulation of autophagy
        initiation.

      ATP6V0C is a core structural component of the V-ATPase V0 domain. Nine copies
      of
      ATP6V0C assemble with one copy of ATP6V0B to form the c-ring that rotates during
      proton translocation. The conserved glutamate residue E139 serves as the proton-binding
      site essential for proton transport.

      As part of the V-ATPase complex, ATP6V0C is essential for acidifying intracellular
      compartments including lysosomes, endosomes, Golgi, and synaptic vesicles. Acidification
      is required for hydrolase activity, receptor-ligand dissociation, neurotransmitter
      loading, and protein processing.
