## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O95352
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme ATG7 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATG12-activating enzyme E1 ATG7; AltName: Full=Autophagy-related protein 7; Short=APG7-like; Short=hAGP7; AltName: Full=Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATG7 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:16935}; Synonyms=APG7L;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATG7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Atg7. (IPR006285); Atg7_N. (IPR032197); Atg7_N_1. (IPR042522); Atg7_N_2. (IPR042523); ThiF/MoeB/HesA. (IPR045886)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATG7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATG7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATG7** (gene ID: ATG7, UniProt: O95352) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

1) Identity verification and definitions
- Gene/protein: ATG7 (autophagy related 7) encodes an E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme essential for macroautophagy. Human ATG7 belongs to the conserved ATG7 family and serves as the common E1 for two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: ATG12 and ATG8 (LC3/GABARAP) (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9).
- Family/domains and quaternary organization: ATG7 is a homodimeric E1 with N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains; structural work catalogs E1 features required for adenylation and thioester formation with ATG12/ATG8. The Atg7 homodimer mediates trans delivery to E2s (ATG10 or ATG3) (Feb 2021; Journal of Biochemistry; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).
- Organism: Evidence cited below pertains to human/mammalian ATG7, matching Homo sapiens O95352 (liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

2) Primary biochemical function and enzymatic mechanism (substrate specificity)
- Role: ATG7 is the E1-like activating enzyme that catalyzes the first committed steps in both ATG12 and LC3/ATG8 conjugation pathways required for autophagosome biogenesis and expansion (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2).
- Substrates and E2 partners:
  - ATG12 system: ATG7 adenylates ATG12’s C-terminal glycine, forms a thioester with its catalytic cysteine, and transfers ATG12 to the E2 enzyme ATG10, culminating in the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate that associates with ATG16L1 (Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).
  - LC3/ATG8 system: ATG7 adenylates processed LC3/ATG8 (after ATG4 cleavage), forms an ATG7∼LC3 thioester, then transfers LC3 to the E2 ATG3. The ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex acts as an E3-like factor to catalyze LC3 conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3–PE) at the phagophore (Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic steps and architecture: Structural/biochemical analyses show a distinctive trans-thioester transfer across an ATG7 homodimer: the UBL thioester on one protomer is transferred to an E2 bound to the other protomer, ensuring selective handoff to ATG3 or ATG10 (Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

3) Pathway context, cellular localization, and complexes
- Canonical autophagy: ATG7 functions in the cytosolic LC3 lipidation module (ATG7→ATG3→ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1→LC3–PE) that drives autophagosome membrane growth; the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate is generated on forming autophagic membranes and scaffolds E3-like activity with ATG16L1 (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).
- Complexes and interactions: ATG7 physically interacts with ATG3 and ATG10 to form transient E1–E2 complexes enabling UBL transfer. Regulatory and functional interactions extend to p53 and FOXO1, linking stress signaling to autophagy induction (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2).
- Noncanonical autophagy: Beyond macroautophagy, ATG7 also controls LC3-associated microautophagy/LC3-associated pathways; stimulus-driven ATG7 deacetylation induces both macroautophagy and LC3-associated microautophagy (Nov 2024; Autophagy; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2287932) (xu2024deacetylationofatg7 pages 1-2).

4) Recent developments (2023–2024): regulation, structure, and noncanonical roles
- Acetylation as a rheostat: A 2024 study showed that ATG7 is acetylated by EP300 (sites K284, K296); acetylation disrupts ATG7–ATG3 interaction and inhibits LC3 lipidation, whereas deacetylation promotes macroautophagy and LC3-associated microautophagy (Nov 2024; Autophagy; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2287932) (xu2024deacetylationofatg7 pages 1-2).
- Ubiquitination and stress signaling: Reviews summarize K63-linked ubiquitination at ATG7 K413 by TRIM7 (and additional ROS/DNA-damage–linked pathways), promoting ATG7 function in host defense and stress responses (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7).
- Transcriptional/post-transcriptional control: ATG7 mRNA and pre-mRNA maturation are influenced by RBPs (HuR, LIN28A) and splice factor mutations (U2AF35 S34F); FOXO1 acetylation favors formation of an Ac‑FOXO1–ATG7 complex that activates autophagy independently of Beclin1/mTOR, establishing transcription-independent regulation (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2).
- Structural and mechanistic consolidation: Structural catalogs delineate the common E1 chemistry (adenylation and thioester intermediates) and trans-thioester transfer across the ATG7 dimer to E2s, reinforcing models for E3-like activity of ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 in LC3 lipidation (Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

5) Disease genetics and pathophysiology
- Congenital disorders of autophagy: Recent clinical genetics emphasize that biallelic pathogenic variants in core conjugation genes (ATG5, ATG7, ATG12) cause neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative phenotypes, underscoring the essentiality of ATG7-mediated conjugation in human neural integrity (Oct 2025; MedRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.30.25338537) (lambton2025biallelicatg12variants pages 1-4).
- Aging-related and organ-specific roles: Reviews catalog tissue-specific consequences of ATG7 loss (e.g., hematopoietic dysfunction, mitochondrial defects, ROS buildup; epithelial barriers; metabolic tissues), and links to neurodegeneration and vascular biology, positioning ATG7 dysregulation within aging and disease spectra (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 7-8, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9).
- Signaling and immunity: ATG7 integrates with p53 and FOXO1 programs and modulates innate responses (e.g., Listeria clearance pathways requiring ATG7 regulation), highlighting crosstalk between autophagy and stress/immunity (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9).

6) Current applications and implementations
- Autophagy modulation as a therapeutic avenue: While specific ATG7-targeted drugs are not in routine use, contemporary work frames ATG7’s post-translational regulation (acetylation/ubiquitination) as potential druggable nodes to tune LC3 lipidation and LC3-associated microautophagy for disease contexts involving cytoplasmic DNA clearance or lysosomal membrane protein turnover (Nov 2024; Autophagy; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2287932) (xu2024deacetylationofatg7 pages 1-2). Reviews further position ATG7’s multi-layer regulation in aging and chronic disease as a rationale for intervention development (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9).

7) Expert opinions and consensus perspectives
- Comprehensive 2024 review (Communications Biology) synthesizes ATG7’s enzymology, PTM regulation (acetylation/ubiquitination), and disease relationships, arguing that ATG7 is a central, precisely programmed regulator whose dysregulation contributes to multiple age-related diseases (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic structural consensus (2021) consolidates the E1 chemistry and trans-thioester handoff across the ATG7 dimer to ATG3/ATG10, informing current models for conjugation system architecture (Feb 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

8) Quantitative details and data points
- Site-specific acetylation: K284 and K296 identified as EP300-catalyzed acetylation sites; mutation to arginine (2KR) preserves ATG7–ATG3 interaction and enhances LC3 lipidation and autophagy induction under stimuli (Nov 2024; Autophagy; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2287932) (xu2024deacetylationofatg7 pages 1-2).
- Ubiquitin linkage specificity: K63-linked ubiquitination at K413 (and other sites under ROS/DNA damage signaling) promotes ATG7 function, highlighting pathway-selective ubiquitin signaling (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7).
- Dimeric trans-thioester transfer: Structural analyses specify that Atg7 transfers activated UBLs in trans within the homodimer to cognate E2s, a distinctive specificity determinant for proper LC3/ATG12 conjugation (Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

9) Localization
- Functional localization is cytosolic at phagophore assembly sites where ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 scaffolds E3-like activity; ATG7 engages LC3/ATG12 and their E2s at these sites to effect lipidation/ligation (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1; Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

10) Verification against ambiguity safeguards
- The identity and role align with Homo sapiens ATG7: an ATG7-family E1 enzyme for ATG8/ATG12 conjugation, consistent with the UniProt O95352 annotation and InterPro families for ThiF/MoeB/HesA-like E1s. No conflicting gene symbol usage identified in human literature curated here (Mar 2024; Communications Biology; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1; Feb 2021; J Biochem; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (liu2024insightsone1like pages 1-2, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).

Key takeaways
- ATG7 is the shared E1-like enzyme catalyzing the activation of ATG12 and LC3/ATG8, central to autophagosome formation through adenylation and thioester intermediates and trans-thioester transfer to E2s ATG10 and ATG3, respectively (Feb 2021; https://doi.org/10.1093/jb/mvab017) (matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 2-3).
- Regulation by reversible acetylation (EP300-driven) and K63-linked ubiquitination (TRIM7 and stress kinases) tunes ATG7’s interaction with ATG3/ATG10 and downstream LC3 lipidation; stimulus-driven deacetylation is sufficient to induce macroautophagy and LC3-associated microautophagy (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2287932; Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (xu2024deacetylationofatg7 pages 1-2, liu2024insightsone1like pages 6-7).
- Human disease links extend from congenital autophagy disorders (ATG7/ATG5/ATG12) to aging-related processes and stress/immunity pathways; ATG7’s centrality makes its regulatory nodes attractive for therapeutic exploration (Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.30.25338537; Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06080-1) (lambton2025biallelicatg12variants pages 1-4, liu2024insightsone1like pages 8-9).
