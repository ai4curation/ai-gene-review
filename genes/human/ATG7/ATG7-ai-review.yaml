description: >-
  ATG7 is an E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme essential for autophagy. It functions
  as the common E1 enzyme
  for two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: (1) ATG12 conjugation, where ATG7 activates
  ATG12 for its
  conjugation with ATG5 via the E2 ATG10; and (2) ATG8/LC3 lipidation, where ATG7
  activates LC3/GABARAP
  proteins for their conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine via the E2 ATG3. ATG7
  forms a homodimer and
  uses a trans-thioester transfer mechanism across protomers. The catalytic cysteine
  (Cys572) is essential
  for forming thioester intermediates with ATG12 and ATG8 family proteins. Both conjugation
  systems are
  essential for autophagosome formation and membrane expansion during canonical macroautophagy.

        as a primary
        function. If autophagy flux oscillates with circadian rhythm, that does not
        make ATG7 a
        "rhythmic process" gene. ATG7's core function is as an E1-like enzyme for
        ATG8/ATG12
        activation. The circadian connection is a downstream effect in specific tissues
