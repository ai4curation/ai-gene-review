### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UQB8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BAR/IMD domain-containing adapter protein 2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:947}; AltName: Full=Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2; Short=BAI-associated protein 2; Short=BAI1-associated protein 2; Short=Protein BAP2; AltName: Full=Fas ligand-associated factor 3; Short=FLAF3; AltName: Full=Insulin receptor substrate p53/p58; Short=IRS-58; Short=IRSp53/58; AltName: Full=Insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa; Short=IRSp53; Short=Insulin receptor substrate p53;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BAIAP2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AH/BAR_dom_sf. (IPR027267); BAIP2_I-BAR_dom. (IPR030128); BAIP2_SH3. (IPR035594); I-BAR_dom. (IPR013606); IRSp53/IRTKS/Pinkbar. (IPR027681)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BAIAP2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BAIAP2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BAIAP2** (gene ID: BAIAP2, UniProt: Q9UQB8) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity and symbol verification: The target is human BAIAP2 (UniProt Q9UQB8), also known as IRSp53 (insulin receptor substrate of 53 kDa) and BAI1-associated protein 2. Literature consistently uses these aliases for the human I-BAR/IMD family adaptor IRSp53/BAIAP2, confirming symbol, organism, and domain architecture alignment (I-BAR/IMD N-terminus and C-terminal SH3, with CRIB/PR region and additional motifs) (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).

- Domain family: BAIAP2/IRSp53 is a member of the BAR superfamily’s I-BAR/IMD subgroup, with an N-terminal I-BAR/IMD that binds phosphoinositide-rich membranes, senses/generates negative curvature, and a C-terminal SH3 domain that recruits actin-regulatory partners. CRIB/PR motifs mediate small GTPase coupling. This matches the UniProt-listed domain composition (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Primary molecular role: IRSp53 is a curvature-sensitive membrane-cytoskeleton adaptor that couples plasma membrane shape to actin remodeling. Its I-BAR/IMD domain binds and sorts to negatively curved membrane topologies; its SH3 domain recruits actin effectors (e.g., WAVE/Scar complexes, N-WASP, Eps8, Mena/VASP) to modulate branched versus bundled actin assembly, integrating small GTPase signals (Rac1, Cdc42) (eLife, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; J Cell Sci, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; Mol Med Rep, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).
- Distinct from enzymes/transporters: IRSp53 is a scaffold/adaptor, not catalytic; it tunes actin architecture and membrane curvature rather than catalyzing chemical reactions or transporting substrates (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).

Molecular mechanism and pathway integration
- Curvature sensing/generation: IRSp53’s I-BAR displays curvature-dependent membrane sorting with a peak near 0.05 nm−1 (∼100 nm-diameter evaginations) and roughly twofold enrichment over control, linking membrane topography to actin assembly. In vitro, full-length IRSp53 deforms PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes, induces indentations/tubules, and can seed co-recruitment of partner BAR proteins (e.g., BIN1) (eLife 2023; Communications Biology 2024) (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5).
- Small GTPase coupling: A central CRIB/PR region and overall architecture place IRSp53 at the intersection of Rac1- and Cdc42-mediated signaling. Rac1 pathways bias toward WAVE–Arp2/3-dependent lamellipodia/ruffles, whereas Cdc42 influences filopodia; IRSp53 integrates these via its membrane-binding I-BAR and SH3-recruited effectors (J Cell Sci 2024; Mol Med Rep 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).
- SH3-mediated effectors: Through SH3, IRSp53 binds proline-rich partners, including components of the WAVE/Scar complex, N-WASP, Eps8, and Ena/VASP proteins, controlling actin nucleation and bundling to produce filopodia and lamellipodial edge dynamics (eLife 2023; Mol Med Rep 2025) (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).
- Cooperative BAR networks: IRSp53 and the N-BAR protein BIN1 cooperate in filopodia biogenesis; IRSp53-generated curvature recruits BIN1, and BIN1 requires IRSp53 to drive filopodia in cells, highlighting BAR–BAR crosstalk (Communications Biology, May 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5).

Subcellular localization and structures
- Sites of action: IRSp53 concentrates at the plasma membrane at regions of negative curvature, including nanoscale evaginations (~100 nm), and at protrusive structures like filopodia and lamellipodial edges. In neurons, it is enriched at dendritic spine structures. Full-length IRSp53 is required for curvature-enrichment and mechanochemical coupling to actin (eLife 2023; J Cell Sci 2024) (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Nanoscale mechanosensing of membrane shape homeostasis (eLife 2023): Mechanical stretch/compression generates ∼100 nm plasma membrane evaginations that are rapidly recognized by IRSp53. This triggers a transient Rac1/Arp2/3-driven actin burst that re-flattens the membrane (feedback timescale on the order of seconds; Ezrin recruitment lags actin by ∼10 s), establishing a membrane shape homeostasis mechanism (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; Sep 2023) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).
- BIN1–IRSp53 cooperation in filopodia (Communications Biology 2024): BIN1 is necessary and sufficient to promote filopodia in myoblasts, but requires IRSp53; >75% of IRSp53-positive filopodia co-localize with BIN1. IRSp53 forms membrane indentations on PI(4,5)P2 GUVs that recruit BIN1; IRSp53 knockdown reduces BIN1-driven filopodia. This defines a cooperative actin–membrane platform for protrusion (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8; May 2024) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5).
- Updated reviews of I-BAR/IRSp53 biology and virology interface (J Cell Sci 2024): IRSp53 is presented as the founding I-BAR family member with dual curvature sensing/generating capacity, PI(4,5)P2 binding, and SH3-mediated effector recruitment at the Rac1/Cdc42 signaling crossroads. Potential roles are discussed in EV release and viral assembly contexts (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).
- Family-level synthesis (Mol Med Rep 2025, accepted Dec 2024): While centered on IRTKS, this review contextualizes IRSp53 within the I-BAR family, emphasizing membrane curvature control, SH3-mediated recruitment of Eps8/WAVE/Ena-VASP, and Rac/Cdc42 interplay. It supports a conserved scaffold mechanism across family members (https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; Jan 2025; accepted Dec 19, 2024) (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Mechanobiology and cell migration: The eLife 2023 work operationalizes IRSp53 as a mechanosensor that restores membrane shape at the nanoscale, providing a framework for how cells maintain plasma membrane topography during migration and force adaptation—a concept applicable to immune cell navigation and epithelial dynamics (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).
- Filopodia engineering and muscle/cytoskeletal pathology: The BIN1–IRSp53 partnership offers a route to modulate filopodial dynamics and membrane–actin coupling in muscle and other cells, relevant to BIN1-linked myopathies and to protrusion-dependent processes such as neurite outgrowth and cell–cell contacts (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8; 2024) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5).
- Virology/EV biology: Reviews highlight IRSp53’s potential role in viral assembly interfaces and EV biogenesis at curved membrane microdomains, suggesting biophysical targets in pathogen–host interactions and intercellular cargo transfer (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Integrative perspective (J Cell Sci 2024): IRSp53 is framed as a central node connecting the plasma membrane’s lipid/curvature code with actin effectors downstream of Rac1/Cdc42. The review emphasizes how I-BAR electrostatics, PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains, and SH3-driven partner selection tune protrusion types (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).
- Mechanochemical control (eLife 2023): The study proposes a generalizable membrane homeostasis module in which I-BAR proteins (IRSp53) detect nanoscale curvature and recruit actin machinery to restore shape, prioritizing curvature sensing over curvature creation per se in the tested context (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).
- Family-level convergence (Mol Med Rep 2025): Cross-family comparisons (IRSp53/IRTKS) support a modular scaffold logic: I-BAR for curvature, CRIB/PR for small GTPase inputs, SH3 for NPF recruitment and actin bundling/nucleation output (https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025) (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent)
- Curvature sorting and enrichment: IRSp53 shows maximal sorting to membrane evaginations at curvature ≈0.05 nm−1 with ~2× enrichment over control; evaginations are ~100 nm scale; Ezrin follows IRSp53/actin with a ~10 s delay (eLife 2023, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; Sep 2023) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).
- Filopodia co-localization and dependency: In myoblasts, >75% of IRSp53-positive filopodia co-localize with BIN1; IRSp53 knockdown significantly reduces filopodia density; in vitro, full-length IRSp53 induces inward membrane indentations/tubules on PI(4,5)P2 GUVs that recruit BIN1 (Communications Biology 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8; May 2024) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5).
- Mechanistic models and recruitment: Work compiling I-BAR behavior shows IRSp53 recruitment to negatively curved membranes and coupling to Arp2/3-mediated actin network assembly in protrusions in cell-based systems (2023 synthesis) (sahnine2023molecularmechanismsregulating pages 125-131).

Pathways and compartmental context
- Pathways: IRSp53 integrates Rho-family GTPase signaling (Rac1, Cdc42) with actin nucleation/bundling via SH3 partners (WAVE, N-WASP, Ena/VASP, Eps8) to drive lamellipodial ruffles, filopodial protrusions, and endocytic/EV-associated actin dynamics (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8).
- Compartments: Plasma membrane protrusions (filopodia/lamellipodia), nanoscale membrane evaginations, dendritic spine compartments; endocytic and extracellular vesicle biogenesis sites are implicated by curvature-sensitive recruitment (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).

Disease and pathogen relevance (focused to available evidence)
- Neuronal/synaptic function: IRSp53 has established roles in dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity (supported by primary work cited within the 2023 eLife mechanistic paper), positioning BAIAP2 as a synaptic scaffold impacting plasticity phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 30-31).
- Pathogen/virology interfaces: Reviews highlight the plausibility of IRSp53 in viral assembly and EV release due to its ability to sense/organize PI(4,5)P2-rich curved microdomains and recruit actin effectors, a concept consistent with broader I-BAR biology (J Cell Sci 2024, https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).

Concise summary of primary function, location, and pathways
- Function: Curvature-sensitive membrane–actin adaptor that biases actin network architecture by recruiting NPFs/bundlers via SH3 in response to local membrane shape and small GTPase inputs (Rac1/Cdc42) (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).
- Location: Plasma membrane nanodomains of negative curvature, filopodia, lamellipodia, and neuronal dendritic spines; also implicated at endocytic/EV sites (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72316; 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8, lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7).
- Pathways: Rho GTPase–actin regulatory networks (Rac1/Cdc42) with downstream Arp2/3 and Ena/VASP/Eps8/WAVE via SH3 interactions, and cooperation with other BAR proteins (e.g., BIN1) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8; 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).

Quantified curvature sorting: peak at ~0.05 nm^-1 with ~2× enrichment. | Rac1, Arp2/3, Ezrin | Nanoscale plasma membrane evaginations (mechanosensing sites) | Quiroga et al., eLife 2023 (doi:10.7554/eLife.72316) (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8); Sahnine 2023 (sahnine2023molecularmechanismsregulating pages 125-131) |
| Cooperative factors (example: BIN1) | BIN1 (N-BAR) bundles actin and requires IRSp53 for BIN1-driven filopodia; BIN1 localizes at filopodia base and along filopodia and is recruited to IRSp53-induced membrane indentations; BIN1–IRSp53 association is SH3-mediated. Quant: >75% of IRSp53-positive filopodia show BIN1 colocalization. | BIN1, Dynamin, Ezrin | Filopodia base and shaft; GUV membrane tubules in vitro | Picas et al., Commun Biol 2024 (doi:10.1038/s42003-024-06168-8) (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5) |
| Disease & pathogen contexts | IRSp53 implicated in neuronal development/plasticity and neuropsychiatric phenotypes (mouse social deficits, synaptic roles), cancer/tissue fluidity (tumor spheroid wetting), and pathogen exploitation (host protrusions, EV-mediated cargo like Arc/tau; reported roles in bacterial cell-to-cell spread and proposed involvement in virus assembly). | Afadin (junctional partner in tissue mechanics), Arc (EV biogenesis), factors in migration/invasion pathways | Brain (dendritic spines, circuits affecting social behavior), tumor spheroids (tissue fluidity), infection-related protrusions/EV release | Lacouture 2024 (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7); Quiroga et al. 2023 (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 6-8); Picas et al. 2024 (picas2024bin1regulatesactinmembrane pages 3-5); Zhang & Zhang 2025 (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3) |


*Table: Compact reference table summarizing IRSp53/BAIAP2 key concepts, mechanisms, partners, cellular sites, mechanosensing functions, cooperative factors (e.g., BIN1), and disease/pathogen contexts with primary source citations for rapid lookup.*

Limitations and open questions
- Human genetic associations and detailed clinical statistics for BAIAP2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, and pathogen exploitation require additional targeted studies; the present synthesis emphasizes mechanistic and cell-biophysical work (2023–2024) and authoritative reviews that frame hypotheses for those disease contexts (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.262064; 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; 2025) (lacouture2024hiv1assembly–whenvirology pages 6-7, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 2-3).
