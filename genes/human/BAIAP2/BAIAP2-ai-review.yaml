description: >-
  BAR/IMD domain-containing adapter protein 2 (IRSp53) is a curvature-sensitive
  membrane-cytoskeleton adaptor that couples plasma membrane shape to actin
  remodeling. The protein contains an N-terminal I-BAR/IMD domain that senses
  and generates negative membrane curvature by binding PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes,
  a central CRIB/proline-rich region for small GTPase (Rac1/Cdc42) coupling, and
  a C-terminal SH3 domain that recruits actin nucleation-promoting factors
  (WAVE, N-WASP, Eps8, Mena/VASP). IRSp53 integrates Rho-family GTPase signaling
  with actin network assembly to drive filopodia, lamellipodia, and membrane
  ruffles. The protein is enriched at plasma membrane protrusions, dendritic
  spines, and sites of negative membrane curvature.

    summary: >-
      Phylogenetic inference of cytosol localization is well-supported.
      IRSp53 is detected throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of specific
      binding partners and shows cytosolic distribution when not membrane-recruited.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Consistent with UniProt subcellular location data and IDA evidence from
      HPA immunofluorescence (GO_REF:0000052). The protein shuttles between
      cytosol and membrane in a curvature/GTPase-dependent manner.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Nucleoplasm localization is questionable for IRSp53. The protein is
      primarily a cytoplasmic/membrane-associated adaptor with no well-established
      nuclear function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While IBA annotation is present, IRSp53's core functions are at the plasma
      membrane and cytoplasm. Nuclear localization is not supported by deep
      research or UniProt annotations. May represent low-level detection or
      isoform-specific behavior.

  description: >-
    The I-BAR domain preferentially binds to negatively curved membranes,
    showing maximal sorting at curvatures of ~0.05 nm^-1 with ~2x enrichment
    (eLife 2023). This curvature sensing triggers downstream actin assembly.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Does IRSp53 have preference for specific phosphoinositide species beyond
    PI(4,5)P2? The I-BAR domain binds PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes, but specificity
    for other PIP species is not fully characterized.
- question: >-
    What is the quantitative relationship between membrane curvature and
    IRSp53 recruitment in human cells? eLife 2023 provides quantitative data
    but further studies on curvature thresholds and residence times would be
    valuable.

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Liposome binding assays with defined curvatures and lipid compositions
    to quantify PI(4,5)P2 vs other PIP binding specificity. This would clarify
    lipid binding specificity of the I-BAR domain.
