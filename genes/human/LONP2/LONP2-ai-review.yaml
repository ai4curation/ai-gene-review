description: >-
  LONP2 (Lon protease homolog 2, peroxisomal) is an ATP-dependent serine protease
  localized to the peroxisomal matrix where it mediates selective degradation of
  misfolded, unassembled, and oxidatively damaged proteins. The protein functions
  in peroxisomal protein quality control, processes PTS2-containing proteins,
  and regulates fatty acid beta-oxidation through degradation of self-processed
  forms of TYSND1. LONP2 contains an N-terminal substrate recognition domain,
  a central AAA+ ATPase domain with Walker A/B motifs, and a C-terminal serine
  protease domain with a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad. It also possesses ATP-independent
  chaperone activity. Mutations in LONP2 cause Buratti-Harel syndrome, a
  neurodevelopmental disorder.

        IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. LONP2 facilitates protein
        targeting to peroxisomes by processing PTS2-containing proteins after their
        import into the peroxisomal matrix. The deep research confirms LONP2 plays
