description: Activator of 90 kDa heat shock protein ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1/AHSA1)
  is an HSP90 co-chaperone that stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP90, thereby
  accelerating its chaperone cycle. AHSA1 competes with inhibitory co-chaperones
  FNIP1 and TSC1 for HSP90 binding, providing reciprocal regulation of client
  protein chaperoning. Its N-terminal domain binds the middle domain of HSP90
  while the C-terminal domain stabilizes the dimerized HSP90 N-terminal domains.
  Recent in vitro studies suggest that the N-terminal extension (M1-R16), unique
  to higher eukaryote Aha1 proteins, confers an autonomous holdase-like chaperone
  activity independent of HSP90, though the in vivo significance of this remains
  to be established.

      IBA annotation for ATPase activator activity based on phylogenetic inference
      (PANTHER). This is the core molecular function of AHSA1. Aha1 was identified
      as the activator of Hsp90 ATPase in yeast and human, stimulating ATPase
      activity 5-fold in vitro (PMID:12604615) and confirmed across multiple studies
      (PMID:12504007, PMID:29127155, PMID:27353360). The IBA annotation is well
      supported by conserved function across yeast (S. cerevisiae Aha1, Hch1) and
      S. pombe orthologs included in the PANTHER family.

      Aha1 deletion impairs activation of the Hsp90 client v-Src (PMID:12504007,

      The annotation from DisProt is based on PMID:33808352 (Hu et al. 2021), which
      used NMR HSQC titrations and ThT assays to show that full-length human Aha1
      interacts with intrinsically disordered alpha-synuclein and inhibits its
      aggregation in vitro. However, the core construct Aha128-335 (lacking the
      N-terminal M1-W27 extension and C-terminal RLF motif) showed no significant
      interaction with alpha-synuclein, indicating this is not a property of the
      conserved Aha1 core domains. The authors themselves describe this as
      "chaperone-like activity" and note that in vivo significance remains
      unestablished. AHSA1's primary, evolutionarily conserved function is as an
      HSP90 ATPase activator, not as an independent chaperone. The unfolded protein
      binding annotation is an over-annotation that conflates an in vitro
      observation with a core molecular function. Furthermore, GO:0051082 is

      AHSA1 is primarily an HSP90 co-chaperone whose core function is stimulating

      binding annotation is based on in vitro NMR titration experiments showing
      that full-length Aha1 interacts with alpha-synuclein (PMID:33808352), but
      this interaction depends on the N-terminal extension (M1-W27) and C-terminal
      RLF motif, which are peripheral to the conserved Aha1 domains and absent in
      lower eukaryotes. The authors state that "extensive in vivo studies need to
      be conducted to precisely decipher the functional roles of Aha1 under

      follow-up study (PMID:37486705) confirmed the holdase activity maps to the
      N-terminal extension (M1-R16) and is driven by electrostatic interactions
      that can be abolished by high NaCl concentration, suggesting non-specific
