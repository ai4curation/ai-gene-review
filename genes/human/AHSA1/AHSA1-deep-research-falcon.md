You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human AHSA1 (AHA1/p38), UniProt O95433

Publication window emphasized: 2023–2024 where available.

1. Executive summary

AHSA1 (also called AHA1; historically described as the “Activator/Accelerator of Hsp90 ATPase”) encodes a conserved HSP90 co‑chaperone that is the most potent known stimulator of HSP90 ATP hydrolysis. Its primary molecular function is to bind HSP90 and accelerate progression of the HSP90 conformational/ATPase cycle, thereby modulating maturation of HSP90 client proteins (including kinases and steroid receptors) and affecting proteostasis and disease phenotypes in cancer and neurodegeneration. Multiple recent studies show that human AHSA1 contains an N‑terminal metazoan-specific regulatory element (intrinsic chaperone domain; ICD) that both confers HSP90-independent “holdase” activity and tunes recruitment to HSP90 by dampening the activity of the adjacent ATPase-stimulatory NxNNWHW motif. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

2. Gene/protein identity verification (required disambiguation)

Target identity: AHSA1 (Homo sapiens), UniProt O95433.

2.1 Naming and synonyms

AHSA1 is referred to as Ahsa1 or Aha1 in the chaperone literature and is explicitly described as “Activator/Accelerator of Hsp90 ATPase,” a co‑chaperone that potently stimulates HSP90 ATPase activity. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

A 2024 review likewise defines Aha1 as “Activator of Hsp90 ATPase activity homolog 1” and describes it as the most potent accelerator of HSP90 ATPase. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

2.2 Family/domain architecture consistent with UniProt O95433

Human AHSA1 is described as a two-domain protein (N‑terminal domain and C‑terminal domain) connected by a flexible linker; both domains are required for full stimulation of HSP90 ATPase. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1a pages 37-41)

Key conserved motifs in the N‑terminal domain are repeatedly identified across Aha-type co‑chaperones, including (i) NxNNWHW (central for ATPase stimulation) and (ii) RKxK (important for catalytic-loop regulation). (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2, hussein2025decipheringahsa1a pages 37-41)

A mechanistic synthesis explicitly connects the AlphaFold model identifier AF-O95433-F1 to human AHSA1, supporting that the literature entity is the UniProt O95433 protein. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1a pages 37-41)

A supporting schematic/sequence alignment from a 2024 primary paper visually shows AHSA1 domain architecture and the conserved ICD (aa 1–20), NxNNWHW, and RKxK motifs. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 media 467b9fc0)

3. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

3.1 HSP90 chaperone cycle and co-chaperone control

HSP90 is an abundant chaperone whose ATP-binding and ATP-hydrolysis-driven conformational changes support folding/maturation of a large client set (>400 clients). (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Co‑chaperones regulate the timing and direction of HSP90 conformational transitions; AHA1/AHSA1 is distinctive in that it markedly accelerates HSP90 ATP hydrolysis. (mondol2023aha1regulateshsp90’s pages 1-2)

3.2 Primary molecular function of AHSA1: stimulation of HSP90 ATPase

Definition: AHSA1/AHA1 is the HSP90 co‑chaperone that “potently stimulates” HSP90 ATPase activity by promoting transition to the closed, N‑terminally dimerized state and by engaging catalytic elements of HSP90. (liu2022hsp90andaha1 pages 1-2, hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

Mechanistic model: AHA1 binds HSP90’s middle domain and accelerates ATP hydrolysis, likely via interaction with the HSP90 catalytic loop (residues 370–390). (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

3.3 Functional sequence features (motifs) and how they map to mechanism

NxNNWHW motif: A conserved motif in the AHSA1 N‑domain that drives ATPase stimulation; deletion of N‑terminal residues encompassing this motif reduces ATPase stimulation and alters ATP-binding kinetics (lower apparent Km for ATP in the cited work). (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

RKxK motif: Proposed to stabilize the HSP90 catalytic loop and position a critical arginine to facilitate ATP binding/hydrolysis; mutations in RKxK drastically impair AHSA1’s ability to enhance HSP90 ATPase activity. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1a pages 41-45, hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

Asymmetry: AHSA1 binds HSP90 asymmetrically in structural/biochemical studies; a single AHSA1 molecule can be sufficient to stimulate ATPase activity, consistent with ordered hydrolysis across the HSP90 dimer. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

3.4 Autonomous (HSP90-independent) chaperone/holdase activity

Recent work supports that AHSA1 has HSP90-independent holdase activity requiring its extreme N‑terminus (first ~16–27 residues depending on assay), where it can prevent aggregation of model substrates (e.g., luciferase/rhodanese) and bind aggregation-prone/disordered proteins such as α‑synuclein. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

In cells, an HSP90-binding-defective AHSA1 mutant (E67K) can still rescue levels of certain client proteins, supporting an HSP90-independent component to AHSA1 function. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

4. Subcellular localization and where AHSA1 acts

The retrieved primary and review excerpts largely discuss AHSA1 as part of the cytosolic HSP90 machinery (consistent with HSP90’s essential cytosolic role); explicit compartmental localization statements for AHSA1 itself were not present in the evidence snippets captured here. Therefore, localization here is inferred from its demonstrated biochemical and cellular interactions with HSP90 and cytosolic client maturation assays rather than from direct localization experiments. (liu2022hsp90andaha1 pages 1-2, hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

5. Pathways and biological processes involving AHSA1 (mechanistic framing)

5.1 Proteostasis and client maturation

AHSA1 regulates late-stage folding/activation steps by accelerating HSP90 ATPase cycling, thereby influencing client maturation/release; this mechanism underpins downstream effects across diverse client classes (kinases, steroid receptors) and disease-associated assemblies (“heteroprotein complexes” centered on HSP90). (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2, mondol2023aha1regulateshsp90’s pages 1-2)

5.2 microRNA biogenesis via Dicer1 folding (example of a defined client consequence)

A primary study (Nucleic Acids Research, 2022) demonstrates that HSP90 and AHA1 modulate microRNA maturation by promoting folding/stability of Dicer1, with genetic depletion of Aha1 reducing Dicer1 protein and mature miRNAs, and rescue depending on AHA1 functional regions. (liu2022hsp90andaha1 pages 1-2)

6. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

6.1 2024: Intrinsic chaperone domain (ICD) as a metazoan-specific regulator of recruitment and ATPase stimulation

A 2024 EMBO Reports study identifies an additional conserved ~20-aa peptide in metazoan AHSA1 immediately preceding NxNNWHW, termed the intrinsic chaperone domain (ICD). The ICD diminishes HSP90 ATPase stimulation by interfering with NxNNWHW function and also controls regulated recruitment/interaction with HSP90 in cells; its deletion can cause loss of interaction with HSP90 and the glucocorticoid receptor. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

These domain/motif relationships are supported visually by the paper’s schematic and sequence alignment showing ICD (aa 1–20), NxNNWHW, and RKxK. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 media 467b9fc0)

6.2 2023: Stoichiometry-dependent regulation of HSP90 by Aha1

A 2023 Biophysical Journal study reports that one or two Aha1 molecules can bind per HSP90 dimer and that this binding stoichiometry differentially regulates HSP90 properties; in their system, two Aha1 molecules coordinate to strongly stimulate ATPase activity and promote unfolding of the HSP90 middle domain. (mondol2023aha1regulateshsp90’s pages 1-2)

6.3 2023–2024: Therapeutic repositioning toward co-chaperone interfaces

A 2024 review argues that historical N-terminal HSP90 ATP-pocket inhibitors were limited by broad client degradation and dose-limiting toxicities, motivating interest in targeting HSP90–co‑chaperone protein–protein interfaces such as HSP90/Aha1. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

A 2023 Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology article likewise notes the structural/functional complexity of HSP90 in disease and discusses small-molecule approaches aimed at modulating HSP90-dependent folding by targeting Aha1, including compounds reported to inhibit the Aha1–HSP90 complex. (chiosis2023structuralandfunctional pages 9-10)

7. Current applications and real-world implementations

7.1 Drug discovery: direct AHSA1 targeting and inhibitors

Multiple myeloma: A 2022 translational study identifies AHSA1 as a unique target of the natural product bufalin using a proteome microarray; it maps the binding site to AHSA1 lysine 137 (K137). Mutation of K137 reduced AHSA1–HSP90A interaction and suppressed downstream effects. The same study identifies KU-177 as an AHSA1-selective inhibitor that targets the same site and reports that bufalin and KU-177 reduce proliferation of MRD-positive cells from primary and recurrent MM patient samples; KU-177 also reverses AHSA1-driven proteasome inhibitor resistance. (gu2022ahsa1isa pages 1-2)

7.2 Drug discovery strategy: disrupting HSP90/AHA1 protein–protein interaction

A 2024 review summarizes accumulating evidence that disease states can feature HSP90-centered heteroprotein complexes containing Aha1, and proposes that small-molecule disruptors of the HSP90/Aha1 complex can be effective in models of cancer and neurodegeneration, potentially sparing essential baseline HSP90 functions compared with pan-HSP90 inhibitors. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

7.3 Cystic fibrosis (CFTR proteostasis) as a mechanistic application area

AHSA1 silencing enhances CFTR folding and can restore function of the disease-associated ΔF508 CFTR variant, positioning AHSA1 as a potential proteostasis-modulating target in cystic fibrosis. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

7.4 Neurodegeneration/tauopathy mechanism-based application area

Overexpression of AHSA1 in mouse brains has been reported to increase Tau aggregation and neuronal cell death, and reviews link Aha1-dependent client maturation to tau phosphorylation pathways. These data underpin the rationale for targeting the HSP90/Aha1 axis in tauopathies. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2, blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

7.5 Biomarker applications in cancer prognosis and therapy response

Multiple myeloma: elevated AHSA1 expression is associated with relapse and poor outcomes (supporting potential biomarker utility) and is mechanistically tied to activation of CDK6 and PSMD2 via HSP90A co-chaperoning. (gu2022ahsa1isa pages 1-2)

Lung adenocarcinoma: a 2024 prognostic modeling paper reports AHSA1 as part of an immune-escape-related prognostic signature and provides hazard ratios/AUCs (see statistics section). (jia2024theprognosticvalue pages 11-11, jia2024theprognosticvalue pages 8-9)

8. Expert opinions and authoritative analyses (selected)

8.1 AHSA1 as a disease driver via proteostasis network imbalance

A 2024 expert review frames Aha1 dysregulation as a driver that can push HSP90 complexes toward disease phenotypes in cystic fibrosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration, and identifies the HSP90/Aha1 interface as a promising therapeutic focus. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

8.2 AHSA1 as an actionable node within the broader HSP90 disease network

A high-impact 2023 Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology review highlights that co-chaperone regulation (exemplified by AHA1) contributes to HSP90 functional complexity in disease and notes efforts to chemically inhibit the Aha1–HSP90 complex, consistent with a growing consensus that co-chaperone- and state-selective strategies may improve therapeutic windows. (chiosis2023structuralandfunctional pages 9-10)

9. Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent and/or high-authority)

9.1 HSP90 system-level quantities

Client breadth: HSP90 is described as stabilizing/maturing >400 client proteins. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Abundance: HSP90 is estimated at ~1–2% of total cellular protein in healthy cells and ~4–6% in stressed/transformed cells. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Kinome dependence: ~60% of the human kinome is described as dependent on HSP90/Cdc37 complexes for maturation and stability (contextualizing why HSP90-cycle modulation by Aha1 can have strong signaling consequences). (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

9.2 AHSA1 mechanistic quantities

Cellular abundance ratio: AHSA1/Aha1 is reported ~30-fold less abundant than HSP90. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

Stoichiometry/asymmetry: a single AHSA1 molecule can be sufficient to stimulate HSP90 ATPase activity; structural studies show asymmetric binding with one AHSA1 NTD resolved in a semi-hydrolyzed state. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45)

Binding stoichiometry: 2023 work reports one or two Aha1 molecules can bind per HSP90 dimer and that stoichiometry changes functional outcomes. (mondol2023aha1regulateshsp90’s pages 1-2)

HSP90 catalytic loop residues implicated in Aha1 effect: residues 370–390 are identified as the catalytic-loop region believed to interact functionally with Aha1 to accelerate ATP hydrolysis. (blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Mapped inhibitor binding residue: AHSA1-K137 is identified as a specific binding site for bufalin and KU-177 in a multiple myeloma study. (gu2022ahsa1isa pages 1-2)

9.3 Cancer prognosis metrics (2024)

In a 2024 LUAD prognostic study, AHSA1-associated statistics shown include highly significant p-values (e.g., P=9.4e−25 and P=6.9e−4) and hazard ratios displayed in the excerpt (HR=0.46, 95% CI 0.31–0.69; and HR=5.98, 95% CI 1.85–19.38), alongside time-dependent ROC AUCs for survival prediction at 365/1095/1825 days including 0.69 (0.62–0.76), 0.70 (0.61–0.78), and 0.70 (0.49–0.90) in one panel. (jia2024theprognosticvalue pages 11-11)

Separately in the same 2024 paper, time-point ROC AUCs reported for a prognostic model include 0.70 (0.62–0.77) at 365 days, 0.63 (0.57–0.70) at 1,095 days, and 0.66 (0.58–0.74) at 1,825 days. (jia2024theprognosticvalue pages 8-9)

10. Limitations and open questions (based on retrieved evidence)

10.1 Context dependence of client outcomes

Even while AHSA1’s core biochemical activity (HSP90 ATPase acceleration) is robust, downstream effects on specific client proteins can be inconsistent across studies and model systems, implying that functional annotation should distinguish (i) the conserved mechanistic role in the HSP90 cycle from (ii) context-dependent phenotypes. (hussein2025decipheringahsa1a pages 41-45)

10.2 Localization evidence gap in the retrieved excerpts

Direct subcellular localization evidence for AHSA1 (e.g., microscopy-based localization under basal vs stress conditions) was not present in the excerpts retrieved here, and should be addressed with dedicated localization studies or curated databases if needed. (liu2022hsp90andaha1 pages 1-2, hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

12. Recommended functional annotation (concise)

Molecular function: AHSA1 (AHA1) is an HSP90 co‑chaperone that accelerates HSP90 ATPase activity and conformational cycling, likely via contacts to HSP90’s middle domain and catalytic loop; AHSA1 contains conserved NxNNWHW and RKxK motifs required for maximal ATPase stimulation and can act asymmetrically with substoichiometric abundance relative to HSP90. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2, hussein2025decipheringahsa1aa pages 41-45, blagg2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Additional function: AHSA1 harbors an N‑terminal metazoan ICD (aa ~1–20) that confers HSP90-independent holdase activity and negatively regulates ATPase stimulation by interfering with NxNNWHW; this region also controls regulated recruitment to HSP90 in cells. (hussein2024recruitmentofahsa1 pages 1-2)

Disease relevance and applications: AHSA1 is implicated in CFTR proteostasis, tauopathy mechanisms, and cancer progression/therapy response, and is being explored both as a drug target (direct inhibitors such as KU‑177/bufalin-binding site K137 in MM; and PPI disruptors of HSP90/Aha1) and as a prognostic/therapeutic biomarker in cancer cohorts.
