description: >-
  MAP7D2 is a microtubule-associated protein of the MAP7/ensconsin family that localizes
  to the proximal axon and serves as a critical cofactor for kinesin-1-mediated cargo
  transport. The protein directly binds microtubules via its N-terminal region and
  interacts with kinesin-1 family members (KIF5A/B/C) through its C-terminus. MAP7D2
  functions to recruit and activate kinesin-1 on microtubules at the proximal axon/axon
  initial segment, thereby gating anterograde transport of organelles (mitochondria,
  lysosomes, ER-derived vesicles) into the axon. It stabilizes microtubules through
  direct binding and plays roles in controlling cell motility and neurite outgrowth.
  The protein also localizes to centrosomes, midbody during cytokinesis, and neuron
  projections. Recent GWAS studies have implicated MAP7D2 in age-related hearing loss,
  consistent with its expression in inner ear hair cells.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from MAP7 family members. MAP7D2
      belongs to the MAP7 family which includes MAP7, MAP7D1, MAP7D2, and MAP7D3,
      all of which regulate microtubule organization. Pan et al. 2019 demonstrated
      that MAP7D2 localizes to microtubules and regulates their organization at the
      proximal axon. Kikuchi et al. 2022 showed MAP7D2 stabilizes microtubules through
      direct binding [file:human/MAP7D2/MAP7D2-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is well-supported by both phylogenetic evidence and direct
      experimental studies. MAP7D2 clearly functions in microtubule cytoskeleton
      organization as a core function, recruiting kinesin-1 to microtubules and
      stabilizing them.
