|description[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/description)|UBA7 (Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 7) is the sole E1 activating enzyme for ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15), catalyzing the ATP-dependent activation of ISG15 and its transfer to the E2 enzyme UBE2L6. As the initiating enzyme of the ISGylation pathway, UBA7 plays a critical role in innate antiviral immunity and cellular stress responses. The protein is localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modifies diverse substrates including antiviral effectors and tumor suppressors like p53. UBA7 functions as a tumor suppressor that is frequently downregulated in cancers, and its loss increases susceptibility to viral infections.|
