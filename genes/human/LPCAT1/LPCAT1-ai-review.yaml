description: Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) is an ER-resident enzyme that operates
  in the Lands cycle to remodel membrane phospholipids. It catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine
  (lysoPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) using acyl-CoA donors, with preference for saturated fatty acyl-CoAs.
  The enzyme is critical for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) production in pulmonary surfactant.
  LPCAT1 also localizes to lipid droplets where it contributes to local PC synthesis. Additionally, it
  has reported activity toward lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG). The enzyme
  contains EF-hand domains and a catalytic HXXXXD motif. Recent research has linked LPCAT1 to ferroptosis
  resistance in cancer through membrane lipid saturation.

  review:
    summary: This is the primary and defining molecular function of LPCAT1. PMID:18156367 directly characterized
      LPCAT1 (Aytl2) as a lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase that converts lysoPC to PC using acyl-CoA
      donors. The study demonstrated activity with palmitoyl-CoA and lysoPC substrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core enzymatic function established by direct biochemical characterization. The enzyme catalyzes
      the conversion of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + acyl-CoA to 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
      + CoA. This is the canonical LPCAT reaction and represents the primary molecular function of the
      gene product.

      localizations are ER and lipid droplets. Plasma membrane localization may represent a specialized

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

    reason: This is an extremely broad parent term. More specific membrane localizations (ER membrane,

    summary: HDA annotation from a high-throughput membrane proteomics study of NK cells. LPCAT1 was identified
      as a membrane protein in this proteomics screen.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While the HDA evidence is valid (LPCAT1 is a membrane protein), the term is overly generic.
      More specific membrane localizations are annotated. However, the experimental basis (proteomics)
      provides independent confirmation of membrane association.
