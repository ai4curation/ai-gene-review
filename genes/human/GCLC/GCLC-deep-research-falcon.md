## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P48506
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Glutamate--cysteine ligase catalytic subunit {ECO:0000305}; EC=6.3.2.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12663448, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9675072}; AltName: Full=GCS heavy chain; AltName: Full=Gamma-ECS; AltName: Full=Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GCLC {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:4311}; Synonyms=GLCL, GLCLC;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glutamate--cysteine ligase type 3 family.
- **Key Domains:** GCS. (IPR004308); Gln_synth/guanido_kin_cat_dom. (IPR014746); GCS (PF03074)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GCLC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GCLC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GCLC** (gene ID: GCLC, UniProt: P48506) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan status and verification
- Identity verification: The target is human GCLC (HGNC:4311), UniProt P48506, encoding the catalytic (heavy) subunit of glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL; EC 6.3.2.2). Literature from 2023–2025 consistently describes GCLC as the catalytic subunit that, together with GCLM (modifier subunit), forms the holoenzyme catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, matching the UniProt description and GCS family/domain context (no symbol ambiguity detected in the evidence set) (kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2, timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).

Comprehensive research report on human GCLC (UniProt: P48506)
1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Enzymatic role: GCLC is the catalytic subunit of glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GSH synthesis. The reaction conjugates L‑glutamate with L‑cysteine using ATP to form γ‑glutamylcysteine; γ‑glutamylcysteine is then ligated with glycine by glutathione synthetase to generate GSH. This first step is feedback‑inhibited by GSH and constrained by cysteine availability (publication date: 2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2). Experimental assays employing human recombinant GCLC/GCLM confirm cysteine dependence and GCL catalytic activity in vitro (publication date: 2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).
- Holoenzyme composition: GCL is a heterodimer composed of GCLC and GCLM. GCLM modulates GCLC catalytic properties and cellular sensitivity to inhibition; genetic or pharmacologic perturbation of GCLM alters GCL activity and cellular GSH levels (2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2), and small molecules can target GCLM to inhibit GCL (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13).
- Cellular role: GSH is a central redox buffer and cofactor for detoxification and peroxide reduction; GCLC/GCL activity governs GSH pool size, with implications for oxidative stress responses, drug detoxification, and regulated cell death modalities (2023-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-023-00797-1) (kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Covalent allosteric GCL inhibition via GCLM Cys114: Chemoproteomic discovery identified EN25, a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand that engages an allosteric cysteine (C114) on human GCLM, inhibiting GCL activity (biochemical IC50 ≈ 16 μM; alkyne analog ≈ 3.6 μM). EN25 reduces cellular GSH and selectively impairs viability of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells; ferrostatin-1 partially rescues viability, linking inhibition to ferroptosis susceptibility (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).
- NRF2–GCLC axis in cuproptosis resistance: In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models, the cuproptosis inducer elesclomol–copper stabilizes NRF2 (NFE2L2), upregulating GCLC and GCLM and elevating GSH, which is transported into mitochondria by SLC25A39 to chelate copper and block cuproptosis. Disabling the NFE2L2–GSH–SLC25A39 pathway enhances cuproptosis-mediated tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo (2024-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-81317-x) (liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2).
- GCLC PTM regulation and ferroptosis: Oxidative stress–regulated succinylation/desuccinylation modulates GCLC enzymatic activity. SIRT2 desuccinylates specific lysines on GCLC, increasing activity, elevating GSH, and protecting from ferroptosis; loss of SIRT2 reduces GSH and sensitizes to ferroptosis, while succinylation-mimic GCLC mutants fail to rescue (2025-04 online; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-025-01505-8) (chen2025gclcdesuccinylationregulated pages 1-2).
- In vivo systems to study GSH limitation: A 2024 JBC study engineered cytosolic/mitochondrial GSH production to dissect consequences of GSH depletion. Findings reinforced GCL’s rate-limiting role, BSO sensitivity dependence on GCLM, and the compartmental nuances of GSH in cell death responses, including ferroptosis (2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2).
- Oncology and therapy resistance context (overview): A 2024 review synthesizes GSH/GCL roles in tumor biology, therapeutic resistance, ferroptosis association, and early-stage drug discovery against GCL, consolidating human cancer links and emerging targeting strategies (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).

3) Biochemical specificity and mechanism
- Reaction/substrate specificity: Human GCLC catalyzes ATP-dependent formation of γ‑glutamylcysteine from L-glutamate and L-cysteine. In vitro reconstitution with recombinant human GCLC/GCLM uses cysteine as initiating substrate, validating substrate requirement and enabling inhibitor testing (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5). Rate-limiting control and feedback inhibition by GSH are established and were leveraged in genetic and pharmacologic experiments (2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2).
- Holoenzyme modulation by GCLM: Genetic screens and pharmacology show that GCLM presence shapes sensitivity to BSO and small-molecule inhibitors; targeted covalent engagement of GCLM C114 allosterically inhibits the holoenzyme, reducing GSH and promoting ferroptosis-like cell death in sensitive contexts (2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645; 2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).

4) Subcellular localization
- GSH synthesis is predominantly cytosolic; mitochondrial GSH pools derive from cytosolic synthesis and import. Direct evidence shows GSH imported into mitochondria through SLC25A39, downstream of NRF2-dependent induction of GCLC/GCLM, thereby modulating mitochondrial death pathways such as cuproptosis (2024-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-81317-x) (liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2).

5) Transcriptional and post-translational regulation
- Transcriptional control: The KEAP1–NRF2 axis upregulates GCLC (and GCLM) via antioxidant response elements in response to oxidative/electrophilic stress, with demonstrated induction under cuproptotic stress that elevates GSH pools (2024-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-81317-x) (liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2). Reviews synthesizing cancer and redox biology further contextualize GCLC as a canonical NRF2 target gene linked to therapy resistance and ferroptosis avoidance (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).
- Post-translational control: Oxidative stress–responsive lysine succinylation on GCLC is dynamically regulated by SIRT2 (desuccinylase) and p300 (succinyltransferase), tuning enzymatic activity, cellular GSH, and ferroptosis susceptibility (2025-04; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-025-01505-8) (chen2025gclcdesuccinylationregulated pages 1-2).

6) Roles in glutathione metabolism and regulated cell death (ferroptosis/cuproptosis)
- Ferroptosis: Pharmacologic inhibition of GCL lowers GSH and predisposes cells to ferroptotic death; rescue by ferrostatin-1 supports ferroptosis linkage (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13). GCLC activation via desuccinylation is protective against ferroptosis, and its inhibition (or PTM shifts that reduce activity) sensitizes to ferroptosis (2025-04; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-025-01505-8) (chen2025gclcdesuccinylationregulated pages 1-2). A 2024 synthesis connects elevated GCLC/GCLM/GSH with therapy resistance and ferroptosis suppression across cancers (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).
- Cuproptosis: In PDAC, NRF2‑induced GCLC/GCLM elevate GSH, which chelates copper in mitochondria via SLC25A39 import, inhibiting cuproptosis; loss of this axis increases sensitivity to cuproptosis in vitro/in vivo (2024-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-81317-x) (liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2).

7) Human genetics and deficiency phenotypes
- GCLC deficiency: A 2024 case report expands the phenotype to adult‑onset spinocerebellar ataxia with chronic hemolytic anemia due to homozygous GCLC c.514T>A (p.S172T), with low GSH and cerebellar atrophy. Prior families typically presented with hemolytic anemia; neurological involvement is less frequent. Management attempted antioxidant and GSH supplementation without definitive correction (2024-04; URL: https://doi.org/10.1159/000538225) (alhatou2024clinicalandbiochemical pages 1-2). Reviews of glutathione metabolism catalogue inborn errors and pediatric cases with GCL deficiency (contextual background) (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).

8) Therapeutic targeting and real‑world implementations
- BSO (buthionine sulfoximine): An irreversible GCL inhibitor historically used to deplete GSH. In Burkitt lymphoma models, BSO decreased growth and—crucially—enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, while sparing control B cells; the study notes tolerability and prior clinical experience in neuroblastoma regimens with melphalan (2023-11 online; print 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-023-00797-1) (kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2).
- Emerging small‑molecule strategies: Covalent, cysteine‑targeted allosteric inhibitors of the GCL holoenzyme (via GCLM Cys114) suppress GCL activity and GSH, sensitizing cancer cells to ferroptosis; EN25 and analogs provide tool compounds with biochemically measured IC50s and chemoproteomic validation (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).

9) Tissue expression, disease associations, and statistics/data highlights
- Cancer associations: GCLC is overexpressed in certain malignancies and is essential for viability in Burkitt lymphoma (CRISPR evidence), with protein overexpression observed in BL tissues (2023-11 online; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-023-00797-1) (kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2). Reviews summarize associations of elevated GCLC/GCLM and GSH pathway with poor outcomes and resistance across tumor types, often in the context of NRF2 activation and ferroptosis suppression (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).
- Quantitative and mechanistic data points:
  • EN25 biochemical IC50 ≈ 16 μM against GCL; EN25‑alkyne ≈ 3.6 μM; covalent engagement at GCLM Cys114 validated by ABPP; ferrostatin-1 rescue indicates ferroptosis contribution (2023-10; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202300371) (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5).
  • BSO sensitizes BL cells to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; GCLC knockout reduces BL viability; GCLC protein overexpressed in BL tissues (2023-11 online; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-023-00797-1) (kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2).
  • NRF2 stabilization by elesclomol–Cu elevates GCLC/GCLM expression; GSH import to mitochondria via SLC25A39 antagonizes cuproptosis; genetic disruption of the NRF2–GSH–SLC25A39 axis enhances tumor suppression (2024-11; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-81317-x) (liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2).
  • SIRT2‑dependent desuccinylation of GCLC increases activity and ferroptosis resistance; succinylation‑mimic mutants fail to restore GSH/ferroptosis resistance (2025-04 online; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-025-01505-8) (chen2025gclcdesuccinylationregulated pages 1-2).

10) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Redox and cancer metabolism: A 2024 integrative review details how the GSH system and GCL (GCLC/GCLM) underpin redox homeostasis, therapeutic resistance, and ferroptosis evasion in tumors, underscoring GCLC as a potential therapeutic node and biomarker of redox adaptation (2024-08; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158423) (kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).
- Mechanistic clarity and translational outlook: The 2024 JBC resource articulates the centrality of GCL in mammalian GSH homeostasis, the genetic determinants of BSO sensitivity (GCLM), and the compartmental constraints that shape responses to GSH depletion and ferroptosis, providing a rigorous platform for future inhibitor development and in vivo validation (2024-02; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105645) (timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2).

Conclusions and implications
- GCLC is a well‑defined human enzyme executing the ATP‑dependent ligation of glutamate and cysteine—the rate‑limiting step in GSH biosynthesis—within a GCLC/GCLM holoenzyme. Recent work (2023–2024) advances our understanding of: (i) covalent allosteric inhibition via GCLM to deplete GSH and potentiate ferroptosis; (ii) NRF2‑driven transcriptional control of GCLC/GCLM that buffers cuproptosis through mitochondrial GSH import; and (iii) PTM regulation (succinylation/desuccinylation) that tunes GCLC activity and ferroptosis susceptibility. Together with genetic evidence of human GCLC deficiency causing hemolytic anemia (sometimes with adult‑onset neurological disease), these findings clarify core biochemistry, regulatory logic, and translational avenues—including BSO repurposing and new GCL inhibitors—supporting both mechanistic interrogation and rational therapeutic design (zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 10-13, zhang2023covalenttargetingof pages 3-5, liu2024nfe2l2andslc25a39 pages 1-2, chen2025gclcdesuccinylationregulated pages 1-2, timson2024developmentofa pages 1-2, alhatou2024clinicalandbiochemical pages 1-2, kazimierska2024inhibitionofthe pages 1-2, kalinina2024glutathionedependentpathwaysin pages 26-27).
