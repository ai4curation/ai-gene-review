description: GCLC encodes the catalytic (heavy) subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL; EC 6.3.2.2), the rate-limiting
  enzyme in de novo glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. The enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of L-glutamate and L-cysteine
  to form gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine, which is subsequently converted to GSH by glutathione synthetase. GCLC forms a heterodimer
  with the regulatory/modifier subunit GCLM (GCLC:GCLM), which modulates the catalytic properties and feedback inhibition
  sensitivity of the enzyme. The reaction is feedback-inhibited by GSH. GCLC is transcriptionally regulated by the KEAP1-NRF2
  pathway in response to oxidative and electrophilic stress. Post-translational modifications including succinylation (regulated
  by SIRT2 desuccinylation) modulate GCLC activity and influence ferroptosis susceptibility. Mutations in GCLC cause autosomal
  recessive hemolytic anemia (CNSHA7), sometimes associated with spinocerebellar degeneration, due to GSH deficiency in erythrocytes.
  GCLC is cytosolic and is essential for cellular redox homeostasis.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: GCLC is the catalytic subunit of the glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) heterodimer, forming a complex with GCLM
      (the regulatory/modifier subunit). This annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference and experimental evidence
      showing GCLC-GCLM interaction (PMID:9675072, PMID:9841880).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation accurately reflects that GCLC is part of the GCL complex. This is a core function supported
      by extensive experimental evidence. The heterodimer formation between GCLC and GCLM is essential for optimal enzymatic
      activity and has been demonstrated by co-expression and purification studies.

  review:
    summary: GCLC possesses glutamate-cysteine ligase activity, catalyzing the ATP-dependent ligation of L-glutamate and L-cysteine
      to form gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine. This is the primary enzymatic function of the catalytic subunit.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of GCLC. The IBA annotation is consistent with extensive experimental evidence

  description: GCLC is the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalyzing the ATP-dependent ligation of L-glutamate
    and L-cysteine to form gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine. This is the rate-limiting step in de novo glutathione biosynthesis.
    The enzyme requires Mg2+ as a cofactor and is feedback inhibited by GSH. Km values are 1.8 mM for glutamate, 0.1 mM for
    cysteine, and 0.4 mM for ATP.
