description: >-
  PKM (Pyruvate Kinase M) encodes pyruvate kinase isoforms that catalyze the final
  step of glycolysis: conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP to pyruvate and ATP.

  CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative splicing of mutually exclusive exons 9/10
  produces isoforms with FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT metabolic properties:

  (1) PKM1 (P14618-2, M1-PK) is expressed in ADULT differentiated tissues (muscle,
  brain, heart). It is a constitutively active homotetramer with HIGH pyruvate kinase
  activity, supporting efficient ATP generation via complete glycolysis and oxidative
  metabolism.

  (2) PKM2 (P14618-1, M2-PK) is expressed in EMBRYONIC tissues, PROLIFERATING cells,
  and nearly all CANCERS. It has LOW basal activity and is allosterically regulated
  by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). PKM2 can exist as inactive monomer/dimer or
  active tetramer. LOW activity allows glycolytic intermediates to accumulate for
  biosynthetic pathways (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) - the metabolic basis
  of the WARBURG EFFECT in cancer.

  PKM2-SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS (not shared by PKM1):
  - Protein kinase activity (phosphorylates histone H3 at Tyr11)
  - Nuclear translocation and transcription coactivator activity (with HIF-1alpha)
  - These non-glycolytic functions contribute to cancer cell proliferation.

  The PKM1-to-PKM2 switch is controlled by hnRNP splicing factors (hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2,
  PTBP1) and is a metabolic hallmark distinguishing differentiated vs proliferating cells.

    summary: >-
      Both PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms possess pyruvate kinase activity, catalyzing the final step of glycolysis
      (PEP + ADP -> pyruvate + ATP). However, these isoforms have FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT enzymatic properties.
      PKM1 (P14618-2) is constitutively active with HIGH activity [PMID:20847263]. PKM2 (P14618-1) has LOW basal
      activity and requires allosteric activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) to form active tetramers
      [PMID:15996096, PMID:18337815]. The IBA annotation is correct but does not capture this critical
      isoform-specific difference in activity levels.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core function for both isoforms. Pyruvate kinase activity is the canonical function of PKM.

  description: >-
    PKM catalyzes the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis, transferring a phosphoryl group
    from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP to generate pyruvate and ATP. CRITICAL ISOFORM
    DISTINCTION: PKM1 (P14618-2) is constitutively active with HIGH activity in adult tissues
    (muscle, brain, heart). PKM2 (P14618-1) has LOW basal activity requiring allosteric
    activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and is expressed in embryonic tissues and cancer
    cells. PKM2's low activity allows glycolytic intermediates to accumulate for biosynthetic
    pathways - the metabolic basis of the Warburg effect.
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0004713
    label: protein tyrosine kinase activity
  description: >-
    PKM2-SPECIFIC FUNCTION (not present in PKM1): Nuclear dimeric PKM2 acts as a protein
    tyrosine kinase, phosphorylating STAT3 at Tyr-705 to activate transcription. This
    non-metabolic moonlighting function contributes to cancer cell proliferation and
    tumorigenesis. PKM1 does NOT have this activity.
- molecular_function:

  description: >-
    PKM2-SPECIFIC FUNCTION (not present in PKM1): Nuclear dimeric PKM2 phosphorylates
    histone H3 at Thr-11 (H3T11ph), promoting gene transcription and tumorigenesis.
    This protein kinase activity requires nuclear translocation and dimerization,
    distinct from its cytoplasmic glycolytic function. PKM1 does NOT have this activity.
