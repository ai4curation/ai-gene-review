description: >-
  APEX1 (also known as APE1, HAP1, REF-1) is a multifunctional protein that plays
  a central role in the cellular response to oxidative stress. It has two major
  independent activities: (1) DNA repair as the principal AP endonuclease in the
  base excision repair (BER) pathway, and (2) redox regulation of transcription
  factors. As an AP endonuclease, APEX1 incises DNA at abasic sites, generating
  a single-strand break with 5'-deoxyribose phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl ends. It also
  has 3'-5' exonuclease activity on mismatched DNA termini and 3'-phosphodiesterase
  activity that removes blocking groups such as phosphoglycolate and 8-oxoguanine.
  The redox function, mediated by the N-terminal domain, reduces critical cysteines
  on transcription factors (HIF-1alpha, NF-kappaB, AP-1, p53) to enhance their DNA
  binding activity. APEX1 also functions as an endoribonuclease on single-stranded
  RNA, regulating mRNA stability.

      Apoptosis regulation is a downstream consequence of APEX1's DNA repair
      function rather than a core function. Loss of APEX1 leads to increased
      apoptosis due to accumulated DNA damage.

      label: DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) endonuclease activity
    description: >-
      APEX1 is the major AP endonuclease in human cells, cleaving the phosphodiester
      backbone 5' to abasic sites in DNA. This is the defining molecular function
      of the protein. APEX1 plays a central role in base excision repair, acting
      downstream of DNA glycosylases to process abasic sites and coordinate with
      DNA polymerase beta for gap filling.

    description: >-
      APEX1/Ref-1 reduces critical cysteines on transcription factors (HIF-1alpha,
      NF-kappaB, AP-1, p53, STAT3) to enhance their DNA binding activity. This
      redox function is independent of the DNA repair activity.

  - molecular_function:

      label: transcription coactivator activity
    description: >-
      Through its redox activity, APEX1 functions as a transcription coactivator,
      stimulating the DNA binding activity of multiple transcription factors in
      response to oxidative stress and other signals.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Verify the incorrect GO:0033892 (pyrimidine dimer nuclease) and GO:0004844
      (uracil DNA glycosylase) annotations by testing whether APEX1 has activity
      on UV-induced pyrimidine dimers or can remove uracil from DNA. These
      activities are not consistent with APEX1's known biochemistry as an AP
      endonuclease.
