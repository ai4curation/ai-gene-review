## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P02794
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ferritin heavy chain; Short=Ferritin H subunit; EC=1.16.3.1 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9003196}; AltName: Full=Cell proliferation-inducing gene 15 protein; Contains: RecName: Full=Ferritin heavy chain, N-terminally processed;
- **Gene Information:** Name=FTH1; Synonyms=FTH, FTHL6; ORFNames=OK/SW-cl.84, PIG15;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ferritin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Ferritin. (IPR001519); Ferritin-like. (IPR012347); Ferritin-like_diiron. (IPR009040); Ferritin-like_SF. (IPR009078); Ferritin_CS. (IPR014034)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "FTH1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'FTH1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **FTH1** (gene ID: FTH1, UniProt: P02794) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified identity and scope before research. The target is human ferritin heavy chain (FTH1; UniProt P02794), a 21 kDa subunit of the ferritin family that assembles as a 24‑mer nanocage with ferritin light chain (FTL). FTH1 contains the catalytic ferroxidase center that oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, enabling safe mineral storage; domain annotations match ferritin/ferritin‑like diiron motifs as provided (IPR001519, IPR012347, IPR009040, IPR009078, IPR014034). Organism is Homo sapiens (human). No ambiguity with non‑human genes was used in this report (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36, tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32).

Comprehensive research report on human FTH1 (UniProt P02794)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Ferritin architecture and chemistry: Ferritin is a 24‑subunit, ~12 nm outer/8 nm inner diameter protein nanocage that can store up to ~4,000–4,500 iron atoms as a ferrihydrite‑like mineral. Mammalian ferritin is a heteropolymer of heavy (FTH1) and light (FTL) chains; the H‑chain hosts the binuclear ferroxidase center that catalyzes Fe2+ oxidation to Fe3+, while the L‑chain facilitates nucleation/mineral growth. Fe2+ entry occurs mainly via threefold hydrophilic pores and transit is guided by negative electrostatics; the product is immobilized Fe3+ mineral inside the lumen, buffering the labile iron pool and limiting Fenton chemistry (representative parameters and mechanistic details summarized) (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14060624, Biomolecules, May 2024; and engineering/biophysical summaries) (tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32). Additional mechanistic and structural details for human ferritin are consistent with recent nanotechnology summaries (e.g., channels at threefold and fourfold symmetry axes; H/L functional complementarity) (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36).
- Cellular iron homeostasis and regulation: Cytosolic iron exists as a labile Fe2+ pool, imported predominantly via transferrin (TF)–TFRC endocytosis, with endosomal Fe3+ reduced by STEAP3 and exported by DMT1. Excess Fe2+ is stored in ferritin; export occurs via ferroportin (FPN/SLC40A1) coupled to ferroxidases (hephaestin or ceruloplasmin). FTH1 and FTL translation is regulated by IRP1/IRP2 binding to 5′‑UTR IREs (repressing synthesis in iron deficiency), and FTH1 is also transcriptionally induced by NRF2 as part of antioxidant defense (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252312987, IJMS, Dec 2024) (ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 6-7, ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 7-9). 
- Ferritin turnover and iron release (ferritinophagy): Selective autophagy of ferritin is mediated by cargo receptor NCOA4, delivering ferritin to lysosomes and releasing Fe2+ back to the labile pool; this process couples to ferroptosis susceptibility in multiple contexts (review background) (ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 6-7).
- Systemic/serum ferritin and receptors: Ferritin can be secreted by non‑classical pathways or in extracellular vesicles and circulates as serum ferritin (typically L‑rich), widely used as a biomarker in inflammatory and iron disorders. Exogenous human H‑ferritin binds TfR1 (CD71) and SCARA5, enabling cellular uptake and has been leveraged for drug delivery (technology‑oriented reviews) (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36, tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Ferritin heteropolymer assembly by cryo‑EM: A 2024 structural study used engineered constructs and high‑resolution cryo‑EM to analyze human heteropolymer ferritin assembly, showing a preference for H–L heterodimer building blocks and stochastic assembly pathways. The work provides mechanistic insight into how H/L subunit ratios and interfaces may tune function in human tissues (https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5104, Protein Science, Jul 2024) ().
- Ferritinophagy mechanisms and regulation (2024 updates): A 2024 review synthesizes new insights into NCOA4 structure–function and regulation, emphasizing its C‑terminal ferritin‑binding domain and multiple isoforms that fine‑tune ferritin turnover at the immunity–metabolism interface, expanding beyond iron‑dependent roles (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, Cell Death Discovery, Jul 2024). A companion 2024 Cell Proliferation review highlights the double‑edged roles of ferritinophagy within the ferroptosis axis across diseases, consolidating recent evidence and mechanisms (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, Feb 2024) (, ).
- FTH1 in ferroptosis and disease (2023–2024 primary data): 
  • Cancer immunotherapy and prognosis: A 2024 pan‑cancer analysis linked high FTH1 expression to immunotherapy resistance and distinct tumor immune microenvironments, with associations to macrophage infiltration and immune checkpoints, suggesting inhibitory FTH1‑related signaling as a strategy to overcome resistance (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-023-03625-x, Cancer Immunol Immunother, Jan 2024) ().
  • Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): 2024 in vitro/in vivo data show FTH1 interacts with PYCR1 to dysregulate proline metabolism and promote KRAS‑mutant PDAC growth; iron chelator deferasirox suppressed tumor growth by targeting FTH1‑mediated pathways (https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-024-01300-4, Exp & Mol Med, Sep 2024) ().
  • Ovarian cancer chemoresistance: 2024 mechanistic work demonstrated iron promotes malignancy and platinum resistance by enhancing DNA repair via an FTH1/FTL–POLQ/RAD51 axis; iron chelators synergized with platinum in vitro and in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06688-5, Cell Death & Disease, May 2024) ().
  • Pediatric AML: 2023 analysis identified high FTH1 expression as a poor prognostic factor; functional assays indicated that FTH1 upregulation promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis via the ferroptosis pathway (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2022.1068094, Frontiers in Oncology, Feb 2023) ().
- Immune cell biology (2024): EMBO Journal reported that FTH supports regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage stability by providing iron for TET dioxygenases that maintain FOXP3 locus demethylation, thereby sustaining FOXP3 expression and immune homeostasis; the FTH ferroxidase function was mechanistically implicated (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00064-x, EMBO J, Mar 2024) ().
- CNS and systemic context: 2024 narrative review summarized ferritin’s central role in CNS iron homeostasis, including secretion in EVs and intercellular transfer (e.g., microglia to oligodendrocytes), and emphasized translational regulation of FTH1 by IRP/IRE and NRF2 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252312987, IJMS, Dec 2024) (ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 2-4, ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 6-7, ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 7-9).

3) Subcellular localization and trafficking
- Primary localization: Ferritin is predominantly cytosolic. Human ferritin can also localize to lysosomes (during ferritinophagy), nucleus, and mitochondria; mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) is a separate gene, but cytosolic ferritin has been detected in organellar contexts in some studies and reviews (summarized in translational nanotechnology overviews of human H‑ferritin) (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36).
- Ferritinophagy routing: NCOA4 binds ferritin and traffics the complex to autophagosomes for lysosomal degradation, releasing iron to the labile pool; inhibition of autophagy or NCOA4 limits ferritin iron release and ferroptotic sensitivity in multiple disease models (updated reviews, 2024) (, ).
- Nuclear localization and clinical relevance: In BRCA1/2‑mutant breast cancer, nuclear FTH1 (nFTH1), but not cytoplasmic FTH1, independently predicted shorter disease‑free and metastasis‑free survival, highlighting a trafficking/localization phenotype with prognostic value (HR for DFS 2.71 [1.49–4.92]) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16010028, Cancers, Dec 2023) ().
- Secretion and extracellular ferritin: Non‑classical secretion and EV‑associated ferritin are described in CNS and systemic contexts; serum ferritin is clinically used in inflammation and iron disorders and is enriched for L‑chain, but receptor‑mediated uptake of H‑ferritin via TfR1 and SCARA5 is well established (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36, ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 6-7).

4) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostic biomarkers:
  • Serum ferritin is widely used as a biomarker across infection/inflammation and cardiometabolic risk; translational reviews reaffirm this use-case and note L‑rich composition in serum ferritin (technology and biology summaries) (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36).
  • Tumor tissue biomarkers: FTH1 immunohistochemistry and subcellular localization can carry prognostic information (e.g., nuclear FTH1 in BRCA1/2‑mutant breast cancer predicts worse recurrence‑free and metastasis‑free survival) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16010028, Dec 2023). Pan‑cancer analyses linked high FTH1 to immunotherapy resistance, suggesting stratification value (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-023-03625-x, Jan 2024) (, ).
- Therapeutic and imaging platforms (ferritin nanocages): Human H‑ferritin binds TfR1 and can be engineered for targeted delivery; methods include pH‑driven disassembly/reassembly for cargo loading, lumenal charge mutations, and surface functionalization. Reported applications span chemotherapy payloads, imaging (e.g., gadolinium‑loaded HFn), and combination modalities. Reviews outline opportunities and translational hurdles (e.g., receptor heterogeneity, clearance, scale‑up) and report use in preclinical oncology models; serum‑stable designs (PASylation/XTEN) are under evaluation (https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14060624, May 2024; Expert review overview, Nov 2025 online) (tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32, giacobbo2026progressandpotential pages 1-3).
- Therapeutic strategy (iron and ferroptosis modulation): In PDAC, iron chelation with deferasirox reduced growth by modulating FTH1‑mediated pathways (https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-024-01300-4, Sep 2024); in ovarian cancer, iron depletion synergized with platinum therapy, mechanistically dependent on ferritin heavy/light chain regulation of DNA repair components (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06688-5, May 2024) (, ).

5) Expert opinions, statistics, and quantitative data from recent studies
- Quantitative structural/biophysical parameters: Ferritin cage dimensions (~12 nm outer, ~8 nm inner) and storage capacity (~4,000–4,500 Fe atoms) are consistently reported across 2024 structural/nanotech reviews; entry channels and ferroxidase activity are emphasized as key determinants of iron handling (tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32, incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36).
- Clinical statistics and prognostic effect sizes:
  • Breast cancer (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers): Nuclear FTH1 associated with shorter disease‑free survival (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.49–4.92, p=0.001) and metastasis‑free survival (HR 3.54, 95% CI 1.45–8.66, p=0.006) in multivariable analyses (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16010028, Dec 2023) ().
  • Pan‑cancer immunotherapy: High FTH1 correlated with reduced benefit from immunotherapy and with macrophage infiltration and immune checkpoint expression across multiple cancers in bioinformatic analyses (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-023-03625-x, Jan 2024) ().
  • PDAC mechanistic efficacy: Deferasirox reduced viability and tumor growth in KRAS‑mutant PDAC models by targeting the FTH1–PYCR1 axis affecting proline metabolism (https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-024-01300-4, Sep 2024) ().
  • Ovarian cancer mechanistic synergy: Iron chelators plus platinum produced synergistic antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo, with the FTH1/FTL–POLQ/RAD51 axis underpinning iron‑driven DNA repair and resistance (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06688-5, May 2024) ().
- Immune cell mechanism: FTH1 supports Treg FOXP3 locus demethylation via enabling TET dioxygenase activity, functionally sustaining Treg lineage and impacting autoimmune neuroinflammation and tumor progression in mouse models (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00064-x, Mar 2024) ().

Pathways and primary function, with substrate specificity and localization
- Enzymatic function: FTH1’s ferroxidase center binds Fe2+ and O2 to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, producing an Fe(III) mineral within the 24‑mer lumen; the substrate specificity is ferrous iron (Fe2+) and molecular oxygen, and the reaction product is ferric iron (Fe3+) coordinated in a ferrihydrite‑like mineral. This reaction reduces reactive ferrous iron and supports safe storage, central to iron metabolism and protection from oxidative damage (tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32, incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36).
- Pathways: FTH1 acts within cellular iron handling (TF/TFRC uptake; IRP/IRE control), ferritinophagy (NCOA4‑mediated lysosomal turnover), ferroptosis (buffering labile iron to limit lipid peroxidation), immune regulation (support of TET enzymes in Tregs), and cancer metabolic rewiring (e.g., proline metabolism in KRAS‑mutant PDAC; DNA repair in ovarian cancer) (, , , , , ).
- Localization: FTH1 functions primarily in the cytosol within ferritin shells; it traffics to autophagosomes/lysosomes during ferritinophagy; nuclear localization has been observed in tumor settings with prognostic implications; extracellular/serum ferritin reflects secretory and EV pathways. Uptake of exogenous H‑ferritin occurs via TfR1 and SCARA5 (incocciati2025redesigninghumanferritin pages 31-36, ferretti2024theunderestimatedrole pages 6-7).

Expert synthesis and outlook
- Consensus across 2023–2024 publications: FTH1 remains central to iron buffering and ferroxidation, with emerging roles in immune regulation and tumor biology through ferroptosis coupling and metabolic co‑dependencies. Manipulating ferritin turnover (NCOA4) or FTH1 expression can modulate ferroptosis and therapeutic responses. Translationally, H‑ferritin nanocages present a promising but still maturing platform for targeted delivery via TfR1; variability in receptor expression and pharmacokinetics are recognized hurdles (tisci2024engineeredhumanferritins pages 25-32, giacobbo2026progressandpotential pages 1-3).
