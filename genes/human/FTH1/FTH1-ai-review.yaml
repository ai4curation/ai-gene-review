description: FTH1 encodes the ferritin heavy chain, a 21 kDa subunit of the ferritin
  complex that assembles as a 24-mer nanocage (~12 nm outer diameter, ~8 nm inner
  cavity) with ferritin light chain (FTL). The heavy chain contains the binuclear
  ferroxidase center that catalyzes oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ (EC 1.16.3.1), enabling
  safe storage of up to 4,500 iron atoms as ferrihydrite mineral within the protein
  shell. FTH1 is central to intracellular iron homeostasis, buffering the labile iron
  pool and limiting Fenton chemistry-mediated oxidative damage. The protein is regulated
  post-transcriptionally by IRP1/IRP2 via 5'-UTR iron-responsive elements (IREs),
  and transcriptionally by NRF2 as part of antioxidant defense. Ferritin turnover
  occurs via ferritinophagy, mediated by the cargo receptor NCOA4 which binds FTH1
  at Arg-23 to target ferritin to autolysosomes for degradation and iron release.
  FTH1 plays a critical role in negative regulation of ferroptosis by sequestering
  iron and limiting lipid peroxidation. Mutations in FTH1 cause hemochromatosis type
  5 (IRE mutation) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type 9.

  review:
    summary: Ferritin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein in mammalian cells. The
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is well-supported by the UniProt
      subcellular location annotation which states "Cytoplasm" with experimental evidence
      (PMID:26436293). Crystal structures and functional studies consistently show
      cytoplasmic localization of the ferritin complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The cytoplasmic localization of FTH1 is a core functional characteristic.
      The 24-mer ferritin nanocage forms in the cytoplasm where it performs its iron
      storage function. This is supported by extensive structural and cell biological

  review:
    summary: Ferrous iron (Fe2+) binding is the initial step in ferritin's iron storage
      mechanism. The IBA annotation is strongly supported by direct experimental evidence
      from PMID:9003196 which used stopped-flow assays and site-directed mutagenesis
      to demonstrate Fe2+ binding at the ferroxidase center, showing that "the first
      48 Fe(II) atoms/molecule added are bound and oxidized at the dinuclear centers."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Fe2+ binding is essential to FTH1's core ferroxidase function. The ferritin
      H chain binds Fe2+ at its dinuclear ferroxidase center (sites A and B) prior
      to oxidation. This is experimentally validated and central to the protein's
      physiological role.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Iron ion transport describes the movement of iron ions. While FTH1 is
      involved in iron handling, its primary role is iron storage rather than active
      transport. The UniProt function annotation states FTH1 "Stores iron in a soluble,
      non-toxic, readily available form" and "Also plays a role in delivery of iron
      to cells" but this delivery function is attributed to the assembled ferritin
      complex being taken up by cells, not direct transport activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: FTH1's primary function is iron sequestration and storage, not active
      transport. The term "iron ion transport" implies movement across membranes or
      between compartments, whereas ferritin accumulates iron within its mineral core.
      Iron release occurs via ferritinophagy (lysosomal degradation), not a transport
      mechanism intrinsic to FTH1.

  review:
    summary: Ferric iron (Fe3+) is the oxidized form stored within the ferritin mineral
      core. The deep research confirms that FTH1 catalyzes "oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+,
      producing an Fe(III) mineral within the 24-mer lumen." The ferric iron is coordinated
      in a ferrihydrite-like mineral structure.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Fe3+ binding/storage is the end product of FTH1's ferroxidase activity.
      The ferrihydrite mineral core contains coordinated Fe3+ ions. This is central

    summary: 'The IEA annotation based on EC number mapping (EC 1.16.3.1) is appropriate.
      FTH1''s ferroxidase activity is well-established experimentally, with the catalytic
      reaction: 4 Fe(2+) + O2 + 4 H(+) = 4 Fe(3+) + 2 H2O. This is validated by direct
      experimental evidence in PMID:9003196.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Ferroxidase activity is the defining enzymatic function of the ferritin
      heavy chain. The dinuclear ferroxidase center in FTH1 oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+
      coupled to oxygen reduction. This is the mechanistic basis for ferritin's iron

      promoted ferroptosis in response to erastin and sorafenib." FTH1 is transcriptionally
      activated by NRF2 as part of the antioxidant response.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Negative regulation of ferroptosis is a core function of FTH1. By sequestering
      labile iron, FTH1 limits iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, the hallmark of ferroptosis.
      This is experimentally validated and physiologically significant.

    action: ACCEPT

    reason: FTH1 does have roles in immune function, particularly in supporting Treg
