## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P20936
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ras GTPase-activating protein 1; Short=GAP; Short=GTPase-activating protein; Short=RasGAP; AltName: Full=Ras p21 protein activator; AltName: Full=p120GAP;
- **Gene Information:** Name=RASA1; Synonyms=GAP, RASA;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C2_dom. (IPR000008); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849); Ras_GTPase. (IPR039360)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RASA1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RASA1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RASA1** (gene ID: RASA1, UniProt: P20936) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and identity verification
- We verified the target: human RASA1 (UniProt P20936), also known as p120RasGAP, matches the provided description. Literature consistently describes a multi‑domain protein with N‑terminal SH2–SH3–SH2 modules, central PH and C2 domains, and a C‑terminal catalytic RasGAP domain, aligning with UniProt domains and the user’s brief (e.g., Stewart & Clark 2020, Journal of Cell Science; URL: https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.238865, Feb 2020) (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 3-4). The organismal context is Homo sapiens throughout.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Primary biochemical function: RASA1 is a Ras GTPase‑activating protein that accelerates GTP hydrolysis on Ras, thereby turning off Ras signaling and constraining downstream RAF–MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT pathways (reviewed in Oncology Reports 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2020.7807, Oct 2020) (zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 1-2, zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 8-9). The GAP catalytic activity resides in the C‑terminal RasGAP domain, while SH2/SH3/PH/C2 modules mediate recruitment and regulation (Journal of Cell Science 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.238865, Feb 2020) (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 3-4).
- Domain architecture: Tandem SH2–SH3–SH2, PH, C2, and RasGAP domains (Structure 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2022.10.009, Dec 2022) (stiegler2022tandemengagementof pages 15-16). SH2 domains bind phosphotyrosines in partner proteins; the SH3 domain is atypical and can bind non‑PxxP targets; PH and C2 mediate lipid/membrane interactions; the GAP domain engages Ras to stimulate hydrolysis (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, stiegler2022tandemengagementof pages 15-16).
- Cellular localization and membrane recruitment: RASA1 is cytosolic but is recruited to membranes through (i) SH2 recognition of phosphotyrosyl motifs in activated receptors/adaptors and (ii) lipid binding via PH/C2, often Ca2+‑sensitive; such modular domains are a common strategy for GAPs to reach membrane‑anchored GTPases (Bioscience Reports 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20231420, May 2024; Journal of Cell Science 2020) (odonoghue2024rolesofg pages 7-7, stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 3-4).

Recent mechanistic and structural advances (with emphasis on 2022–2024)
- Tandem SH2 engagement and partner specificity: Biophysical/structural work shows p120RasGAP’s dual SH2 domains engage doubly phosphorylated motifs on different partners (EphB4, p190RhoGAP/ARHGAP35, Dok1) with distinct modes and affinities; SH2 binding organizes spatial recruitment without altering intrinsic RasGAP catalytic activity (JBC 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105098, Sep 2023; Structure 2022) (vish2023diversep120rasgapinteractions pages 1-2, stiegler2022tandemengagementof pages 15-16).
- Ras–Rho crosstalk via SH3: A co‑crystal structure established that RASA1’s atypical SH3 domain directly binds the DLC1 RhoGAP domain at a site overlapping the RhoA interface, inhibiting DLC1’s RhoGAP activity and providing a molecular mechanism for Ras–Rho pathway crosstalk (Nature Communications 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32541-4, Aug 2022) (chau2022sh3domainregulation pages 6-7, chau2022sh3domainregulation pages 1-2).
- Post‑translational control of Ras–GAP interactions: Ubiquitination of Ras at K128 (observed for NRAS/KRAS) increases binding interfaces for GAPs (NF1 and RASA1), enhancing GAP‑mediated hydrolysis. Growth factor stimulation transiently increases K128 ubiquitination, restricting wild‑type Ras activation; reduced K128 ubiquitination activates Ras signaling and promotes tumorigenesis in models (EMBO Journal 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00146-w, Jun 2024) (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7).

Pathways, partners, and precise roles in signaling
- Pathways: RASA1 is a principal negative regulator of Ras→RAF–MEK–ERK, and influences PI3K–AKT outputs; in endothelium, RASA1 deficiency leads to ERK hyperactivation and vascular malformation phenotypes (review and models: Journal of Cell Science 2020; 2022 thesis; URLs: https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.238865; https://doi.org/10.11575/prism/40578) (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, gosal2025theintersectionof pages 28-31, greyssonwong2022developmentofrasa1 pages 26-31).
- Key binding partners: EphB4 (receptor tyrosine kinase), p190RhoGAP (ARHGAP35), Dok1 — all recruit p120RasGAP via phosphotyrosines; DLC1 is bound by the SH3 domain leading to inhibition of DLC1’s RhoGAP activity; these interactions coordinate Ras and Rho signaling at membranes (JBC 2023; Nat Commun 2022) (vish2023diversep120rasgapinteractions pages 1-2, chau2022sh3domainregulation pages 6-7).
- Endothelial/vascular functions: Endothelial RASA1 activity is necessary for normal embryonic vascular development. Loss increases ERK signaling in AVM lesions; preclinical work supports MEK/ERK pathway dependence (2022 thesis; URL: https://doi.org/10.11575/prism/40578) (gosal2025theintersectionof pages 28-31, greyssonwong2022developmentofrasa1 pages 26-31).

Genetics, clinical spectrum, and statistics (RASA1-related vascular anomalies)
- Syndrome and spectrum: Heterozygous germline loss‑of‑function RASA1 variants cause capillary malformation–arteriovenous malformation (CM‑AVM) syndrome with variable expressivity, including multifocal cutaneous capillary malformations, fast‑flow AVMs/AVFs (intracranial, intraspinal, extremities), and occasionally vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM). Intrafamilial variability is common (Genes 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14030549, Feb 2023) (coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 12-13, coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 8-9).
- Two‑hit/second‑hit mechanism and mosaicism: Multiple lines of evidence support a germline‑plus‑somatic “second‑hit” model for RASA1, with somatic inactivating events in lesions contributing to focal malformations and incomplete penetrance. Recent clinical genetics work in pediatric high‑flow cerebrovascular malformations emphasizes this model and reports both inherited and de novo RASA1 variants (Frontiers in Genetics 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2025.1430657, Mar 2025) (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7). Experimental models (zebrafish rasa1 mutants) further support ERK‑driven pathology and informed early MEK inhibition strategies (gosal2025theintersectionof pages 28-31).
- Prenatal presentations and quantitative data: In a 2023 summary of 21 prenatal‑onset cases of RASA1‑related CM‑AVM, reported prenatal findings included polyhydramnios ≈38%, non‑immune hydrops ≈24%, and chylothorax ≈15%; mortality in prenatal‑onset cases was ≈30%. Postnatal features included cutaneous capillary malformations ≈73% and vascular malformations/AVMs ≈65% (Genes 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14030549, Feb 2023) (coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 8-9). Clinical heterogeneity was highlighted by mildly affected carriers in the same families (coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 11-12).
- Clinical spectrum detail: Reviews of vascular anomalies (Hematology 2024) note RASA1 CM‑AVM and a related EPHB4 CM‑AVM2 with shared deregulation of Ras–MAPK signaling, and discuss expanding presentations including lymphatic involvement (URL: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000598, Dec 2024) (seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9). A 2024 review oriented to interventional radiologists emphasizes genetics‑informed diagnosis and the importance of biopsy/somatic testing in management planning (Seminars in Interventional Radiology 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0044-1791204, Aug 2024) (seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9).

Testing recommendations and expert guidance (2023–2024)
- Genetic testing: The 2024 VASCERN‑VASCA consensus assesses gene–disease associations and provides recommendations for testing somatic variants in vascular anomalies. It supports inclusion of Ras/MAPK pathway genes (including RASA1 and EPHB4) on targeted gene panels, emphasizes sensitivity for low‑level mosaicism in lesional tissue, and encourages standardized variant interpretation (Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-024-03196-9, May 2024) (seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9). Case‑based recommendations advocate germline RASA1 testing with consideration of somatic/lesional testing where feasible, due to frequent second‑hit mechanisms and variable penetrance (Frontiers in Genetics 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2025.1430657, Mar 2025) (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7).
- Clinical surveillance: For carriers/newborns with even subtle cutaneous CMs, second‑level imaging to exclude occult high‑flow lesions is recommended based on prenatal/postnatal cohorts (Genes 2023) (coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 11-12).

Therapeutic implications and real‑world implementations
- Targeted therapies in models and translational practice: Preclinical RASA1‑deficiency models (mouse/zebrafish) show that MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors can mitigate hemorrhage/edema or improve survival, consistent with ERK hyperactivation in AVMs (2022 thesis; URL: https://doi.org/10.11575/prism/40578) (greyssonwong2022developmentofrasa1 pages 26-31, gosal2025theintersectionof pages 28-31). Contemporary clinical reviews of vascular anomalies advocate molecular classification and selective repurposing of pathway inhibitors (e.g., MEK inhibitors) for fast‑flow malformations driven by Ras/MAPK activation (Hematology 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1182/hematology.2024000598, Dec 2024) (seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9).
- Mechanistic avenues for modulation: The 2024 EMBO Journal study showing Ras K128 ubiquitination enhances NF1/RASA1 engagement suggests a post‑translational axis that could be leveraged to restore RasGAP restraint in disease contexts (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00146-w, Jun 2024) (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7).

Cancer relevance
- RASA1 as a tumor suppressor: Reduced RASA1 function contributes to Ras pathway activation in cancers; reviews summarize downregulation/mutation across tumor types and oncogenic impacts of miRNA‑mediated repression (Journal of Cell Science 2020; Oncology Reports 2020; URLs above) (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 8-9, zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 1-2, bellazzo2020cuttingthebrakes pages 15-17). The K128‑Ub study connects increased GAP engagement to constrained Ras outputs, underscoring how loss of such regulation can foster tumorigenesis (EMBO Journal 2024; URL above) (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7).

Subcellular site of action and substrate specificity
- Site and substrate: RASA1 acts at cytoplasmic leaflets of membranes where Ras is anchored, recruited by phosphotyrosine‑dependent interactions and lipid‑binding modules. It catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on Ras (H‑, K‑, N‑Ras) and has reported activity toward RRas/Rap in vitro; endothelial studies implicate effects on integrins and basement membrane dynamics (Journal of Cell Science 2020; Oncology Reports 2020; thesis 2022; URLs above) (stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 1-2, greyssonwong2022developmentofrasa1 pages 26-31).

Open questions and limitations
- Precise penetrance of specific end‑organ lesions (e.g., true population‑level VGAM rates in RASA1 carriers) and quantitative second‑hit frequencies require further large‑scale datasets; current evidence supports incomplete penetrance and frequent two‑hit mechanisms but comprehensive population statistics were not available in the sources reviewed here (romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7, coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 8-9, seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9).

*Table: Compact, evidence‑linked summary of human RASA1 identity, domains, functions, membrane recruitment, partners, 2022–2024 mechanistic advances, pathways, clinical genetics, testing guidance, and therapeutic implications with representative recent sources.*

Conclusions
Human RASA1 (p120RasGAP) is a modular RasGAP that integrates phosphotyrosine‑ and lipid‑dependent recruitment to inactivate Ras at membranes, constraining RAF–MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT signaling. Recent advances clarify tandem SH2 engagement with doubly phosphorylated partners (EphB4, p190RhoGAP, Dok1), Ras–Rho crosstalk via SH3‑mediated inhibition of DLC1, and a ubiquitination‑dependent mechanism (Ras K128‑Ub) that enhances GAP binding. Clinically, heterozygous RASA1 variants cause the CM‑AVM spectrum, with incomplete penetrance, prenatal manifestations, and support for germline‑plus‑somatic second hits; contemporary guidance recommends including RASA1 in gene panels and pursuing lesional testing where possible. Preclinical evidence supports MAPK‑targeted strategies (e.g., MEK inhibition) for RASA1‑driven AVMs, aligning with precision‑medicine approaches to vascular anomalies (stiegler2022tandemengagementof pages 15-16, vish2023diversep120rasgapinteractions pages 1-2, chau2022sh3domainregulation pages 6-7, romano2025arteriovenouscerebralhighflow pages 6-7, coccia2023prenatalclinicalfindings pages 8-9, seront2024molecularlandscapeand pages 8-9, greyssonwong2022developmentofrasa1 pages 26-31, gosal2025theintersectionof pages 28-31, stewart2020pumpingthebrakes pages 2-3, zhang2020roleofrasa1 pages 1-2).
