description: >-
  RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, also known as p120RasGAP or p120GAP) is the prototypical
  Ras GTPase-activating protein that negatively regulates Ras signaling by stimulating the
  intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, converting active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. The protein
  contains a modular architecture with N-terminal tandem SH2 domains, an atypical SH3 domain,
  and central PH and C2 domains that mediate membrane recruitment via phosphotyrosine binding
  and lipid interactions. The C-terminal catalytic RasGAP domain contains an essential arginine
  finger (Arg-789) that stabilizes the transition state during GTP hydrolysis. RASA1 is recruited
  to activated receptor tyrosine kinases (including PDGFR, EGFR, and EphB4) via its SH2 domains,
  thereby constraining Ras-mediated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling. Beyond its GAP activity,
  RASA1 serves as a signaling scaffold through interactions with p190RhoGAP (ARHGAP35) and DLC1,
  linking Ras and Rho pathway crosstalk. Germline loss-of-function mutations cause capillary
  malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM1), highlighting its essential role
  in vascular development and endothelial cell function. The protein also has a documented
  anti-apoptotic function through caspase-mediated cleavage generating fragment N, which
  activates Akt to promote cell survival under stress conditions.

  review:
    summary: >-
      RASA1 is the prototypical RasGAP, and GTPase activator activity is its defining core
      molecular function. Phylogenetic inference via IBA is well-supported by extensive
      experimental evidence demonstrating that RASA1 stimulates Ras GTPase activity
      (PMID:2123878, PMID:7478585, PMID:9219684).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of RASA1. The protein accelerates GTP hydrolysis
      on Ras proteins, converting active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. This function is
      conserved across the RasGAP family and extensively validated experimentally.

    summary: >-
      RASA1 regulates intracellular signal transduction by constraining Ras-mediated

      regulatory role of RASA1 in these pathways.
    action: ACCEPT

      This annotation appropriately captures RASA1's role as a negative regulator of
      Ras-mediated signaling. The protein integrates signals from receptor tyrosine
      kinases and modulates downstream pathways. IBA annotation is consistent with
      conserved function across the RasGAP family.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    RASA1 is the prototypical Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). Its C-terminal
    GAP domain contains an essential arginine finger (Arg-789) that is inserted into
    the Ras active site to stabilize the transition state and accelerate GTP hydrolysis
    by approximately 10^5-fold. This converts active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP,
    thereby terminating Ras-mediated signaling. RASA1 stimulates GTPase activity of
    normal Ras but not oncogenic mutants (G12V, Q61L) that sterically block the
    arginine finger mechanism.

    RASA1 binds specifically to GTP-bound active Ras proteins via its C-terminal
    RasGAP domain. This binding is essential for delivering the catalytic arginine
    finger into the Ras active site. The interaction is sensitive to both ionic
    strength and lipids, reflecting the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic
    nature of the Ras-GAP interface revealed by crystallography.

    RASA1 contains tandem N-terminal SH2 domains that recognize phosphotyrosine
    motifs on activated receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGFR, EGFR, EphB4) and adaptor
    proteins. This phosphotyrosine binding is essential for recruiting RASA1 to
    sites of active signaling at the plasma membrane, where it can access membrane-
    anchored Ras proteins.

    RASA1 is recruited to phosphorylated EphB4 receptor and mediates inhibition
    of downstream Ras-ERK signaling in endothelial cells. This function is critical
    for proper vascular development. Mutations affecting EphB4-RASA1 interaction
    cause capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) and
    vein of Galen malformations.

    Under mild stress conditions, caspase-3 partially cleaves RASA1 to generate an
    N-terminal fragment (fragment N) that activates Akt kinase. This provides a
    negative feedback mechanism preventing excessive caspase activation and allowing
    cells to survive transient stress.
