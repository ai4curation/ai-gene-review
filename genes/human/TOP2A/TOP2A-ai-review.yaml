description: DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha is an essential nuclear enzyme that controls DNA topology by catalyzing ATP-dependent
  double-strand passage reactions. It resolves DNA supercoiling, unknots DNA, and decatenates interlinked sister chromatids.
  TOP2A is absolutely required for DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and mitotic chromosome segregation in proliferating
  cells.

    reason: Well-established localization supported by multiple IDA studies (PMID:9155056, PMID:10959840, PMID:10788521, PMID:16611985).
      The deep research states 'Topo IIα is predominantly a nuclear enzyme. It localizes to the cell nucleus, where the chromosomal

    reason: Core function demonstrated in multiple studies (PMID:11136718, PMID:15456904, PMID:15965487). TOP2A decatenates

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Demonstrated in PMID:16712776 studying HIV-1 replication. This is a very specific process involving retroviruses
      and represents a non-core, context-specific function. The term is oddly specific for what is likely a general role of
      TOP2A in resolving topological stress during reverse transcription/integration.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Supported by PMID:10473615. While TOP2A primarily functions as a homodimer, it can heterodimerize with TOP2B or
      with truncated isoforms, which is relevant for some cellular contexts and drug resistance mechanisms.

  original_reference_id: PMID:9049244
  review:
    summary: TOP2A binds DNA as part of its mechanism, but this is too general for the core function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: TOP2A does bind DNA directly as confirmed by biochemical studies (PMID:12079377, PMID:10788521, PMID:9049244,
      PMID:22323612). However, this is a very general molecular function term. The enzyme's DNA binding is integral to its
      topoisomerase activity, and this annotation provides useful but non-specific information about the protein's molecular
      capabilities.
