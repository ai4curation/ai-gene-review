### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BTN3A3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BTN3A3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BTN3A3** (gene ID: BTF3, UniProt: O00478) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: BTN3A3 (Butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A3) — human (UniProt O00478)

Identity verification and gene context
- Identity: BTN3A3 encodes a primate-specific, type I transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily protein in the BTN/MOG family. Human BTN3A3 is one of three BTN3A paralogs (BTN3A1, BTN3A2, BTN3A3) encoded in the extended MHC locus. BTN3A3 contains extracellular IgV and IgC domains and an intracellular B30.2/SPRY domain; BTN3A2 lacks the B30.2 domain, whereas BTN3A1 and BTN3A3 possess it (human) (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8, published Nov 2023) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2). A cautionary note: some databases list “BTF3” as a synonym of BTN3A3; this should not be confused with the unrelated transcription factor gene BTF3. All evidence below pertains to human BTN3A3 with BTN/MOG immunoglobulin architecture.

Key concepts and definitions
- Architecture/domains: BTN3A3 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal IgV-like domain, a membrane-proximal IgC-like domain, a transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane (JM) segment, and a C-terminal intracellular B30.2/SPRY domain (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2).
- Family roles: BTN3A molecules collaborate with BTN2A1 to regulate activation of human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in response to phosphoantigens (PAgs). Although BTN3A1’s B30.2 binds PAgs, BTN3A3’s B30.2 differs and is not competent for direct PAg binding (see Mechanisms below) (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Current Oncology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).

Cellular and tissue localization
- Tissue distribution: BTN3A3 is constitutively expressed in the human respiratory tract. Immunohistochemistry in human tissues shows BTN3A3-positive cells along the nasal epithelium, and expression in airway epithelial cells (including type I/II pneumocytes), alveolar macrophages, and endothelial cells. Lung has among the highest BTN3A3 expression across surveyed tissues (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8, published Jun 2023) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Inducibility: BTN3A3 can be upregulated by type I/II interferons in human cells (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8; MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).

Mechanisms and pathways
A. γδ T cell activation (Vγ9Vδ2)
- Division of labor within BTN3A complexes: PAg sensing occurs on the intracellular B30.2 domain of BTN3A1, but the extracellular IgV domain of BTN3A2/BTN3A3 contributes to Vγ9Vδ2 TCR triggering. Mechanistic data indicate that positioning the relevant intracellular and extracellular domains on different BTN3A chains within homo-/heteromers is required for optimal activation. JM-region interactions regulate BTN3A homo-/heteromer formation, trafficking, and conformation, thereby tuning signaling (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2).
- BTN3A3’s B30.2 and PAg binding: Unlike BTN3A1, BTN3A3’s B30.2 domain does not directly bind PAgs; a single residue difference at position 351 (Arg in BTN3A3 vs His in BTN3A1) disrupts the positively charged binding pocket required for PAg binding. BTN3A3 nonetheless participates via its extracellular domain within BTN3A complexes that engage the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR (Current Oncology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329) (tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).

B. Antiviral restriction of influenza A viruses
- Primary activity and species specificity: BTN3A3 is a potent, primate-evolved host restriction factor that inhibits avian (but not most human-adapted) influenza A viruses (IAV) by blocking early viral RNA replication. In cell-based ISG screens, BTN3A3 (and BTN3A1 to a lesser extent) restricted avian H1N1 replication, while human-adapted strains (e.g., PR8, Cal04) were largely unaffected. siRNA depletion of BTN3A3 increased replication of avian strains in human airway-derived cells (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Viral genetic determinants of evasion: The viral nucleoprotein (NP) residue 313 determines sensitivity: avian viruses commonly encode 313F (or 313L), which confers BTN3A3 sensitivity, whereas human viruses often encode 313Y or 313V, conferring evasion. Additional substitutions at NP residue 52 (adjacent to 313) in some avian zoonotic lineages (e.g., H7, H9) also mediate evasion in humans (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8; MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).
- Magnitude and stage of restriction: Overexpression of BTN3A3 in human A549 cells produced large reductions in infectious titers of an avian H1N1 strain; BTN3A3’s inhibitory effect was reported to be orders of magnitude greater than BTN3A1 in this system, acting early at viral RNA replication (MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).
- Interferon connection and airway relevance: BTN3A3 is constitutively present in human airways and can be further induced by type I/II IFNs, positioning it as a component of the human species barrier to avian IAV spillover (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Nature 2023 (Pinto et al.): Established BTN3A3 as a primate-evolved, airway-expressed restriction factor against avian IAV; mapped viral NP residue 313 and nearby residue 52 as evasion determinants; showed early block of avian IAV RNA replication; documented constitutive airway expression and IFN inducibility (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8; Jun 2023) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Nature Communications 2023 (Karunakaran et al.): Demonstrated BTN3A3’s extracellular domain contribution to Vγ9Vδ2 activation, the necessity of correct domain partition across BTN3A chains, and the role of JM-region interactions in BTN3A complex formation and function (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Nov 2023) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2).
- MedComm 2023 (Tian et al.): Reviewed the impact of NP residue mutations (313 F/L→Y/V; and residue 52 N/H/Q) for BTN3A3 evasion and summarized experimental evidence of BTN3A3’s potency vs avian IAV in human cells (https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441; Dec 2023) (tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).
- Current Oncology 2025 review (Tang et al.): Summarized BTN3A3’s structural constraints for PAg binding (Arg351) and its role together with BTN3A1/BTN3A2 in Vγ9Vδ2 activation via heteromeric BTN complexes (https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329; Jun 2025) (tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).

Current applications and implementations
- γδ T cell biology and immuno-oncology context: Mechanistic insights into BTN3A complexes (BTN3A1/BTN3A2/BTN3A3 with BTN2A1) are foundational for γδ T cell–directed approaches. BTN3A3 participates structurally (extracellular domain) in complexes that engage the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR, although BTN3A1 provides the intracellular PAg sensor. Thus, BTN3A3 is a component of the emerging “BTN axis” targeted for modulating Vγ9Vδ2 responses in cancer and infection (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Current Oncology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).
- Public health relevance: BTN3A3 constitutes part of the human innate barrier to avian IAV zoonosis. Viral adaptation at NP 313/52 that evades BTN3A3 correlates with zoonotic potential in certain avian lineages (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8; MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Pinto et al. (Nature 2023) provided primary experimental evidence and an evolutionary perspective on BTN3A3 as a primate-evolved restriction factor shaping the IAV species barrier (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Karunakaran et al. (Nature Communications 2023) clarified the cooperative architecture of BTN3A complexes driving Vγ9Vδ2 activation, highlighting BTN3A3’s extracellular role and JM-region governed assembly (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2).
- Tang et al. (Current Oncology 2025) reviewed the molecular basis preventing BTN3A3’s B30.2 domain from binding PAgs (Arg351) and summarized BTN cooperation in γδ T cell activation (https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329) (tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).

Relevant statistics and data
- ISG screening and functional assays: In human airway-derived cells, BTN3A3 overexpression strongly suppressed replication of avian H1N1, while siRNA knockdown enhanced avian-virus replication without affecting human-adapted PR8. Infection kinetics and western blots confirmed early replication inhibition (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5).
- Magnitude of restriction: In A549 cells, BTN3A3 reduced avian IAV titers by large factors; BTN3A3 was reported as markedly more potent than BTN3A1 against an avian H1N1 reporter virus, with orders-of-magnitude reduction in titers (MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).
- Genetic determinants in NP: Sensitivity vs evasion mapped to NP residue 313 (F/L→Y/V) and nearby residue 52 substitutions (N/H/Q) on the NP head surface (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8; MedComm, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.441) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, tian2023thedeterminantsassociated pages 1-3).

Clinical and disease associations (evidence to date)
- Hematologic malignancy context: Butyrophilin transcripts, including BTN3A family members, are dysregulated in PBMCs and bone marrow of AML patients; broader BTN family studies link BTN pathways to γδ T cell–based immunotherapies. Reports summarized in AML context indicate BTN3A-axis modulation can influence Vγ9Vδ2 cytotoxicity (Acta Haematologica Polonica, 2025; https://doi.org/10.5603/ahp.106632) (jakubik2025butyrophilinsaresignificantly pages 15-17).
- Solid tumor notes: Secondary literature aggregated in AML review indicates that low BTN3A3 expression has been associated with poor prognosis and pro-tumor phenotypes in non-small cell lung cancer in independent studies; however, these are not primary data within that review and should be interpreted cautiously pending direct validation (Acta Haematologica Polonica, 2025; https://doi.org/10.5603/ahp.106632) (jakubik2025butyrophilinsaresignificantly pages 15-17).

Open questions and regulatory insights
- Interferon regulation: BTN3A3 is interferon-inducible in human airway cells; the upstream transcriptional circuitry (e.g., NLRC5, CIITA) and post-translational regulation (e.g., pyroglutamate modification) have been discussed in the broader BTN3A literature, but direct, BTN3A3-specific recent primary evidence was not retrieved in the sources synthesized here (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Structural biochemistry: BTN3A3’s extracellular domain supports Vγ9Vδ2 activation within BTN complexes, whereas its B30.2 domain does not bind PAg, consistent with residue-level constraints (Arg351). The precise stoichiometry and dynamics of BTN3A3-containing complexes at the cell surface alongside BTN2A1 remain active areas of research (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Current Oncology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol32060329) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, tang2025mechanismsandfunctions pages 5-6).

Summary of primary function, localization, and pathway role
- Primary function: BTN3A3 is a structural/signaling component of BTN heteromeric complexes that enable Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation, operating chiefly through its extracellular IgV domain in cooperation with BTN3A1 (intracellular PAg sensor) and BTN2A1 (TCR-binding partner). BTN3A3 also acts as an innate restriction factor against avian IAV, blocking early RNA replication (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 35-37).
- Cellular site of action: Plasma membrane (extracellular IgV/IgC domains) for γδ T cell interactions; intracellular B30.2 domain is present but does not bind PAg in BTN3A3. Antiviral restriction is exerted in infected cells of the human airway, with evidence for an intracellular block in avian IAV RNA replication (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5).
- Pathways: BTN3A3 contributes to the BTN3A/BTN2A1 axis that transduces PAg-induced “inside-out” signals to the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR. Independently, BTN3A3 is part of IFN-inducible and constitutive epithelial defenses shaping the IAV species barrier (Nature Communications, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41938-8; Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06261-8) (karunakaran2023adistincttopology pages 1-2, pinto2023btn3a3evasionpromotes pages 1-5).

Limitations of current evidence
- Some regulatory features (e.g., specific transcription factors, post-translational modifications) and therapeutic implementations (BTN3A-targeting antibodies) are not directly evidenced in the cited 2023–2024 sources compiled here. Where noted above, such topics require additional source confirmation.
