description: 'Butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A3 (BTN3A3, also known as BTF3) is a
  type I transmembrane protein belonging to the extended B7 family of immune regulatory
  molecules. It contains two extracellular immunoglobulin domains and an intracellular
  B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain. BTN3A3 plays a role in T cell-mediated immunity, particularly
  in the regulation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, though it is less functionally active
  than its close paralog BTN3A1. The protein forms homodimers and can heterodimerize
  with BTN3A1, regulating immune responses and potentially contributing to cancer
  biology.'
