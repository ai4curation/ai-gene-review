## Output

### Comprehensive Research Report: BTN3A3 (BTF3) Gene in Human

---

#### **1. Gene and Protein Overview**

**Gene Name:** BTN3A3 (Butyrophilin Subfamily 3 Member A3)  
**Synonyms:** BTF3, BTN3.3  
**NCBI Gene ID:** 10384  
**UniProt ID:** O00478  
**Protein Name:** BT3A3_HUMAN  
**Gene Type:** Protein-coding gene

BTN3A3 is a member of the butyrophilin (BTN) family, which is part of the extended B7 family of immune regulatory molecules. The BTN genes are located within or near the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region and encode type I transmembrane proteins with two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain (Ma’ayan Lab, Harmonizome; GeneCards; NCBI Gene; Protein Atlas) [1, 5, 8, 3].

---

#### **2. Molecular Function**

BTN3A3 functions as a **signaling receptor** and is involved in immune regulation, particularly in T-cell responses. Its molecular functions include:

- **Signaling receptor binding** (Wikipedia; GeneGlobe) [10, 12]
- **Regulation of cytokine production** (GeneGlobe) [12]
- **T cell-mediated immunity** (GeneGlobe) [12]
- **Phosphoantigen sensing** (via its intracellular B30.2 domain, which is critical for Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation) [1]

The **intracellular B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain** is a key functional region that allows BTN3A3 to bind phosphoantigens and mediate immune cell activation, although BTN3A3 is less stimulatory than BTN3A1 under normal conditions. However, gain-of-function mutations in this domain can confer phosphoantigen binding and T-cell activation capacity [1].

---

#### **3. Biological Processes**

BTN3A3 is involved in several critical biological processes:

- **T cell-mediated immunity**  
- **Regulation of cytokine production**  
- **Immune response modulation**  
- **Cancer stemness and tumor progression**  
- **Adaptive immune response** (UniProt; GeneCards; Ma’ayan Lab) [5, 1]

Recent studies highlight its role in **cancer biology**, where BTN3A3 acts as a receptor for LSECtin on breast cancer cells, promoting cancer stemness and tumor progression. Downregulation of BTN3A3 in non-small cell lung cancer is associated with advanced clinical stage, increased proliferation, and poorer survival [1].

BTN3A3 expression is also modulated by the interplay between **BLIMP1 and interferon regulatory factors**, integrating it into immune-regulatory networks [1].

---

#### **4. Cellular Localization**

BTN3A3 is a **type I membrane protein**, meaning it is anchored in the plasma membrane with its N-terminus extracellular and C-terminus intracellular. Its cellular localization includes:

- **Integral component of the membrane**  
- **Plasma membrane**  
- **External side of the plasma membrane** (Wikipedia; GeneGlobe) [10, 12]

BTN3A3 is detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-cells, spleen, and lymphocytes, supporting its role in immune cell function [7].

---

#### **5. Protein Domains**

BTN3A3 contains the following structural domains:

- **Two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains**  
- **Transmembrane domain**  
- **Intracellular B30.2 (PRYSPRY) domain** (Ma’ayan Lab; GeneCards; NCBI Gene) [1, 5, 8]

The B30.2 domain is crucial for phosphoantigen binding and immune cell activation. The extracellular Ig domains mediate receptor-ligand interactions, such as with LSECtin in cancer contexts [1].

---

#### **6. Known Protein Interactions**

BTN3A3 interacts with several key molecules:

- **LSECtin (C-type lectin domain family 4 member G, CLEC4G):** BTN3A3 serves as a receptor for LSECtin on breast cancer cells, promoting cancer stemness and tumor progression [1].
- **Phosphoantigens:** The intracellular B30.2 domain binds phosphoantigens, which can activate Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, especially in the context of gain-of-function mutations [1].
- **Other butyrophilin family members:** BTN3A3 shares high homology with BTN3A1, but displays distinct functional properties in immunity and cancer [1].

---

#### **7. Disease Associations**

BTN3A3 is implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer:

- **Breast Cancer:** BTN3A3-LSECtin interaction promotes cancer stemness and tumor progression [1].
- **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Downregulation of BTN3A3 correlates with advanced clinical stage, increased proliferation, and poorer overall survival [1].
- **Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** BTN3A3 expression is part of prognostic risk models, indicating its potential utility as a biomarker for tumor progression and patient outcome [1].
- **Influenza A Virus:** BTN3A3 evasion may promote the zoonotic potential of influenza A viruses [6].

BTN3A3 is also involved in immune regulation and may play a role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, though this area requires further research [1, 5].
