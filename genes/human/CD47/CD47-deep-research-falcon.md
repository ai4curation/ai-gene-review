## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q08722
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Leukocyte surface antigen CD47; AltName: Full=Antigenic surface determinant protein OA3; AltName: Full=Integrin-associated protein; Short=IAP; AltName: Full=Protein MER6; AltName: CD_antigen=CD47; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CD47; Synonyms=MER6;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** CD47. (IPR006704); CD47-like_TM. (IPR013147); CD47_Vset. (IPR013270); Ig-like_dom. (IPR007110); Ig-like_dom_sf. (IPR036179)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CD47" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CD47' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CD47** (gene ID: CD47, UniProt: Q08722) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity checks: The target is human CD47 (UniProt Q08722), also known as integrin-associated protein (IAP) and leukocyte surface antigen CD47. CD47 is a widely expressed plasma-membrane protein with an extracellular Ig-like domain that binds SIRPα and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), consistent with the provided UniProt identity and domain annotations. No conflicting symbols were encountered in the evidence; all sources refer to human CD47 as an innate immune checkpoint ligand and integrin-associated protein (no organismal ambiguity). (isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3, skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49)

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and localization: CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed cell-surface receptor on human cells, originally identified as integrin-associated protein (IAP). It resides on the outer plasma membrane and forms membrane clusters impacting signaling and phagocytosis. (Isenberg & Montero 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1584). (isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3)
- Principal ligands and complexes: The extracellular Ig-like domain of CD47 binds SIRPα on myeloid cells in trans, establishing an innate immune checkpoint that suppresses phagocytosis. CD47 also binds TSP1 with high affinity and can interact in cis with multiple β integrins (αVβ3, αIIbβ3, α2β1, α4β1, α6β1, α5β1), and co-associates with receptors including VEGFR2, FAS, CD14, and others, shaping diverse downstream signaling outcomes. (Skrobek 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.32156. Isenberg & Montero 2024). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3)
- Core checkpoint mechanism (CD47–SIRPα): Upon CD47–SIRPα engagement, SIRPα ITIMs recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which dephosphorylate myosin IIA and other substrates to inhibit phagocytic synapse formation and engulfment (“don’t-eat-me” signal). (Skrobek 2023). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49)
- TSP1–CD47 signaling: TSP1 binding to CD47 modulates vascular and metabolic signaling, notably inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) signaling and VEGF signaling, constricting blood vessels and exerting anti-angiogenic effects; it can promote ROS/oxidative stress and cellular senescence in specific contexts. (Skrobek 2023; Isenberg & Montero 2024; URLs: https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.32156; https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1584). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 8-9)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Updated conceptual framing: Editorial analyses emphasize that CD47 sits at a junction of multiple receptor–ligand networks (SIRPα, TSP1, integrins, VEGFR2), complicating therapeutic modulation and necessitating attention to on-target, non-SIRPα effects when designing inhibitors. Program halts and trial discontinuations have prompted re-evaluation of strategy, dose, and combinations. (Isenberg & Montero 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1584). (isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 8-9)
- Engineering/selectivity strategies to mitigate anemia: 2023 reviews summarize approaches to reduce RBC binding/toxicity, including tumor-selective anti-CD47 antibodies, SIRPα-targeting decoys/antibodies that avoid RBCs, and blockade of CD47 pyroglutamylation via QPCTL inhibition to weaken CD47–SIRPα without affecting mature RBCs. (Liu et al. 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01365-z). (liu2023emergingphagocytosischeckpoints pages 18-19)
- Quantitative updates from hematologic malignancy trials (selected): A 2024 review compiled efficacy and safety readouts across several anti-CD47 programs:
  - Magrolimab + azacitidine in higher-risk MDS (phase 1): ORR 75%, CR 33%; anemia risk mitigated by priming dose; later, phase 3 ENHANCE program halted in 2023 due to lack of survival benefit in AML subsets and broader strategic concerns. (Xu et al. 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1348852). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11)
  - Magrolimab + rituximab in NHL: ORR 40%/CR 33% in DLBCL (n=15) and ORR 71%/CR 43% in follicular lymphoma (n=7) in early studies; multi-agent combinations reported ORR ~51.5%, CR ~39.4%, median DOR ~18 months in selected settings. (Xu et al. 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1348852). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
  - Letaplimab + azacitidine (MDS): ORR 82.2%, CR 31.1%, with anemia in ~48%. Lemzoparlimab + azacitidine: ORR 82.1%. Ligufalimab (AK117): in AML/MDS cohorts, multiple grade ≥3 cytopenias; among 20 evaluable, 9 CR + 2 CRi; in MDS, 48.1% CR in 27 evaluable and 22.2% grade ≥3 anemia. (Xu et al. 2024). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
  - Evorpacept (ALX148): MDS/AML program (e.g., ASPEN-02) terminated in Aug 2023 for insufficient added benefit versus azacitidine; ongoing/alternative solid tumor combinations continue outside MDS. (Xu et al. 2024; Jiang et al. 2024; URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1348852; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1378647). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11)
- Mechanistic modeling: Membrane-biophysical studies in 2023 described cooperative, membrane-mediated clustering and interactions in CD47–SIRPα adhesion systems, complementing microscopy data and extending quantitative understanding for therapeutic design. (Li et al. 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13110871). ()

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology (hematologic): Anti-CD47 antibodies (e.g., magrolimab) and SIRPα-based decoys/antibodies are being advanced mainly in MDS/AML and B-cell lymphomas, often in combination with hypomethylating agents or anti-CD20 antibodies to exploit enhanced antibody-dependent phagocytosis and innate–adaptive crosstalk. Early-phase activity has been observed, though late-phase readouts have been mixed, leading to program reprioritizations in 2023. (Xu et al. 2024; Jiang et al. 2024; URLs above). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11)
- Solid tumors: Combination strategies (e.g., with anti-EGFR or anti-HER2 antibodies) remain under exploration; strategic reassessments followed 2023 terminations in MDS, but solid tumor development continues in selected combinations and platform trials. (Jiang et al. 2024; Isenberg & Montero 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1378647; https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1584). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3)
- Vascular biology/cardiometabolic disease (mechanistic application): Recent studies reinforce that TSP1–CD47 signaling inhibits NO–cGMP and VEGF signaling, supporting investigational concepts for modulating perfusion, angiogenesis, and inflammatory tone; however, clinical translation outside oncology remains exploratory. (Skrobek 2023; Isenberg & Montero 2024). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 8-9)

4) Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Strategic reassessment of CD47 targeting: Editorial commentary argues that CD47’s pleiotropy and multi-receptor hub function explain divergent clinical outcomes and on-target toxicities; future success likely requires agent-specific pharmacology (e.g., epitope, Fc design), refined dosing (priming, step-up), and rational combinations that consider both SIRPα-dependent and TSP1/integrin/VEGFR2 co-signaling. (Isenberg & Montero 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1584). (isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 8-9)
- Industry landscape (2023–2024): Reviews summarize the halting of phase 3 ENHANCE (magrolimab + azacitidine in HR‑MDS) in July 2023 and termination of evorpacept MDS program in August 2023, underscoring feasibility challenges and the need for improved patient selection and biomarkers (e.g., TP53 status, macrophage/TME contexture). (Jiang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
- Engineering recommendations: Reviews highlight RBC-sparing strategies (SIRPα-focused agents, tumor-selective antibodies, QPCTL inhibition) as crucial to balancing efficacy and safety in upcoming trials. (Liu et al. 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01365-z). (liu2023emergingphagocytosischeckpoints pages 18-19)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (selected)
- HR-MDS (magrolimab + azacitidine, early-phase): ORR 75%, CR 33% (phase 1). (Xu et al. 2024). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
- NHL combinations (magrolimab + rituximab): DLBCL cohort ORR 40%/CR 33% (n=15); FL cohort ORR 71%/CR 43% (n=7). (Xu et al. 2024). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
- Multi-agent regimens (selected settings): ORR ~51.5%, CR ~39.4%, median DOR ~18 months; median OS not reached at reporting. (Xu et al. 2024). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
- Safety signals: Anemia is a prominent, mechanism-based toxicity due to RBC CD47; mitigation via priming doses and RBC-sparing designs is reported across clinical programs. (Xu et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2023). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4, liu2023emergingphagocytosischeckpoints pages 18-19)

Mechanistic detail and pathway roles
- CD47–SIRPα phagocytosis checkpoint: CD47 on target cells engages SIRPα on macrophages; SIRPα ITIMs recruit SHP‑1/SHP‑2, which dephosphorylate myosin IIA, reducing contractility and engulfment, thereby suppressing phagocytosis. This checkpoint integrates with other myeloid checkpoints (e.g., PD‑L1/MHC‑I axes) and can be overcome by blockade or by pro-phagocytic receptor activation. (Skrobek 2023; Liu et al. 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.32156; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01365-z). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, liu2023emergingphagocytosischeckpoints pages 18-19)
- TSP1–CD47 vascular and metabolic signaling: TSP1 ligation of CD47 inhibits NO–cGMP signaling (limiting vasodilation) and decreases VEGF signaling, anti-angiogenic overall; it can promote ROS and senescence, with implications for ischemia, atherosclerosis, and tissue stress responses. (Skrobek 2023; Isenberg & Montero 2024). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 8-9)
- Integrin associations and inside-out signaling: CD47’s cis association with multiple integrins (e.g., αIIbβ3) links TSP1–CD47 engagement to integrin activation via Gi, SYK, FAK, and Src, aligning with its original designation as IAP and supporting roles in adhesion and platelet biology. (Skrobek 2023). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49)

Structural insights (recent)
- Structural and biophysical efforts: Attempts using cryo-EM and nanobody complexes to characterize full-length human CD47 and its complexes are reported; CD47 forms membrane clusters and engages multiple partners, but high-resolution, full-length structures remain technically challenging. These efforts guide epitope- and interface-focused therapeutic design even when atomic-resolution data are incomplete. (Skrobek 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.32156. Isenberg & Montero 2024). (skrobek2023structuralcharacterizationof pages 46-49, isenberg2024toleratingcd47 pages 1-3)

Clinical landscape synopsis (2023–2024)
- Programs and outcomes: After early promising activity, magrolimab’s phase 3 ENHANCE program in MDS was halted in 2023; AML development concluded with limited expected survival benefit in TP53‑mutant disease. Evorpacept’s MDS/AML program was terminated for lack of added benefit, though other solid-tumor combinations continue. Several alternative anti‑CD47 and SIRPα‑directed agents report high response rates in early MDS cohorts but share hematologic toxicities that require mitigation. (Jiang et al. 2024; Xu et al. 2024; URLs above). (xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 10-11, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)
- Safety and translational considerations: Anemia attributable to RBC CD47 remains the principal on‑target toxicity; strategies include priming/step dosing, RBC‑sparing epitope selection, SIRPα‑centric agents, Fc engineering, and modulation of CD47–SIRPα maturation (e.g., QPCTL). (Liu et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2024). (liu2023emergingphagocytosischeckpoints pages 18-19, xu2024opportunitiesandchallenges pages 2-4)

Notes on verification and domains
- The literature aligns with the UniProt description: CD47 is an Ig superfamily protein with a V-set Ig-like extracellular domain, a multi-pass transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail; the functionally salient domains and binding partners (SIRPα, TSP1, integrins) are consistent with domain annotations provided. No conflicting gene symbol usage or non-human ortholog confusion was found. (Isenberg & Montero 2024; Skrobek 2023).
