description: >-
  CD47 (also known as integrin-associated protein, IAP) is a ubiquitously expressed
  cell surface receptor that functions as an innate immune checkpoint - the "don't eat me"
  signal. The core function of CD47 is to bind SIRPalpha on myeloid cells (macrophages,
  dendritic cells) in trans, which recruits SHP-1/SHP-2 phosphatases to inhibit phagocytosis.
  This CD47-SIRPalpha axis is critical for self-recognition and prevents inappropriate
  phagocytic clearance of healthy cells. CD47 also binds thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) to modulate
  vascular signaling, including inhibition of nitric oxide signaling. Additionally, CD47
  associates with multiple integrins (alphaVbeta3, alphaIIbbeta3, etc.) to modulate
  integrin-mediated signaling and cell adhesion. The protein contains an extracellular
  Ig-like V-type domain and five transmembrane helices.

      Plasma membrane localization is a core property of CD47 function. The protein

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is an OVER-ANNOTATION and MISLEADING. CD47's core function
      is as a phagocytosis checkpoint. When CD47 is lost or blocked, cells are
      cleared by phagocytes - this appears as "cell death" but is NOT apoptosis.
      The cells are engulfed by macrophages, not dying by apoptotic program.
      While CD47 can augment FAS-mediated apoptosis (PMID:15917238), this is a
      secondary/modulatory effect, not its core function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      CD47 is fundamentally a "don't eat me" signal that prevents phagocytosis.
      Loss of CD47 leads to phagocytic clearance, not apoptosis. The annotation
      to "apoptotic process" is fundamentally misleading about the protein's
      function. The keyword-based mapping from Swiss-Prot "Apoptosis" is
      inappropriate because CD47's relationship to cell death is indirect -
      it modulates whether cells get cleared by phagocytes, not whether they
      undergo intrinsic apoptotic cell death.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      CD47 on target cells binds SIRPalpha on macrophages/phagocytes, recruiting
      SHP-1/SHP-2 phosphatases to inhibit phagocytosis. This is the primary innate
      immune checkpoint function of CD47 - the "don't eat me" signal.

        label: cell surface
  - description: >-
      CD47 is the receptor for the C-terminal cell-binding domain of TSP1,
      modulating integrin function and vascular signaling (including NO signaling).
