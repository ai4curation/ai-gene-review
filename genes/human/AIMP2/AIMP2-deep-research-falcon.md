1. **Check if the gene symbol "AIMP2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AIMP2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AIMP2** (gene ID: AIMP2, UniProt: Q13155) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human AIMP2 (Q13155) – Aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (p38/JTV-1)

Verification of target identity and domains
- Identity/organism: AIMP2 (aliases p38, JTV-1) is a nonenzymatic, human scaffold subunit of the cytosolic multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Reviews and primary studies consistently describe AIMP2 as an essential architectural component of the MSC in Homo sapiens, matching UniProt Q13155 (human). AIMP2 belongs to the AIMP family (AIMP1/p43, AIMP2/p38, AIMP3/p18) (Zhou 2020; Liang 2015) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2, liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6).
- Domains/architecture: AIMP2 harbors a C-terminal GST-like domain mediating interactions with aminoacyl‑tRNA synthetases (e.g., EPRS, DRS/KARS module), consistent with GST_C-like annotations. It interacts with EPRS largely via GST domain heterodimerization and with DRS via specific loop contacts; these domain-level features align with the thioredoxin-like/GST superfamily annotations in the database summary (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Core role: AIMP2 is a central scaffold of the mammalian MSC (with several cytosolic ARSs). Beyond scaffolding, AIMP2 is stress-responsive and can be released from the MSC to execute signaling functions linked to apoptosis, tumor suppression, and innate immunity (Zhou 2020; Liang 2015) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2, liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6).
- MSC integrity and essentiality: Genetic and biochemical data indicate AIMP2 is required for complex stability and organismal viability; loss perturbs aminoacylation activities of complex-bound synthetases and AIMP2 deficiency in mice is lethal or increases tumor susceptibility (Liang 2015) (liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6).

Molecular interactions and pathways (current understanding)
- MSC binding partners: AIMP2 directly scaffolds multiple ARSs. Domain-resolved evidence shows EPRS binds the AIMP2 GST domain; DRS (aspartyl‑RS) binds via defined loop interactions. AIMP2 also connects MSC submodules containing RRS, KRS, and QRS (Zhou 2020; Liang 2015) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2, liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6).
- Phosphorylation-dependent release and nuclear translocation: DNA damage triggers JNK-dependent phosphorylation and dissociation of AIMP2 from the MSC, nuclear translocation, and binding to p53 to protect it from degradation. TGF‑β signaling induces AIMP2 expression and nuclear translocation; p38 MAPK phosphorylates AIMP2 at S156, promoting release from the MSC and binding to Smurf2, which leads to FBP downregulation and c‑Myc suppression. An S156A mutant impairs these tumor‑suppressor functions (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).
- TNF/NF‑κB axis: AIMP2 enhances TNF‑α–dependent pro‑apoptotic signaling by promoting ubiquitin‑dependent degradation of TRAF2 via c‑IAP1 recruitment (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).
- Wnt pathway: AIMP2 binds DVL1, disrupting AXIN–DVL1 assembly, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β‑catenin signaling and modulating intestinal stem-cell compartments (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).

Cellular localization
- Basal: Predominantly cytosolic as a core MSC scaffold (Liang 2015; Zhou 2020) (liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6, zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2).
- Stress-induced: Upon specific stress/signaling cues (DNA damage, TGF‑β, p38 MAPK activation), AIMP2 is released from the MSC and translocates to the nucleus to execute transcriptional/tumor‑suppressive functions (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).

Disease mechanisms and recent developments (prioritized 2023–2024)
Neurodegeneration/Parkinson’s disease
- AIMP2 as Parkin substrate and parthanatos mediator: Foundational work identifies AIMP2 as a parkin substrate; AIMP2 accumulation drives PARP‑1 overactivation and dopaminergic neuron loss via parthanatos. Parkin overexpression protects cells from AIMP2 toxicity, and interventions that reduce AIMP2 (e.g., VPS35-mediated lysosomal clearance) mitigate toxicity (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 2-4, zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 12-12).
- 2024 update—bidirectional regulation by DX2: AIMP2’s exon‑2–deleted splice variant, DX2, antagonizes AIMP2. In neuronal models, DX2 translocates to the nucleus more rapidly under oxidative stress, binds PARP‑1 with apparently higher affinity than AIMP2, and inhibits PARP‑1–dependent neuronal death. In vivo, DX2 transgenics show neuroprotection in rotenone models; single intracranial AAV‑DX2 improved behavior/mobility in 6‑OHDA PD models. This positions DX2 as a candidate therapeutic that counters AIMP2‑PARP‑1–driven parthanatos (Lee 2024, Acta Neuropathol Commun., Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-023-01697-5) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2).

Cancer
- Tumor suppressor functions of AIMP2: AIMP2 promotes apoptosis upon genotoxic stress (via p53 stabilization) and suppresses oncogenic signaling (e.g., c‑Myc via FBP degradation) after S156 phosphorylation and Smurf2 engagement (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).
- AIMP2‑DX2 splice variant (oncogenic): DX2 is upregulated in several cancers (lung, chemoresistant ovarian), competes with AIMP2 for p53 and TRAF2 binding, and promotes tumorigenesis/chemoresistance (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).
- 2022–present translational advance—KRAS stabilization by DX2 and small-molecule inhibitor: DX2 specifically binds the KRAS hypervariable region and G‑domain in the cytosol prior to farnesylation, blocking Smurf2‑mediated KRAS ubiquitination and increasing KRAS stability; DX2 levels correlate with KRAS in colon/lung cancers. A small molecule targeting the DX2–KRAS interface reduces KRAS levels and suppresses KRAS‑dependent tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (Nature Communications, May 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30149-2) (kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2).

Antiviral/viral interactions
- 2023 host-targeting anti-HIV concept via AIMP2–LysRS interface: During HIV‑1 infection, S207‑phosphorylated LysRS is released from the MSC and supports HIV replication by producing Ap4A in the nucleus to activate USF2 and promote proviral transcription. An MSC‑derived AIMP2 peptide (AIMP2‑N36) that binds LysRS and stabilizes its MSC‑bound conformation suppresses HIV‑1 DNA transcription in cells without impairing LysRS canonical aminoacylation—demonstrating a translational strategy to restrain LysRS noncanonical pro‑HIV activity by leveraging AIMP2–LysRS binding (Nucleic Acids Research, Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad941) (tang2023humanlysyltrnasynthetase pages 9-11).
- 2024 EV71 antiviral mechanism: AIMP2 restricts Enterovirus 71 by recruiting the E3 ligase SMURF2 to promote proteasomal degradation of the viral 3D polymerase (Virologica Sinica, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virs.2024.06.009) (ren2024aimp2restrictsev71 pages 12-13).
- Additional viral context: Earlier summaries link AIMP2–viral interactions (e.g., influenza A NS2 stabilizing AIMP2 to promote M1 SUMOylation and viral replication), highlighting that viruses can modulate AIMP2 to reprogram host ubiquitin/SUMO pathways (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 12-12).

Current applications and implementations
- Gene therapy concept (PD): AAV‑mediated DX2 delivery mitigated behavioral deficits and neuronal death in toxin-based PD models in vivo, suggesting a potential disease-modifying approach targeting the AIMP2–PARP‑1 axis (Lee 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-023-01697-5) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2).
- Small molecules in oncology: A DX2–KRAS interface inhibitor reduced KRAS abundance and KRAS‑dependent tumor growth in preclinical models (Nature Communications, 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30149-2) (kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2).
- Host-directed antivirals: The AIMP2‑N36 peptide strategy indicates that stabilizing MSC components to prevent noncanonical, virus-supportive functions of ARSs (e.g., LysRS) can attenuate HIV replication without suppressing translation (Nucleic Acids Research, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad941) (tang2023humanlysyltrnasynthetase pages 9-11).

Expert synthesis and analysis
- AIMP2 functions as a molecular switch: Under homeostasis, it scaffolds the MSC to support translation. Under stress or specific signaling (JNK, p38 MAPK; TGF‑β), phosphorylation‑dependent release allows nuclear relocalization where AIMP2 coordinates tumor suppressor pathways (p53 stabilization, c‑Myc suppression) and apoptotic signaling (TNF‑TRAF2 axis). The same release principle enables pathogenic roles in PD when AIMP2 accumulates and hyperactivates PARP‑1 parthanatos; conversely, the DX2 splice variant buffers AIMP2’s lethal interactions in neurons but can be oncogenic in proliferative tissues by neutralizing AIMP2 tumor-suppressor functions (Zhou 2020; Lee 2024) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8, lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic window considerations: Tissue context likely dictates whether enhancing AIMP2 (cancer) or antagonizing its interactions (neurodegeneration) is beneficial. The divergent effects of DX2 underscore this: neuroprotective in PD models by competing with AIMP2–PARP‑1, but tumor‑promoting via competition with AIMP2 at p53/TRAF2 and via KRAS stabilization (Lee 2024; Zhou 2020; Kim 2022) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2, zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8, kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2).
- Virology perspective: AIMP2 sits at an intersection of host translation machinery and ubiquitin signaling. EV71 studies reveal an intrinsic antiviral role (AIMP2→SMURF2→viral polymerase degradation), while HIV exploits release of LysRS from the AIMP2‑scaffolded MSC; constraining ARS release with an AIMP2‑derived peptide curtails HIV transcriptional activation, illustrating host-pathway leverage points (Tang 2023; Ren 2024) (tang2023humanlysyltrnasynthetase pages 9-11, ren2024aimp2restrictsev71 pages 12-13).

Relevant statistics and data
- PD models: DX2 transgenic mice exhibited neuroprotection in rotenone-induced damage; AAV‑DX2 improved motor behavior in 6‑OHDA models (qualitative summary from Lee 2024). These data provide preclinical proof-of-concept for targeting the AIMP2–PARP‑1 axis (Lee 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-023-01697-5) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2).
- Oncology models: Disrupting DX2–KRAS interaction lowered KRAS levels and suppressed KRAS‑dependent tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (Nature Communications 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30149-2) (kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2).
- HIV replication assays: AIMP2‑N36 expression suppressed HIV-1 DNA transcription in single-cycle and multi-round infection without impairing LysRS aminoacylation, indicating a selective host-directed antiviral effect (Nucleic Acids Research 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad941) (tang2023humanlysyltrnasynthetase pages 9-11).

Concise functional summary
- Primary role: Nonenzymatic scaffold subunit of the MSC, organizing multiple ARSs through GST‑like domain interfaces, essential for complex stability and organismal viability (Liang 2015; Zhou 2020) (liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6, zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2).
- Stress signaling: Upon phosphorylation (JNK; p38 S156), AIMP2 dissociates from the MSC, translocates to the nucleus, binds p53 (stabilization), recruits Smurf2 to suppress c‑Myc (via FBP ubiquitination), facilitates TNF‑α–induced apoptosis (TRAF2–c‑IAP1), and modulates Wnt/DVL1 (Zhou 2020) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 6-8).
- Disease links: AIMP2 accumulation drives PD‑relevant parthanatos via PARP‑1; DX2 antagonizes AIMP2 in neurons but is oncogenic in cancers and stabilizes KRAS. AIMP2 can also act as an antiviral restriction factor (EV71), and AIMP2–LysRS interactions can be exploited to suppress HIV transcription (Lee 2024; Kim 2022; Tang 2023; Ren 2024) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2, kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2, tang2023humanlysyltrnasynthetase pages 9-11, ren2024aimp2restrictsev71 pages 12-13).

Limitations and open questions
- High-resolution structural data for full-length human AIMP2 in complex with all cognate ARSs remains incomplete; most domain-level interactions are inferred from subcomplexes and reviews (Zhou 2020; Liang 2015) (zhou2020rolesofaminoacyltrna pages 1-2, liang2015steppingoutof pages 4-6).
- Translational balance: DX2 shows tissue‑specific duality (neuroprotective vs oncogenic). Defining safe delivery/induction paradigms will be crucial for clinical translation (Lee 2024; Kim 2022) (lee2024bidirectionalregulationof pages 1-2, kim2022aimp2dx2providestherapeutic pages 1-2).
