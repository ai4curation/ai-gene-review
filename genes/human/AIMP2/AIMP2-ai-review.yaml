description: 'AIMP2 (also known as p38/JTV-1) is a non-enzymatic scaffold protein essential for the assembly and stability of the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Through its GST-like C-terminal domain, AIMP2 heterodimerizes with EPRS1 and connects to other MSC submodules including DRS-KARS. The N-terminal region directly binds KARS1 (lysyl-tRNA synthetase). Beyond its structural role in the MSC, AIMP2 has well-documented moonlighting functions in tumor suppression: upon DNA damage or TGF-beta signaling, AIMP2 is phosphorylated (by JNK/p38 MAPK), dissociates from the MSC, translocates to the nucleus, and stabilizes p53 by preventing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. AIMP2 also promotes FUBP1 degradation to suppress c-Myc, modulates TNF-alpha signaling via TRAF2, and inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through DVL1 binding. In Parkinson''s disease, AIMP2 accumulation (due to defective parkin-mediated ubiquitination) drives PARP-1-dependent parthanatos. The DX2 splice variant lacking exon 2 antagonizes AIMP2 functions and has oncogenic properties.'

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: AIMP2 is a well-established core scaffold component of the mammalian MSC. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and supported by extensive experimental evidence including mass spectrometry identification (PMID:19131329, PMID:24312579), X-ray crystallography of AIMP2-KARS1 and AIMP2-EPRS1 subcomplexes, and cryo-EM structure of the full complex (PMID:32644155).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of AIMP2. Multiple studies demonstrate that AIMP2/p38 is part of the MSC and is required for its assembly and stability. Kaminska et al. (PMID:19131329) showed that siRNA knockdown of p38 disrupts MSC integrity, and the protein has been directly identified as an MSC component by mass spectrometry and structural studies.

  review:
    summary: AIMP2 nuclear localization is conditional and occurs upon DNA damage or stress signaling. Under basal conditions, AIMP2 is predominantly cytosolic as part of the MSC. Upon UV irradiation or genotoxic stress, AIMP2 is phosphorylated, dissociates from the MSC, and translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with p53 (PMID:18695251).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Nuclear localization is stress-induced and not the basal state. The annotation is correct but represents a conditional localization associated with the moonlighting tumor suppressor function rather than the core MSC scaffold function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: Cytosolic localization is the basal state of AIMP2 where it functions as part of the MSC scaffold. This is well-supported by direct experimental evidence (PMID:19289464) showing dynamic organization of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes in the cytoplasm of human cells.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytosol is the primary subcellular location where AIMP2 carries out its core function as MSC scaffold. This is supported by IDA evidence from PMID:19289464 and is consistent with the MSC being a cytosolic translation-associated complex.

    label: translation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: While AIMP2 is part of the MSC which supports translation, AIMP2 itself does not directly catalyze any step of translation. It functions as a scaffold for the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that carry out aminoacylation. The annotation is too direct an inference.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: AIMP2 does not directly participate in translation but rather supports aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex assembly, which is upstream of translation. A more accurate BP annotation would be tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation or protein-containing complex assembly.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: AIMP2 has a documented role in promoting apoptosis via p53 stabilization upon DNA damage. However, the evidence (PMID:18695251) is phenotypic - cells lacking AIMP2 are resistant to apoptosis, and reintroduction restores susceptibility. This demonstrates REGULATION of apoptosis, not direct participation in the apoptotic process. AIMP2 stabilizes p53 by blocking MDM2, and p53 then triggers apoptosis - AIMP2 is upstream of the apoptotic machinery.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The mechanism is regulatory - AIMP2 blocks MDM2 to stabilize p53, which then activates apoptotic genes. AIMP2 does not directly participate in apoptotic process execution (caspase cascades, membrane changes, DNA fragmentation). The phenotypic evidence (resistance/susceptibility to apoptosis) supports a regulatory annotation, not process participation. This is a genuine evolved proapoptotic moonlighting function, but the correct GO term is "positive regulation of apoptotic process."

AIMP2 brings together multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and auxiliary proteins to form the MSC. Its GST-like domain mediates heterodimerization with EPRS1, while its N-terminus binds KARS1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of AIMP2. The IDA evidence from Kaminska et al. (2009) directly demonstrates AIMP2's adaptor function in mediating MSC assembly. Structural studies have since confirmed the molecular basis of these interactions.

core_functions:
- description: AIMP2 is a non-enzymatic scaffold protein that brings together multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (KARS1, EPRS1, DARS1, and others) and auxiliary proteins to form the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). Its GST-like C-terminal domain mediates heterodimerization with EPRS1, while its N-terminal region directly binds KARS1 (lysyl-tRNA synthetase). This adaptor function is essential for MSC assembly and stability. The DRS-AIMP2-EPRS subcomplex functions as an architectural pivot connecting two AIMP2-centered subcomplexes to assemble the complete ~1.5 MDa MSC (PMID:31576228).

- description: AIMP2 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor through multiple independent mechanisms. Upon DNA damage, AIMP2 is phosphorylated by JNK, dissociates from the MSC, and translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds p53 (via N-terminal transactivation domain) and competitively blocks MDM2 access, thereby preventing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and stabilizing p53 to promote apoptosis. This represents a key moonlighting function linking the translational machinery to tumor suppression. Note that AIMP2 REGULATES apoptosis (by stabilizing p53) rather than directly participating in apoptotic process execution.

- description: AIMP2 mediates TGF-beta-induced growth arrest through regulation of c-Myc. Upon TGF-beta stimulation, AIMP2 is phosphorylated at Ser156 by p38 MAPK, promoting its dissociation from the MSC and nuclear translocation. Nuclear AIMP2 binds to FUSE-binding protein (FBP/FUBP1), a transcriptional activator of c-myc, and interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 to promote FBP ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This leads to c-Myc downregulation essential for cellular differentiation.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the stoichiometry of AIMP2 within the MSC? Is there evidence for substoichiometric AIMP2 that could explain partial MSC function after partial AIMP2 depletion?
- question: Does the DX2 splice variant (lacking exon 2) retain any MSC scaffolding function, or is it exclusively involved in antagonizing AIMP2's moonlighting functions?
- question: How is the balance between MSC-bound and free AIMP2 regulated under normal physiological conditions, and what determines the threshold for stress-induced dissociation?
- question: Why do AIMP2 mutations or accumulation affect specific cell types preferentially (e.g., dopamine neurons, oligodendrocytes, lung epithelial cells)? What accounts for this selective vulnerability in HLD17 and Parkinson's disease?
- question: What factors control the alternative splicing that generates AIMP2-DX2, and how does Hsp70 selectively stabilize the oncogenic variant?
- question: Could enhancing AIMP2-DX2 be beneficial in Parkinson's disease (since it competes with full-length AIMP2 for PARP1 activation but lacks parthanatos-inducing capability) without promoting tumorigenesis?
- question: What is the molecular mechanism by which AIMP2 promotes ADAR protein degradation, and does this involve ubiquitination pathways similar to its effects on FBP and TRAF2?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Quantitative proteomics to determine the fraction of cellular AIMP2 that is MSC-bound versus free under basal and stress conditions
  hypothesis: A significant pool of AIMP2 exists free from the MSC even under basal conditions, poised for rapid stress response
- description: Structural studies to determine whether post-translational modifications (phosphorylation at S156 or other sites) alter AIMP2's affinity for MSC components
  hypothesis: Phosphorylation at S156 disrupts the AIMP2-EPRS1 interface, promoting MSC dissociation
- description: CRISPR knock-in of phosphomimetic AIMP2 variants to test the role of constitutive phosphorylation on MSC integrity and tumor suppressor function in vivo
  hypothesis: Constitutive phosphomimetic AIMP2 will show impaired MSC scaffolding but enhanced tumor suppressor activity
