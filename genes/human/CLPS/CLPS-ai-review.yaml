description: Pancreatic colipase, the classical small secreted protein (112 AA precursor,
  ~10 kDa mature) that functions as an essential cofactor for pancreatic triglyceride
  lipase (PNLIP) in dietary fat digestion. Produced by pancreatic acinar cells and
  secreted into the duodenum, colipase binds to the C-terminal domain of pancreatic
  lipase and anchors the enzyme to the lipid-water interface in the presence of bile
  salts, restoring and stabilizing lipase activity during triglyceride hydrolysis.
  The protein contains multiple disulfide bonds forming a stable structure and exhibits
  lipase binding activity. Beyond fat digestion, colipase also participates in retinoid
  metabolism and shows antimicrobial properties (response to bacterium). CLPS is the
  archetypal member of the colipase family, with related proteins (LRCOL1, CLPSL1,
  CLPSL2) functioning in non-pancreatic tissues.
