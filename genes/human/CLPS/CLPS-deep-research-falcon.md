Plan overview
We verified the human target identity (CLPS; UniProt P04118) and collected mechanistic, structural, physiological, and recent omics evidence. We synthesized key concepts, recent developments (emphasizing 2023–2024), applications, and quantitative data, and we compiled a summary artifact.

Executive summary
CLPS encodes human pancreatic colipase, a small secreted protein cofactor required for optimal pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PNLIP/PTL) activity at the oil–water interface in the presence of bile salts during intestinal fat digestion. Colipase binds the C-terminal domain of PTL, stabilizes the open-lid conformation, and anchors the catalytic domain to bile salt–lined lipid micelles, enabling interfacial activation and efficient hydrolysis of dietary triacylglycerols. CLPS is expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and secreted with PTL into the duodenum; its gene maps to human chromosome 6p21.1–pter. A 2024 large-scale pQTL/GWAS colocalization study reported that plasma CLPS levels colocalize at an RNLS-associated type 1 diabetes locus, supporting an exocrine pancreas contribution to T1D biology, though this is a preprint. Selected quantitative estimates indicate PTL with colipase accounts for roughly three-quarters of luminal triglyceride hydrolysis. (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 2-3, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 7-8, davis1991assignmentofthe pages 2-3, elgamal2024circulatingpancreaticenzyme pages 1-4)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family/domain context. CLPS encodes human pancreatic colipase (colipase family). Colipase is a small, secreted, heat-stable protein cofactor (~10–12 kDa) with a flattened, disulfide-stabilized three-finger fold that interfaces with the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL/PNLIP) (Annual Review of Nutrition, 1997; Journal of Lipid Research, 2002). These features align with the colipase family annotation and domain organization noted for UniProt P04118. URL: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 7-8)
- Primary biochemical role. Colipase is essential for optimal PTL activity at physiological bile salt concentrations because bile salts inhibit PTL adsorption to the lipid interface. Colipase forms a specific 1:1 complex with PTL, reverses bile salt inhibition, and enables interfacial activation so that PTL hydrolyzes triacylglycerol to diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and free fatty acids for micellar uptake (Biochemistry, 1999; J Lipid Res, 2002; Am J Vet Res, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1021/bi982601x (1999-04); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12); https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (bezzine1999humanpancreaticlipase pages 1-2, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5)
- Substrate and localization context. The PTL–colipase complex acts at the oil–water interface of dietary lipid droplets and bile salt micelles in the intestinal lumen; products join mixed micelles for enterocyte absorption and chylomicron assembly (Ann Rev Nutr, 1997; Am J Vet Res, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07); https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4)
- Proprotein processing and enterostatin. Colipase is synthesized as procolipase and activated in the duodenum by trypsin cleavage, which releases the N‑terminal pentapeptide enterostatin. Enterostatin has been detected in the gut and circulation in animal studies and reduces voluntary fat intake in rodents, consistent with a signaling role, though human evidence remains limited (Ann Rev Nutr, 1997). URL: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6)

Mechanism and structural features
- Lipase–colipase complex and lid dynamics. PTL is a two-domain enzyme: an N‑terminal α/β-hydrolase fold harboring the catalytic triad and a C‑terminal β‑sandwich domain that binds colipase. In solution, a mobile lid covers the active site; at the interface and with colipase, the lid opens, forming a continuous hydrophobic plateau with the PTL “5‑loop” and colipase finger tips to engage the lipid surface (Am J Vet Res, 2022; J Lipid Res, 2002). URLs: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 7-8)
- Binding surfaces and key residues. Mutational and structural work implicates colipase residues (e.g., Glu45, Glu64, Arg65, Asn89) contacting PTL residues (e.g., Asn366, Gln369, Lys400), while PTL’s hydrophobic 5‑loop (residues ~405–414) is critical for interfacial binding; antibodies against the 5‑loop abolish interfacial activity (J Lipid Res, 2002; Biochemistry, 1999). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12); https://doi.org/10.1021/bi982601x (1999-04) (lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 7-8, bezzine1999humanpancreaticlipase pages 1-2)
- Bile salts and interfacial activation. Bile salts assemble on lipid droplets forming micelles that both inhibit PTL adsorption and, when colipase is present, provide the platform for the active PTL–colipase complex; colipase anchors PTL to the micellar surface and stabilizes the open active conformation (Am J Vet Res, 2022; Biochemistry, 1999). URLs: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08); https://doi.org/10.1021/bi982601x (1999-04) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4, bezzine1999humanpancreaticlipase pages 1-2)

Cellular and tissue context; pathway placement
- Expression, secretion, and localization. Colipase is produced by pancreatic acinar cells, stored in zymogen granules, and co‑secreted with PTL into the duodenum in response to cholecystokinin and secretin; under inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis, exocrine secretion is disrupted and circulating levels of pancreatic enzymes increase (Am J Vet Res, 2022; J Lipid Res, 2002). URLs: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2)
- Pathways. CLPS functions in fat digestion and absorption and in the pancreatic secretion pathway, enabling efficient luminal lipolysis whose products enter mixed micelles for uptake (Ann Rev Nutr, 1997; Am J Vet Res, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07); https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4)

Genomic location and gene regulation context
- Genomic locus. The human CLPS gene maps to chromosome 6p21.1–pter (Genomics, 1991). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543(91)90509-d (1991-05) (davis1991assignmentofthe pages 2-3)
- Regulatory context. Coordinated acinar secretion of PTL and CLPS is stimulated by gut hormones (CCK/secretin), matching their packaging in zymogen granules and co-release into the intestinal lumen (Am J Vet Res, 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Plasma protein QTLs and T1D risk. A 2024 medRxiv preprint analyzing plasma pQTLs across 2,922 proteins and T1D GWAS loci reported colocalization of an RNLS locus with plasma levels of colipase (CLPS), highlighting exocrine pancreas contributions to T1D biology; Mendelian randomization supported causal roles for several proteins, while CLPS was noted in colocalization (preprint; not yet peer reviewed) (medRxiv, 2024-08-09). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.24311619 (2024-08) (elgamal2024circulatingpancreaticenzyme pages 1-4)
- Current physiology/clinical framing. Recent reviews continue to emphasize that colipase is required for optimal PTL activity at physiological bile salt concentrations and that PTL with colipase accounts for the majority of luminal triglyceride hydrolysis, integrating mechanistic and clinical perspectives across species (Am J Vet Res, 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Digestive physiology and nutrition. Understanding CLPS is essential for interpreting fat digestion and for optimizing pancreatic enzyme replacement strategies where PTL must act at the lipid–water interface in the presence of bile salts; colipase is the physiological cofactor that restores activity in this context (J Lipid Res, 2002; Am J Vet Res, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12); https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4)
- Pancreatic disease biomarkers. In pancreatitis, exocrine secretion polarity is lost and pancreatic enzymes increase in circulation; while pancreatic lipase is the routine biomarker, colipase’s co-secretion and acinar origin contextualize its potential as a component of broader exocrine signatures (Am J Vet Res, 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5)
- Emerging omics biomarker research. The 2024 pQTL/T1D colocalization for CLPS suggests potential biomarker development and motivates targeted validation of CLPS levels in autoimmunity risk stratification, pending peer review and replication (medRxiv, 2024-08-09). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.08.24311619 (2024-08) (elgamal2024circulatingpancreaticenzyme pages 1-4)

Expert opinions and authoritative perspectives
- Mechanistic consensus. Authoritative reviews agree that colipase is indispensable for optimal PTL function in vivo at physiological bile salt levels, primarily by anchoring PTL at micelles and stabilizing the open-lid conformation for interfacial catalysis (Ann Rev Nutr, 1997; J Lipid Res, 2002; Am J Vet Res, 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12); https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2, lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 2-4)
- Structural insights. Structural and mutational studies delineate the colipase three-finger fold and PTL C-terminal binding site, and identify a hydrophobic 5‑loop and colipase contact residues that are critical for forming the interfacial catalytic platform (Biochemistry, 1999; J Lipid Res, 2002). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1021/bi982601x (1999-04); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (bezzine1999humanpancreaticlipase pages 1-2, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 7-8)

Relevant statistics and data
- Quantitative contribution to dietary fat hydrolysis. PTL in complex with colipase is responsible for roughly 75% of dietary triglyceride hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen, underscoring CLPS’s physiological importance (Am J Vet Res, 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.22.03.0048 (2022-08) (lim2022lipasesitsnot pages 4-5)
- Genetic/physiological evidence of requirement. In vivo models demonstrate that colipase deficiency leads to steatorrhea and undigested lipids on high-fat diets, indicating partial compensation by other lipases only under low-fat conditions (J Lipid Res, 2002). URL: https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 2-3)

Verification of identity and avoidance of symbol ambiguity
- The gene symbol CLPS (HGNC:2085) refers to human pancreatic colipase, consistent with UniProt P04118 and all cited literature. No conflicting human gene usage for “CLPS” was identified in recent or foundational sources. The organism is Homo sapiens, and the protein belongs to the colipase family with the expected three-finger, disulfide-stabilized fold and procolipase processing (Ann Rev Nutr, 1997; Genomics, 1991; J Lipid Res, 2002). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nutr.17.1.141 (1997-07); https://doi.org/10.1016/0888-7543(91)90509-d (1991-05); https://doi.org/10.1194/jlr.r200012-jlr200 (2002-12) (lowe1997structureandfunction pages 3-6, davis1991assignmentofthe pages 2-3, lowe2002thetriglyceridelipases pages 1-2)
