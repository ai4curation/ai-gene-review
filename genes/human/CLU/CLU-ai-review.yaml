description: >-
  Clusterin (CLU), also known as Apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) and Complement
  Cytolysis Inhibitor (CLI), is a highly glycosylated secreted chaperone that
  functions primarily as an extracellular holdase. The predominant secretory
  isoform (sCLU) prevents aggregation of non-native proteins in the
  extracellular space, maintaining them in a soluble, folding-competent state
  for subsequent refolding by ATP-dependent chaperones such as HSPA8/HSC70. CLU
  does not refold proteins itself and does not require ATP. It inhibits amyloid
  fibril formation by multiple amyloidogenic proteins (APP, APOC2, SNCA, etc.)
  and plays a key role in inhibiting complement membrane attack complex (MAC)
  assembly by preventing C9 polymerization. CLU also facilitates clearance of
  misfolded proteins via receptor-mediated endocytosis through LRP2/megalin.
  Intracellular forms of CLU have been implicated in ubiquitin-dependent
  proteasomal degradation, anti-apoptotic signaling via BAX interaction at
  mitochondria, and NF-kappa-B modulation. CLU is associated with the HDL
  particle and is widely expressed, with particular relevance to Alzheimer
  disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer.

  review:
    summary: >-
      CLU is well-established as a regulator of apoptosis. The secreted form
      inhibits apoptosis via complement MAC inhibition (PMID:9200695), the
      intracellular form inhibits apoptosis by interacting with activated BAX
      at mitochondria (PMID:16113678), and isoform 4 (nCLU) promotes apoptosis
      via BCL2L1 interaction (UniProt). The IBA annotation to the broad term
      "regulation of apoptotic process" is appropriate given the dual
      pro- and anti-apoptotic roles of different CLU isoforms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      CLU has well-documented roles in both inhibiting and promoting apoptosis
      depending on isoform and context. The IBA term at this level of

      synaptic biology through its interactions with amyloid-beta and its
      association with neurodegeneration. However, CLU is not a synaptic
      protein per se; it is an extracellular chaperone that is present in
      the extracellular space including at synapses.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). The
      annotation is based on PMID:25402950 (Rohne et al. 2014), which investigated the
      chaperone activity of clusterin under different glycosylation and redox conditions.
      The paper demonstrates that CLU has chaperone-like holdase activity -- it prevents
      aggregation of stressed/unfolded target proteins and maintains them in a soluble
      state. Critically, CLU does not actively refold proteins (PMID:11123922) and does
      not require ATP (PMID:11123922). This is consistent with an extracellular holdase
      function rather than a classical folding chaperone. The best replacement from
      existing GO terms is GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" (defined as binding to
      a protein to assist the protein folding process), though this is an imperfect fit
      since CLU prevents aggregation rather than directly assisting folding. The existing
      IBA annotation to GO:0051787 "misfolded protein binding" and the IDA annotations
      to GO:0051787 (PMID:11123922, PMID:19996109) more accurately capture the binding
      aspect of CLU chaperone function. GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" (already
      annotated via IDA from PMID:11123922 and PMID:12176985) captures the biological
      process aspect. A holdase-specific MF term would be ideal but does not currently
      exist in GO.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is being obsoleted. CLU is an extracellular
      holdase chaperone that prevents protein aggregation rather than actively promoting
      folding. PMID:25402950 demonstrates that CLU chaperone activity depends on
      glycosylation and redox environment, confirming holdase function. PMID:11123922
      established that CLU does not refold proteins by itself and does not require ATP.
      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is proposed as an interim replacement -- it
      is the closest available MF term for chaperone activity, though CLU functions as a
      holdase (preventing aggregation and maintaining proteins in a folding-competent
      state for downstream ATP-dependent chaperones) rather than a foldase. The existing
      annotations to GO:0051787 "misfolded protein binding" (IBA, IDA) already capture
      the binding specificity, and GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" (IDA) captures the
      biological process. A future holdase-specific term in GO would be more appropriate.

      At very low ratios, CLU can promote complex assembly, but this is a

    CLU (Clusterin/Apolipoprotein J) is a secreted extracellular holdase chaperone that
    binds a very broad range of structurally divergent stressed and misfolded protein
    substrates via exposed hydrophobic surfaces. CLU prevents irreversible aggregation
    by forming soluble high-molecular-weight complexes with its client proteins,
    maintaining them in a state competent for refolding by downstream ATP-dependent
    chaperones such as HSP70/HSC70. CLU itself does NOT refold proteins and does NOT
    require ATP. Recent structural analyses (2024-2025) reveal that two intrinsically
    disordered hydrophobic tails generated by precursor cleavage are indispensable for
    this holdase chaperone activity. CLU chaperone activity is enhanced at mildly acidic
    pH and depends on glycosylation.

    label: protein sequestering activity
  description: >-
    CLU inhibits the terminal complement pathway by sequestering soluble membrane attack
    complex (sMAC) precursors and preventing C9 polymerization. Cryo-EM structures show
    CLU binds a negatively charged surface of sMAC and obstructs the polymerizing face of
    C9, trapping it in an intermediate conformation. CLU also binds C5b-7 to prevent
    membrane attachment and binds C5b-8 and C5b-9 to prevent further C9 assembly. At
    physiological levels, CLU can reduce complement cytolysis of nucleated cells by
    10-fold or more.
