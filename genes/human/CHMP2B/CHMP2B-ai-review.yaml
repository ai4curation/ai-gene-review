description: CHMP2B (Charged multivesicular body protein 2b) is a core component of the ESCRT-III (Endosomal
  Sorting Complex Required for Transport III) machinery, belonging to the evolutionarily conserved SNF7
  family. CHMP2B functions as a structural subunit that assembles into helical polymers on membranes to
  mediate reverse-topology membrane scission events. The protein participates in multiple cellular processes
  including multivesicular body (MVB) formation and cargo sorting, cytokinetic abscission at the midbody,
  nuclear envelope reformation during telophase, plasma membrane repair, autophagosome maturation, and
  viral budding (particularly HIV-1). CHMP2B is recruited to membrane necks where it cooperates with other
  ESCRT-III subunits (CHMP4B, CHMP3) and the AAA ATPase VPS4 for membrane remodeling and fission. Mutations
  in CHMP2B cause frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTDALS7), demonstrating
  the critical importance of ESCRT-III function in neuronal homeostasis. The protein contains an N-terminal
  MIT-interacting motif that mediates interaction with VPS4, and post-translational modifications including
  K6 methylation by SMYD2 regulate its polymerization dynamics and abscission timing.

  review:
    summary: CHMP2B has been detected at nuclear pores as part of ESCRT-III function in nuclear envelope
      reformation, though its primary localization is at sites of annular fusion rather than mature nuclear
