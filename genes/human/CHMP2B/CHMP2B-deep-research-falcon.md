## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UQN3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Charged multivesicular body protein 2b; AltName: Full=CHMP2.5; AltName: Full=Chromatin-modifying protein 2b; Short=CHMP2b; AltName: Full=Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 2-2; Short=Vps2-2; Short=hVps2-2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CHMP2B; ORFNames=CGI-84;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SNF7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Snf7_fam. (IPR005024); Snf7 (PF03357)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CHMP2B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CHMP2B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CHMP2B** (gene ID: CHMP2B, UniProt: Q9UQN3) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview: We verified the gene/protein identity (CHMP2B, UniProt Q9UQN3), then gathered recent (2023–2024) peer‑reviewed literature on ESCRT‑III function, post‑translational regulation, cellular localizations, and FTD/ALS disease mechanisms, plus clinical biomarker and natural‑history data from the Danish CHMP2B pedigree. We prioritize primary studies and recent reviews, include URLs and publication dates, and cite each major claim.

Comprehensive research report: Human CHMP2B (Q9UQN3)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: CHMP2B (charged multivesicular body protein 2B) is a human ESCRT‑III subunit in the evolutionarily conserved SNF7/ESCRT‑III family that assembles on membranes to remodel and ultimately sever membrane necks; CHMP2B mutations are established genetic causes of familial frontotemporal dementia/ALS (FTD/ALS) (Nucleus, 2024; review) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3). This places CHMP2B in the ESCRT pathway that drives intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), membrane repair, and other reverse‑topology scission reactions, with disassembly powered by the AAA+ ATPase VPS4 (Nature Communications, 2024) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Core ESCRT‑III functions: ESCRT‑III polymers assemble at membrane necks; VPS4 remodels/extracts ESCRT‑III subunits to complete scission. ESCRT‑III operates in MVB biogenesis, cytokinetic abscission, nuclear envelope integrity/repair, plasma membrane and lysosomal repair, and autophagy/lysosome pathways (Nucleus, 2024; review) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).

2) Molecular function and regulation; recent developments (2023–2024)
- ESCRT‑III dynamics in cytokinesis and viral budding: A 2024 study identified lysine‑6 methylation of CHMP2B by SMYD2 as a regulator of abscission timing. SMYD2 loss or non‑methylatable CHMP2B K6 mutants delay CHMP2B polymerization and abscission; SMYD2 gain accelerates abscission and can bypass the abscission checkpoint. The same K6 methylation also modulates ESCRT‑III‑dependent HIV‑1 budding (Nature Communications, May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47717-3) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2).
- ESCRT‑III in autophagy/mitophagy: ESCRT‑III is required for sealing phagophores/autophagosomes; depletion of ESCRT‑III subunits (including CHMP2 paralogues) impairs mitophagic flux, consistent with ESCRT‑mediated membrane closure before lysosomal fusion (Autophagy, 2020; context for mechanism cited in 2024 reviews) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).
- ESCRT‑III in nuclear envelope and lysosomal/plasma membrane repair: Recent synthesis highlights roles for ESCRT‑III in nuclear pore complex surveillance and nuclear envelope repair, as well as lysosomal membrane damage responses—all processes relevant to neuronal survival (Nucleus, 2024; review; May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2024.2349085) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).

3) Cellular and subcellular localization and where CHMP2B acts
- Endosomes/MVBs and endolysosomal system: Disease‑linked CHMP2B mutations cause enlarged endosomes, endolysosomal trafficking defects, and accumulation of autophagic compartments, locating CHMP2B function at the endosome/MVB–lysosome interface (Nucleus, 2024) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 9-10).
- Cytokinetic bridge (midbody): CHMP2B is part of ESCRT‑III assemblies at the intercellular bridge, where post‑translational methylation by SMYD2 tunes its polymerization and timing of abscission (Nature Communications, 2024) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Additional sites in neurons: ESCRT‑III functions in synaptic pruning/trafficking and degradative pathways in neurons; alterations in ESCRT‑III (including CHMP2B) are implicated in synaptic dysfunction in FTD/ALS (Nucleus, 2024; review) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).

4) Pathway context and interactions
- ESCRT cascade: Adaptor factors and early ESCRTs nucleate ESCRT‑III assembly. CHMP2B participates in ESCRT‑III heteropolymers that constrict membrane necks, with VPS4 catalyzing remodeling/disassembly to complete scission (Nature Communications, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47717-3) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2). Reviews synthesize CHMP2B within ESCRT‑III roles at endosomes/MVBs, nuclear envelope, and lysosomal repair (Nucleus, 2024) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).

5) Disease‑associated mutations and mechanisms (FTD/ALS), with recent primary data
- Spectrum of pathogenic variants: Reviews summarize autosomal dominant C‑terminal truncations (e.g., CHMP2BIntron5/Δ10/Q165X) and point mutations (e.g., D148Y, T104N) causing ESCRT‑III dysfunction (Nucleus, 2024) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 9-10). A 2023 clinical genetics study reported a novel splice‑site variant (c.532‑2A>T) in CHMP2B in the first Chinese family with CHMP2B‑FTD, predicting truncation that removes part of exon 6; clinical presentation included behavioral onset and frontotemporal atrophy (Mol Genet Genomic Med, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/mgg3.2222) (li2023anovelsplice‐site pages 3-4).
- Mutation‑specific cellular phenotypes:
  • T104N (associated with ALS‑predominant phenotypes) relocalizes CHMP2B from MVB‑like structures to Golgi‑associated aggregates and inhibits neuronal process elongation; aggregation co‑localizes with GM130 and ubiquitin (Neurology International, Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/neurolint15030063) (shirai2023ftdalstype7associated pages 4-6).
  • D148Y (FTD‑linked) accumulates at the Golgi, triggers Golgi stress signaling (↓Hsp47, ↑Arf4), and blunts neurite elongation; rescuable by Hsp47 overexpression or Arf4 knockdown, nominating Golgi stress modulators as therapeutic targets (Current Issues in Molecular Biology, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46020090) (fukatsu2024modulatinggolgistress pages 1-2).
- Endolysosomal/autophagy dysfunction and proteinopathy: ESCRT‑III impairment by CHMP2B mutations is linked to accumulation of autophagic structures, defective endosome‑to‑lysosome fusion, and lysosomal repair responses; CHMP2B‑FTD often lacks classic cytoplasmic TDP‑43 inclusions despite ubiquitin/p62 pathology (Nucleus, 2024; review) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 9-10).

6) Clinical biomarkers and natural history (applications and real‑world data)
- CSF endo‑lysosomal/proteostasis markers in a genetically homogeneous Danish pedigree: Targeted PRM‑MS in 31 family members (11 symptomatic, 7 presymptomatic carriers, 13 controls) showed lower CSF ubiquitin, cathepsin B (CTSB), and APP, with higher complement C9, lysozyme, and transcobalamin II (TCN2) in mutation carriers. Some markers correlated with CSF/serum ratios, suggesting peripheral contributions; authors hypothesize intracellular sequestration/altered exosome trafficking as a basis for reduced CSF ubiquitin. Neurofilament light (NfL) rises in CSF/serum several years before onset (Alzheimer’s & Dementia: DADM, Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/dad2.12402) (toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 1-2, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 5-6, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 2-3, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 6-7).
- Natural history in six generations (Danish FTD‑3 pedigree): Mean age at onset 58.9 years (SD 5.9), mean time from onset to institutionalization 5.7 years (SD 3.7), and to death 10.0 years (SD 7.1), with high variability. Elevated mortality (HR 3.84, p<0.0001). Modifiers included earlier onset with higher education and daily alcohol use; paternal transmission associated with earlier onset in women; ApoE ε4/ε4 associated with delayed institutionalization (Acta Neurol Scand, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13578) (roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 9-13, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 13-18, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 1-9).
- Network physiology: EEG microstate analysis (fronto‑parietal network; “microstate D”) showed a biphasic change—prolonged duration early after symptom onset then reduced duration later—consistent with evolving fronto‑parietal network dysfunction in CHMP2B‑FTD (Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, Sep 2021; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.714220) (musaeus2021corticalfrontoparietalnetwork pages 1-2).

7) Expert opinions and authoritative syntheses (2023–2024)
- 2024 review (Nucleus) emphasizes that ESCRT‑III (including CHMP2B) underpins nuclear envelope surveillance/repair and endolysosomal trafficking in human neurons and that CHMP2B mutations produce truncated proteins, enlarged endosomes, and autophagy defects, clarifying mechanisms for FTD/ALS without canonical TDP‑43 pathology (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1080/19491034.2024.2349085) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3, keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 9-10).
- 2024 mechanistic advance: CHMP2B K6 methylation by SMYD2 is a tunable PTM that gates ESCRT‑III polymerization and abscission timing, and also affects HIV‑1 budding—providing a new regulatory axis with potential therapeutic leverage (May 2024; Nature Communications; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47717-3) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2).
- 2024 autophagy‑lysosome perspective: Autophagy‑lysosomal defects, including those from ESCRT‑III perturbation (e.g., CHMP2B), are central in neurodegeneration and aging brains (Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00757-5) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3).

8) Translational directions and current applications
- Biomarker development: The 2023 CHMP2B family CSF study provides candidate endo‑lysosomal biomarkers (C9, lysozyme, TCN2, ubiquitin, CTSB, APP) for presymptomatic and symptomatic stages, complementing NfL; relationships with CSF/serum ratios guide interpretation of central vs peripheral sources (Alzheimer’s & Dementia: DADM, Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/dad2.12402) (toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 1-2, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 5-6).
- Genetic counseling and prognosis: The six‑generation cohort quantifies onset, progression, and survival distributions and potential modifiers, informing counseling and clinical trial design in CHMP2B‑FTD (Acta Neurol Scand, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13578) (roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 9-13, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 13-18).
- Potential therapeutic targets:
  • SMYD2–CHMP2B K6 methylation axis to restore/retime ESCRT‑III polymerization in cytokinesis‑related contexts and potentially in other ESCRT‑dependent neuronal processes (Nature Communications, 2024) (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2).
  • Golgi stress pathway modifiers (Hsp47 upregulation; Arf4 downregulation) rescue neurite phenotypes induced by FTD‑linked CHMP2B mutants (Current Issues in Molecular Biology, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46020090) (fukatsu2024modulatinggolgistress pages 1-2).

9) Quantitative highlights (recent statistics and data)
- CSF proteomic panel in CHMP2B‑FTD: Relative decreases in ubiquitin, APP, CTSB; increases in complement C9, lysozyme, TCN2; NfL increases years pre‑onset (DADM, Jan 2023) (toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 1-2, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 5-6, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 2-3, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 6-7).
- Natural history metrics in Danish CHMP2B‑FTD: mean age at onset 58.9 years; mean onset→institutionalization 5.7 years; mean onset→death 10.0 years; HR for mortality 3.84 (Acta Neurol Scand, Jan 2022) (roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 9-13, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 13-18, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 1-9).
- Neuronal cell biology: CHMP2B T104N mutation shifts localization to Golgi aggregates and impairs neurite outgrowth; D148Y similarly perturbs Golgi stress signaling and morphology, with rescue by Hsp47/Arf4 modulation (Aug 2023; Feb 2024) (shirai2023ftdalstype7associated pages 4-6, fukatsu2024modulatinggolgistress pages 1-2).

10) Verification of identity and domain alignment
- All cited sources explicitly refer to human CHMP2B, an ESCRT‑III/SNF7 family protein operating in the endolysosomal and membrane scission pathways; no evidence was found for conflicting gene symbols/organisms. These align with the UniProt record (Q9UQN3; Homo sapiens; SNF7 family) provided in the prompt (Nucleus, 2024; Human Molecular Genetics, 2020) (keeley2024nuclearanddegradative pages 1-3, fortaznar2020retrovirusreactivationin pages 14-15).

Notes on scope and limitations
- Some mechanistic details (e.g., direct structural data specific to human CHMP2B polymers) are better established for other ESCRT‑III subunits; where needed we referenced authoritative reviews integrating ESCRT‑III assembly mechanisms that include CHMP2B’s role. The 2023–2024 primary advances most directly specific to CHMP2B include K6 methylation (SMYD2) and new mutation‑linked neuronal phenotypes and subcellular mislocalization (T104N, D148Y), plus biomarker and natural‑history data in the Danish pedigree (richard2024methylationofescrtiii pages 1-2, shirai2023ftdalstype7associated pages 4-6, fukatsu2024modulatinggolgistress pages 1-2, toft2023endo‐lysosomalproteinconcentrations pages 1-2, roos2022sixgenerationsof pages 9-13).
