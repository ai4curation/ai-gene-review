### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P56524
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Histone deacetylase 4 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:10220385}; Short=HD4; EC=3.5.1.98 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10220385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523670, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12032081};
- **Gene Information:** Name=HDAC4 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:14063}; Synonyms=KIAA0288;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the histone deacetylase family. HD type 2
- **Key Domains:** HDAC4/5/7/9. (IPR046949); HDACs. (IPR000286); His_deacetylse_dom. (IPR023801); His_deacetylse_dom_sf. (IPR037138); Hist_deacetylase_Gln_rich_N. (IPR024643)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HDAC4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HDAC4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HDAC4** (gene ID: HDAC4, UniProt: P56524) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human HDAC4 (UniProt P56524)

Plan and verification
- Identity/domain verification: HDAC4 is a human class IIa histone deacetylase with an N‑terminal regulatory region (containing MEF2-binding, NLS, and phospho‑14‑3‑3 sites) and a C‑terminal histone deacetylase domain that includes an NES; these features and its assignment to class IIa HDACs are consistently described in recent reviews (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) and broader class IIa syntheses (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061). (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 3-4)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition and classification: HDAC4 is a zinc‑dependent histone deacetylase of the class IIa subfamily (HDAC4/5/7/9). Class IIa HDACs are distinguished by an N‑terminal transcriptional regulatory/scaffolding region (interacting with MEF2 and corepressors) and a C‑terminal deacetylase domain; they undergo regulated nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Catalytic hallmark: Vertebrate class IIa HDACs, including HDAC4, harbor a Tyr→His substitution in the catalytic tyrosine of the deacetylase active site, markedly reducing intrinsic activity toward ε‑acetyl‑lysine and contributing to their frequent description as “pseudoenzymes.” (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 4-7)
- Corepressor coupling: Owing to low intrinsic activity, HDAC4 commonly functions within corepressor assemblies that include HDAC3 bound to NCoR/SMRT, which provide robust deacetylase catalytic function. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Enzymology and structure-focused insights: 2024 structural/computational reviews catalog human HDAC classes and active‑site architecture, contextualizing class IIa active‑site differences and inhibitor design trends across HDACs. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17050620) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 36-37)
- HDAC4 regulation in inflammation/metabolism: A 2024 focused review synthesizes HDAC4’s tissue expression (brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, macrophages), weak intrinsic catalytic activity, activation via HDAC3/NCoR–SMRT complexes, and detailed post‑translational regulation of nucleo‑cytoplasmic shuttling. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Cardiovascular/neuro contexts for HDAC inhibition: 2024 systematic and perspective reviews report continuing translational interest in HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) for myocardial infarction and for fibrotic/inflammatory diseases, with discussion of expanding indications (including a recent approval of the pan‑HDAC inhibitor givinostat for Duchenne muscular dystrophy). (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797; Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14121605) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18)

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Therapeutic use of HDACi beyond oncology: A 2024 perspective highlights the FDA approval of givinostat (a pan‑HDAC inhibitor) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and surveys non‑oncology development (fibrotic/inflammatory indications). While not isoform‑selective for HDAC4, this represents a real‑world precedent for systemic HDAC modulation relevant to HDAC4‑regulated pathways (myogenesis, muscle inflammation). (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14121605) ()
- Cardiovascular research translation: A 2024 systematic review across 18 preclinical AMI studies found multiple HDAC inhibitors (e.g., TSA, SAHA, VPA, mocetinostat, givinostat, entinostat, apicidin, RGFP966) improved ventricular function and reduced infarct size/remodeling; the review cautions about bias and the translational gap to clinical practice. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Class IIa as signal transducers/pseudoenzymes: Expert synthesis emphasizes class IIa HDACs function primarily as regulated transcriptional coregulators and signal transducers with limited intrinsic deacetylase activity due to the Tyr→His substitution, relying on recruitment of catalytically active deacetylases (e.g., HDAC3). (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 1-3, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 4-7, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 3-4)
- Metabolic and inflammatory roles: An endocrine/metabolism review (2024) concludes HDAC4’s context‑dependent signaling via non‑histone targets and transcription factors (e.g., MEF2, HIF, STAT1, FOXO family) underlies impacts on insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, cardiac development, and macrophage‑mediated inflammation. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Quantified regulatory phosphosites: Phosphorylation at S265/S266 (CaMKII sites) promotes nuclear export and/or dimerization with HDAC5; phosphorylation at S245, S467, and S632 creates 14‑3‑3 docking motifs that drive cytoplasmic sequestration; PP2A‑mediated dephosphorylation of S298 promotes nuclear import. These sites are repeatedly reported in recent syntheses of HDAC4 regulation. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Pathway‑level outcomes with HDACi in cardiovascular models: 18 preclinical AMI studies summarized improvements in ventricular function and infarct size with HDACi; while not HDAC4‑selective, these aggregate effects provide translational context for HDAC4‑linked cardiac pathways. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18)

Functional annotation of HDAC4
- Primary molecular function and enzymology: HDAC4 is a Zn2+‑dependent lysine deacetylase by family classification, but in vertebrates it exhibits very low intrinsic activity toward ε‑acetyl‑lysine because histidine substitutes for the canonical catalytic tyrosine in the active site (HDAC4 Tyr976→His). Structural analyses rationalize reduced transition‑state stabilization and substrate processing. Functionally, HDAC4 typically represses transcription by scaffolding DNA‑bound factors (especially MEF2) and recruiting corepressors (NCoR/SMRT) that include HDAC3, which provides the principal deacetylase activity in these complexes. (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061; May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 4-7, kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Substrate specificity: Direct, robust deacetylation of histone ε‑acetyl‑lysine by isolated vertebrate HDAC4 is weak; in cellular contexts, deacetylation attributable to HDAC4 generally reflects activity of associated HDAC3 within NCoR/SMRT complexes, while HDAC4’s N‑terminus provides sequence‑specific transcription factor targeting (e.g., MEF2). Definitive, broadly accepted non‑histone substrates exclusively catalyzed by human HDAC4 in vivo remain limited; several reviews emphasize its role as a recruiter/scaffold rather than a stand‑alone deacetylase. (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 1-3, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 4-7)

Cellular localization and regulation
- Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling: HDAC4 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm. N‑terminal serine phosphorylation creates 14‑3‑3 docking motifs (e.g., pS245/pS467/pS632) that sequester HDAC4 in the cytoplasm and activate the C‑terminal NES for CRM1‑dependent export; pharmacologic CRM1 inhibition (e.g., leptomycin B) drives nuclear accumulation. Ca2+/CaMK signaling and PKD family kinases phosphorylate these motifs and promote export; PP2A dephosphorylation at S298 facilitates nuclear import. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Transcriptional repression via MEF2: HDAC4’s N‑terminus binds MEF2, displacing coactivators and recruiting NCoR/SMRT–HDAC3 complexes to MEF2 sites, thereby repressing MEF2‑dependent myogenic and neuronal gene programs. Phosphorylation‑triggered 14‑3‑3 binding leads to dissociation/export, relieving repression. (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 3-4)

Pathway contexts and tissue roles
- Skeletal and cardiac muscle: HDAC4–MEF2 repression is a key checkpoint in myogenesis; CaMK‑dependent export of HDAC4 relieves repression and enables differentiation/oxidative gene expression. Cardiovascular reviews underscore HDAC family involvement in remodeling and infarct response; although pan‑HDACi are active, isoform‑specific physiological roles (e.g., HDAC4 shuttling) shape transcription during stress and recovery. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 9-11)
- Neurons: HDAC4 is highly expressed in brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum), dynamically shuttles in activity‑dependent signaling, and represses MEF2‑dependent neuroprotective/neuronal differentiation programs when nuclear. (2025 thesis synthesizing human data) (lowe2025investigatingtherole pages 25-28)
- Endothelium and metabolism: Class IIa members (including HDAC4) regulate endothelial functions (angiogenesis, immune responses) and, in metabolic tissues, influence insulin signaling and glucose handling via interactions with FOXO family and other factors. (Mar 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2023.1091794; May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)

Chemical probes, inhibitors, and translational status (emphasis on 2023–2024)
- Inhibitor landscape: 2024–2025 medicinal chemistry and structural reviews summarize HDAC inhibitor pharmacophores (hydroxamic acids, ortho‑aminoanilides, etc.) and design considerations across HDAC classes; however, clinically deployed agents remain largely pan‑ or class‑biased rather than HDAC4‑selective. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17050620) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 36-37)
- Clinical implementation beyond cancer: An authoritative 2024 perspective notes givinostat’s FDA approval for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and expanding non‑oncology exploration of HDAC inhibition in fibrotic/inflammatory disease, providing real‑world relevance for HDAC4‑regulated pathways though not isoform‑selective. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14121605) ()
- Cardiovascular preclinical evidence: Systematic review (2024) reports improved ventricular function and smaller infarcts with HDACi across 18 animal AMI studies, while highlighting bias and the need for rigorous clinical translation. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18)

Caveats and open questions (evidence‑based)
- Isoform‑selective pharmacology: Despite intense efforts, robustly HDAC4‑selective small‑molecule deacetylase inhibitors remain limited; many tools are pan‑HDAC or class‑biased. Class IIa biology also involves scaffolding that may not be fully addressed by catalytic inhibition alone. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17050620; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061) (curcio2024thehistonedeacetylase pages 36-37, brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 1-3)
- Catalysis vs scaffolding: Multiple recent syntheses emphasize HDAC4’s low intrinsic deacetylase activity and reliance on HDAC3 within NCoR/SMRT; thus, functional outcomes often reflect complex assembly and localization state rather than HDAC4 catalysis per se. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)

Summary
- Verified identity: HDAC4 (P56524) is a human class IIa HDAC with hallmark N‑terminal regulatory/MEF2‑binding regions and a C‑terminal HDAC domain; it shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm under kinase‑ and 14‑3‑3–dependent control. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Mechanism: Due to a Tyr→His active‑site substitution, HDAC4 has weak intrinsic ε‑acetyl‑lysine deacetylase activity and commonly represses transcription through MEF2 targeting and recruitment of NCoR/SMRT–HDAC3 complexes that supply catalytic activity. (Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15081061; May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 4-7, kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Localization/regulation: CaMK/PKD phosphorylation of N‑terminal serines creates 14‑3‑3 docking, activates CRM1‑dependent export (blocked by leptomycin B), whereas PP2A dephosphorylation promotes nuclear import; specific sites include S245, S265/S266, S298, S467, S632. (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2023.0174) (kang2024rolesofhistone pages 3-5)
- Applications: Although HDAC4‑selective drugs remain a challenge, HDAC pathway modulation has entered practice (e.g., givinostat in DMD), and preclinical cardiovascular evidence with HDACi is encouraging yet preliminary for clinical translation. (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14121605; Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13247797) (brancolini2025classiiahdacs pages 17-18)
