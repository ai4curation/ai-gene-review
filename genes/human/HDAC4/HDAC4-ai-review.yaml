description: HDAC4 is a class IIa histone deacetylase that functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor by bridging DNA-binding transcription factors (especially MEF2 family) to the enzymatically active HDAC3/NCoR/SMRT corepressor complex. Due to a Tyr->His substitution in the active site (H803 in human HDAC4), class IIa HDACs including HDAC4 have intrinsically weak deacetylase activity toward acetylated lysines. HDAC4 undergoes regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling controlled by phosphorylation at serine residues (S246, S467, S632) and subsequent 14-3-3 protein binding. When phosphorylated, HDAC4 is sequestered in the cytoplasm; dephosphorylation allows nuclear import where it can repress transcription. HDAC4 plays important roles in skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation, neuronal function, and metabolic regulation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: HDAC4 belongs to the class IIa HDAC family and possesses a histone deacetylase catalytic domain. However, due to a conserved Tyr->His substitution in the active site, HDAC4 has markedly reduced intrinsic deacetylase activity toward acetyl-lysine substrates compared to class I HDACs. PMID:11804585 demonstrated that HDAC4 enzymatic activity depends on association with HDAC3/NCoR/SMRT complex. PMID:18614528 provided structural evidence for the low intrinsic activity. Despite limited intrinsic activity, HDAC4 can still deacetylate substrates and the IBA annotation is phylogenetically valid.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While HDAC4 has weak intrinsic deacetylase activity, it is still classified as a histone deacetylase by family membership and does possess measurable deacetylase activity. The IBA annotation correctly reflects the conserved function across the phylogenetic group.

  review:
    summary: PMID:19071119 shows HDAC4 enhances HIF-1alpha transactivation by physically associating with HIF-1alpha and promoting dissociation from FIH-1 while increasing binding to p300. This is coactivator activity, not direct DNA-binding transcription factor activity. HDAC4 lacks any known sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and functions via protein-protein interactions with DNA-binding transcription factors.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation to GO:0001216 (DNA-binding transcription activator activity) is incorrect. GO:0003700 usage guidance explicitly states that proteins with enzymatic activity (like histone deacetylases) and no known DNA binding domain should be annotated to GO:0003712 (transcription coregulator activity) instead. PMID:19071119 demonstrates HDAC4 acts through protein-protein interactions with HIF-1alpha, promoting its transactivation by competing with FIH-1 binding and enhancing p300 recruitment - this is the mechanism of a transcription coactivator, not a DNA-binding transcription factor.

  review:
    summary: PMID:18850004 shows HDAC4 binds and reduces histone H3 acetylation at the Sp1/Sp3 binding site-rich p21 proximal promoter. The annotation has 'contributes_to' qualifier in the GOA file, which appropriately reflects that HDAC4 is recruited to chromatin through interaction with Sp1 rather than through direct sequence-specific DNA binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The 'contributes_to' qualifier is appropriate here because HDAC4 is recruited to the p21 promoter through its interaction with Sp1/Sp3, not through direct sequence-specific DNA binding. This is consistent with its function as a coregulator.

- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0003714
    label: transcription corepressor activity
  description: HDAC4 functions primarily as a transcriptional corepressor by bridging DNA-binding transcription factors (especially MEF2) to the enzymatically active HDAC3/NCoR/SMRT complex. Due to a Tyr->His substitution in the active site (H803), HDAC4 has very weak intrinsic deacetylase activity and relies on the HDAC3/NCoR/SMRT complex for catalytic function.
