description: >-
  Alpha-crystallin A chain (CRYAA/HSPB4) is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family
  that serves dual roles as a major structural component of the ocular lens and as a molecular
  chaperone with holdase activity. CRYAA forms large oligomeric complexes (approximately 540 kDa)
  that suppress nonspecific aggregation of destabilized proteins under stress conditions including
  heat, UV irradiation, and chemical modification (PMID:8943244). Critically, CRYAA acts as a
  holdase rather than a foldase -- it prevents aggregation of partially unfolded proteins but does
  NOT actively refold them (as documented by the NOT annotation to GO:0042026 protein refolding,
  ISS from bovine ortholog). CRYAA hetero-oligomerizes with CRYAB (HSPB5) and contributes to lens
  transparency and refractive index. Post-translational modifications including phosphorylation at
  T148 (mediated by mTORC2) regulate chaperone capacity. Mutations in CRYAA (e.g., R116H, R116C)
  cause autosomal dominant congenital cataracts through loss of chaperone activity and increased
  protein aggregation (PMID:18407550). CRYAA also has anti-apoptotic activity, binding and
  sequestering pro-apoptotic Bax and Bcl-X(S) proteins (PMID:14752512).

      IBA annotation for negative regulation of apoptotic process. CRYAA has well-documented
      anti-apoptotic activity. PMID:14752512 demonstrated that alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins
      bind to pro-apoptotic Bax and Bcl-X(S) proteins via GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation,
      preventing their translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during staurosporine-induced
      apoptosis. The R116C cataract mutant shows much weaker affinity to Bax and Bcl-X(S)
      (PMID:14752512). PMID:14512969 showed that the R49C mutant failed to protect lens epithelial
      cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically appropriate
      for sHSP family members with anti-apoptotic activity. This is a secondary/non-core function

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding. This is problematic for CRYAA. While some sHSP family
      members can assist in protein refolding (e.g., HSPB1/Hsp27 cooperates with Hsp70 to refold
      substrates), CRYAA specifically acts as a holdase that prevents aggregation but does NOT
      refold proteins. This is documented by the NOT annotation to GO:0042026 (ISS from bovine
      ortholog, GO_REF:0000024). The IBA propagation from the broader sHSP family is overly
      broad for CRYAA, which lacks foldase activity. PMID:19464326 showed that HSPB1 and HSPB5
      kept heat-unfolded substrates folding-competent, but HSPB7 did not support refolding,
      highlighting functional divergence within the family. CRYAA has holdase but not foldase
      activity.

      CRYAA is a holdase, not a foldase. It prevents aggregation of denatured proteins but does
      not refold them. The NOT annotation to GO:0042026 (ISS, GO_REF:0000024) explicitly
      documents this. The IBA propagation from the broader sHSP family is incorrect for CRYAA
      because not all sHSP members have refolding activity. There is functional divergence

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). CRYAA/HSPB4 does
      interact with partially unfolded/destabilized proteins, but the term "unfolded protein binding"
      is problematic because it implies a simple binding function rather than the active chaperone
      holdase activity that CRYAA performs. CRYAA suppresses nonspecific aggregation of destabilized
      proteins (PMID:8943244) but does NOT refold them -- it is a holdase, not a foldase. The IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically propagated from sHSP family members across Drosophila, zebrafish,
      and mammals, which is appropriate for the family-level chaperone function. However, the term
      itself needs replacement. GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the closest available MF term,
      defined as "Binding to a protein or a protein-containing complex to assist the protein folding
      process." This is an imperfect replacement because CRYAA specifically does NOT assist in protein
      folding -- it prevents aggregation (holdase activity). A dedicated holdase-specific GO term is
      needed. As a biological process annotation, GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" (defined as
      "Any process involved in maintaining the structure and integrity of a protein and preventing it
      from degradation or aggregation") is also relevant and is already annotated for CRYAA via
      PMID:12235146.
    action: MODIFY

      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. CRYAA has well-documented chaperone-like holdase activity:
      it suppresses aggregation of heat-denatured aldose reductase and singlet-oxygen-damaged
      gamma-crystallin (PMID:8943244). However, it does NOT refold proteins (NOT annotation to
      GO:0042026 protein refolding, ISS). The best available interim MF replacement is GO:0044183
      "protein folding chaperone," though this term is not ideal because its definition references
      "protein folding process" which is not what CRYAA does. A new holdase-specific term should be
      requested. GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" is appropriate as a BP term.

      "Protein binding" is too generic. The specific interaction is binding to pro-apoptotic
      Bax and Bcl-X(S) to sequester them and prevent apoptosis. This is better captured by
      the negative regulation of apoptotic process annotation (GO:0043066) already present.

      NOT annotation for protein refolding (ISS from bovine ortholog via GO_REF:0000024). This
      is a critical annotation that explicitly states CRYAA does NOT perform protein refolding.
      CRYAA is a holdase chaperone that prevents aggregation of denatured proteins but does not
      actively refold them. This is consistent with all experimental evidence: PMID:8943244
      describes the chaperone-like activity as "the ability to suppress nonspecific aggregation"
      with no mention of refolding capability. PMID:19464326 showed functional divergence among
      sHSP family members -- HSPB1 and HSPB5 kept substrates folding-competent but HSPB7 did
      not support refolding. CRYAA (HSPB4), like HSPB7, is a holdase without foldase activity.
      Both this NOT annotation and the positive IBA annotation for GO:0042026 should be removed:
      the IBA positive assertion is incorrect for CRYAA, and the NOT annotation becomes redundant
      once the incorrect positive assertion is removed.

      The paper explicitly defines this as "chaperone-like activity" meaning the ability to suppress
      nonspecific aggregation of destabilized proteins. The C-terminal truncation mutant (R157STOP)
      showed markedly reduced chaperone-like activity despite preserved secondary structure, confirming
      that the C-terminal region is essential for the holdase function. The experimental evidence
      clearly supports that CRYAA binds partially denatured proteins and prevents their aggregation,
      which is holdase (not foldase) activity. The term GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the

    CRYAA (HSPB4) is a small heat shock protein that functions as an ATP-independent

    that suppress nonspecific aggregation of proteins destabilized by heat, UV irradiation,
    and chemical modification. CRYAA does NOT actively refold substrates (documented by
    NOT annotation to GO:0042026 protein refolding). It maintains denatured proteins in a
    soluble, non-aggregated state. The C-terminal extension is essential for chaperone
    activity, and the T148 phosphorylation site (mediated by mTORC2) regulates chaperone
    capacity. Disease-causing mutations (R116C, R116H, R49C, F71L) impair chaperone
    holdase activity and cause congenital cataracts.

        The alphaA-crystallin (CRYAA) gene encodes a member of the small-heat-shock
        protein (sHSP) family of molecular chaperones and is primarily and abundantly
        expressed in the ocular lens.

        the major lenticular protein chaperones, alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin,
        increased the solubility of the T5P gamma C-crystallin both in vitro and in
        transfected cells.
