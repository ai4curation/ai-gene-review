## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P08195
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Amino acid transporter heavy chain SLC3A2 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain {ECO:0000303|PubMed:3476959}; Short=4F2hc {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11557028}; AltName: Full=4F2 heavy chain antigen {ECO:0000303|PubMed:3036867}; AltName: Full=Lymphocyte activation antigen 4F2 large subunit {ECO:0000303|PubMed:3480538}; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 3 member 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12270127}; AltName: CD_antigen=CD98;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SLC3A2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:11026}; Synonyms=MDU1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SLC3A transporter family. .
- **Key Domains:** Glyco_hydro_13_cat_dom. (IPR006047); Glyco_hydro_b. (IPR013780); Glycoside_hydrolase_SF. (IPR017853); SLC3A2. (IPR042280); SLC3A2_N. (IPR031984)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SLC3A2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SLC3A2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SLC3A2** (gene ID: SLC3A2, UniProt: P08195) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research plan verification and scope
- Identity and aliases: The human gene SLC3A2 encodes the type II transmembrane glycoprotein CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc; also known as 4F2hc/4F2 antigen), which is the ancillary (heavy) subunit of multiple heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs). Authoritative 2024 reviews and structural studies consistently use these aliases and functions for human SLC3A2 (https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4, May 2024). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Organism: Homo sapiens is correct for the research summarized below (same sources as above). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)
- Domain/family note: Recent structural and biochemical literature define SLC3A2/CD98hc as a glycosylated type II membrane protein that forms disulfide-linked HATs with SLC7 light chains; there is no evidence that CD98hc is a glycoside hydrolase. Thus, any glycoside-hydrolase domain annotations are likely incongruent with current structural biology of SLC3A2. (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2, rullotubau2024structureandmechanisms pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- CD98hc/SLC3A2 is the heavy chain component of heteromeric amino acid transporters that covalently pair (via a conserved disulfide) with SLC7 family light chains to enable amino acid transport; CD98hc functions as an essential chaperone/scaffold required for light-chain trafficking and activity at the plasma membrane. It also associates with integrins and modulates outside-in signaling. 2024 reviews and structures reaffirm these roles (Park 2024 review, URL: https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749; Wu et al., Nature Communications 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Canonical light-chain partners include LAT1 (SLC7A5) and LAT2 (SLC7A8), which mediate Na+-independent exchange of large neutral amino acids; additional partners include Asc-1 (SLC7A10) and others. 2024 cryo-EM of Asc-1/CD98hc further defines substrate specificity and transport mode for the Asc-1 complex. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47385-3, Apr 2024). (rullotubau2024structureandmechanisms pages 1-2, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)

2) Molecular function and substrate specificity
- LAT1–CD98hc (SLC7A5–SLC3A2) is a major route for essential large neutral amino acids (e.g., leucine, phenylalanine) and certain drugs; the complex is disulfide-linked (LAT1-C210 to CD98hc-C164) and its assembly and regulation involve specific lipids and post-translational modifications. Wu et al. (2024) demonstrate super-dimerization (LAT1–CD98hc)2, identify four bound phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids at the LAT1 interface, and show regulation of LAT1 palmitoylation by CD98hc R183 impacting transport complex behavior (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4, May 2024). (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)
- Asc-1–CD98hc (SLC7A10–SLC3A2) uniquely supports facilitated diffusion of small neutral amino acids and efficiently transports glycine and D-serine (key NMDAR co-agonists), as resolved by cryo-EM structures (3.4–3.8 Å) and functional assays in 2024 (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47385-3, Apr 2024). Key residues Ser246 and Tyr333 in SLC7A10 determine substrate recognition and exchange versus facilitated-diffusion transport modes. (rullotubau2024structureandmechanisms pages 1-2)
- CD98hc acts as an essential ancillary subunit: it is not the catalytic transporter but is required for surface expression and stability of SLC7 light chains (review synthesis, URL: https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749, Apr 2024). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)

3) Subcellular localization and structural/biophysical features
- Localization: CD98hc-containing HATs are dynamically present at the plasma membrane and in lysosomes; Wu et al. (2024) validate the presence and assembly dynamics of LAT1–CD98hc at both locations, and show pH-sensitive super-dimerization influenced by N-glycans on CD98hc (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4, May 2024). (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)
- Disulfide linkage and glycosylation: CD98hc forms a conserved disulfide bond with SLC7 partners and is a glycosylated type II transmembrane glycoprotein; complex N-glycans modulate assembly and super-dimer behavior (Park 2024; Wu 2024). (https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Higher-order assembly and lipid regulation: Native MS and mass photometry demonstrate LAT1–CD98hc super-dimerization; four endogenous PE lipids stabilize interfaces and influence nearby LAT1 palmitoylation sites, linking membrane lipid composition and PTM cross-talk to transporter regulation (Wu 2024). (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)

4) Signaling roles and pathway integration
- Integrin signaling: CD98hc directly associates with β integrins (e.g., β1/β3) and modulates adhesion-dependent signaling (FAK/PI3K-ERK/AKT), contributing to proliferation, survival, and oncogenic phenotypes in multiple models (reviewed in Park 2024). (https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Amino-acid sensing and mTORC1: By partnering with LAT1, CD98hc supports leucine uptake that feeds mTORC1 activation, coupling nutrient transport to growth signaling. The review synthesis highlights LAT1–CD98hc involvement in mTOR-linked tumor biology and therapeutic targeting (Park 2024). (https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)

5) Disease relevance, applications, and real-world implementations
- Oncology biomarker and target: Elevated CD98hc expression is reported across several human cancers and is linked to malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis in multiple settings (Park 2024 overview, Apr 2024). (https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC): A 2023 preclinical study in colorectal cancer showed that an anti-CD98hc ADC recognizing the ectodomain internalizes to lysosomes, is potently cytotoxic to tumor cells, spares normal colon organoids, and suppresses tumor growth in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models—supporting CD98hc as an actionable surface target (J Exp Clin Cancer Res, Aug 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-023-02784-0). (montero2023anaminoacid pages 1-2)

6) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- High-resolution structural advances (2024):
  • LAT1–CD98hc complex: Super-dimerization, PE lipid binding, glycan modulation, and lysosomal/plasma membrane localization dynamics were defined by native MS, mass photometry, lipidomics, and mutagenesis (Nature Communications, May 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4). (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)
  • Asc-1–CD98hc complex: Cryo-EM structures clarified substrate binding determinants and the unique capacity for facilitated diffusion of glycine/D-serine (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47385-3). (rullotubau2024structureandmechanisms pages 1-2)
- Translational oncology (2023):
  • Anti-CD98hc ADC in colorectal cancer advanced preclinical validation across cells, organoids, and PDXs, indicating a feasible therapeutic window (J Exp Clin Cancer Res, Aug 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-023-02784-0). (montero2023anaminoacid pages 1-2)
- Broad expert synthesis (2024):
  • Park 2024 summarizes CD98hc’s integrated roles in amino acid transport complexes and integrin signaling, their links to mTOR and tumor progression, and therapeutic strategies (Histology and Histopathology, Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-749). (park2024theroleof pages 2-3, park2024theroleof pages 8-8, park2024theroleof pages 1-2)

7) Quantitative and clinical data (selected recent examples)
- CRC expression and ADC efficacy: Tumor-versus-normal analyses revealed significantly higher CD98hc expression in colorectal cancer tissues; the anti-CD98hc ADC showed strong anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, with tumor organoids being sensitive and normal colon organoids largely spared (J Exp Clin Cancer Res, Aug 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-023-02784-0). (montero2023anaminoacid pages 1-2)
- Structural quantitation and mechanistic determinants: Native MS/mass photometry provide stoichiometric evidence for LAT1–CD98hc super-dimers, and lipidomics resolves bound PE lipids; mutational analyses pinpoint residues (e.g., CD98hc R183; LAT1 C187/C210) orchestrating lipid–PTM regulation and disulfide linkage (Nature Communications, May 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47948-4). (wu2024thecompleteassembly pages 1-2)

Expert analysis and interpretation
- Converging structural and functional data establish SLC3A2/CD98hc as a central organizer of amino-acid transporter machineries and as an integrin-associated modulator of growth signaling. The 2024 structural studies move the field beyond a “static chaperone” model toward dynamic, lipid- and glycan-tuned assemblies that traffic between plasma membrane and lysosomes, providing new regulatory levers for pharmacology (e.g., interfering with super-dimerization or lipid/PTM cross-talk). In oncology, surface exposure, tumor-enriched expression, and efficient internalization underpin the rationale for anti-CD98hc ADCs; the 2023 CRC data demonstrate preclinical efficacy and selectivity needed for translation. Together, these insights support dual lines of translation: direct tumor targeting (e.g., ADCs) and indirect metabolic targeting via SLC7 partners (e.g., LAT1-directed strategies), with mTORC1 linkage providing pharmacodynamic readouts.
