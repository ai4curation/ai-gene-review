description: 'SLC3A2 (also known as 4F2hc, CD98 heavy chain) encodes the essential
  heavy chain subunit of heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs). It functions
  as a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that forms disulfide-linked heterodimers
  with various SLC7 family light chain transporters (SLC7A5/LAT1, SLC7A6/y+LAT2, SLC7A7/y+LAT1,
  SLC7A8/LAT2, SLC7A10/Asc-1, SLC7A11/xCT). SLC3A2 acts as a chaperone essential for
  the trafficking, plasma membrane localization, and stability of these light chain
  partners, which provide the actual catalytic transport activity. The SLC3A2/SLC7A5
  (LAT1) complex mediates Na+-independent transport of large neutral amino acids (leucine,
  phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) and is critical for mTORC1 activation. The
  SLC3A2/SLC7A11 (xCT) complex functions as the cystine/glutamate antiporter system
  xc-, important for glutathione synthesis and protection against ferroptosis. SLC3A2
  also modulates integrin signaling independently of its transport functions. High-resolution
  cryo-EM structures have elucidated the molecular architecture of these complexes.
