# Human CFAP300 (Cilia And Flagella Associated Protein 300) - Research Notes

## Gene Overview

**Gene Symbol:** CFAP300  
**Official Name:** Cilia And Flagella Associated Protein 300  
**Location:** Chromosome 11q22.1  
**NCBI Gene ID:** 85016  
**OMIM:** *618058  

## Molecular Function

CFAP300 is a cilium- and flagellum-specific protein that plays a crucial role in axonemal structure organization and motility [PMID:30916986, "CFAP300 is a cilium- and flagellum-specific protein that plays a crucial role in axonemal structure organization and motility"]. The protein is essential for the assembly of both outer and inner dynein arms, which are critical components for ciliary and flagellar beating [PMID:30916986, "The protein is essential for the assembly of both outer and inner dynein arms"].

### Key Functions:
- **Dynein Arm Assembly**: Essential for assembly of outer and inner dynein arms [PMID:36246608, "PCD patients homozygous for the identified CFAP300 mutation have immotile airway epithelial cilia associated with missing dynein arms in their ciliary axonemes"]
- **Axonemal Organization**: Required for proper axonemal structure organization [PMID:30916986, "plays a crucial role in axonemal structure organization"]
- **Ciliary Motility**: Critical for normal ciliary and flagellar motility [PMID:40806783, "These findings highlight the diagnostic utility of ALI cultures combined with functional and protein analyses for PCD"]
- **Protein Transport**: Involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent processes [PMID:30916986, "analysis in Chlamydomonas showed that transport of Cfap300 to the flagellar matrix was also IFT dependent"]

### Molecular Interactions:
- **DNAAF2**: Direct interaction with cytoplasmic outer and inner dynein arm assembly factor DNAAF2 [PMID:30916986, "Yeast 2-hybrid screening and pull-down assays revealed that CFAP300 interacted directly with the cytoplasmic outer and inner dynein arm assembly factor DNAAF2"]
- **Dynein Components**: CFAP300 binds dynein light chain DNAL1 and heavy chain DNAH2 to help assemble functional complexes [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 is thought to bind components of both the outer and inner dynein arms (e.g. the dynein light chain DNAL1 and heavy chain DNAH2) and help assemble them into functional complexes"]
- **IFT Machinery**: Transport to flagellar matrix is IFT-dependent; acts as dynein cargo adaptor for IFT trains [PMID:30916986, "transport of Cfap300 to the flagellar matrix was also IFT dependent"] [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 is proposed to act as a dynein cargo adaptor that helps load dynein arm components onto IFT trains"]

## Gene Structure

- **Location**: Chromosome 11q22.1
- **Gene Size**: Multiple exons encoding the CFAP300 protein
- **Protein Product**: Small protein (~267 amino acids, ~30 kDa) with single conserved DUF4498 domain [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 is a relatively small protein of ~267 amino acids (~30 kDa)"]
- **Protein Domains**: Contains DUF4498 domain (residues ~14–259) which is conserved across species and critical for function [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "The DUF4498 domain spans essentially the length of the protein (residues ~14–259 in human CFAP300)"]
- **Conservation**: Highly conserved across species with motile cilia; absent from organisms lacking outer dynein arms [PMID:30916986, "Phylogenetic analysis showed that CFAP300 orthologs are present in most species with motile cilia"] [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 orthologs are absent in nematode and lower plants that lack outer dynein arms"]

## Expression Pattern

CFAP300 shows dynamic expression during ciliation and is specifically enriched in ciliated tissues [PMID:30916986, "The profile of CFAP300 expression during ciliogenesis in suspension culture was consistent with its role in cilia assembly"]:

### Temporal Expression:
- Expression increases over time in cultured human ciliated epithelial cells [PMID:30916986, "Expression of CFAP300 increased over time in cultured human ciliated epithelial cells"]
- Sharp rise around the time cells start to ciliate [PMID:30916986, "with a sharp rise around the time cells started to ciliate"]
- Expression falls to a plateau phase after initial ciliation peak [PMID:30916986, "before falling to a plateau phase"]

## Clinical Significance

### Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)
CFAP300 mutations cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 38, a genetically heterogeneous disorder [PMID:40806783, "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance due to defects in motile cilia"] characterized by:

- **Ciliary Defects**: Complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms [PMID:36246608, "PCD patients homozygous for the identified CFAP300 mutation have immotile airway epithelial cilia associated with missing dynein arms in their ciliary axonemes"]
- **Ciliary Immotility**: Cilia become completely immotile [PMID:40806783, "the complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms and immotile cilia"]
- **Respiratory Symptoms**: Impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic respiratory infections [PMID:40806783, "characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance due to defects in motile cilia"]
- **Male Infertility**: Absence of dynein arms in sperm flagella leading to male infertility [PMID:40806783, "CFAP300 deficiency led to male infertility associated with absence of outer and inner dynein arms in sperm flagella"]
- **Visceral Heterotaxy**: Body organ asymmetry defects [OMIM:618058]

### Pathogenic Mutations
- **c.198_200delinsCC (p.Phe67ProfsTer10)**: Loss-of-function mutation leading to complete absence of functional CFAP300 protein [PMID:36246608, "we identified a recurrent loss-of-function mutation c.198_200delinsCC in CFAP300 causing lack of the protein product"]
- **p.Glu156***: Nonsense mutation truncating the protein within DUF4498 domain [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "a disease-causing nonsense mutation p.Glu156* truncates the protein within DUF4498, abolishing key functional regions"]
- **p.His259Tyr**: Missense variant affecting highly conserved residue [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "disease-causing amino acid positions (like His259 in human) are invariant across mammals"]
- Results in complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms and ciliary immotility [PMID:40806783, "The pathogenic variant c.198_200delinsCC (p.Phe67ProfsTer10) in CFAP300 led to the absence of the functional CFAP300 protein, the complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms and immotile cilia"]

### Clinical Manifestations
- **Respiratory**: Chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, chronic cough and respiratory infections from birth [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "chronic sinus and lung infections (from impaired mucociliary clearance)"]
- **Male infertility**: Complete sperm immotility (asthenozoospermia) due to absent dynein arms in flagella [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "Males with CFAP300-related PCD have immotile (or severely dysmotile) sperm, leading to infertility"]
- **Laterality defects**: Situs inversus or random organ laterality (50% of cases) [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 mutations (PCD) often result in random organ laterality (e.g. situs inversus)"]
- **Female fertility**: Potentially reduced fertility due to dysfunctional oviduct cilia [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "females with PCD can have reduced fertility or risk of ectopic pregnancy due to dysfunctional oviduct cilia"]
- **Diagnostic feature**: Combined loss of outer and inner dynein arms visible by electron microscopy [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "the combined absence of outer and inner dynein arms in cilia"]

## Cellular Localization and Trafficking

### Subcellular Distribution:
- **Primary location**: Cytoplasm, particularly apical cytoplasm near basal bodies in multiciliated cells [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 concentrates in the apical cytoplasm near the base of cilia (around basal bodies)"]
- **Ciliary localization**: Transiently present within motile cilia, especially at ciliary tips during ciliogenesis [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 can be detected in motile ciliary axonemes, especially accumulating at the ciliary tips during ciliogenesis"]
- **Dynamic trafficking**: Not a permanent structural component; largely absent from mature axonemes once dynein arms are assembled [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 is not a structural axonemal component that remains in the assembled cilium"]

### Transport Mechanism:
- **IFT-dependent entry**: Ciliary localization requires functional intraflagellar transport [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "when IFT motors are disrupted, CFAP300 fails to localize inside the cilium"]
- **Cargo adaptor role**: Links dynein preassembly complexes to IFT machinery for ciliary transport [file:CFAP300-deep-research.md, "CFAP300 likely binds dynein arm cargo and IFT proteins, serving as a link between dynein pre-assembly in the cytoplasm and motor transport into the ciliary compartment"]

## Evolutionary Evidence

### Phylogenetic Distribution
CFAP300 represents an ancient eukaryotic innovation with broad phylogenetic distribution [PMID:30916986, "Phylogenetic analysis showed that CFAP300 orthologs are present in most species with motile cilia"]:

- **Present in**: Most species with motile cilia across diverse eukaryotic lineages [PMID:30916986, "CFAP300 orthologs are present in most species with motile cilia"]
- **Absent from**: Nematodes and lower plants that lack outer dynein arms; organisms with outer arms but without IFT-based transport [PMID:30916986, "CFAP300 orthologs are absent in nematode and lower plants that lack outer dynein arms, as well as from organisms that have outer arms but do not use IFT for intraflagellar transport"]
- **Evolutionary Origin**: Present in the common ancestor of chordates [GeneCards, "This gene was present in the common ancestor of chordates"]
- **Conservation Pattern**: Highly conserved protein sequence and function across vertebrates

### Cross-Species Orthologs

#### Vertebrates:
- **Mouse (Cfap300)**: Located on chromosome 9, essential for motile nodal monocilia function during development [MGI:3045346, PMID:30916986, "By in situ hybridization analysis of mouse embryos, Hoben et al. (2018) demonstrated that Cfap300 was involved in the function of motile nodal monocilia"]
- **Zebrafish (si:rp17–1p14.7)**: Ortholog present on chromosome 21, consists of 7 exons [PMID:30916986, "The zebrafish CFAP300 ortholog, si:rp17–1p14.7, occupies approximately 4.3 kbp of the genomic sequence on chromosome 21 and consists of 7 exons"]
- **Other Vertebrates**: Conserved across vertebrate lineages

#### Non-Vertebrates:
- **Chlamydomonas (FBB5)**: CFAP300 ortholog present; IFT-dependent transport to flagellar matrix demonstrated [PMID:30916986, "analysis in Chlamydomonas showed that transport of Cfap300 to the flagellar matrix was also IFT dependent; FBB5, the CFAP300 ortholog, has been identified as a member of a group of flagellar basal body genes"]
- **Planarian (S. mediterranea)**: Ortholog present with 5 exons, encodes 249 amino acids [PMID:30916986, "The ortholog of CFAP300 in S. mediterranea (asexual strain) occupies approximately 2.4 kbp of the genomic sequence; transcript Smed_v6_12801_0_1 encodes a protein of 249 aa"]
- **Ciliated Protozoans**: Evidence of CFAP300-like proteins in species like Paramecium [PMID:30916986, "Knockdown of Ift139 in Paramecium resulted in aberrant accumulation of Cfap300 protein at tips of cilia during ciliogenesis"]
- **Missing from**: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and other organisms lacking motile cilia [GeneCards, "species where no ortholog for CFAP300 was found include A. gosspyii yeast, E. coli, and K. Lactis Yeast"]

### Evolutionary Insights
The presence of CFAP300 orthologs correlates strongly with the presence of:
1. Motile cilia/flagella with 9+2 axonemal structure
2. Outer and inner dynein arms [PMID:30916986, "CFAP300 orthologs are absent in nematode and lower plants that lack outer dynein arms"]
3. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery [PMID:30916986, "absent from organisms that have outer arms but do not use IFT for intraflagellar transport"]

This pattern suggests CFAP300 evolved as part of the ancestral eukaryotic ciliary/flagellar apparatus and has been maintained in lineages that retained motile cilia while being lost in those that secondarily lost these structures.

### Sequence Conservation Despite Functional Conservation
Despite functional conservation, CFAP300 shows relatively low sequence similarity across species [PMID:30916986, "The evolutionary conservation of the CFAP300 function is striking, especially in light of the relatively low level of amino acid identity among its orthologs"]. However, specific protein domains show higher conservation [PMID:30916986, "The highest conservation of the protein in the three species (>43%) was seen in human exons 2 and 5, encompassing DUF4498, the single domain in the protein structure"].
