description: >-
  CFAP300 (formerly C11orf70) is a dynein axonemal assembly factor essential for the cytoplasmic
  preassembly and intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent trafficking of both outer and inner
  dynein arm complexes into motile cilia and flagella. The protein localizes predominantly to the
  cytoplasm where it participates in dynein arm assembly, with evidence of IFT-dependent movement
  along the ciliary axoneme. Loss-of-function mutations cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
  characterized by combined ODA+IDA loss, respiratory disease, laterality defects, and male
  infertility. CFAP300 interacts with the cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2 and belongs
  to the conserved CFAP300 protein family with a DUF4498 domain.

      CFAP300 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm where it functions in dynein arm
      preassembly. This is supported by multiple lines of evidence including immunofluorescence
      studies showing cytoplasmic localization in human airway epithelial cells [PMID:29727692,
      PMID:29727693] and model organism studies in Paramecium and Chlamydomonas [PMID:29727692].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is a core aspect of CFAP300 function, as the protein participates
      in the cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein arm complexes before their IFT-dependent transport
      into cilia. UniProt also annotates cytoplasmic localization based on sequence similarity
      to orthologs (ISS).

      CFAP300 shows IFT-dependent transport into cilia and accumulates at ciliary tips during
      ciliogenesis [PMID:29727692]. While the protein localizes mainly in the cytoplasm, a
      fraction is transported into the axoneme via intraflagellar transport.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although the primary site of CFAP300 function is in the cytoplasm (dynein preassembly),
      experimental evidence demonstrates IFT-dependent movement of the protein within cilia
      and accumulation at ciliary tips. This axonemal localization likely reflects the protein's
      role in IFT-dependent trafficking of assembled dynein complexes.

      This annotation is based on the interaction between CFAP300 and DNAAF2, a cytoplasmic
      ODA/IDA assembly factor [PMID:29727693]. While the interaction is experimentally
      validated, 'protein binding' is too generic to be informative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The term 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) provides no information about the actual
      function of CFAP300. The interaction with DNAAF2 is biologically meaningful and supports
      CFAP300's role in dynein arm preassembly, but this is better captured by process
      annotations (outer/inner dynein arm assembly) rather than a generic binding term.
      Curation guidelines recommend avoiding 'protein binding' in favor of more specific
      molecular function terms.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the precise molecular mechanism by which CFAP300 facilitates dynein arm
    preassembly? Does it function as a chaperone, scaffold, or adapter protein?
    Understanding the biochemical activity would enable more precise molecular function
    annotation. Current evidence shows interaction with DNAAF2 and requirement for dynein
    assembly, but the mechanism is unclear.
- question: >-
    Does CFAP300 have distinct roles in ODA versus IDA assembly, or does it function at
    a common step upstream of both? Both ODA and IDA are affected by CFAP300 loss,
    suggesting either a very upstream role or involvement in multiple parallel pathways.

- description: >-
