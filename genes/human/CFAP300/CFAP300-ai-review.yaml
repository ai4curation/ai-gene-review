  label: Homo sapiens
description: CFAP300 (Cilia And Flagella Associated Protein 300) is a small (~267
  amino acids) cytoplasmic protein essential for the assembly and transport of axonemal
  dynein arms. Functions as both a chaperone/assembly factor for dynein complexes
  and as a cargo adaptor linking dynein components to intraflagellar transport (IFT)
  machinery. Contains a conserved DUF4498 domain critical for protein-protein interactions.
  Mutations in CFAP300  cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 38 (CILD38), characterized
  by complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms, resulting in immotile cilia, chronic
  respiratory infections, male infertility, and laterality defects.

  findings:
  - statement: CFAP300 binds specific dynein components DNAL1 and DNAH2
    supporting_text: CFAP300 is thought to bind components of both the outer and inner
      dynein arms (e.g. the dynein light chain DNAL1 and heavy chain DNAH2) and help
      assemble them into functional complexes
  - statement: CFAP300 has chaperone-related functions in dynein assembly
    supporting_text: Studies indicate CFAP300 performs chaperone-related functions
      in the pre-assembly of dynein arms, likely stabilizing or folding dynein subunits

      defects
    supporting_text: Males with CFAP300-related PCD have immotile (or severely dysmotile)

  review:
    summary: DNAAF2 interaction supported by both publications but experimental details need verification
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:29727693 states "C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2" but publications don't detail experimental methods in abstracts. However, 'protein binding' is uninformative per curation guidelines. CFAP300 functions as an adapter/scaffolding protein for dynein arm assembly.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization directly supported by experimental evidence in publications
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:29727692 demonstrates that "Tagged C11orf70 in Paramecium and Chlamydomonas localizes mainly in the cytoplasm with a small amount in the ciliary component." PMID:29727693 confirms involvement in "cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms." This validates the sequence similarity inference.

  review:
    summary: Automated annotation based on keywords
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Too general - while technically correct that cilia are part of cytoskeleton,
      this annotation lacks specificity for CFAP300's actual functional location

  review:
    summary: Motile cilium localization confirmed by experimental evidence showing ciliary transport
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:29727692 shows "Tagged C11orf70...localizes mainly in the cytoplasm with a small amount in the ciliary component" and demonstrates "its transport within cilia is IFT dependent." Both papers show CFAP300 mutations cause "immotile respiratory cilia" confirming functional relevance to motile cilia.
