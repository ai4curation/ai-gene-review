  label: Homo sapiens
description: CFAP300 (Cilia And Flagella Associated Protein 300) is a small (~267
  amino acids) cytoplasmic protein essential for the assembly and transport of axonemal
  dynein arms. Functions as both a chaperone/assembly factor for dynein complexes
  and as a cargo adaptor linking dynein components to intraflagellar transport (IFT)
  machinery. Contains a conserved DUF4498 domain critical for protein-protein interactions.
  Mutations in CFAP300  cause Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 38 (CILD38), characterized
  by complete loss of outer and inner dynein arms, resulting in immotile cilia, chronic
  respiratory infections, male infertility, and laterality defects.
