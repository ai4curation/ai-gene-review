# Gene Function and Role 
CFAP300 (Cilia and Flagella Associated Protein 300), also known as C11orf70, DNAAF17 (Dynein Axonemal Assembly Factor 17), FBB5, or CILD38, encodes a small protein (~267 amino acids) essential for motile cilia and flagella function ([www.orpha.net](https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/gene/CFAP300?mode=name#:~:text=CFAP300%20,associated%20protein%20300)) ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/CFAP300#:~:text=CFAP300%20is%20a%20cilia,are%20essential%20for%20generating%20movement)). It is a **cilia/flagellum-specific protein** that contributes to axonemal structure organization and motility ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP300#:~:text=Cilium,%28%20CF300_HUMAN%2CQ9BRQ4)). In particular, CFAP300 is required for the proper assembly of the **axonemal dynein arms** – large motor protein complexes on ciliary microtubules that generate the forces for ciliary beating ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP300#:~:text=Cilium,%28%20CF300_HUMAN%2CQ9BRQ4)). Through this role, CFAP300 is critical for the movement of motile cilia in the respiratory airways, reproductive tract, and other tissues, as well as for sperm flagellar motility ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/CFAP300#:~:text=CFAP300%20is%20a%20cilia,are%20essential%20for%20generating%20movement)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=defective%20function%20of%20sperm%20flagellar%2C,OMIM%5D%3A%20244%20400%29.%2021)). Consistent with this function, loss-of-function mutations in CFAP300 cause *Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia* (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by immotile cilia leading to chronic respiratory infections, fertility issues, and organ laterality defects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Primary%20ciliary%20dyskinesia%20,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)). In summary, CFAP300 acts as a key **dynein-arm assembly factor** in the cytoplasm and is essential for building functional motile cilia and flagella ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)).

# Molecular Functions 
CFAP300’s molecular activity centers on facilitating the assembly and transport of axonemal dynein motor complexes. It has no known enzyme activity or obvious catalytic motifs; instead, it functions as a **protein interaction hub or co-chaperone** during dynein complex maturation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=cilia,Further%20studies%20are%20needed%20to)). Studies indicate CFAP300 performs “**chaperone-related functions**” in the pre-assembly of dynein arms, likely stabilizing or folding dynein subunits in concert with other co-factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)). In particular, CFAP300 is thought to bind components of both the outer and inner dynein arms (e.g. the dynein light chain DNAL1 and heavy chain DNAH2) and help assemble them into functional complexes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=cilia,Further%20studies%20are%20needed%20to)). Indeed, a truncating mutation in CFAP300 abrogated its interaction with DNAL1/DNAH2, suggesting that **CFAP300 physically binds dynein arm subunits** to promote their incorporation into the motor unit ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=cilia,Further%20studies%20are%20needed%20to)). Consistent with this, Gene Ontology annotations identify CFAP300’s molecular function as general **protein binding (IPI evidence)** based on physical interaction data ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP300#:~:text=GO%20ID%20%20,29727692)). 

Another critical molecular role of CFAP300 is coupling the assembled dynein complexes to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery for delivery into cilia. CFAP300 is proposed to act as a **dynein cargo adaptor** that helps load dynein arm components onto IFT trains ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,mutations%20cause%20defective%20cilia%20motility)). In support of this, experiments in model organisms show that CFAP300’s entry into cilia is *IFT-dependent*: when IFT motors are disrupted, CFAP300 fails to localize inside the cilium ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=reduced%20cilia%20beating%20and%20swim,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). CFAP300 itself accumulates at ciliary tips during ciliogenesis in a pattern similar to the IFT-B complex protein IFT46 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=ciliary%20component.%20IFT139%2FTTC21B%20%28IFT,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)), implying CFAP300 rides the IFT machinery along the axoneme. Thus, at a molecular level, CFAP300 likely **binds dynein arm cargo and IFT proteins**, serving as a link between dynein pre-assembly in the cytoplasm and motor transport into the ciliary compartment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,mutations%20cause%20defective%20cilia%20motility)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=ciliary%20component.%20IFT139%2FTTC21B%20%28IFT,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). This unique adapter/chaperone function is critical for ensuring dynein motors are correctly built and shipped to their axonemal destinations.

# Biological Processes 
Given its role, CFAP300 is involved in several **ciliary and flagellar biological processes**. Foremost, it is required for the *assembly of axonemal dynein complexes* – both outer dynein arms (ODA) and inner dynein arms (IDA) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=gene%2C%20C11orf70%2C%20that%20cause%20PCD,perform%20a%20conserved%20dynein%20assembly)). This places CFAP300 in the biological process of **axonemal dynein arm assembly and preassembly**. Failure of this process (e.g. in CFAP300 mutants) leads to cilia lacking dynein arms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)), underscoring CFAP300’s role in assembling these motility machines. Consequently, CFAP300 is crucial for the process of **cilium movement (motile cilium beating)**. By enabling dynein arms to attach to ciliary microtubules, CFAP300 allows ciliary beating that drives fluid movement in airways, clears mucus, and propels sperm, among other functions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Primary%20ciliary%20dyskinesia%20,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=defective%20function%20of%20sperm%20flagellar%2C,OMIM%5D%3A%20244%20400%29.%2021)). In sperm cells, CFAP300-driven dynein assembly is part of the process of **sperm flagellum motility** and hence normal male fertility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=defective%20function%20of%20sperm%20flagellar%2C,OMIM%5D%3A%20244%20400%29.%2021)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)). 

CFAP300 also indirectly contributes to processes like **mucociliary clearance** in the respiratory tract (by enabling cilia to beat and clear mucus and pathogens) and **determination of left/right body asymmetry** during embryogenesis. Embryonic nodal cilia require beating to establish left-right symmetry; CFAP300 mutations (PCD) often result in random organ laterality (e.g. situs inversus) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Primary%20ciliary%20dyskinesia%20,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)), indicating CFAP300’s involvement in the left-right axis specification process via ciliary motion. Additionally, CFAP300 is linked to **cilium organization and assembly** more generally. Transcriptomic clustering and single-cell data place CFAP300 in the gene module for “cilium assembly/organization” in multiciliated cells ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Cilium%20assembly%20%28mainly)). While CFAP300 doesn’t build microtubules itself, its role in adding dynein arm structures is part of the broader process of assembling a functional 9+2 axoneme. Finally, by virtue of its IFT linkage, CFAP300 partakes in the process of **intraciliary transport of dynein components**, a specialized aspect of cilium biogenesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=reduced%20cilia%20beating%20and%20swim,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). In summary, CFAP300 is integral to biological processes tied to motile ciliary function: assembling dynein motors, enabling ciliary beating, sperm motility, and downstream effects like mucus clearance and developmental symmetry.

# Cellular Localization 
CFAP300 is an **intracellular protein** localized to the cytoplasm and motile cilia compartments. It is predominantly found in the **cell cytoplasm**, where it participates in dynein motor pre-assembly ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=85016#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20be%20located,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Dec%202024)). In multiciliated cells, CFAP300 concentrates in the apical cytoplasm near the base of cilia (around basal bodies), consistent with a role in preparing dynein complexes before entry into cilia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20previous%20reports%20on,arm%20assembly%20of%20sperm%20flagella)). A smaller fraction of CFAP300 is localized within the cilium itself: CFAP300 can be detected in **motile ciliary axonemes**, especially accumulating at the **ciliary tips during ciliogenesis** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=ciliary%20component.%20IFT139%2FTTC21B%20%28IFT,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). This transient ciliary localization likely reflects CFAP300 riding with IFT to deliver dynein arms; once the dynein cargo is deposited, CFAP300 may recycle back. In model organisms (Paramecium, *Chlamydomonas*), tagged CFAP300 was observed mainly in the cytoplasm with a **minor pool inside cilia**, corroborating this dual localization ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,mutations%20cause%20defective%20cilia%20motility)). 

In addition to motile cilia, CFAP300 has been observed at the **centrosome/basal body** region and even in primary (non-motile) cilia of cultured cells ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION%20Tissue,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)). The Human Protein Atlas reports CFAP300 protein is localized to the **centrosome and the primary cilium** in cell lines ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION%20Tissue,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)). This suggests CFAP300 may associate with basal bodies (the organizing centers for cilia) and can enter the primary cilium (perhaps via IFT) even though its critical function is in motile cilia. Overall, CFAP300’s localization can be summarized as **cytoplasmic (for assembly)** and **ciliary (for transport)**: it resides in cytosolic foci and around basal bodies, and a portion travels inside the axoneme (especially at ciliary tip or base) during the delivery of dynein arms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=reduced%20cilia%20beating%20and%20swim,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). Notably, CFAP300 is not a structural axonemal component that remains in the assembled cilium; rather, it is largely absent from mature axonemes once dynein arms are in place ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)). This dynamic localization aligns with its role as a assembly factor and transport facilitator, not a permanent axonemal structural protein. 

# Protein Domains and Structural Features 
CFAP300 is a relatively small protein of ~267 amino acids (~30 kDa) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=used%20to%20predict%20the%20effect,truncate%20the%20protein%20or%20cause)). Its primary recognizable feature is a single conserved domain of unknown function: **DUF4498**. The DUF4498 domain spans essentially the length of the protein (residues ~14–259 in human CFAP300) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=85016#:~:text=pfam14926%20Location%3A14%20%E2%86%92%20235%20DUF4498%3B,associated%20protein)). This domain is conserved across species’ CFAP300 orthologs, but its biochemical role is not yet characterized – it does not show homology to known enzymatic domains or well-defined structural motifs, hence the “domain of unknown function” designation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=85016#:~:text=pfam14926%20Location%3A14%20%E2%86%92%2090%20DUF4498%3B,associated)). The absence of any catalytic signatures (e.g. ATP-binding motifs, etc.) suggests CFAP300 is likely a scaffolding or adaptor protein. Indeed, DUF4498 could serve as a **protein–protein interaction module**, allowing CFAP300 to bind dynein arm subunits or chaperones. Mutational analysis supports the importance of this domain: all known pathogenic variants (missense and truncations) lie within DUF4498, disrupting CFAP300’s ability to carry out its interactions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=First%2C%20we%20identified%20a%20homozygous,this%20mutation%20in%20the%20affected)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=,Electropherograms%20show)). For example, a disease-causing nonsense mutation p.Glu156* truncates the protein within DUF4498, abolishing key functional regions and likely destabilizing the structure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=The%20homozygous%20nonsense%20variant%20in,mutation%20on%20the%20CFAP300%20protein)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=the%20DUF4498%20domain%20of%20the,T%2C%20in%20CFAP300%20could)). 

Beyond DUF4498, CFAP300 has no other well-defined domains. It does not contain coiled-coil regions, transmembrane segments, or signal peptides, in line with its **cytosolic localization and accessory role**. The protein is predicted to be mostly α-helical and/or disordered, which is common for assembly factors that need flexibility (though detailed secondary structure awaits experimental elucidation). A homology model (SWISS-MODEL) of CFAP300 suggests its truncation mutants would significantly alter the protein’s fold ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=deleterious%20mutation%2C%20and%20it%20has,in%20CFAP300%20might%20be%20pathogenic)), again underscoring that the intact DUF4498 domain is crucial. In summary, CFAP300 is essentially composed of the DUF4498 domain, making it a single-domain protein. This domain is a distinguishing signature of CFAP300 family proteins across species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=with%20mutations%20in%20the%20uncharacterized,Phylogenetic%20analysis%20shows%20C11orf70)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). Its structural purpose is likely to provide an interface for binding multiple partners (dynein subunits, other assembly factors, or IFT components) to coordinate dynein arm assembly. Further structural studies are needed to reveal how DUF4498 mediates these interactions, but its conservation implies an important structural role conserved in evolution. 

# Disease Associations and Mutant Phenotypes 
**Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)** is the key disease association for CFAP300. Biallelic mutations in CFAP300 cause an autosomal recessive form of PCD, designated *Ciliary Dyskinesia, Primary, 38 (CILD38)* ([www.orpha.net](https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/gene/CFAP300?mode=name#:~:text=Diseases%20List)) ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/CFAP300#:~:text=Associated%20Diseases)). Patients with CFAP300 mutations present the classic PCD phenotype: chronic sinus and lung infections (from impaired mucociliary clearance), bronchiectasis, chronic otitis media (ear infections), and often situs inversus or other laterality defects (due to nodal cilia dysfunction in the embryo) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Primary%20ciliary%20dyskinesia%20,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)). Notably, CFAP300 mutations consistently lead to a specific ultrastructural ciliary defect: the *combined absence of outer and inner dynein arms* in cilia. High-resolution analyses (electron microscopy and immunofluorescence) of respiratory cells from patients show that both ODAs and IDAs are missing from the axonemes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=whole,from%20PCD%20caused%20by%20them)). This hallmark “ODA+IDA loss” is diagnostic of a dynein-arm assembly defect and is seen with CFAP300 and similar assembly factor mutations. As a result, the cilia are largely immotile or beat only weakly, causing the PCD symptoms.

**Male infertility** is another major phenotype caused by CFAP300 mutations. Males with CFAP300-related PCD have immotile (or severely dysmotile) sperm, leading to infertility (asthenozoospermia) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Asthenozoospermia%20,OMIM%5D%3A%20244%20400%29.%2021)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=associated%20with%20human%20male%20infertility,airway%20cilia%2C%20correct%20polarization%20of)). Sperm tails are essentially modified cilia, and consistent with the airway findings, patients’ sperm flagella also lack both inner and outer dynein arms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=whole,from%20PCD%20caused%20by%20them)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)). This leads to completely non-motile sperm. Defects in CFAP300 thus cause a “sperm flagellar dyskinesia” phenotype: normal axoneme structure except for missing dynein motors, resulting in infertility. Notably, CFAP300 mutations have been identified in infertile men initially diagnosed with idiopathic flagellar immotility, later found to actually have PCD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=The%20cilia,respiratory%20symptoms%2C%20rather%20than%20male)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)). Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can be used to bypass the motility defect for such patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=dynein%20arm%20,from%20PCD%20caused%20by%20them)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=trafficking%20in%20sperm%20flagella,undiagnosed%20infertility%20in%20PCD%20patients)). 

Female fertility might also be affected: females with PCD can have reduced fertility or risk of ectopic pregnancy due to dysfunctional oviduct (fallopian tube) cilia. CFAP300 is highly expressed in fallopian tube ciliated cells ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Predicted%20location,Early%20spermatids)), so it’s plausible that CFAP300 mutations could impair oocyte transport. However, most literature focus has been on respiratory and male phenotypes; female reproductive outcomes in CFAP300 deficiency are less documented. 

No known associations with diseases outside of the ciliary context have been reported for CFAP300. It is considered a **disease-related gene** primarily in the context of PCD ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CFAP300%20INFORMATION%20Protein,interactions%20PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION)). There is some data linking CFAP300 expression to cancer prognosis (e.g. low-level prognostic marker in kidney cancer) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CANCER%20%26%20CELL%20LINES%20Prognostic,Low%20cancer%20specificity%20Cell%20line)), but there is no evidence that CFAP300 mutations play a causal role in cancers. Instead, the phenotypic consequences are specifically due to ciliary dysfunction. In summary, **loss-of-function of CFAP300 leads to Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia**, with hallmark symptoms of respiratory tract disease, laterality defects (like Kartagener’s syndrome when situs inversus is present), and infertility, especially in males ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=whole,from%20PCD%20caused%20by%20them)). These phenotypes are directly tied to the failure to assemble dynein arms, affirming CFAP300’s essential role in ciliary motility.

# Expression Patterns and Tissue Specificity 
CFAP300 is most prominently expressed in tissues and cell types that have motile cilia or flagella. Transcript and protein profiling shows **tissue-enriched expression in the testis, fallopian tube, and choroid plexus** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Predicted%20location,Early%20spermatids)) – all tissues rich in ciliated cells or flagellated cells. The testis (particularly the seminiferous tubules) shows high CFAP300 expression, primarily in developing spermatids/sperm, consistent with its role in sperm flagella formation ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION%20Tissue,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,in%20immune%20cells%20Immune%20cell)). Likewise, the fallopian tubes have ciliated epithelial cells important for egg transport, and CFAP300 is elevated there to support those motile cilia ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Predicted%20location,Early%20spermatids)). In the brain, CFAP300 is enhanced in the choroid plexus and likely ependymal cells (which possess motile cilia to circulate cerebrospinal fluid) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Predicted%20location,Early%20spermatids)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Brain%20specificity,Heart%20muscle)). Generally, **any tissue containing multi-ciliated cells** (e.g. respiratory epithelium, nasal mucosa, trachea, brain ependyma, oviduct) or flagellated cells expresses CFAP300 as part of the ciliary gene program. 

At the single-cell level, CFAP300 is classified as “cell type enhanced” in **multiciliated cells and in male germ cells** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,in%20immune%20cells%20Immune%20cell)). Single-cell RNA sequencing data indicate especially high expression in **respiratory ciliated cells, early spermatids and spermatocytes, and certain ionocytes** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,in%20immune%20cells%20Immune%20cell)). Multiciliated respiratory cells and immature sperm cells both strongly upregulate CFAP300 during the phase when they are building cilia/flagella. This timing fits with CFAP300’s role: it is expressed during ciliogenesis and flagellogenesis. In differentiated airway epithelium cultures, CFAP300 mRNA appears as part of the “ciliogenesis” cluster of genes, being expressed around the onset of cilia formation (possibly FOXJ1-regulated or co-regulated) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Cilium%20assembly%20%28mainly)). Indeed, some studies of multiciliogenesis have noted that assembly factors (like CFAP300’s orthologs) can have early expression during cilia development independent of the core regulators, ensuring dynein arms are ready for installation ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715915115#:~:text=interactions,HEATR2%20did%20not%20affect%20this)) ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715915115#:~:text=temporal%20expression%20of%20known%20preassembly,of%20the%20IDA%20and%20ODA)). 

Notably, CFAP300 is *not* expressed in cells lacking cilia. Tissues composed of primarily non-ciliated cells show very low CFAP300 levels, and it is **not detected in immune cells** or other unciliated cell types ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=expression%20cluster%5E%7Bi%7D%20Ciliated%20cells%20,in%20immune%20cells%20Immune%20cell)). This specificity underscores CFAP300’s dedicated role in ciliary structure. Developmentally, CFAP300 would be expected to be active in any context of motile cilia formation – for example, during embryogenesis in cells of the embryonic node (though those are transient). However, because nodal cilia are few and transient, expression data there are limited; the laterality defects seen in mutants imply it is indeed expressed and needed in those nodal cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)). 

In summary, CFAP300’s expression is **tightly correlated with the presence of motile cilia/flagella**. High expression in testis, airway, reproductive tract, and brain ependyma reflects its requirement in those ciliated systems ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Cilium%20assembly%20%28mainly)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=CELL%20TYPE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Single,in%20immune%20cells%20Immune%20cell)). The gene is part of the ciliary gene network activated during ciliogenesis, ensuring the protein is available when dynein arms are being assembled and transported. This makes CFAP300 an excellent marker for cells engaged in ciliogenesis or spermatogenesis, and its expression pattern provides further evidence of its specialized role in ciliary function.

# Key Experimental Evidence and Literature 
Several key studies have elucidated CFAP300’s function, disease relevance, and mechanism:

- **Discovery in PCD (2018):** The involvement of CFAP300 in PCD was first demonstrated by Fassad *et al.* (2018) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=,G%2C%20Arnoult%20C%2C%20Ray%20PF)). Using targeted gene panel sequencing in patients with unexplained PCD, they identified biallelic mutations in *C11orf70* (CFAP300) in multiple families ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=Targeted%20Next%20Generation%20Sequencing%20Identifies,Mutations%20in%20Individuals%20with%20PCD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=match%20at%20L411%20First%2C%20we,this%20mutation%20in%20the%20affected)). Affected individuals had classic PCD features including neonatal respiratory distress, laterality defects (one family had situs inversus totalis), and immotile cilia with combined ODA+IDA loss on electron microscopy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=with%20laterality%20defects%20and%20immotile,Phylogenetic%20analysis%20shows%20C11orf70)). This study provided the first genetic link between CFAP300 and human disease. Crucially, Fassad *et al.* also performed **functional experiments in model organisms** to confirm CFAP300’s role. In *Paramecium*, RNAi knockdown of the CFAP300 ortholog caused loss of both inner and outer dynein arms and reduced ciliary beating ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=match%20at%20L49%20Paramecium%20C11orf70,IFT%20kinesin)), recapitulating the human phenotype at the cellular level. They created GFP-tagged CFAP300 in *Paramecium* and *Chlamydomonas*, showing it localizes mostly to cytoplasm with some presence in cilia, and observed that disrupting intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins prevented CFAP300 from entering cilia ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,mutations%20cause%20defective%20cilia%20motility)). During ciliogenesis in these models, CFAP300-GFP was seen accumulating at ciliary tips along with IFT proteins ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=ciliary%20component.%20IFT139%2FTTC21B%20%28IFT,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)). These experiments established that CFAP300 is *conserved and essential* for dynein arm assembly across species, and that it likely links dynein arms to IFT for ciliary transport ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=Paramecium%20C11orf70%20RNAi%20knockdown%20led,IFT%20kinesin)). The authors summarized that “C11orf70 encodes a protein needed for assembly of both outer and inner arm axonemal dyneins…a hallmark of axonemal dynein assembly co-chaperones” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=gene%2C%20C11orf70%2C%20that%20cause%20PCD,perform%20a%20conserved%20dynein%20assembly)). This pivotal study (published in *American Journal of Human Genetics*) firmly identified CFAP300 as a dynein arm assembly factor and the cause of PCD in those families.

- **Role in Dynein Trafficking (2019):** Subsequent research by Voelkel *et al.* (2019) expanded on CFAP300’s mechanism, focusing on its role in dynein transport within cells. In *Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.* they reported CFAP300 mutations in Slavic PCD patients and provided evidence that CFAP300 is involved in the **intraflagellar transport-dependent trafficking of axonemal dyneins** ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=match%20at%20L1504%20Voelkel%20K%2C,View%20Article)). They showed that in human airway cells lacking CFAP300, dynein arm proteins accumulate abnormally at the ciliary base (apical cytoplasm) but fail to integrate into the axoneme – suggesting CFAP300 is required to escort these complexes into cilia. This aligns with the earlier model organism data and reinforces the idea that CFAP300 acts after initial assembly to ensure delivery of dyneins via IFT. Their biochemical analyses also hinted that CFAP300 might interact with known IFT proteins (like IFT139 or IFT46) or dynein docking factors, though details remain under investigation. This study helped solidify CFAP300’s classification as a **dynein arm transport adaptor** in addition to assembly factor.

- **Male Infertility and Sperm Evidence (2021-2024):** Because many PCD genes had been studied mainly in respiratory cilia, later studies examined CFAP300’s effect on sperm flagella. A 2021 report by Aprea *et al.* in *PLOS Genetics* analyzed sperm from men with various dynein assembly gene mutations (including CFAP300) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=sperm%20structure%20and%20function%2C%20and,We%20found%20that%20the%20process)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=preassembly%20mutant%20males%20,of%20ODAs%2C%20while%20some%20respiratory)). They found that CFAP300-mutant individuals’ sperm had a *complete loss of ODAs and IDAs* in flagella, the same defect seen in their respiratory cilia ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=match%20at%20L458%20II1%29%2C%20CFAP300,and%20S4%20and%20Table%202)) ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=match%20at%20L568%20OP,S9%20Fig)). High-speed video showed these sperm were immotile, confirming CFAP300’s necessity for flagellar beating. Interestingly, they noted that some PCD patients with assembly factor mutations (like CFAP300) had residual outer dynein arms in proximal airway cilia but **sperm flagella showed none**, suggesting sperm might be even more sensitive to loss of these assembly factors ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1009306#:~:text=respiratory%20cilia%20by%20immunofluorescence%20microscopy,These)). This study underscored the critical nature of CFAP300 in fertility and that preassembly of dyneins is equally vital in the germline. In 2024, Zhou *et al.* published a case of a consanguineous Chinese patient with a novel CFAP300 nonsense mutation, manifesting as classic PCD plus infertility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=PCD%20is%20typically%20resulted%20from,results%20expand%20the%20spectrum%20of)). They provided further ultrastructural evidence via TEM and immunostaining that the patient’s sperm tails lacked dynein arms, and showed dynein markers (DNAH2 for IDA, DNAL1 for ODA) mislocalized near the base of the flagellum instead of along it ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=species,protein%20300%3B%20AA%3A%20amino%20acid)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=and%20ODA%20but%20exhibited%20a,arm%20assembly%20of%20sperm%20flagella)). This directly visualized that dynein components were present but not transported/assembled without CFAP300, reinforcing the proposed mechanism. They also demonstrated successful assisted reproduction (ICSI) in this case, highlighting the clinical management aspect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=dynein%20arm%20,from%20PCD%20caused%20by%20them)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=trafficking%20in%20sperm%20flagella,undiagnosed%20infertility%20in%20PCD%20patients)). 

- **Conservation and Evolution (2018-2022):** Research has also explored CFAP300 in evolutionary contexts. Schultz *et al.* (2022) described CFAP300 mutations in Finnish PCD patients and noted that CFAP300 is *highly conserved among ciliated organisms* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Scholar%20scholar.google.com%20%5D%20,Google%20Scholar)). Phylogenetic analyses show CFAP300 orthologs exist in diverse species that have motile cilia/flagella, from single-celled algae to mammals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=of%20inner%20and%20outer%20dynein,ciliary%20tips%20in%20a%20similar)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). Fassad *et al.* (2018) specifically found CFAP300 (referred as FBB5 in Chlamydomonas) is present in organisms with 9+2 cilia and absent in those lacking motile cilia, supporting its specialized evolutionary role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). These studies often cite CFAP300 as part of a suite of *dynein arm assembly factors* (DNAAFs) that emerged to assist with the size and complexity of dynein motors. Reviews such as Horani *et al.* (2018, PNAS) and King (2016, CSH Perspectives) discuss how multiple DNAAFs (including ones discovered earlier like DNAAF1-7) work together ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715915115#:~:text=only%20in%20the%20cytoplasm%2C%20and,expression%2C%20interactions%2C%20and%20functions%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5088525/#:~:text=In%20motile%20cilia%2C%20movement%20is,trafficked%20into%20the%20ciliary%20shaft)). CFAP300 (DNAAF17) is now counted among these factors, and its discovery filled a gap in understanding how all dynein arms are properly assembled. 

Overall, the literature converges on the idea that CFAP300 is an **essential assembly factor and transport mediator for ciliary dynein arms**. Key evidence from human genetics (identification of mutations causing PCD), cell biology (localization and knockout phenotypes in model organisms), and patient cell studies (ultrastructure and protein mislocalization) all support this function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)). These findings are well-cited in recent reviews of ciliary biology and PCD genetics. The knowledge gained from these experiments is directly informing curation of Gene Ontology and clinical variant databases, as CFAP300 is now a recognized target in genetic testing for PCD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Scholar%20scholar.google.com%20%5D%20,Google%20Scholar)). 

# Evolutionary Conservation 
CFAP300 is **highly evolutionarily conserved** in organisms that possess motile cilia or flagella. Homologs of CFAP300 have been identified in a wide range of ciliated eukaryotes, from single-celled protists up through mammals ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=of%20inner%20and%20outer%20dynein,ciliary%20tips%20in%20a%20similar)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). For example, *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* (a biflagellate green alga) has a CFAP300 ortholog originally termed **FBB5** (encoded by gene *Cre12.g556300*) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=Functional%20Characterization%20of%20C11orf70%20in,Chlamydomonas)). *Paramecium tetraurelia* also has a clearly conserved CFAP300 ortholog (GSPATG00011350001) that performs the same function in assembling ciliary dyneins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=Paramecium%20C11orf70%20RNAi%20knockdown%20led,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=We%20identified%20the%20Paramecium%20C11orf70,target)). These protistan versions are similar in size and contain the DUF4498 domain, indicating the domain’s ancient origin. In vertebrates, CFAP300 is conserved from fish (e.g. zebrafish) to birds to humans. The protein sequence is strongly conserved among mammals – disease-causing amino acid positions (like His259 in human) are invariant across mammals and even present in lower organisms, highlighting functional constraint ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=the%20DUF4498%20domain%20of%20the,T%2C%20in%20CFAP300%20could)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=,different%20mammalian%20and%20other%20ciliate)). Phylogenetic analyses show that CFAP300’s presence or absence correlates with the presence of motile cilia: organisms that lack motile cilia (for instance, higher plants or certain nematodes that don’t have 9+2 axonemes) also lack any CFAP300 homolog ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). This suggests CFAP300 was likely present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes with flagella, and lost in lineages that lost motile cilia.

Functionally, the conservation is demonstrated by cross-species experiments. Human CFAP300’s role can be modeled in *Chlamydomonas* or *Paramecium* – knockdown or mutation in those organisms produces matching phenotypes (loss of dynein arms, immotile cilia) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=match%20at%20L49%20Paramecium%20C11orf70,IFT%20kinesin)). This indicates that CFAP300’s function in dynein preassembly is fundamentally the same across eukaryotes. Moreover, *Xenopus* (frog) and mouse have been used to study related ciliary genes; although specific CFAP300-knockout mouse data are not yet widely reported, the expression in motile-cilia cells of mouse (e.g. trachea, ependyma) mirrors the human pattern ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Cilium%20assembly%20%28mainly)). The strong evolutionary conservation also extends to the network of interacting proteins: many dynein assembly factors are conserved together. For example, C21orf59 (Kurly) was FBB18 in *Chlamydomonas*, and CFAP300 was FBB5 ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715915115#:~:text=only%20in%20the%20cytoplasm%2C%20and,expression%2C%20interactions%2C%20and%20functions%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)) – both are DNAAFs found in algae and humans, underscoring a conserved assemblage of co-chaperones handling axonemal motors. 

This conservation across species underscores the importance of CFAP300’s function. It implies that the mechanism of dynein arm maturation and intraflagellar transport **evolved early** and has remained under strong selective pressure due to the essential nature of motile cilia (for cell locomotion, feeding, fluid transport, etc., in various organisms). In practical terms, the evolutionary conservation means model organisms can be effectively used to study CFAP300. Indeed, the human CFAP300 protein is sufficiently similar to *Chlamydomonas* FBB5 that cross-reference of findings is possible ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=The%20presence%20or%20absence%20of,the%20top%20hit%20in%20a)). Researchers have leveraged this to determine that CFAP300 is part of the same functional module as known assembly factors (like KTU/DNAAF2, DYX1C1, etc.) which also show presence only in ciliated species ([www.pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715915115#:~:text=only%20in%20the%20cytoplasm%2C%20and,expression%2C%20interactions%2C%20and%20functions%20of)). In summary, CFAP300 is an evolutionarily ancient protein, conserved from protists to humans, dedicated to the construction of ciliary movement apparatus. Its sequence conservation and consistent functional role across species highlight its significance in the biology of cilia and flagella.

# Relevant Gene Ontology (GO) Terms 
Based on the functions and characteristics of CFAP300, several Gene Ontology terms are applicable for annotation:

- **Molecular Function (MF):**  
  - *Protein binding* – CFAP300 binds axonemal dynein components and possibly chaperone/transport proteins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=cilia,Further%20studies%20are%20needed%20to)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP300#:~:text=GO%20ID%20%20,29727692)).  
  - *Dynein complex binding* (candidate term) – more specifically, it attaches to parts of the axonemal dynein complex (e.g. light and heavy chains) to facilitate assembly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=cilia,Further%20studies%20are%20needed%20to)).  
  - *Molecular chaperone regulator activity* (or *protein complex assembly factor*) – CFAP300 acts as a co-chaperone in assembling the dynein motor complexes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)). *(While no direct GO term exists solely for “axonemal dynein assembly factor,” CFAP300’s role aligns with chaperoning protein complex assembly.)*

- **Biological Process (BP):**  
  - *Axonemal dynein complex assembly* – CFAP300 is required for assembling both outer and inner dynein arm complexes in cilia ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5986720/#:~:text=gene%2C%20C11orf70%2C%20that%20cause%20PCD,perform%20a%20conserved%20dynein%20assembly)).  
  - *Cilium organization* – it contributes to the proper structural organization of the ciliary axoneme by ensuring motor components are in place ([learn.mapmygenome.in](https://learn.mapmygenome.in/CFAP300#:~:text=CFAP300%20is%20a%20cilia,are%20essential%20for%20generating%20movement)).  
  - *Cilium movement (motile cilium beating)* – CFAP300 enables motility; loss of CFAP300 results in non-moving cilia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Primary%20ciliary%20dyskinesia%20,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)).  
  - *Intraflagellar transport* – specifically, *intraflagellar transport involved in dynein arm delivery*; CFAP300 links dynein cargo to IFT trains for transport into cilia ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=reduced%20cilia%20beating%20and%20swim,defective%20cilia%20motility%20and%20PCD)).  
  - *Sperm flagellum motility* (or *sperm axoneme assembly*) – supports the assembly and function of the sperm tail for motile sperm ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=Asthenozoospermia%20,OMIM%5D%3A%20244%20400%29.%2021)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)).  
  - *Determination of left/right asymmetry* – via role in nodal cilia function; mutations cause situs inversus, indicating involvement in left-right axis determination during development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=proteins%20that%20are%20indispensable%20for,combined%20loss%20of%20the%20inner)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=CFAP300%20variant%20exhibited%20male%20infertility%2C,40%20CFAP298%2C%20another)).  
  - *Multiciliate cell differentiation* (indirect) – CFAP300 is part of the gene program expressed during the differentiation of multiciliated cells, aiding the formation of multiple motile cilia ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=Tissue%20specificity,Cilium%20assembly%20%28mainly)).

- **Cellular Component (CC):**  
  - *Cytoplasm* – CFAP300 is predominantly cytoplasmic ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=85016#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20be%20located,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Dec%202024)).  
  - *Motile cilium* – it is associated with the axoneme of motile cilia/flagella (transiently present in the ciliary compartment, especially at tips) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=in%20the%20intraflagellar%20transport%20%28IFT%29,mutations%20cause%20defective%20cilia%20motility)).  
  - *Ciliary basal body/centriole* – localizes near basal bodies (centrosomes) where dynein preassembly foci are found ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137691-C11orf70#:~:text=PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION%20Tissue,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)).  
  - *IFT particle (IFT train)* – while not a core IFT subunit, CFAP300 physically interacts with the IFT machinery; one could annotate it to components involved in IFT transport of cargo.  
  - *Dynein axonemal particle (preassembly complex)* – refers to the cytosolic complex of dynein subunits and assembly factors. CFAP300 likely resides in such preassembly complexes along with HSP proteins and other DNAAFs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)). *(This is not a standard GO CC term, but is conceptually where CFAP300 operates.)*

In formal annotation, one might use terms like **“outer dynein arm assembly” (GO:0036158)** and **“inner dynein arm assembly” (GO:0036159)** to capture CFAP300’s role in those specific processes. Additionally, **“axoneme” (GO:0005930)** and **“motile cilium” (GO:0031514)** would be appropriate CC terms for its location, and **“protein binding” (GO:0005515)** for its molecular function ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CFAP300#:~:text=GO%20ID%20%20,29727692)). Given its specialized function, a term like **“dynein axonemal assembly factor activity”** could be coined to describe factors like CFAP300, though currently curators would annotate the process (assembly) and the binding function separately. 

Overall, these GO terms encapsulate CFAP300 as a **cytoplasmic protein that binds to axonemal dynein components and facilitates their assembly and transport into motile cilia**, thereby enabling ciliary motility. Each of these aspects is well-supported by experimental evidence from multiple studies, making CFAP300 a well-defined candidate for GO curation in the context of ciliary structure and function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29727692/#:~:text=CFAP300%29,IFT%20kinesin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11784957/#:~:text=pathogenesis,and%20the%20sperm%20flagellar%20phenotype)).
