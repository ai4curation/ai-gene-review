## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9NWX6
- **Protein Description:** Probable tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.79; AltName Induced in high glucose-1 (IHG-1); AltName Interphase cytoplasmic foci protein 45 (ICF45)
- **Gene Information:** Name=THG1L; Synonyms=ICF45
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human)
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase family
- **Key Domains:** Thg1_C_dom (IPR025845); tRNAHis_GuaTrfase_cat (IPR024956); tRNAHis_GuaTrfase_Thg1 (IPR007537); Thg1 (PF04446)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "THG1L" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human)
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'THG1L' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **THG1L** (gene ID: THG1L, UniProt: Q9NWX6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

    > Ever since the advent of commercial next-generation sequencing platforms in the early 2000s with its associated decrease in sequencing costs [1], the number of DNA sequences increased considerably [2]. Generally, these data become publicly accessible in databases provided by projects focussing on different aspects of biological sequence information [3,4]. Ensembl [5] and NCBI [6] for instance, have a strong focus on genome annotation with the help of RNA transcript information while UniProt has a pronounced emphasis on protein-coding genes and biological function of proteins. UniProt's records are either based on manually annotated, non-redundant protein sequences (SwissProt) or on highquality computationally analysed records, which are enriched with automatic annotation (TrEMBL) [7]. Relying on accurate genome annotations and protein descriptions, Gene Ontology (GO) [8,9] categorises gene products and fits them into a computational model of biological systems. Their assignment deploys a controlled vocabulary, so-called GO terms, to link genes and gene products to biological processes, cellular components, or molecular functions.
    > However, genome annotation is not standardised, and each service provider uses their own custom-built annotation pipelines. As a consequence, this often leads to ambiguity in gene names during genome annotation with different gene symbols being given to the same gene or the same gene symbol being given to different, but similar genes. Additionally, since the pre-existing wealth of sequencing information relies on model organisms like human and mouse, there is a strong bias in gene symbols towards those chosen for these species. Particularly for model species, this issue has been partially addressed, for example by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) [10], the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) [11], or the Chicken Gene Nomenclature Consortium [12]. However, this neither guarantees that gene names are harmonised among these consortia, nor does it keep researchers from assigning alternative gene symbols in their annotations, especially when working with non-model species.

    > Reviewer #3 (Comments for the Author):
    > In this manuscript, Modlin et al., attempt to tackle the problem of assigning functions to ~1700 hypothetical and/or underannotated genes in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb) genome. Rapid and accurate annotation of microbial genomes is indeed a very critical and under appreciated part of microbial ecophysiology. This step is especially crucial for pathogenic organisms such as Mtb where accurate functional annotation of these hypothetical proteins could unravel mechanisms which could act as drug targets. The authors employed a two-pronged strategy to define a set of these unannotated or under-annotated genes and to then provide possible functions for many of these genes. First, they undertook a large-scale manual curation of literature to assign functions (including EC numbers for enzymatic functions) to ~575 genes.

    > To obtain basic information on WERs and their target genes, such as official gene symbols, gene IDs, gene types, and genomic locations, gene annotations were downloaded from the GENCODE project [ 44 ] for human and mouse, and from NCBI [ 45 ] and Ensembl [ 46 ] for the other species. Genomic locations were extracted from the corresponding GTF annotation files. Gene symbols were primarily standardized based on the NCBI Gene database [ 45 ] for mRNAs and lncRNAs, GtR-NAdb [ 47 ] for tRNAs, miRbase [ 48 ] for microRNAs, and cir-cBase [ 49 ] for circRNAs. Deprecated or substituted versions of genes were filtered out. The LiftOver [ 50 ] program was employed to convert and unify genomic coordinates across different genome assembly versions.
    > The functional descriptions of WERs were compiled based on the UniProt database [ 51 ] and further supplemented with evidence from relevant publications, with particular emphasis on their functions as RNA modification regulatory proteins.

    > The lists of proteins used for the comparison contain more items than listed previously due to expansion out of gene clusters, for example, to allow the updating and comparison of current HGNC gene symbols. These lists of proteins were compared in Microsoft Excel 2011 using PivotTable.
    > The protein set for the CHO midbody was derived from the accession numbers in Table S1 and Table S2 from Skop et al. [9]. Original accession numbers were updated to more recent UniProt accessions (2/2010), and duplicates from different species or different protein isoforms were removed. The unique UniProt accessions were mapped to gene names using UniProt KB Unimart, UniProt dataset [82], and these gene names were confirmed manually as HGNC symbols using HGNC, with ambiguities checked using BLASTP of the sequence corresponding to the original accession number. Accessions that didn't map successfully in Unimart were manually analyzed using BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set using sequences from the original accessions, combined with TreeFam.org data for the non-human UniProt accessions. HGNC symbols were updated again on 12/14/2010 before comparison with this paper's protein set.
    > The protein set for the HeLa spindle proteome is derived from the 1121 accession numbers in Sauer et al. supplementary table 1 column 2 [17]. Updating the 1116 UniProt accession numbers and 5 IPI accession numbers from 795 rows required several steps. Most proteins were updated to current UniProt accessions using UniProt retrieve. Duplicates were removed. Sequences for the IPI accession numbers and 16 defunct UniProt accession numbers were recovered from other sources on the web, and BLASTP against the human RefSeq protein set with a cutoff of at least 90% identity was used to update some of these accessions. The unique current UniProt accessions were mapped to HGNC symbols using UniProt ID mapping to HGNC IDs.

    > Structural annotation refers to the prediction of gene structures on a genome assembly, including the positions of transcripts, exons, introns, coding sequences, and other features [49]. Functional annotation provides information about the gene's biological role(s), for example, gene ontologies [50], pathways, functional domains, and names. Model organism databases can manually assign biological function to genes by accumulating evidence from the scientific literature and structuring it in human and machine-readable formats. In contrast, for non-model organisms such as those in the Ag100Pest Initiative, most, if not all, functional annotation is performed computationally, as (1) gene function in very few genes have been established experimentally for these non-model species, and (2) the capacity for literature-based curation of gene function does not yet exist for these species.
    > Most of the genome assemblies generated by the Ag100Pest project are being annotated using the NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline [51]. This pipeline relies on Gnomon [52] for gene prediction and uses genome assembly, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) alignments, transcripts, and protein alignments as inputs. The resulting gene predictions are given an accession number and made publicly available. Gene names are assigned based on homology to proteins in SwissProt [53,54]. The NCBI eukaryotic annotation pipeline requires both the genome assembly and associated RNA-Seq evidence to be publicly available in the NCBI's GenBank and Sequence Read Archive, respectively (SRA; see [55]). In the event that an Ag100Pest species lacks sufficient RNA-Seq evidence in SRA, additional data will be generated, as appropriate, and submitted to aid with NCBI gene structure prediction and annotation.
    > NCBI does not currently generate additional functional annotations. Proteins deposited in GenBank or generated by RefSeq should eventually be functionally annotated by UniProt [53].

    > In order to detect gene and protein names which are assigned to products of different genes and thus result in erroneous cross-references, dedicated lists are created for each organism separately. Organism-specific lists are necessary, since terms that are ambiguous in one organism might be explicit in another. For example, ADORA2 is an ambiguous gene name in Homo sapiens but not in mouse, and GALT in mouse but not in H.sapiens.
    > In a first step, ambiguous names within the databases were extracted. If a name occurs in at least two entries describing different genes or proteins (splice variants count as one gene/protein), this particular name is marked as ambiguous and is excluded from the mapping process. In a second step, corresponding gene names occurring in the manually annotated sections of RefSeq as well as in UniProt were analyzed. Entries containing the same gene product name and having a one-to-many or many-to-many relation (e.g. one Swiss-Prot entry maps to many RefSeq entries) were scrutinized for misleading annotation. This process is done manually by inspecting additional information like sequence similarity or functional information about the involved entries. In most of the cases, the exclusion of the ambiguous gene names resulted in correct one-to-one relations.
    > As statistical analysis revealed (Supplementary Material S2) that gene names with less than four letters are exceptionally error-prone, only gene names with at least four letters are kept for mapping purposes. However, gene names with less than four letters can be queried, e.g. a search for the tumor suppressor 'p53' reveals the respective entries with the official gene name 'TP53'. Organism-specific lists of ambiguous gene and protein names are available for download on the CRONOS home page.

    > We decided to prioritize human genes and proteins. The following strategy has been implemented to resolve gene and protein text entities to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol (corresponding to human, when possible):
    > -Try to find a match among Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) names (Braschi et al., 2019;HUGO, 2021);
    > -Try to find a match among names in The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (Armstrong et al., 2020; IUPHAR/BPS, 2021); -Try to find matches among names in UniProt (Bateman et al., 2017); -Otherwise, try to match to an enzyme name and resolve to an EC number (Bairoch, 2000;Expassy, 2021).
    > In general, it is very difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the protein encoded by that gene. Therefore, gene and protein names are not strictly distinguished from each other but considered as one category. Therefore, the annotations considered in this study can be grouped into three categories: chemicals, genes/proteins, and diseases.

    > Top hits were required to have a percent query coverage (QC) ≥ 80 to be used for annotating transcripts.

Genes without a published gene symbol (named 'LOC' + Gene ID in NCBI's database) were assigned a UniProt gene symbol based on the protein annotation listed in the RefSeq entries, when possible. Ultimately, a list of transcript identifiers and gene symbols were compiled into a transcript-to-gene map for subsequent analyses.
    > To further facilitate analyses of gene functions, additional steps were taken to identify the putative function of genes annotated with a symbol that began with 'LOC'. First 'LOC' genes with a protein-coding gene description in NCBI's database were manually assigned the appropriate gene symbol. Transcript sequences of remaining 'LOC' genes were queried through a blastn search against NCBI's nucleotide database (parameters: max target seq = 2, max hsps = 1, evalue = 0.01, perc identity = 90). Results from the blastn search were filtered to exclude hits with query coverage < 90 and hits that included vague terms (e.g., 'uncharacterized', 'genome assembly' and 'chromosome'). Gene symbols were extracted from the first hit for each transcript and assigned as the identity of that gene for genes with only a single transcript with hits or with consistent hits across transcripts. For genes with multiple transcripts that matched different gene symbols, the annotation was manually determined based on the number of transcripts for each gene symbol hit and query coverage/% identity values. For any 'LOC' genes that were identified as a gene already present in the dataset, gene counts were concatenated for further analysis.

    > A typical use of an ortholog database is transferring functional annotations from known genes in model organisms to genes of unknown function in other organisms, on the basis of the conjecture that orthologs are usually functionally conserved. To demonstrate such an application in our database, we showed a query to retrieve ortholog information of a specified protein.
    > Here, we specified a UniProt ID to obtain ortholog information. For describing functional categories of genes, we used Gene Ontology (GO) [24]. The UniProt GO Annotation (UniProt-GOA) database [25] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA) provides GO term assignment to proteins with evidence codes (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). We created an ontology for GO annotation (GOA-O, Table 1, http://purl.jp/bio/11/goa) and described UniProt-GOA data in RDF using it (Table 2). If some model organisms have experimentally verified GO annotations, we can transfer such a validated annotation to orthologs of other organisms.

- Summary: A set of 2001 potential non-coding genes are described based on features such as weak conservation, a lack of protein features, or ambiguous annotations from major databases, all of which correlated with low peptide detection across the seven experiments.

    > However, despite the variety of tissues interrogated in our analysis, it is to be expected that some proteins will remain undetected because they are tissue specific.
    > Although the technical limitations of proteomics analyses are among the most probable reason for detecting peptides for ,60% of the protein-coding genes, there may be another reason for not identifying peptides for certain genes. It is possible that some of the genes predicted to be protein-coding in the GENCODE geneset do not actually code for proteins. To investigate this, we selected 2001 genes that had one or more features that suggested of a lack of coding potential. We found protein evidence for ,6% of these genes, and for many of these genes, the reading frame was not conserved in cross-species alignments. Together the non-protein-like features, loss of reading frame and lack of protein evidence suggested that many of these genes might not code for proteins under normal circumstances.
    > We did detect proteomics evidence for several genes in this set, for example, SLC5A3 (ENSG00000198743), which was annotated by UniProt as only having evidence of protein existence by homology, and for SPA17 (ENSG00000064199), which is annotated as 'putative' by GENCODE. Both these genes have protein-like features and good conservation. They were in the list of potential non-coding genes because the human genome annotation project is not yet complete and these genes had yet to be annotated with evidence by GENCODE and UniProt. SPA17 is no longer tagged as 'putative' in the GENCODE 19 annotation. We also identified peptides for genes with conflicting proteincoding evidence, such as WASH4P (ENSG00000234769) and WASH6P (ENSG00000182484), annotated as protein coding, but tagged as pseudogenes in the Ensembl description. Again as the human genome annotation progresses, these descriptions are likely to be refined.
    > There are genes that do not fit into the conventional coding/ non-coding narrative in the non-coding set. Several genes are annotated as potentially non-functional but may actually be functional under certain conditions.

    > MAKER, SNAP, and AUGUSTUS (with intron-exon boundary hints provided from RNA-seq) were then used to predict genes in the repeat-masked reference genome. To help guide the prediction process, Swiss-Prot peptide sequences from the UniProt database were downloaded and used in conjunction with the protein sequences from A. carolinensis, L. agilis, and Z. vivipara to generate peptide evidence in the MAKER pipeline. Only genes that were predicted by both SNAP and AUGUSTUS were retained in the final gene sets. To assess the quality of gene prediction, Annotation Edit Distance (AED) scores were generated for each of the predicted genes as part of the MAKER pipeline. Fourth, we curated the genome manually, during which we verified and corrected a preselected list of genes. We preselected genes that are biologically relevant for our focal species and our current research, such as arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARS), heat shock protein family (HSP40), heat shock protein family A (HSP70), and the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Lastly, genes were further characterized for their putative function by performing a BLAST search of the peptide sequences against the UniProt database. tRNA were predicted using the software tRNAscan-SE (version 2.05).

Gene function (Gene Ontology components, functions, and processes) was extracted either from PlasmoDB or by querying the InterPro ID with the InterPro2GO mapping tool from EMBL-EBI. Gene essentiality data was obtained for P. falciparum 20 and P. berghei 21,22 parasites mapped to their falciparum orthologs using OrthoMCL orthology group IDs. Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs of crystal structures were obtained by searching either gene symbols, UniProt IDs associated with each gene, or the term "Plasmodium". A report with gene identifier, organism, accession number, method for structure determination and publication information was extracted for the search hits.

Diseases were matched to MeSH identifiers; and gene and protein annotations were matched to gene symbols, protein accession numbers, or the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers using the procedure developed in our previous study [8]. As mentioned above, since it is difficult and often impossible to distinguish the name of a gene from the name of the corresponding encoded protein, gene and protein names are considered a single category, gene. Corresponding names are resolved to the most reasonable gene, protein, or enzyme symbol. As mentioned in our previous study [8], the procedure prioritizes human genes and proteins.

    > A gold standard set of protein functional annotations was generated by extracting data from UniProt [16] and BRENDA [17]. We extracted all protein sequence and annotation data from UniProt (release 2016_05) for the organism Zea mays, keeping the EC annotations only from the manually reviewed component of UniProt, while removing those annotations that had not undergone manual review. We also extracted experimentally verified protein annotations for Zea mays from BRENDA (release 2016.1). The UniProt and BRENDA annotations were then merged by matching proteins based on the database crosslinks provided by BRENDA, resulting in the union of the reviewed annotations from UniProt and the experimentally verified annotations of BRENDA with duplicates removed. The merged protein annotations were then matched to the B73 RefGen_v2 translated gene models using BLASTP based on a sequence identity cutoff of 96% and an e-value cutoff of 1e-20. We selected the top scoring hit for each protein which resulted in matches to 1,815 unique maize proteins. EC annotations for alternate isoforms were consolidated at the gene level, resulting in 1,475 experimentally verified or manually reviewed protein functional annotations across 1,450 maize genes.

    > Single-gene search: Gene annotation is essential for biologists to understand a gene's function. MTD's single-gene search interface allows researchers to obtain a comprehensive gene description by entering or selecting a gene ID. The results include sequence information, CAZy family, Pfam domains, GO/KEGG annotations, and phenotype information (Fig. 2D), along with sequence-based predictions such as optimal protein activity temperature, melting temperature (Tm), subcellular localization, and transcription factor scores. To enhance data accessibility, links to external databases such as NCBI, KEGG, FungiDB [4], UniProt, and JGI are also provided, facilitating cross-referencing of gene annotations across various resources.
    > Unlike the static genome, the transcriptome captures dynamic gene expression changes in response to developmental or environmental conditions, establishing a dynamic link between an organism's genome and its physical characteristics [63]. In the single-gene retrieval interface, the expression of the searched gene is visualized in the form of box plots and scatter plots across transcriptome datasets (Fig. 2E). When hovering over any data point, users can view the corresponding experimental details, such as mutant name, sample processing methods, and growth conditions. This interactive feature reveals gene expression responses to environmental factors, allowing researchers to quickly identify experimental conditions of interest and explore the gene's potential roles in diverse biological contexts. Moreover, clicking on the dataset title will direct users to the GEO browser for further detailed descriptions. KEGG Pathway or Gene List Search: In transcriptome studies, researchers typically adopt a "bottom-up" approach: first sequencing all mRNA in a cell, identifying differentially expressed genes between conditions, and then performing GO/KEGG enrichment analysis to interpret functional distributions. MTD, however, offers a complementary "top-down" search strategy, enabling users to examine the expression of genes within a specific KEGG pathway (Fig. 3A) or a user-defined gene set. A unique feature of MTD is its manually curated data categorization system, which organizes sample data with detailed annotations based on experimental conditions.

    > The results from transcriptome-based, homology-based, and de novo prediction were integrated using EVM v2.1.0. Subsequently, PASA v2.5.3 (72) was utilized to refine the gene models by incorporating transcriptome evidence, correcting exon-intron boundaries, adding UTRs, and modeling alternative splicing events, followed by the removal of extremely short genes and those containing premature stop codons to improve annotation quality. The final gene set was evaluated using BUSCO to assess completeness.
    > Gene function annotation is the process of predicting the function of target proteins by aligning their sequences with known functional protein sequences in databases. The methods for gene function annotation can be divided into two main approaches: the first is based on sequence homology, where the protein sequences of D. officinale are aligned with the UniProt, Nr, GO, and KEGG databases using BLASTP to obtain related functional information and potential involvement in metabolic pathways; The second is based on domain similarity, where the protein sequences of D. officinale were analyzed using InterProScan v5.51 (73) to identify conserved domains, assign protein families, and predict functional site.
    > Non-coding RNAs annotation Non-coding RNAs are RNA molecules that do not encode proteins, including rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and miRNA, among others. These RNAs perform their biological functions directly after transcription, without the need for translation into proteins.
