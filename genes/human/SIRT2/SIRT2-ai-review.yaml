description: NAD-dependent protein deacetylase and defatty-acylase that 
  functions primarily in the cytoplasm but shuttles to the nucleus during G2/M 
  transition. SIRT2 deacetylates histones (H4K16, H3K18, H3K56), alpha-tubulin 
  (K40), and numerous non-histone substrates including transcription factors 
  (FOXO1, FOXO3, HIF1A, RELA/p65), metabolic enzymes (ACLY, G6PD, PCK1), and 
  cell cycle regulators (CDC20, BubR1). Also possesses efficient demyristoylase 
  and depalmitoylase activities. Key roles include regulation of cell cycle 
  progression, chromatin condensation during mitosis, metabolic regulation, and 
  peripheral nerve myelination.

    summary: SIRT2 localizes to the nucleus, particularly during G2/M transition
      and mitosis. North and Verdin (PMID:17726514) demonstrated that SIRT2 
      undergoes nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling via CRM1-dependent nuclear export, 
      with nuclear accumulation during mitosis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by multiple experimental studies. SIRT2 shuttles 
      between cytoplasm and nucleus, with nuclear enrichment during mitosis 
      where it associates with chromatin and deacetylates H4K16.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on yeast Sir2 function. While SIRT2 has 
      chromatin-related functions, direct evidence for human SIRT2 involvement 
      in rDNA heterochromatin formation is limited.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Inferred from yeast Sir2 function. Human SIRT2 is primarily 
      cytoplasmic and its chromatin functions are more related to mitotic H4K16 
      deacetylation than rDNA silencing. The IBA annotation may be conservative 
      but represents possible ancestral function.

    reason: Lacks direct experimental evidence for human SIRT2. This may be

      benzoylation (Kbz) both in vitro and in vivo
    supporting_text: we demonstrate that SIRT2, a NAD+-dependent protein 
      deacetylase, removes histone Kbz both in vitro and in vivo
    reference_section_type: ABSTRACT
  - statement: SIRT2 has debenzoylase activity with Kcat/Km approximately 1/6 of
      deacetylase activity
    supporting_text: Kcat/Km for debenzoylation was approximately 1/6 of that 
      for deacetylation
    reference_section_type: RESULTS
  - statement: Loss of SIRT2 increases global histone Kbz levels especially on 
      H3 and H2B
    supporting_text: By examining core histone Kbz levels in Sirt2+/+ (wild-type
      (WT)) and Sirt2−/− (knockout (KO)) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells,
      we found that loss of SIRT2 expression was associated with increased Kbz 
      levels, especially on H3 and H2B proteins
