## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8IXJ6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-2; EC=2.3.1.286 {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11483616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11812793, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16648462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18722353, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24177535}; AltName: Full=NAD-dependent protein defatty-acylase sirtuin-2 {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.3.1.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25704306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29239724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32103017}; AltName: Full=Regulatory protein SIR2 homolog 2; AltName: Full=SIR2-like protein 2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SIRT2; Synonyms=SIR2L, SIR2L2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sirtuin family. Class I subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** DHS-like_NAD/FAD-binding_dom. (IPR029035); NAD-dep_sirtuin_deacylases. (IPR050134); Sirtuin. (IPR003000); Sirtuin_cat_small_dom_sf. (IPR026591); Sirtuin_class_I. (IPR017328)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SIRT2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SIRT2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SIRT2** (gene ID: SIRT2, UniProt: Q8IXJ6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human SIRT2 (UniProt Q8IXJ6)

Executive verification of identity and scope
- Target: SIRT2 (sirtuin-2), human NAD+-dependent lysine deacylase in the class I sirtuin family (UniProt Q8IXJ6). Literature retrieved below consistently refers to human SIRT2, matching the NAD-dependent deacetylase/defatty-acylase description and sirtuin family/domain architecture; no symbol ambiguity identified. SIRT2 is predominantly cytosolic with nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, consistent with Class I sirtuin features (reviewed and evidenced below) (garmendiaberges2023ageassociatedchangesof pages 2-4, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 4-6).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Enzymatic class and mechanism: SIRT2 is a member of the NAD+-dependent sirtuin family that removes acyl groups from ε-lysine side chains via a catalytic mechanism that couples acyl-lysine to NAD+, releasing nicotinamide and producing 2′-O-acyl-ADP-ribose with the deacylated lysine. Structural pockets A/B/C bind NAD+/nicotinamide, and the extended C (EC) pocket accommodates long-chain acyl groups, underpinning selectivity and allosteric modulation (Pharmaceuticals review, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 6-8).
- Activities and substrate scope: SIRT2 catalyzes lysine deacetylation and defatty-acylation (including demyristoylation); it can remove diverse acyl groups (acetyl to long-chain acyls such as myristoyl) (2024 review; 2024 HTRF screen) (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305000; Jun 2024) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 6-8, yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19). Canonical substrates include α-tubulin K40 (microtubules) and histone sites (e.g., H4K16) among others; the EC pocket explains SIRT2’s efficient demyristoylase activity (2024 J Med Chem SAR; 2024 review) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00229; Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (colcerasa2024structureactivitystudiesof pages 54-56, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 6-8).
- Cellular localization: SIRT2 is largely cytoplasmic but shuttles to the nucleus (e.g., during mitosis or infection). Isoforms differ in localization: major isoforms are cytosolic and shuttling; a nuclear isoform (SIRT2.5) lacks a nuclear export sequence and is inactive in standard biochemical assays (review, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 4-6). Age-focused review and infection studies support nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics and stress- or signaling-dependent relocalization (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12121476; Nov 2023) (garmendiaberges2023ageassociatedchangesof pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Allosteric, substrate-selective SIRT2 inhibition with broad-spectrum antiviral activity: FLS-359 is a SIRT2-selective allosteric inhibitor/modulator that binds in the EC pocket. It partially inhibits deacetylation without blocking demyristoylation and exhibits broad antiviral activity in vitro (e.g., SARS‑CoV‑2 EC50 ≈ 0.3 μM; Zika 0.4 μM; HCMV 0.5 μM; Influenza A ~1.2 μM; RSV 6.7 μM) and reduces HCMV in two humanized mouse models (J Clin Invest, 2023; Pharmaceuticals, 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 3-5, roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 2-4).
- SIRT2 inhibition in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models: Small-molecule Sirt2 inhibitors improved gut epithelial barrier integrity and protected mice from DSS-induced colitis, mechanistically via modulating the ARF6 fatty-acylation cycle and E-cadherin trafficking. Genetic vs pharmacologic perturbation emphasized substrate-selective inhibition advantages (PNAS, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; Apr 2024) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5).
- Enzyme screening and modality innovation: A 2024 homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay was developed to identify SIRT2 deacetylase versus demyristoylase inhibitors, discovering a compound with dual inhibition (IC50 deacetylase 7 μM; demyristoylase 37 μM) and detecting deacetylation-specific inhibitors (PLOS ONE, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305000; Jun 2024) (yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19). Structure–activity studies in 2024 characterized new selective chemotypes for SIRT2 deacetylase inhibition, including co-crystal structural confirmation and cellular activity (J Med Chem, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00229; Jun 2024) (colcerasa2024structureactivitystudiesof pages 54-56).
- Viral cell-cycle control: SIRT2 deacetylase activity supports early stages of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication through regulation of CDK2 acetylation and the G1–S transition; pharmacologic inhibition with AGK2 at 2.5 μM early post‑infection impairs viral replication (mSystems, 2023) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00510-23; Dec 2023) (betsinger2023sirtuin2promotes pages 5-7).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Host-directed antivirals: FLS-359 and related SIRT2 modulators provide broad-spectrum antiviral activities across DNA and RNA viruses, with in vivo efficacy in HCMV humanized mouse models, and favorable oral PK in mice (t1/2 ~6 h; Cmax 89 μM; AUC 713 μM·h/mL at 50 mg/kg PO) (JCI 2023; Pharmaceuticals 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9).
- Inflammation and barrier disease: In IBD models, Sirt2 inhibitors and modulation of the NMT–SIRT2–ARF6 axis improved epithelial integrity and reduced DSS colitis severity, highlighting translation potential for gut barrier diseases (PNAS, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; Apr 2024) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5).
- Tool compounds and screening platforms: Dual-activity HTS assays and SAR-driven chemotypes broaden the toolbox for selectively modulating SIRT2’s deacetylase versus defatty-acylase activities, enabling substrate-biased pharmacology (PLOS ONE 2024; J Med Chem 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305000; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00229) (yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19, colcerasa2024structureactivitystudiesof pages 54-56).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Substrate-selective modulation is advantageous: Reviews and structural studies indicate that partial, substrate-selective allosteric modulation (e.g., inhibiting deacetylation but sparing demyristoylation) can produce beneficial phenotypes distinct from genetic knockouts, with improved tolerability and efficacy in host-directed anti-infective strategies (JCI 2023; Pharmaceuticals 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9). The IBD study similarly emphasizes the divergence of inhibitor vs genetic phenotypes in vivo (PNAS 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5).
- Context-dependent roles: Age-related and tissue-specific analyses show SIRT2 functions vary by compartment and physiological state; nuclear relocalization during infection reprograms host transcription, while cytosolic functions dominate microtubule regulation and membrane trafficking (Biology 2023; Pharmaceuticals 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12121476; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298) (garmendiaberges2023ageassociatedchangesof pages 2-4, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 4-6, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 11-12).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Enzyme inhibition quantitative data:
  • FLS-359 SIRT2 deacetylase IC50 ≈ 3 μM (≫100 μM for SIRT1/3); partial inhibition persists at saturation; IC50 increased to ~7 μM when peptide substrate increased from 5 to 50 μM; thermal shift ΔTm +1.4°C at 6.25 μM and +2.0°C at 12.5 μM (JCI, 2023) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; Jun 2023) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 2-3, roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 1-2).
  • HTRF screening yielded a dual-activity hit: deacetylase IC50 7 μM and demyristoylase IC50 37 μM (PLOS ONE, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305000; Jun 2024) (yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19).
- Antiviral potency and PK:
  • FLS-359 antiviral IC50/EC50 examples: SARS‑CoV‑2 ~0.3 μM (CC50 15.8 μM, SI ~53); Zika ~0.4 μM (CC50 41.6 μM, SI ~104); HCMV ~0.5 μM (cell-to-cell spread); Influenza A ~1.2 μM (CC50 >100 μM); RSV 6.7 μM (review table) (JCI, 2023; Pharm, 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 3-5, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 2-4).
  • Mouse PK: FLS-359 t1/2 ~6 h; Cmax 89 μM; AUC 713 μM·h/mL at 50 mg/kg PO; tolerated at 50 mg/kg b.i.d. ×14 days without adverse signs (Pharm, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; Sep 2024) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9).
  • HCMV dependency window: AGK2 (2.5 μM) inhibits replication when added before 24 h post-infection; later addition less effective (mSystems, 2023) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00510-23; Dec 2023) (betsinger2023sirtuin2promotes pages 5-7).
- Barrier/inflammation endpoints (IBD): Sirt2 inhibition or Sirt2 knockdown increased epithelial TEER, reduced paracellular permeability (Lucifer Yellow), and decreased serum FITC-dextran leakage in DSS-treated mice; NMT inhibitor IMP-1088 at 5 mg/kg protected DSS mice and at 0.1 μM reduced ARF6 fatty-acylation and ARF6-GTP in Caco-2 cells (PNAS, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; Apr 2024) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5).

Functional and mechanistic roles
A) Enzymatic activities and substrate specificity
- Dual activity: SIRT2 is both a lysine deacetylase and a potent lysine defatty-acylase (including demyristoylase). Structural analyses show an EC/selectivity pocket that accommodates long-chain acyls; allosteric modulators can bias activity toward or against specific acyl substrates (2024 review; JCI 2023; HTRF screen 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305000) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 6-8, roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19).
- Tubulin deacetylation: α-tubulin K40 deacetylation is a foundational SIRT2 function linking SIRT2 to microtubule stability and dynamics (2024 J Med Chem SAR review; age review) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00229; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12121476) (colcerasa2024structureactivitystudiesof pages 54-56, garmendiaberges2023ageassociatedchangesof pages 2-4).
- Defatty-acylation of host proteins: SIRT2 removes lysine fatty acylations installed by bacterial effectors (e.g., Shigella IcsB) on Ras/Rho family members and CHMP5; SIRT2 is transcriptionally induced under Golgi stress via CREB3, enhancing host defense (Nat Commun, 2022) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32227-x; Aug 2022) (wang2022golgistressinduces pages 4-6, wang2022golgistressinduces pages 6-8, wang2022golgistressinduces pages 2-4).
- ARF6 K3 myristoylation cycle: NMT1/2 install lysine myristoylation on ARF6 K3, promoting membrane association during the GTPase cycle; SIRT2 removes this myristoyl group. Pharmacologic Sirt2 inhibition shifts ARF6 dynamics to increase E-cadherin at the cell surface and improve epithelial barrier function (PNAS, 2024) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; Apr 2024) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5).
- CDK2 acetylation: SIRT2 deacetylase activity modulates CDK2 K6 acetylation and controls the G1–S transition, supporting early HCMV replication (mSystems, 2023) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00510-23; Dec 2023) (betsinger2023sirtuin2promotes pages 5-7).

B) Cellular localization and dynamics
- Predominantly cytosolic, associates with microtubules (α-tubulin). SIRT2 shuttles to the nucleus in mitosis and during certain infections, where it deacetylates histone H3K18 and reprograms host transcription; SIRT2 induction by Golgi stress via CREB3 increases cellular defatty-acylase capacity (2024 review; 2023 Biology; 2022 Nat Commun) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12121476; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32227-x) (shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 4-6, garmendiaberges2023ageassociatedchangesof pages 2-4, wang2022golgistressinduces pages 2-4, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 11-12).

C) Pathways and precise roles
- Cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking: Through α-tubulin deacetylation and ARF6 defatty-acylation, SIRT2 regulates microtubule stability, intracellular transport, and junctional trafficking (e.g., E-cadherin recycling), with barrier integrity consequences in gut epithelium (PNAS, 2024; J Med Chem 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00229) (hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5, colcerasa2024structureactivitystudiesof pages 54-56).

Strength of evidence and nuances
- Multiple convergent lines of evidence (enzyme biochemistry, X‑ray structures, cell biology, proteomics, and mouse models) establish SIRT2’s dual enzymatic roles and context-dependent functions. Notably, pharmacologic SIRT2 inhibition can yield different outcomes than genetic loss—consistent with substrate-selective/allosteric mechanisms—illustrated by antiviral and IBD models (JCI 2023; PNAS 2024; review 2024) (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci158978; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319833121; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph17101298) (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9).

Conclusion
Human SIRT2 is an NAD+-dependent lysine deacylase with dual deacetylase and defatty-acylase activities. Its cytosolic localization, nuclear shuttling, and stress-induced regulation allow SIRT2 to couple metabolic state and pathogen/stress signals to cytoskeletal control, membrane trafficking, and gene expression. Recent 2023–2024 advances highlight allosteric, substrate-selective SIRT2 modulators with broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy and proof-of-concept anti-inflammatory benefits in IBD models. Mechanistic precision—distinguishing deacetylase from defatty-acylase outputs—appears central to therapeutic potential and may explain divergences between pharmacologic and genetic perturbation outcomes (roche2023anallostericinhibitor pages 8-10, shenk2024drugstargetingsirtuin pages 8-9, hou2024sirt2inhibitionimproves pages 3-5, yang2024ahomogeneoustimeresolved pages 18-19).
