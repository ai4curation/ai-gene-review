description: KCTD14 encodes a BTB/POZ domain-containing protein that is a member
  of the KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) protein 
  family. The protein contains a T1-type BTB domain (residues 33-130) that is 
  predicted to mediate pentameric homooligomerization based on family-wide 
  structural analysis. Unlike many other KCTD family members, recent 
  AlphaFold-based structural modeling (2024) suggests KCTD14 does NOT form a 
  stable complex with Cullin3 (Cul3), indicating it may not function as a 
  canonical CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor. The protein's primary molecular 
  function remains poorly characterized, though high-throughput interaction 
  studies have detected associations with STK16, TCF4, and ACSF3. KCTD14 shows 
  low tissue specificity and has been detected in parotid gland and 138 other 
  cell types or tissues.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from InterPro domain analysis. The 
      T1-type BTB domain (IPR003131) in KCTD14 is structurally homologous to 
      domains that mediate oligomerization in other KCTD family members. 
      AlphaFold-based structural surveys support that KCTD BTB domains 
      frequently assemble into pentamers, and KCTD14 is expected to oligomerize 
      via its BTB domain in keeping with the family trend (Balasco et al. 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is well-supported by structural homology. The BTB/POZ
      domain is a well-characterized oligomerization domain. Family-wide 
      AlphaFold analyses confirm that KCTD proteins typically form pentameric 
      assemblies via their BTB domains. While direct experimental evidence for 
      KCTD14 oligomerization is lacking, the structural prediction is robust 
      given the high conservation of oligomerization function across BTB 
      domains.

  review:
    summary: This annotation derives from the Rolland et al. 2014 proteome-scale
      human interactome map, which used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify 
      approximately 14,000 high-quality binary protein-protein interactions. 
      This is a high-throughput study without specific KCTD14-focused 
      validation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Per curation guidelines, GO:0005515 (protein binding) is 
      uninformative and should be avoided. The term does not convey any specific
      information about the molecular function of KCTD14. The high-throughput 
      nature of the study means specific interactors were not validated for 
      KCTD14 individually. If specific binding partners were identified, more 
      informative molecular function terms should be used instead. The 
      interaction data itself may be useful but the GO:0005515 annotation is not
      informative.

    reason: Per curation guidelines, GO:0005515 (protein binding) is

      about KCTD14. The underlying interaction data may be valuable for 
      characterizing KCTD14 function, but the GO annotation itself is not

  review:
    summary: This annotation derives from Chen et al. 2018, which established an
      interactome perturbation framework to prioritize damaging missense 
      mutations for developmental disorders. The study analyzed approximately 
      2,000 de novo missense mutations in the context of the human interactome 
      network. This is a computational/high-throughput study focused on mutation
      effects on interactions rather than direct functional characterization.

    reason: Per curation guidelines, GO:0005515 (protein binding) is

      disease-relevant missense mutations by their effects on protein 
      interactions, not on characterizing the specific molecular functions of 
      individual proteins like KCTD14. The generic protein binding annotation 
      provides no insight into KCTD14's specific function.
