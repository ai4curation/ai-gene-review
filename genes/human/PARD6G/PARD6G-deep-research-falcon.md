## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BYG4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Partitioning defective 6 homolog gamma; Short=PAR-6 gamma; AltName: Full=PAR6D;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PARD6G; Synonyms=PAR6G;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PAR6 family. .
- **Key Domains:** PAR6_homolog. (IPR051741); PB1-like. (IPR053793); PB1_dom. (IPR000270); PB1_Par6. (IPR034868); PDZ. (IPR001478)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PARD6G" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PARD6G' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PARD6G** (gene ID: PARD6G, UniProt: Q9BYG4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The requested target is human PARD6G (PAR-6 gamma), UniProt Q9BYG4. Literature on human PAR-6 proteins consistently describes PAR-6 family members as PB1- and PDZ-domain scaffold/adaptor proteins that partner with atypical PKCs (aPKC/PRKCI or PRKCZ) and CDC42 in the Par3–Par6–aPKC complex. Mechanistic and structural data cited below align with this family/domain architecture and function, supporting that PARD6G belongs to the PAR-6 family with PB1 and PDZ domains and a CRIB–PDZ regulatory module characteristic of PAR-6 proteins (human isoform-specific studies are sparse, so several findings are inferred from conserved PAR-6 mechanisms) (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and domains: PAR-6 proteins (including human PARD6G) are polarity adaptors with an N‑terminal PB1 domain that heterodimerizes with the PB1 of aPKC and a C‑terminal CRIB–PDZ module that binds CDC42-GTP and PDZ ligands. This architecture enables assembly of the Par3–Par6–aPKC complex and integration of small GTPase inputs to control apical polarity. A second, lower-affinity interface has been mapped where the Par‑6 CRIB‑PDZ region can directly engage the aPKC kinase domain region (KD‑PBM), complementing the canonical PB1–PB1 interaction (Kd ~20 µM measured biochemically), providing mechanistic basis for Par‑6 modulation of aPKC (see below) (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 32-36).
- Core binding partners and assemblies: PAR-6 binds aPKC (PRKCI/PRKCZ) via PB1–PB1, and binds CDC42‑GTP via the CRIB–PDZ module. PAR-6 and aPKC function within a larger Par network with PAR‑3 and apical determinants such as Crumbs (CRB3), with interactions regulated by CDC42 and PDZ ligands. These assemblies localize to the apical cortex and tight junction region in epithelia to scaffold aPKC activity that enforces apical identity by excluding basolateral factors (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024+; mechanistic highlights)
- Dual-mode Par‑6:aPKC contacts and allosteric regulation (biochemical reconstitution, 2023): Purified-component assays mapped two contacts: (1) PB1–PB1 (Par‑6 PB1 ↔ aPKC PB1‑C1) and (2) CRIB‑PDZ to the aPKC KD‑PBM region. The CRIB‑PDZ–KD‑PBM interaction can displace the aPKC PB1‑C1 regulatory module from the kinase domain/autoinhibitory state, proposing a route by which Par‑6 relieves aPKC autoinhibition; this C‑terminal contact is modulated by CDC42 and PDZ‑ligand engagement, rationalizing context-dependent observations that Par‑6 can inhibit or activate aPKC (Kd ~20 µM for CRIB‑PDZ:KD binding) (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 32-36).
- Structural capture–release model for Par6–aPKC substrate handling (2025; accepted 2024): Cryo‑EM structure of human aPKCι–Par6α with full-length Llgl1 shows a tripartite complex that traps a phosphorylated Llgl1 intermediate (pS663) bridging aPKC and Par‑6, impeding further phosphorylation. Disruption of the Lgl–aPKC interface impedes phosphorylation, while disrupting the Lgl–Par‑6 PDZ contact promotes complex dissociation and completion of multisite phosphorylation. The authors propose a Par‑6 PDZ–regulated capture‑and‑release mechanism in which binding by CDC42‑GTP and apical Crumbs promotes disassembly and substrate release, linking CDC42/Crumbs inputs to spatial control of aPKC activity in polarized membrane domains (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01425-0) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2).

Subcellular localization and functional roles
- Apical cortex/tight junctions in epithelia: CDC42‑GTP engagement of PAR‑6 CRIB–PDZ promotes apical membrane recruitment and tight-junction enrichment of the Par6–aPKC module; PAR‑3 scaffolding and apical determinants contribute to localization. At the apical cortex, aPKC phosphorylates and excludes basolateral substrates (e.g., LGL), reinforcing apico–basal polarity (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2).
- Epithelial polarity and tight junction assembly: The Par3–Par6–aPKC complex is required for apico–basal polarity establishment and tight-junction organization; mechanistic details of Par‑6 regulation of aPKC help explain how signaling and assembly are coupled to junctional localization (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49).
- Front–rear polarity and cell migration: The Par complex integrates CDC42 signaling to recruit and regulate aPKC during cell polarization; biochemical work and network logic from recent analyses emphasize CDC42- and PDZ‑ligand–dependent control of Par6–aPKC assembly and activity, consistent with roles in leading-edge signaling in migrating cells (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27).

Pathways and mechanism of action
- Upstream regulation: CDC42‑GTP binds the Par‑6 CRIB–PDZ module, causing conformational changes that modulate PDZ ligand binding (e.g., Crumbs) and influence the CRIB‑PDZ interaction with the aPKC kinase domain region, thereby affecting aPKC autoinhibition and activation. PAR‑3 provides additional scaffolding and can modulate aPKC substrate access (context-dependent inhibitory effects reported for PAR‑3 CR3-flanking regions) (vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27).
- Catalytic output: aPKC in the complex phosphorylates polarity substrates (e.g., LGL), driving their apical exclusion and domain segregation. The cryo‑EM capture–release mechanism shows aPDZ‑regulated kinetic control over multisite phosphorylation and spatial substrate handling, coordinated by CDC42/Crumbs inputs (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2).

Disease associations and real-world relevance
- Imprinting/epigenetic regulation at the PARD6G locus: A case report of complete paternal isodisomy of chromosome 18 identified hypomethylation/demethylation of the PARD6G‑AS1 promoter, consistent with parent‑of‑origin methylation (maternal imprint) at this locus; the authors discuss potential phenotypic influence of altered methylation at PARD6G‑AS1 in the clinical presentation (arthrogryposis), and summarize broader evidence that PARD6G/PARD6G‑AS1 carries imprinting marks in human tissues (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1297754; published Dec 2023) (moch2023casereportcomplete pages 6-6, moch2023casereportcomplete pages 4-6).
- Cancer relevance (current evidence limits): Large-scale, isoform‑specific cancer statistics for PARD6G were not found in the retrieved 2023–2025 sources. Nonetheless, the mechanistic literature demonstrates that PAR‑6–aPKC signaling governs epithelial polarity and apical junctions, processes frequently perturbed in carcinomas. The new structural mechanism for Par6–aPKC substrate capture and CDC42/Crumbs‑regulated release provides a rationale for how dysregulation could mispattern apical–basal identity in disease. Where PARD6G-specific data are limited, functional inference rests on conserved domain architecture and shared interactions among human PAR‑6 isoforms (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27).

Expert opinions and network logic (recent reviews/analyses)
- Recent biochemical and conceptual syntheses emphasize: (i) multiple, cooperative Par‑6:aPKC contacts (PB1–PB1 and CRIB‑PDZ ↔ aPKC KD‑PBM) that tune aPKC autoinhibition and catalytic output; (ii) allosteric integration of CDC42‑GTP and PDZ ligands (e.g., Crumbs) in controlling Par6–aPKC assembly, localization, and activity; and (iii) dynamic cycling between distinct Par assemblies (with PAR‑3 and apical determinants) underlying robust polarity establishment. These expert perspectives provide a coherent framework for how Par6‑centered scaffolding establishes and maintains apical polarity in human cells (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49).

Relevant statistics and data points from recent studies
- Affinity of the newly described Par‑6 CRIB‑PDZ interaction with the aPKC KD‑PBM region is reported at Kd ~20 µM in pull‑down/biochemical assays with purified proteins, highlighting a low‑affinity but functionally significant regulatory contact that can be missed without targeted constructs (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 32-36).
- The cryo‑EM structure delineates a phosphorylated Llgl1 pS663 intermediate held within the Par6–aPKC complex; mutational disruptions at either the Llgl1–aPKC or Llgl1–Par6 PDZ interfaces alter complex assembly and phosphorylation progression, providing structure–function evidence for a PDZ‑regulated capture–release cycle coordinated by CDC42/Crumbs (doi: 10.1038/s41594-024-01425-0) (earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2).
- Clinical epigenetics: Hypomethylation/demethylation at PARD6G‑AS1 accompanying paternal iUPD18 in a patient underscores parent‑of‑origin methylation control at the locus and the potential for imprinting perturbations to contribute to disease phenotypes (doi: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1297754) (moch2023casereportcomplete pages 6-6, moch2023casereportcomplete pages 4-6).

Notes on evidence scope
- Direct, isoform‑specific functional studies on human PARD6G (PAR‑6γ) remain limited compared to PAR‑6α/β; however, the defining PB1 and CRIB‑PDZ domains, the conserved aPKC and CDC42 interactions, and their roles in the Par complex are shared across human PAR‑6 proteins. Accordingly, we infer PARD6G function from conserved mechanisms, highlighting where findings derive from PAR‑6 family/complex data in human systems (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114).

Conclusion
Human PARD6G encodes a PAR‑6 family polarity adaptor with PB1 and CRIB‑PDZ domains that scaffold aPKC and CDC42 within the Par3–Par6–aPKC complex at the apical cortex/tight junctions. Recent biochemical and structural studies reveal dual Par‑6:aPKC interfaces and a Par6‑PDZ–regulated capture–release mechanism for aPKC substrates (e.g., LGL) that is coordinated by CDC42 and Crumbs, offering a detailed molecular basis for how PAR‑6 directs aPKC localization and catalytic output to establish apico–basal polarity. Although PARD6G‑specific disease statistics are sparse, imprinting at the PARD6G/PARD6G‑AS1 locus is documented, and the central role of the Par6–aPKC module in epithelial polarity and junctional organization provides a compelling mechanistic link to disease contexts where polarity is disrupted (vargas2023insightsintothea pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 23-27, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 32-36, vargas2023insightsintothe pages 44-49, earl2025capturemutualinhibition pages 1-2, vargas2023insightsintothea pages 112-114, moch2023casereportcomplete pages 6-6, moch2023casereportcomplete pages 4-6).
