description: >-
  PARD6G (PAR-6 gamma) encodes a polarity adaptor protein belonging to the PAR6 family.
  The protein contains an N-terminal PB1 domain that heterodimerizes with atypical protein kinase C
  (aPKC/PRKCI or PRKCZ) and a C-terminal CRIB-PDZ module that binds CDC42-GTP and PDZ ligands.
  PARD6G functions as an essential scaffold within the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC polarity complex, linking
  activated Rho family GTPases (CDC42, RAC1) to aPKC signaling at the apical cortex and tight junctions
  of polarized epithelial cells. The protein integrates CDC42 and Crumbs inputs to regulate aPKC
  activity through a capture-and-release mechanism that controls phosphorylation of polarity substrates
  like LGL, thereby establishing and maintaining apicobasal polarity in epithelial cells.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PAR6 proteins regulate the localization of polarity substrates through the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC
      complex. aPKC phosphorylates substrates like LGL, driving their exclusion from the apical
      membrane domain (Earl et al. 2025, vargas2023). The IBA annotation is consistent with the
      conserved role of PAR6 family members in controlling cellular localization of polarity determinants.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The PAR6-aPKC complex controls the subcellular localization of polarity substrates through
      phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. PARD6G as a scaffold regulates where aPKC acts,
      thereby regulating cellular localization of downstream targets. This is a core function.

      Cell polarity establishment is the defining function of the PAR protein family. PARD6G

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the specific functional differences between human PARD6A, PARD6B, and PARD6G isoforms?
  - question: Does PARD6G have non-epithelial functions in humans, such as in asymmetric division of stem cells?
  - question: What is the significance of the nuclear localization inferred by IBA annotation?
suggested_experiments:

      Isoform-specific knockdown/knockout studies in human epithelial cells to determine
      if PARD6G has unique functions compared to PARD6A and PARD6B
    hypothesis: PARD6G may have distinct or redundant functions compared to other PAR6 isoforms
