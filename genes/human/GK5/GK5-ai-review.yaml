description: 'Glycerol kinase 5, tissue-specialized glycerol kinase enzyme predominantly
  expressed in skin sebaceous glands. Member of FGGY carbohydrate kinase family. Catalyzes
  ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to produce sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the
  first step of glycerol utilization pathway. ~60 kDa protein with catalytic aspartate
  residues (Asp-280, Asp-443) essential for enzymatic activity. Cytosolic enzyme with
  distinct dual role: (1) Metabolic function - provides glycerol-3-phosphate for triglyceride
  synthesis in sebaceous glands; (2) Regulatory function - negatively regulates SREBP
  (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) processing and activation. Binds C-terminal
  regulatory domain of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, inhibiting their cleavage and nuclear
  translocation, thereby limiting expression of lipid biosynthetic genes in skin.
  Skin-specific negative regulator of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis - loss
  causes excessive lipid accumulation (cholesterol, triglycerides, ceramides) in sebaceous
  glands and pronounced alopecia in mice. GK5-deficient Gk5^toku mouse exhibits ~80%
  lethality due to hair growth defects, rescuable by simvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase
  inhibitor). Kinase activity essential for SREBP regulatory function - catalytically-dead
  mutants fail to suppress SREBP activation. Distinguishable from X-linked glycerol
  kinase (GK) which cannot compensate for GK5''s regulatory role. Expression widespread
  at mRNA level but protein predominantly in skin; enriched in sebaceous glands. In
  cancer, GK5 upregulated in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells where it promotes cell
  survival through SREBP1/SCD1 pathway, conferring drug resistance. GK5 enables cancer
  cells to maintain lipogenesis and resist apoptosis under EGFR inhibition. Potential
  therapeutic target in oncology and dermatology.'
