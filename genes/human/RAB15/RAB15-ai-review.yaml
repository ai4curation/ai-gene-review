description: >-
  RAB15 is a small GTPase of the Rab family that regulates endocytic membrane trafficking,
  specifically at the interface between sorting endosomes and the endocytic recycling compartment
  (ERC). RAB15 localizes to early/sorting endosomes and the perinuclear ERC, where it modulates
  receptor recycling pathways. In its GTP-bound active state, RAB15 recruits effector proteins
  including REP15, which specifically localizes to the ERC and regulates slow receptor recycling.
  Wild-type and GTP-locked RAB15 inhibit both fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis
  and reduce homotypic early endosome fusion, counteracting the stimulatory effects of Rab5.
  RAB15 also participates in regulated exocytosis, cooperating with Rab27a and the shared effector
  Munc13-4 in Weibel-Palade body secretion in endothelial cells. The protein has been detected
  at cilia in high-throughput screens, though it is not required for primary cilium formation.

      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. RAB15 has been directly shown to participate
      in Weibel-Palade body exocytosis in endothelial cells, where it cooperates with Rab27a
      and the effector Munc13-4 to drive secretion [PMID:22899725].

      The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental data. PMID:22899725 demonstrates
      through complete Rab screening that RAB15 localizes to Weibel-Palade body membranes
      and knockdown experiments show it is required for WPB exocytosis, cooperating with
      Rab27a via the shared effector Munc13-4.

          Apart from Rab3 and Rab27, we identified three additional Rabs, Rab15 (a previously
          reported endocytic Rab), Rab33 and Rab37, on the WPB limiting membrane. A knockdown
          approach using siRNAs showed that among these five WPB Rabs only Rab3, Rab27 and
          Rab15 are required for exocytosis.

        a specific effector of Rab27, Munc13-4, appears to be also an effector of Rab15
        and is required for WPB exocytosis

  findings:
    - statement: RAB15 localizes to sorting/early endosomes and perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment
      supporting_text: >-
        RAB15 localizes to sorting/early endosomes (SEs/EEs) and the perinuclear endocytic
        recycling compartment (ERC), where it co-resides with Rab4/5 on SEs and Rab11 on ERC
    - statement: RAB15 regulates endocytic sorting and recycling of the transferrin receptor
      supporting_text: >-
        RAB15 regulates endocytic sorting and recycling of the transferrin receptor (TfR),
        helping partition cargo between rapid recycling from SEs and slower recycling via the ERC
    - statement: REP15 was identified as a direct specific RAB15 effector
      supporting_text: >-
        REP15 was identified as a direct, specific RAB15 effector that prefers RAB15-GTP,
        colocalizes perinuclearly with RAB15, and regulates TfR recycling

    id: GO:0003924
    label: GTPase activity
  description: >-
    RAB15 is a small GTPase with intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity (EC:3.6.5.2). The GTPase
    cycle is fundamental to its regulatory function, with GTP-bound active RAB15 recruiting
    effectors and GDP-bound inactive RAB15 being extracted from membranes by GDI.
    Supported by functional characterization of nucleotide-binding mutants [PMID:10837464].
