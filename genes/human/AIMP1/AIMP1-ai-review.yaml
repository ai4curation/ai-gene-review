description: >-
  AIMP1 (also known as p43) is a non-catalytic scaffold component of the multi-aminoacyl
  tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in mammals. It contains an EMAPII-like OB-fold domain
  that binds tRNA and contributes to tRNA recruitment for the MSC. AIMP1 interacts
  with RARS1 (arginyl-tRNA synthetase) and QARS1 (glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase) within
  the complex and stimulates arginyl-tRNA synthetase catalytic activity. The protein
  is primarily cytosolic where it functions as part of the MSC. Upon apoptosis, AIMP1
  is cleaved by caspase-7 at its C-terminus to release the EMAP-II cytokine domain,
  which has proinflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities. This cleavage eliminates
  tRNA-binding capacity and represents a transition from intracellular scaffold to
  extracellular cytokine. AIMP1 also has additional signaling functions including
  negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling through Smurf2 stabilization, and regulation
  of ER chaperone trafficking (gp96/KDELR1). Mutations in AIMP1 cause hypomyelinating
  leukodystrophy type 3 (HLD3).

        This annotation is based on sequence similarity to mouse AIMP1 (P31230), which
        has been shown to be involved in glucose homeostasis through glucagon secretion.

  - description: >-
      AIMP1 is a non-catalytic scaffold component of the MSC (multi-aminoacyl tRNA
      synthetase complex). Multiple studies confirm it is an integral part of this
      complex along with AIMP2 and AIMP3 (PMID:19131329, PMID:14500886). The complex
      contains nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
