## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q12904
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1; AltName: Full=Multisynthase complex auxiliary component p43; Contains: RecName: Full=Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide 2; Short=EMAP-2; AltName: Full=Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II; Short=EMAP-II; AltName: Full=Small inducible cytokine subfamily E member 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=AIMP1; Synonyms=EMAP2, SCYE1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** NA-bd_OB-fold. (IPR012340); tRNA-bd_dom. (IPR002547); Tyrosine-tRNA_ligase_regulator. (IPR051270); tRNA_bind (PF01588)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AIMP1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AIMP1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AIMP1** (gene ID: AIMP1, UniProt: Q12904) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan status: Verified identity and domains of human AIMP1 (UniProt Q12904) and gathered 2023–2024 evidence on structure, intracellular roles in the multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), extracellular processing/signaling, and emerging applications (hair growth peptide TN41). Below is a comprehensive, citation-based report prioritized to recent, authoritative sources.

Comprehensive research report: AIMP1 (Q12904) — structure, function, localization, and recent developments

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and synonyms: AIMP1 (also known as p43; gene aliases EMAP2, SCYE1) is a human subunit of the multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). AIMP1 contains an EMAP-II-like OB-fold tRNA-binding module and functions as an organizational scaffold in the MSC (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2). AIMP1 can be proteolytically processed to release the cytokine EMAP-II, historically linked to proinflammatory and anti-/pro-angiogenic effects depending on context (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1; Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 15-15).
- Domains: AIMP1 harbors an EMAPII-like OB-fold that engages tRNA, and additional basic regions that contribute to multivalent tRNA contacts in the MSC. The OB-fold region is the part proteolytically released as EMAP-II during apoptosis (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Primary role: In the cytosol, AIMP1 is a non-enzymatic scaffolding/organizing subunit of the MSC, aiding assembly and potentially tRNA recruitment via its OB-fold, rather than catalyzing aminoacylation (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).

2) Structure and molecular mechanism (with 2023–2024 updates)
- OB-fold recognition of tRNA 3′ ends: A 2024 co-crystal structure of an EMAPII-like OB-fold protein (Trbp111) bound to tRNAIle at 2.6 Å revealed that EMAPII-like OB folds recognize the single-stranded tRNA 3′ end, with precise readout of the conserved 3′-CA dinucleotide. The study places AIMP1’s OB-fold in this structural paradigm and explains its tRNA-binding function in the MSC (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Supplementary contacts: In Arc1p/AIMP1, additional basic regions outside the OB-fold enhance affinity via contacts to the tRNA body, consistent with a multivalent tRNA-recruitment role in the MSC (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Proteolysis and EMAP-II generation: The OB-fold region of AIMP1 is cleaved during apoptosis (caspase-7 is implicated), releasing EMAP-II and eliminating tRNA-binding capacity, thereby transitioning AIMP1 from intracellular scaffold to extracellular cytokine (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).

3) Intracellular role in the MSC and binding partners
- MSC scaffold: Human AIMP1 acts with AIMP2/AIMP3 as an organizational scaffold for MSC aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and can directly complex with specific synthetases (e.g., ArgRS/GlnRS), consistent with structural analyses of MSC subcomplexes in prior work and summarized in recent literature (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 15-15).
- Immunoregulatory interactions and trafficking: AIMP1 interacts with the ER chaperone gp96 and COPI/KDELR machinery; loss of AIMP1 misroutes gp96 to the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, AIMP1 also binds and stabilizes Smurf2, promoting TGF-β receptor ubiquitination and degradation, thereby antagonizing TGF-β signaling. Region mapping indicates AIMP1 residues 193–312 bind Smurf2 WW domains, while an N-terminal region associates with gp96/KDELR (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10).

4) Extracellular biology: EMAP-II and AIMP1-derived peptides
- EMAP-II release and function: C-terminal cleavage of AIMP1 yields EMAP-II, a proinflammatory cytokine associated with macrophage recruitment, inflammation, and angiogenesis control. EMAP-II generation coincides with apoptosis-associated caspase activation (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2). Reviews summarize EMAP-II as elevated in microglia and contributing to proinflammatory programs (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9).
- N-terminal AIMP1 fragment and hair growth (2024): AIMP1 also yields a secreted N-terminal peptide under Wnt stimulation in hair follicle stem cells. MMP1 cleaves AIMP1 to generate an N-terminal fragment (active core TN41, aa 6–46), which is secreted and activates dermal papilla cells (DPCs), triggering Akt and ERK signaling and increasing β-catenin, thereby promoting hair shaft elongation and hair regrowth (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 3-5).

5) Localization
- Cytosolic and MSC-associated: AIMP1 is primarily cytosolic as part of the MSC; the OB-fold-mediated tRNA interaction is consistent with cytosolic tRNA handling (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Dynamic subcellular shifts in disease: In chondrocytes, AIMP1 is reported to shift from nuclear localization in healthy cells to cytoplasmic in osteoarthritis; reduction of AIMP1 reinstates TGF-β signaling and cartilage markers in models (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 10-11).
- Secreted extracellular fragments: Under Wnt stimulation, HFSCs secrete an N-terminal AIMP1 fragment processed by MMP1; this was verified by fragment-specific antibodies and protease inhibitor studies (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 3-5, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).

6) Pathways and signaling roles
- TGF-β pathway negative regulation: AIMP1 physically supports Smurf2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TGF-β receptors, thereby suppressing TGF-β signaling; loss of AIMP1 enhances TGF-β-driven gene expression. This mechanism links AIMP1 to fibrosis and cartilage biology (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 10-11).
- Immune activation and NF-κB/MAPK axes: AIMP1 (full-length or EMAP-II) engages dendritic cells, B cells, and microglia, elevating IL-6, IL-1β, TNF and activation markers through JNK/p38/NF-κB signaling; overactivity is implicated in autoimmunity and multiple myeloma osteoclastogenesis (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9).
- Angiogenesis and apoptosis: The AIMP1/EMAP-II axis is linked to macrophage recruitment, inflammation, and angiogenesis control in the context of OB-fold cleavage; EMAP-II has classically been linked to endothelial responses and apoptosis, as summarized in 2024 structural work (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2) and in overview of p43 extracellular activities (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 15-15).
- Hair follicle signaling: The AIMP1-derived TN41 fragment activates Akt/ERK and stabilizes β-catenin in DPCs, promoting hair growth (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).

7) Recent developments (2023–2024 priority) and expert perspectives
- Structural advance: 2024 elucidation of EMAPII-like OB-fold recognition of the universal tRNA 3′-CA explains how AIMP1’s OB-fold engages tRNA in the MSC, and how cleavage would repurpose this domain as a cytokine (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Immune regulation by the mARS complex: A 2024 immunology synthesis details AIMP1’s roles in immune cell activation, ER chaperone trafficking (gp96), suppression of TGF-β signaling via Smurf2, and disease links, highlighting therapeutic exploration (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 10-11).
- Application/hair biology: A 2024 study identifies a defined N-terminal peptide (TN41, aa 6–46) generated by MMP1 that enhances human hair follicle shaft growth ex vivo and accelerates hair regrowth in mice through DPC activation, nominating AIMP1-derived peptides as potential therapeutics in alopecia (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 3-5).

8) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Preclinical therapeutic concepts: Anti-AIMP1 monoclonal antibody approaches (e.g., reported as reducing lupus nephritis severity and inflammatory cytokines while increasing IL-10+ Tregs) and exosomal siAIMP1 are discussed in 2024 immunology synthesis, suggesting avenues for autoimmune disease and myeloma-associated bone disease; clinical translation status is preclinical in the cited review (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10).
- Regenerative dermatology: The TN41 peptide improved hair shaft elongation in cultured human hair follicles and hair regrowth in mouse models, supporting development of peptide-based hair growth agents (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).

9) Relevant statistics and concrete data points
- Hair follicle biology (2024): AIMP1 protein intensity was approximately three-fold higher in healthy versus sparse-hair regions; inducible AIMP1 mice achieved >80% back-hair regrowth versus controls; MMP1 cleaved AIMP1 within 2 h and completely by 4 h in vitro; siRNA against AIMP1 reduced the secreted N-terminal fragment by ~50% (Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 3-5, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic mapping (immunoregulation): AIMP1 residues 193–312 bind Smurf2 WW domains; AIMP1–gp96/KDELR interactions influence gp96 surface display; anti-AIMP1 reduced IFN-γ, IL-17A, IL-6 and increased IL-10+ Tregs in lupus nephritis models (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10).

10) Expert analysis and open questions
- Receptor identity for EMAP-II and AIMP1-derived fragments: 2024 sources emphasize functional outcomes (inflammation, macrophage recruitment, angiogenesis) but do not definitively establish a single human receptor in these new data; receptor usage may be cell- and context-dependent and remains an important area for clarification (Nature Communications, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50730-1; Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10).
- Post-translational regulation and trafficking: The precise signals and PTMs controlling AIMP1 dissociation from the MSC, cleavage (beyond caspases in apoptosis and MMP1 in HFSCs), and secretory routes require further definition (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1423510; Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.101127) (amanya2024themarscomplex pages 10-11, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).

11) Mandatory verification checklist
- Gene symbol and description match UniProt: AIMP1 (p43) with EMAP-II contained region — verified and consistent with human (Homo sapiens) protein Q12904 (Nature Communications, 2024-07; Int J Biol Sci, 2024-10-21) (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 15-15).
- Organism: All cited primary 2024 structural/immunology sources explicitly discuss human AIMP1 or place AIMP1 within metazoan MSC biology; the hair study uses human hair follicles and mouse models (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, kim2024aimp1derivedpeptidesecreted pages 1-2).
- Domains/family: EMAPII-like OB-fold and tRNA-binding confirmed (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2). No conflicting gene symbol usage detected.

Notes on evidence limits
- Historically reported EMAP-II receptors (e.g., CXCR3 variants) and anti-/pro-angiogenic biphasic activities are part of the legacy literature; however, explicit receptor validation and dose-dependence parameters were not directly available in the 2023–2024 sources cited here. Where receptor identity or precise angiogenic polarity could not be confirmed from 2024 literature, claims have been framed cautiously (juru2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 8-9, amanya2024themarscomplex pages 9-10).
