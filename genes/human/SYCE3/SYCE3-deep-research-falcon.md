## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** A1L190
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Synaptonemal complex central element protein 3 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:35245}; AltName: Full=Testis highly expressed gene 2 protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B5KM66}; Short=THEG-2 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B5KM66};
- **Gene Information:** Name=SYCE3 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:35245}; Synonyms=C22orf41, THEG2 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:B5KM66};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Synaptonemal_3. (IPR028145); Synaptonemal_3 (PF15191)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SYCE3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SYCE3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SYCE3** (gene ID: SYCE3, UniProt: A1L190) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human SYCE3 (UniProt A1L190)

Verification of Identity and Domain Context
- Identity and organism: The target is Homo sapiens SYCE3 (Synaptonemal complex central element protein 3), a meiosis-specific component of the synaptonemal complex (SC) central element. Recent reviews of human SC biology list SYCE3 among the central-element proteins, alongside SYCE1, SYCE2, TEX12, and SIX6OS1 (Cells; June 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12131718) (llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4). 
- Domain/family: Literature and structural work align with a helix–loop–helix dimer architecture consistent with synaptonemal_3 annotations (PF15191; IPR028145), with detailed crystallographic and biophysical characterization available (J Biol Chem; June 2019; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA119.008404) (dunne2019amolecularmodel pages 14-15).

Key Concepts and Definitions
- Synaptonemal complex (SC): A supramolecular, tripartite scaffold that zippers homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase I, creating a defined inter-axial spacing and supporting recombination processes leading to crossovers (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 1-3). 
- Central element (CE): The midline substructure of the SC comprising SYCP1 lattice and central-element proteins (SYCE family, TEX12, SIX6OS1) that coordinate synapsis maturation and crossover control; human-focused reviews include SYCE3 in this CE cohort (Cells; June 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12131718) (llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4).

Primary Molecular Function of SYCE3
- Remodeling adapter of the SYCP1 lattice: SYCP1 forms a tetrameric coiled-coil lattice via its α-helical core (notably the αNcore). SYCE3 binds directly to the SYCP1 tetrameric core region (aa 206–362; αNcore) with nanomolar affinity, disrupts the native SYCP1 tetramer interface to form 2:1 SYCP1–SYCE3 complexes, and self-assembles to generate an integrated SYCP1–SYCE3 lattice that matures the CE and supports recombination. This remodeling promotes recruitment and integration of other CE complexes necessary for robust synapsis and crossover maturation (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 1-3, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4).

Protein–Protein Interactions and Structural Roles
- Direct binding to SYCP1: SYCE3 binds the SYCP1 αNcore with ~170 nM affinity (ITC), converting the SYCP1 tetramer into a 2:1 heterotrimeric coiled-coil and enabling lattice integration via SYCE3 self-assembly (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4).
- Bridging CE complexes: SYCE3 interacts with SYCE1–SIX6OS1 and SYCE2–TEX12, acting as a molecular adapter that couples the remodeled SYCP1 lattice to these CE complexes, thereby enabling structural maturation of the SC (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1; Cells; June 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12131718) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4, llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4).
- Self-assembly mechanism: Independent structural/biophysical work shows SYCE3 forms helix–loop–helix dimers capable of hierarchical end-on and lateral oligomerization, including domain-swapped higher-order assemblies that stabilize the CE; refined crystal structure and SAXS/SEC-MALS analyses underpin this model (J Biol Chem; June 2019; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA119.008404) (dunne2019amolecularmodel pages 14-15).

Cellular Localization and Assembly Order
- Localization: SYCE3 localizes to the central element of the SC in meiotic prophase nuclei. Evidence from humanized mouse models of SYCE1 deficiency shows SYCE3 (and SYCP1) can load early onto assembling axes even when TEX12 fails to load in the absence of SYCE1, indicating early CE assembly steps that include SYCE3 (Molecular Human Reproduction; May 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa032) (hernandezlopez2020familialprimaryovarian pages 17-22, llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4).

Pathway Context: Meiosis, Synapsis, and Recombination
- SYCE3 operates in the SC central region to couple synapsis with recombination. By remodeling the SYCP1 lattice and recruiting CE complexes, SYCE3 facilitates maturation of the synapsis interface, supporting DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair progression and crossover formation (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 1-3, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4).

Recent Developments (2023–2024 Priority)
- Mechanistic advance: The 2023 structural study demonstrates that SYCE3’s binding to SYCP1 is not merely accessory but actively remodels the nascent SYCP1 lattice into an integrated SYCP1–SYCE3 architecture, a key step in maturing the central element and enabling downstream CE complex integration (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 1-3, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 6-8).
- In vivo constraints on SC assembly: Mouse genetics targeting the SYCP1 head-to-head interface reported residual SYCE3 staining on unsynapsed axes, highlighting that SYCE3’s presence can precede or persist despite defective SYCP1 lattice formation, further informing assembly hierarchies (Science Advances; Oct 2023; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1562) (huang2022novelcopynumber pages 11-12).
- Review synthesis: Human-focused review in 2023 summarizes central-element composition and interaction wiring, including SYCE3’s interactions within the CE network, providing a current consensus view (Cells; June 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12131718) (llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4).

Phenotypes and Clinical Relevance
- Mammalian models: Syce3 mutant mice (e.g., WY separation-of-function allele and deletion) exhibit severely reduced testis weight, depleted epididymal sperm, fragmented/insufficient SYCP1 recruitment, extensive asynapsis across SYCP3-marked axes, RAD51 foci persistence, and meiotic arrest with infertility—defining a causal role for SYCE3 in synapsis and meiosis (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 6-8).
- Human inference and related genes: Human infertility has been robustly linked to mutations in central-element genes such as SYCE1 (NOA and POI), with patient and model evidence; multivalent CE interactions (e.g., SYCE1–SIX6OS1) are known to be disrupted in infertility. These support the pathogenic potential of CE dysfunction and contextualize SYCE3’s essential role, even as direct human SYCE3 pathogenic variants remain limited in the recent literature surveyed here (BMC Medical Genomics; Jun 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-022-01288-8; Molecular Human Reproduction; May 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/molehr/gaaa032) (huang2022novelcopynumber pages 11-12, hernandezlopez2020familialprimaryovarian pages 17-22).

Current Applications and Implementations
- Diagnostic genetics in infertility: Whole-exome/genome sequencing and targeted gene panels are applied to idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI); central-element genes feature in these assessments. These approaches have identified pathogenic variants in SC genes (e.g., SYCE1) and are suitable for evaluating CE genes including SYCE3 in appropriate clinical contexts (BMC Medical Genomics; Jun 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-022-01288-8) (huang2022novelcopynumber pages 11-12).
- Experimental systems: CRISPR-engineered mouse alleles of Syce3 and integrated structural biophysics (ITC, SEC-MALS, SAXS) provide a translational framework for interpreting variants of uncertain significance in CE genes, informing functional assays and mechanistic modeling (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1; J Biol Chem; Jun 2019; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA119.008404) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 6-8, dunne2019amolecularmodel pages 14-15).

Expert Opinions and Authoritative Analyses
- Structural-mechanistic perspective: The 2023 NSMB study reframes SYCE3 as an active architect of the SC central region—remodeling the SYCP1 lattice and serving as a molecular adapter to CE complexes—rather than a passive scaffold, aligning with an emerging view that CE assembly is a stepwise remodeling process (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 1-3, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4, crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 6-8).
- Human biology review: The 2023 review emphasizes the clinical implications of SC dysfunction and catalogs CE interaction networks including SYCE3, reinforcing a consensus that CE proteins, including SYCE3, are integral to human meiosis and fertility (Cells; June 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12131718) (llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4).

Relevant Statistics and Data Points
- Binding affinity: SYCE3–SYCP1 interaction measured by ITC at ~170 ± 30 nM (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 3-4).
- Mouse phenotypes: Syce3WY/WY and Syce3Δ/Δ show severely reduced testis mass and sperm output with pachytene arrest and large regions of asynapsis; SYCP1 signal is notably reduced in the WY mutant relative to null, indicating perturbed lattice remodeling (Nature Struct Mol Biol; Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00909-1) (crichton2023structuralmaturationof pages 6-8).
- Clinical genetics scope: Central-element gene defects (e.g., SYCE1 CNVs/LoF) cause meiotic arrest and NOA, supporting inclusion of CE genes in diagnostic panels for male infertility, with datasets and case reports accumulating in recent years (BMC Medical Genomics; Jun 2022; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-022-01288-8) (huang2022novelcopynumber pages 11-12).

Gene/Protein Identification Safeguards
- The gene symbol SYCE3 unequivocally matches the human meiosis-specific CE protein described above. No conflicting human gene symbol usage was detected in the surveyed literature; synonyms include C22orf41/THEG2, consistent with UniProt/HGNC. Domain/family (PF15191/IPR028145) assignments align with SYCE3’s documented helix–loop–helix dimer and self-assembly properties (Cells 2023; J Biol Chem 2019) (llano2023synaptonemalcomplexin pages 2-4, dunne2019amolecularmodel pages 14-15).

*Table: Compact, citable summary of human SYCE3 (UniProt A1L190) covering identity, function, interactions, localization, phenotypes, clinical relevance, and structural data with primary-source URLs and dates.*

Conclusions
SYCE3 (A1L190) is a central-element architect of the human synaptonemal complex that binds and remodels the SYCP1 lattice into an integrated SYCP1–SYCE3 structure, bridging to SYCE1–SIX6OS1 and SYCE2–TEX12 complexes. This remodeling is essential for synapsis maturation and for facilitating meiotic recombination and crossover formation. Mouse genetics establish that SYCE3 is required for meiotic progression and fertility. While direct human SYCE3 pathogenic variants remain comparatively sparse in recent publications, strong clinical-genetic evidence from related central-element genes (e.g., SYCE1) and the mechanistic role of SYCE3 support its inclusion in research and diagnostic consideration for meiosis-based infertility. These insights stem from authoritative 2023 structural and human-biology sources and are supported by structural biophysics of SYCE3 self-assembly.
