description: >-
  SYCE3 (Synaptonemal complex central element protein 3) is a major component of the transverse central element
  of synaptonemal complexes (SCs), formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. SYCE3 is an
  88 amino acid protein with a coiled-coil domain (residues 7-75) that forms homodimers and can self-assemble
  into higher-order homooligomers through staggered lateral interactions (mediated by W41/Y44) and end-on
  interactions (domain swapping via an open loop conformation). The core function of SYCE3 is to actively
  remodel the SYCP1 tetramer lattice during early synapsis: SYCE3 binds to SYCP1 tetramers and converts them
  to 2:1 SYCP1-SYCE3 heterotrimers, disrupting the tetramer interface. SYCE3 self-assembly then establishes a
  new integrated SYCP1-SYCE3 lattice by providing 'tetramer-like' interfaces between SYCE3-bound SYCP1 dimers.
  SYCE3 also recruits downstream central element complexes SYCE1-SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12, and promotes fibrous
  assembly of SYCE2-TEX12. Mouse Syce3 knockouts and Syce3WY/WY mutants are infertile with defective SC assembly,
  confirming the essential role of SYCE3's self-assembly in meiotic chromosome synapsis.

      SYCE3 localization to the central element of the synaptonemal complex is strongly supported by structural

      While SYCE3 is required for proper SC formation which is necessary for meiotic recombination, the role
      in reciprocal recombination is indirect. SYCE3's primary function is in structural remodeling of the SC
      lattice, not direct participation in recombination.

      Reciprocal meiotic recombination is a downstream consequence of SYCE3's role in SC assembly. The SC

      This annotation from ComplexPortal is based on a review article (Cahoon & Hawley 2016) that discusses

  - description: >-
      SYCE3 is a major structural component of the central element of the synaptonemal complex. It localizes
      to the central element by forming 2:1 heterotrimers with SYCP1 molecules that span between the central
      and lateral elements. SYCE3 is essential for SC assembly, functioning by actively remodeling the nascent
      SYCP1 tetramer lattice. SYCE3 binding disrupts SYCP1 tetramers and establishes a new integrated SYCP1-SYCE3
      lattice through its self-assembly. Mouse Syce3 knockouts show meiotic arrest with defective SC assembly.
      SYCE3 also recruits downstream central element complexes SYCE1-SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12 to the synaptonemal
      complex with micromolar affinity and promotes fibrous assembly of SYCE2-TEX12.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise stoichiometry and structure of the integrated SYCP1-SYCE3 lattice in vivo? While in vitro studies show 2:1 SYCP1-SYCE3 heterotrimers and characterize their assembly, the precise structure of the integrated lattice in the native SC remains to be determined.
  - question: How does SYCE3 coordinate with other CE proteins temporally during synapsis? The hierarchical recruitment of SYCE1-SIX6OS1 and SYCE2-TEX12 by SYCE3 suggests temporal coordination, but the precise timing and regulatory mechanisms are unclear.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Cryo-EM structure of SYCP1-SYCE3 lattice assemblies to determine the molecular architecture of the integrated SYCP1-SYCE3 lattice at near-atomic resolution
    hypothesis: The integrated SYCP1-SYCE3 lattice has a defined structural organization that can be visualized by cryo-EM
  - description: Live imaging of SC assembly with fluorescently tagged SYCE3 to determine the temporal dynamics of SYCE3 recruitment and SYCP1 lattice remodeling during synapsis
    hypothesis: SYCE3 recruitment occurs in a temporally regulated manner during early synapsis
