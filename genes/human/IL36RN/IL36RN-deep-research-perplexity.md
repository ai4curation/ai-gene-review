# IL36RN Gene: Comprehensive Functional Annotation and Biological Significance

The IL36RN gene encodes interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), a crucial negative regulator of the IL-36 signaling pathway that maintains immune homeostasis at epithelial barriers.[1][2][7] This protein functions as a competitive antagonist by binding to the IL-36 receptor (IL1RL2) with higher affinity than the pro-inflammatory IL-36 agonists, thereby preventing recruitment of the essential coreceptor IL1RAP and blocking the downstream activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.[1][3][7] The critical importance of IL-36Ra is underscored by the discovery that loss-of-function mutations in IL36RN cause a rare autoinflammatory condition called DITRA (deficiency of IL-36 receptor antagonist), which manifests as generalized pustular psoriasis and represents a distinct genetic subtype of pustular inflammatory skin disease.[2][12][21] The IL-36Ra protein, consisting of 153 amino acids with a characteristic β-trefoil fold structure similar to other IL-1 family members, operates predominantly at epithelial surfaces including the skin, intestinal mucosa, and respiratory tract, where it maintains the critical balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals essential for tissue homeostasis.[1][10][37] Recent structural and biochemical investigations have revealed that IL-36Ra stabilizes in complex with the IL-36 receptor through specific amino acid interactions at the binding interface, and that pathogenic mutations frequently affect either protein folding stability or the precise positioning of critical residues required for competitive antagonism of IL-36 signaling.[29][49] This report comprehensively examines the molecular basis of IL-36Ra function, its role within the broader IL-1 family signaling architecture, the structural determinants of its antagonistic activity, the consequences of genetic deficiency, and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway for treatment of IL-36-driven inflammatory diseases.

## Molecular Classification and Structural Organization

The IL36RN gene represents a distinct member of the interleukin-1 cytokine family, encoding a protein product that shares both structural and functional homology with other IL-1 family members while maintaining specialized regulatory roles.[1][37] The IL36RN gene is located on human chromosome 2q13 as part of a densely organized cytokine cluster that includes IL1A, IL1B, IL37, IL36G, IL36A, IL36B, IL38, and IL1RN, with IL-36 encoding genes transcribed away from the centromere.[1][14] Between humans and rodent species, the IL-36 genes demonstrate sequence homology ranging from fifty-four to ninety-one percent, with similar gene location and organizational structure reflecting the conserved biological roles of these cytokines across mammalian species.[14] The IL-36Ra protein demonstrates fifty-two percent amino acid sequence homology with IL-1Ra, the antagonist of IL-1 signaling, indicating a remarkable functional conservation across different members of this cytokine superfamily despite their distinct receptor specificity and tissue localization patterns.[10][20]

The IL-36Ra protein adopts a characteristic three-dimensional structure known as a β-trefoil fold, a structural architecture consisting of twelve β-strands connected by eleven variable loops that together form a pyramidal barrel-like structure.[14][37] This β-trefoil fold represents an ancient protein fold that has been maintained throughout evolution and appears in diverse proteins with varying biological functions, from carbohydrate-binding lectins to various toxins.[37] Unlike many other IL-1 family members that possess signal peptide sequences directing their secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum pathway, IL-36Ra lacks a conventional signal peptide or pro-domain, suggesting utilization of alternative secretion mechanisms distinct from the canonical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway.[14][25] Furthermore, IL-36Ra lacks the characteristic caspase-1 cleavage site that is present in many other IL-1 family members and that permits processing by the inflammasome-activated enzyme caspase-1.[25] This structural distinction indicates that IL-36Ra undergoes processing and activation through different enzymatic pathways than classical IL-1 family members, a finding supported by biochemical studies demonstrating that neutrophil-derived serine proteases such as elastase and cathepsin G can efficiently process IL-36Ra in vitro and in physiological contexts.[20][25]

The protein demonstrates multiple aliases reflecting historical nomenclature changes and the previous classification of this molecule within the broader IL-1 family, including designations such as IL-1F5, IL-1HY1, and FIL1-Delta, nomenclature that has been largely superseded by the current unified "IL-36" nomenclature established in 2010.[1][2][20] These historical names reflect the discovery process through which this protein was initially identified as a member of the IL-1 family before the physiological importance of the IL-36-specific receptor and signaling pathway was recognized, leading to the adoption of more specific nomenclature that better reflects the actual functional role and receptor specificity of the molecule.[20]

## Biochemical Function and Molecular Mechanism of Antagonism

The primary biochemical function of IL-36Ra is to act as a specific competitive antagonist of the three IL-36 agonist cytokines—IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ—by binding to the shared IL-36 receptor (IL1RL2) with substantially higher affinity than do the pro-inflammatory ligands, thereby preventing the recruitment and association of the essential coreceptor IL1RAP required for signal transduction.[1][3][7] Biochemical binding studies using surface plasmon resonance and cell-based reporter assays have demonstrated that IL-36Ra binds to IL-36R with markedly higher affinity than do the IL-36 agonists, and critically, that IL-36Ra exhibits competitive inhibition of IL-36 agonist binding in a dose-dependent manner across physiologically relevant concentration ranges.[5] The high-affinity interaction between IL-36Ra and IL-36R appears to involve specific contacts between amino acid residues on the IL-36Ra surface and complementary residues within the extracellular domain of the IL-36R, with structural modeling studies suggesting that key hydrophilic residues including His22, Asn23, and Arg102 on IL-36Ra contribute significantly to the binding interface and selective receptor recognition.[29][49]

The antagonistic mechanism by which IL-36Ra suppresses IL-36 signaling operates at the level of receptor complex assembly and signal transduction initiation.[1][3][8] When IL-36 agonists bind to IL-36R in the absence of IL-36Ra, this binding induces conformational changes in the receptor extracellular domain that promote heterodimerization with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), forming a functional signaling complex at the plasma membrane.[8][39] The formation of this ternary complex, consisting of the agonist ligand, IL1RL2, and IL1RAP, permits the engagement and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling molecules including the adaptor protein MyD88, which recruits IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAK1 and IRAK4) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to the cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains of the activated receptor complex.[38][57] In contrast, when IL-36Ra binds to IL-36R, the antagonist protein occupies the binding sites on the receptor that would otherwise be available for agonist binding and, critically, the IL-36Ra-bound receptor configuration appears incompatible with productive recruitment and stabilization of IL1RAP at the cell membrane.[1][3][29] Consequently, the formation of the signaling-competent IL-36R:IL1RAP:IL-36 ternary complex is prevented, and the downstream MyD88-dependent signal transduction cascades leading to NF-κB and MAPK activation remain quiescent.[1][8]

Recent investigations have revealed additional mechanistic layers of IL-36Ra antagonism beyond simple competitive receptor occupancy. The IL-36Ra protein can bind alternative receptors within the IL-1 receptor family; specifically, IL-36Ra has been demonstrated to interact with SIGIRR (also known as IL-1R8), an orphan receptor that when engaged by IL-36Ra recruits signaling complexes that suppress rather than promote pro-inflammatory signaling.[19] IL-36Ra engagement with SIGIRR in cells results in inhibition of downstream production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, suppression of phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), and interestingly, promotion of production of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-4, which itself possesses anti-inflammatory properties.[19] However, this SIGIRR-engaging mechanism appears to be restricted to specific cell types and tissue compartments, with evidence from cell culture studies indicating that the IL-36Ra/SIGIRR/IL-4 signaling pathway operates prominently in cells of the central nervous system but has not been reliably demonstrated in hematopoietic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells or in other tissue systems such as the liver.[19] This context-dependent nature of the SIGIRR-mediated signaling cascade suggests that IL-36Ra possesses multiple distinct modes of signaling regulation that operate in tissue-specific and cell-type-specific manners, indicating considerable sophistication in the evolution of immune regulatory mechanisms.

## Cellular Localization and Tissue Distribution

IL-36Ra exhibits a highly restricted tissue distribution pattern, with maximal expression concentrated at epithelial barrier surfaces of the body that represent the primary interface between internal tissues and the external environment or microbiota.[7][9][10] The skin represents the primary site of IL-36Ra expression, where this protein is constitutively produced by keratinocytes, the predominant cell type comprising the epidermis, as well as by cells of the dermal and subcutaneous compartments.[10][14] Beyond the integument, IL-36Ra is substantially expressed in the respiratory tract epithelium lining the bronchioles and lungs, where it similarly functions to suppress IL-36-driven inflammatory responses at this important barrier surface.[10] The gastrointestinal tract represents another major site of IL-36Ra expression, with the protein produced by epithelial cells lining the intestinal mucosa, where it maintains immune homeostasis in a tissue compartment characterized by continuous exposure to dietary antigens and commensal microorganisms.[10][12] The expression of IL-36Ra at these three major epithelial barrier sites—skin, respiratory tract, and intestinal mucosa—aligns with the known localization pattern of IL-36 agonist production and suggests that the IL-36 signaling system has evolved specifically to regulate immune responses at sites of potential pathogen entry and commensal microbe interaction.[9][10]

At the subcellular level, IL-36Ra functions primarily in the extracellular microenvironment and at the plasma membrane where it engages the transmembrane IL-36R receptor.[1][3][8] The IL-36Ra protein is secreted from cells through mechanisms that remain incompletely characterized; however, studies employing recombinant IL-36Ra production systems have established that this protein can be successfully generated as a soluble protein in cell culture supernatants without requirement for the conventional endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide-directed secretory pathway.[27] Once secreted, IL-36Ra reaches the extracellular milieu where it encounters both the pro-inflammatory IL-36 agonist cytokines and the IL-36R receptors displayed on the surface of responsive cell types, enabling the competitive antagonistic interaction that suppresses IL-36-driven signaling.[1][3] The epithelial barrier localization pattern of IL-36Ra expression suggests an important function in localizing the antagonistic activity to specific anatomical sites where barrier homeostasis and regulation of pro-inflammatory responses are critical for physiological function and prevention of excessive immune activation.

Regarding the cellular sources of IL-36Ra production, keratinocytes have emerged as the predominant source of this protein within skin tissue.[10][14][28] This finding is particularly significant because keratinocytes simultaneously represent the major cellular source of the pro-inflammatory IL-36 agonist cytokines within psoriatic and other inflammatory skin lesions, indicating that individual keratinocytes possess both the capacity to produce pro-inflammatory signals and the mechanisms to self-regulate and limit the intensity of these inflammatory responses through coordinated production of the antagonistic IL-36Ra.[28] Additional cell types express IL-36R and respond to IL-36 signaling, including monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells, and specific subsets of macrophages, though many of these cells appear to be relatively minor sources of IL-36Ra production themselves.[14][25] This distribution pattern creates a regulatory architecture wherein a primary cell type (keratinocytes) produces both agonist and antagonist ligands in what appears to be a tightly controlled balance, while secondary responsive cells (immune cells) interpret the net ratio of agonist to antagonist signals to determine the magnitude and duration of inflammatory activation.

## Processing, Activation, and Post-translational Modifications

Like other members of the IL-1 family, IL-36Ra is produced as an inactive full-length precursor protein that requires proteolytic processing to generate the active form that possesses biological activity.[20][25] The full-length, unprocessed precursor form of IL-36Ra exhibits minimal or no detectable biological activity in cell-based functional assays, necessitating removal of N-terminal amino acid residues to unleash the antagonistic capacity of the molecule.[20][25] Multiple lines of biochemical evidence demonstrate that neutrophil-derived serine proteases released during degranulation or generation of neutrophil extracellular traps can efficiently process IL-36Ra in vitro and that these same protease activities are likely responsible for IL-36Ra activation in vivo during inflammatory responses characterized by neutrophil infiltration.[20][25] Specifically, the neutrophil serine proteases cathepsin G and elastase have been shown to cleave IL-36Ra at distinct N-terminal positions, with elastase mediating truncation of IL-36Ra in human skin cells, leading to generation of an active antagonistic form.[20][25]

The processing of IL-36Ra parallels the activation mechanisms for the IL-36 agonist cytokines, with both agonists and antagonists being produced as inactive precursors and both undergoing proteolytic activation through cleavage by serine proteases derived from multiple potential sources.[20][25] The pro-IL-36α, pro-IL-36β, and pro-IL-36γ agonist forms exhibit approximately one-thousand-fold lower biological activity than their proteolytically processed mature forms, indicating that the generation of active forms is a rate-limiting and highly regulated step in IL-36 biology.[20][25] The activation of IL-36α proceeds through N-terminal cleavage at lysine-3 and alanine-4 residues by cathepsin G or elastase, respectively; IL-36β undergoes selective proteolytic activation by cathepsin G through cleavage at arginine-5; and IL-36γ is efficiently activated by elastase or proteinase-3 through cleavage at valine-15, or alternatively by cathepsin S through cleavage between glutamic acid-17 and serine-18.[20][25] These distinct cleavage specificities among the different proteases and the different preferred cleavage sites for each IL-36 isoform suggest that the processing and activation of IL-36 cytokines represents a sophisticated system wherein the identity and magnitude of the activated IL-36 species present in a given tissue context depends on which proteases are present and active, providing another layer of immune regulation that couples the activation of IL-36 signaling to specific inflammatory contexts characterized by particular patterns of neutrophil protease release.

The requirement for proteolytic processing of both IL-36 agonists and antagonists creates an important regulatory insight: in tissue microenvironments where neutrophil proteases are abundant, such as occurs during acute bacterial infection or in established chronic inflammatory lesions, both the pro-inflammatory agonists and the anti-inflammatory antagonist are simultaneously activated, suggesting that the net biological outcome of IL-36 signaling in such contexts depends critically on the relative stoichiometry and kinetics of production of the various agonist and antagonist forms.[20] This feature of the system indicates that IL-36 biology cannot be understood as a simple on-off switch but rather represents a dynamic system of finely balanced antagonism where the amplitude and kinetics of inflammatory responses depend on the precise interplay between protease-mediated processing of multiple ligand forms, receptor occupancy, and signal transduction complex assembly.

## Integration into IL-36 Receptor Signaling Pathways

The IL-36Ra antagonist operates within the context of a dedicated signaling axis composed of three pro-inflammatory agonist ligands (IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ), the shared IL-36 receptor (IL1RL2, also termed IL-1Rrp2 or IL-1R-related protein 2), the essential coreceptor IL1RAP, and the downstream intracellular signaling machinery shared with IL-1 and IL-33 receptors.[1][8][10][20] The IL-36 receptor is a transmembrane protein containing an extracellular domain (ECD) composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains (D1, D2, and D3), a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain that serves as the docking site for adaptor proteins that initiate downstream signal transduction.[56] The IL1RAP coreceptor similarly possesses extracellular immunoglobulin domains and a cytoplasmic TIR domain, and the assembly of a functional signaling complex requires that both the IL-36 agonist and IL-36R and IL1RAP be simultaneously present and appropriately oriented at the plasma membrane.[8][39]

The structural requirements for IL-36 agonist binding to IL-36R have been systematically investigated through biochemical and structural modeling studies. Full-length recombinant IL-36 receptor ectodomain (the D1-D3 domains) was required for efficient binding of IL-36 cytokines; remarkably, no detectable binding of IL-36 cytokines to a truncated receptor construct containing only domains D1-D2 was observed even at very high (50 micromolar) agonist concentrations, indicating that the D3 domain makes essential contributions to agonist recognition and binding.[5] These findings suggest that the IL-36 recognition surface is distributed across multiple domains of the IL-36R ectodomain and that productive agonist binding requires the full structural context of the complete extracellular portion of the receptor. The specificity of IL-36Ra binding to IL-36R has been confirmed through multiple experimental approaches; when IL-36Ra was tested against IL-1R1 (the receptor for IL-1α and IL-1β), no antagonism of IL-1R1 signaling was observed even at saturating concentrations, demonstrating that IL-36Ra exhibits extraordinary selectivity for IL-36R over the highly homologous IL-1R1.[1][5]

Upon IL-36 agonist binding, the conformational change induced in the IL-36R ectodomain promotes the recruitment and stabilization of IL1RAP at the plasma membrane, leading to formation of the signaling-competent ternary complex.[8][39] This ternary complex brings the two TIR domains of IL-36R and IL1RAP into close proximity and appropriate orientation at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, enabling the recruitment of the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), which interacts with the TIR domains through homotypic TIR-TIR domain interactions.[38][41] The MyD88 adaptor protein subsequently recruits IRAK4 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) through interaction between the C-terminal region of MyD88 and the death domain of IRAK4, and this interaction initiates a cascade of protein kinase phosphorylation events.[38][41] IRAK4 undergoes autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation of IRAK1, leading to activation of IRAK1 kinase activity; subsequently, the activated IRAK proteins phosphorylate TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on itself and scaffold proteins including the IKK complex components NEMO and RIP1.[41][57]

The K63-linked polyubiquitination of IKK complex components serves as a critical signal for the recruitment and activation of the TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex, which includes the adapter proteins TAB2 and TAB3 that recognize K63-linked ubiquitin chains through their NZF (zinc-finger) domains.[41][57] TAK1 activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of IKKα, IKKβ, and the structural component NEMO.[41][57] The activated IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) protein at specific serine residues, causing IκBα to dissociate from the NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer and undergo proteasomal degradation, thereby liberating NF-κB for nuclear translocation and binding to κB sites in the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes.[15][41] Simultaneously, the activated MAPK pathway kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) undergo phosphorylation and activation downstream of TRAF6, leading to phosphorylation of downstream transcription factors including c-Jun and c-Fos.[14][57] The convergent activation of both the NF-κB and MAPK signaling cascades downstream of IL-36R engagement drives rapid and robust transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and antimicrobial peptides.[10][14][20][57]

In the specific context of epithelial cells such as keratinocytes, IL-36 stimulation induces substantial upregulation of gene expression for the chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8), which is potently chemotactic for neutrophils and serves to amplify the inflammatory response by recruiting additional inflammatory cells to the site of IL-36 production.[18] Additional chemokines induced downstream of IL-36R signaling include CCL20 and CXCL1, which also participate in immune cell recruitment, and the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides including LL-37 and human β-defensin-2 (HBD-2) is substantially upregulated in response to IL-36 stimulation.[10][14][20][57] The IL-36-stimulated upregulation of antimicrobial peptide production reflects the evolutionary origin of the IL-36 system as a component of barrier immunity, wherein IL-36 functions to alert and activate epithelial cells and immune cells to the presence of microbial pathogens and to mobilize local innate immune defenses. Furthermore, IL-36 signaling in keratinocytes induces the expression of additional IL-36 agonist cytokines, creating an autocrine amplification loop wherein IL-36-stimulated keratinocytes produce additional IL-36 agonists that further activate surrounding cells, resulting in rapid and substantial amplification of the inflammatory cascade.[10][18] The expression of IL36RN encoding IL-36Ra is also responsive to IL-36 stimulation, creating a negative feedback regulatory mechanism wherein the inflammatory stimulus simultaneously triggers production of the antagonist that limits signal transduction, a regulatory strategy observed for multiple components of the IL-36 signaling system.

## Genetic Variation, Mutation Spectrum, and Disease Association

The IL36RN gene is the target of recurrent loss-of-function mutations that account for a substantial proportion of cases of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a potentially life-threatening autoinflammatory skin disorder characterized by widespread pustulation, erythema, and systemic inflammation.[7][21][24][43][50] The clinical significance of IL36RN mutations has been emphasized by the definition of a new disease entity termed DITRA (deficiency of IL-36 receptor antagonist), which encompasses the spectrum of pustular diseases caused by genetic deficiency or impaired function of IL-36Ra.[7][21][50] The frequency of IL36RN mutations in patients with GPP varies substantially depending on geographic location and ethnicity, with reports indicating monoallelic mutations in up to 33.3 percent of GPP patients and biallelic mutations in up to 73.2 percent of GPP patients across various populations, whereas mutation frequencies in patients with plaque psoriasis remain minimal (zero to 11.9 percent for monoallelic mutations) or absent (zero percent for biallelic mutations).[21] These differences in mutation frequency across disease phenotypes provide compelling evidence that IL36RN mutations cause a distinct genetic form of pustular disease that is etiologically separate from common plaque psoriasis.

More than twenty distinct IL36RN gene mutations have been identified in association with various forms of pustular psoriasis and other IL36RN-associated inflammatory conditions.[7][24][43] The mutations identified in IL36RN can be functionally categorized into two major groups: null mutations that result in either complete absence of IL-36Ra protein expression or production of truncated protein fragments that are rapidly degraded, and hypomorphic mutations that permit production of full-length IL-36Ra protein but with impaired biological function, typically manifesting as either reduced antagonistic potency or decreased protein stability.[50] The null mutations identified in IL36RN include point mutations introducing premature stop codons (nonsense mutations) such as c.28C>T (p.Arg10X), c.41C>A (p.Ser14X), and c.280G>T (p.Glu94X), as well as frameshift mutations resulting from insertions or deletions such as c.420_426del (p.Gly141MetfsX29).[50] Additionally, null mutations include missense mutations that severely destabilize the protein, such as c.80T>C (p.Leu27Pro), c.227C>T (p.Pro76Leu), c.368C>T (p.Thr123Met), and c.368C>G (p.Thr123Arg), which result in marked reduction of protein accumulation compared to wild-type IL-36Ra when expressed in cultured cells.[29][50]

The hypomorphic mutations identified in IL36RN include missense mutations that preserve protein expression at near-wild-type levels but impair biological function, such as c.95A>G (p.His32Arg), c.142C>T (p.Arg48Trp), and c.304C>T (p.Arg102Trp), as well as other mutations like c.308C>T (p.Ser113Leu) that show either partial reduction in protein expression or diminished antagonistic activity without complete loss of function.[29][50] Functional studies comparing the antagonistic capacity of different IL36RN mutant proteins have revealed that IL-36Ra variants carrying null mutations exhibit complete functional impairment and fail to repress IL-36-dependent NF-κB activation in reporter assays, whereas hypomorphic mutations show either partial or minimal impairment of antagonistic function.[29][50] These functional distinctions between null and hypomorphic mutations demonstrate important genotype-phenotype correlations within the IL36RN mutation spectrum.

Particular ethnic and geographic variations in IL36RN mutation frequencies and specific mutation types have been documented. The mutation c.115+6T>C, which affects a splice site and generates aberrant splicing of IL36RN transcripts, represents the most frequently observed IL36RN mutation in Asian populations with pustular psoriasis, yet this specific mutation has not been reported in European or African populations.[24][47] In contrast, mutations such as the missense mutation c.338C>T (p.Ser113Leu) are identified as founder mutations in European populations.[26] This geographic variation in mutation spectrum reflects the evolutionary history and population genetics of different human populations and has been proposed to result from the action of founder effects or specific mutational hotspots that differ across populations. For example, the c.368C mutation has been identified as a potential mutational hotspot occurring at a CpG dinucleotide sequence, with this specific nucleotide change identified independently in both European and Japanese patients, suggesting that this particular dinucleotide position exhibits elevated mutability across different populations.[26]

The IL36RN mutation-associated diseases encompass a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that correlate with the functional severity of the underlying mutations. Null mutations causing complete absence of IL-36Ra protein expression show strong associations with the most severe and generalized forms of pustular disease, particularly generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).[50][53] In contrast, hypomorphic mutations permitting production of partially functional IL-36Ra are more commonly identified in patients with localized forms of pustular disease, including palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPPP), characterized by pustular lesions restricted to the palms and soles, and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH), characterized by progressive pustulation and destructive nail changes at the fingertips and toes.[50][53] This genotype-phenotype correlation suggests that the magnitude of IL-36 dysregulation, which correlates with the degree of functional impairment of IL-36Ra, determines whether disease manifestations are limited to specific anatomical sites or progress to systemic pustulation and systemic inflammation.[50][53]

Beyond the aforementioned major pustular phenotypes, IL36RN mutations have been identified in association with geographic tongue (GT), a benign migratory glossitis characterized by erythematous patches with white borders on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue that wax and wane over time.[44][45] Investigation of geographic tongue cases revealed that certain IL36RN mutations, particularly the c.115+6T>C splice site mutation, are enriched in patients with geographic tongue, and furthermore, that the presence of IL36RN mutations in geographic tongue patients correlates with the simultaneous presence of generalized pustular psoriasis phenotypes.[44][45] Patients carrying heterozygous IL36RN mutations show reduced but not absent IL-36Ra expression and disproportionately develop tongue lesions rather than generalized skin disease, suggesting that tongue tissue may require higher baseline levels of IL-36Ra antagonistic activity than skin to maintain homeostasis, and that heterozygous deficiency sufficient to disturb tongue immune tolerance may be insufficient to precipitate systemic disease.[44][45] Recent evidence has also linked IL36RN mutations to intestinal inflammation in the context of Crohn's disease, indicating that IL36RN-associated dysregulation of IL-36 signaling may predispose patients to intestinal inflammatory conditions in addition to the historically recognized skin manifestations.[17]

## Structural Determinants of IL-36Ra Protein Function and Stability

Recent investigations employing integrated in silico and in vitro approaches have systematically identified the amino acid residues within the IL-36Ra protein structure that are critical for maintaining protein folding stability versus those that are essential for the molecular recognition of and binding to the IL-36 receptor.[29][49] Saturation mutagenesis studies modeling the effects of all possible amino acid substitutions at each position within the IL-36Ra protein identified a set of particularly intolerant residues that are predicted to be critical for protein stability, with the most critical residues demonstrating a marked preference for localization within β-strands of the protein core rather than on the protein surface.[29][49] These computationally predicted critical residues demonstrate strong evolutionary constraint, showing significantly elevated genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) scores relative to residues where amino acid substitutions are more commonly tolerated.[29][49] Three spatially adjacent clusters of these critical residues were identified spanning amino acids 56-61, 96-104, and 119-123, with amino acids at these positions forming the hydrophobic core of the protein and exhibiting high conservation across different IL-1 family members including IL-1Ra, IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, and IL-38, suggesting the β-trefoil fold structure represents an evolutionarily optimized protein architecture for IL-1 family cytokines.[29][49]

Functional characterization of IL36RN missense mutations identified in GPP patients reveals that mutations affecting the protein core and destabilizing the β-trefoil fold structure result in marked reductions in steady-state protein accumulation and substantial loss of antagonistic function, whereas surface-located residues represent binding determinants whose disruption may impair IL-36Ra/IL-36R interaction while preserving protein stability.[29][49] Notably, experimental validation of computationally predicted destabilizing mutations confirmed that several GPP-associated alleles including p.Pro27Leu, p.Ser113Leu, p.Ile42Asn, p.Glu112Lys, and p.Thr123Arg resulted in marked reductions of IL-36Ra protein accumulation exceeding four-fold when expressed in cultured cells, whereas most population-frequency variants (identified in unaffected individuals) did not substantially destabilize the protein.[29] These findings establish a clear distinction between disease-associated and population-tolerated variation within the IL36RN gene, wherein disease-associated mutations predominantly disrupt critical protein-folding determinants whereas population variants tend to represent tolerated changes in surface-exposed regions of the protein.

The binding interface between IL-36Ra and IL-36R involves specific hydrophilic amino acid residues on the IL-36Ra surface that make critical contacts with complementary residues within the IL-36R ectodomain. In silico saturation scanning using machine learning algorithms predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein binding affinity (specifically the mCSM and mCSM-PPI2 tools) identified several key IL-36Ra residues whose mutation was predicted to substantially reduce IL-36Ra/IL-36R binding affinity.[29][49] Significantly, the predicted impact of IL36RN mutations on IL-36Ra/IL-36R binding affinity as quantified by changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔΔG) demonstrated significant correlation with experimental measurements of IL-36 signaling in cell-based assays measuring IL-8 production downstream of IL-36R engagement.[29] This finding suggests that surface-accessible residues and their specific interactions with the IL-36R ectodomain represent distinct structural determinants of antagonistic function separate from the core residues that determine protein stability, and that the cumulative effect of IL36RN mutations on either stability or binding affinity drives the loss of antagonistic function observed in patients.[29]

## Expression Regulation and Feedback Control Mechanisms

The expression of IL36RN is dynamically regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli and represents an important component of feedback regulatory mechanisms that limit the magnitude and duration of IL-36-driven inflammatory responses. IL-36 stimulation of keratinocytes results in substantial upregulation of IL36RN mRNA expression through MyD88-dependent mechanisms, indicating that IL-36 agonist stimulation triggers transcriptional induction of the antagonist gene, creating a classical negative feedback regulatory circuit.[16] This negative feedback architecture reflects an evolutionary design principle wherein the primary inflammatory signal (IL-36 agonist production) simultaneously triggers the production of the antagonist (IL-36Ra) that will ultimately limit signal transduction, thereby preventing excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory amplification. The expression of IL36RN is also upregulated in response to other pro-inflammatory signals including stimulation with TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A, inflammatory mediators that are known to contribute to psoriatic inflammation and that participate in crosstalk with the IL-36 signaling pathway.[35] In the context of systemic treatment of psoriasis with anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies such as secukinumab, clinical improvement of disease correlates with upregulation of serum IL-36Ra levels, providing clinical evidence for the importance of IL-36Ra expression in suppressing psoriatic inflammation and suggesting that IL-17A suppression permits compensatory upregulation of IL-36Ra that contributes to disease amelioration.[59]

Beyond keratinocyte-derived IL-36Ra, the IL-36 signaling system appears to involve production of a soluble IL-36 receptor (sIL-36R) that represents an alternative spliced transcript of the IL1RL2 gene encoding the transmembrane IL-36 receptor.[57] This soluble receptor, containing the extracellular domain of the IL-36 receptor but lacking the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains, can bind IL-36 agonists in a dose-dependent manner and compete with the membrane-bound IL-36R for agonist binding, thereby suppressing IL-36 signaling through a mechanism distinct from IL-36Ra competitive antagonism.[57] The production of sIL-36R is regulated by alternative splicing of IL1RL2 mRNA, a process mediated by the RNA helicase DDX5, and interestingly, IL-17D signaling suppresses DDX5 expression, providing a mechanistic link between IL-17D signaling and reduced sIL-36R generation and thereby permitting enhanced IL-36 signaling during contexts of active IL-17 production.[57] This complex regulatory architecture involving cooperative production of IL-36Ra antagonist and soluble receptor suggests that IL-36 biology represents an extensively evolved system with multiple independent regulatory mechanisms that collectively serve to fine-tune the amplitude and kinetics of IL-36-driven inflammatory responses.

## Therapeutic Applications and Recent Clinical Developments

The critical role of IL-36Ra deficiency in driving the pathogenesis of generalized pustular psoriasis has prompted the development of therapeutic strategies specifically targeting the IL-36 signaling pathway. The discovery of IL36RN mutations as a major cause of GPP and the clinical validation of this genetic basis through animal models have provided strong justification for IL-36R-targeted therapeutics as a treatment strategy for GPP and related conditions. In 2019, spesolimab (also known as BI 655130 and marketed as Spevigo), a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the human IL-36R and blocks IL-36 agonist engagement and downstream signaling, was developed and proceeded to clinical trial evaluation for GPP treatment.[51][54] Phase two clinical trials of intravenous spesolimab administered as a single infusion in the context of acute GPP flares demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy, with fifty-four percent of spesolimab-treated patients achieving a pustulation subscore of zero on the GPP Physician Global Assessment (GPPGA) scale by day eight post-infusion compared to only six percent of placebo-treated patients, and forty-three percent of spesolimab recipients achieving a complete resolution of GPPGA total score (zero) compared to eleven percent of placebo recipients.[51] Additional phase two trials of subcutaneous spesolimab administered for maintenance therapy of GPP demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in preventing subsequent GPP flares, with twenty-three percent of patients receiving low-dose spesolimab experiencing flares by week forty-eight compared to twenty-nine percent receiving medium-dose and fifty-two percent receiving placebo, corresponding to hazard ratios for time to flare of 0.16, 0.35, and 0.47 respectively relative to placebo.[51]

The safety profile of spesolimab has been favorable across clinical trials, with infection rates and adverse event frequencies similar to placebo-treated controls, indicating that transient IL-36R blockade does not substantially compromise immune defense mechanisms.[51] However, additional investigation has revealed that spesolimab treatment mitigates residual skin inflammation that persists even after resolution of acute pustular flares, suggesting that complete suppression of IL-36R signaling may produce benefits beyond immediate pustule resolution and may promote restoration of skin barrier function and normalization of immune homeostasis.[54] The clinical efficacy of spesolimab against acute GPP flares and in preventing recurrent flares has led to regulatory approval for this therapeutic agent in multiple countries, representing the first IL-36-targeted monoclonal antibody approved for clinical use and establishing a new therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of IL36RN-associated pustular disease.[51]

In addition to monoclonal antibody-based approaches targeting IL-36R directly, alternative therapeutic strategies targeting the IL-36 signaling pathway have been explored. Small-molecule inhibitors capable of selectively blocking IL-36R signaling have been developed, with recent structures demonstrating that peptide inhibitors can be designed as orthosteric inhibitors that compete with IL-36 agonists for IL-36R binding.[5] These peptide inhibitors demonstrate potent dose-dependent inhibition of all three IL-36 agonists (IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ) in reporter assays measuring IL-36R signaling in recombinant cell lines overexpressing the receptor, and importantly, these peptide inhibitors exhibit specificity for IL-36R over IL-1R1, avoiding off-target effects on IL-1 signaling that might compromise immune defense.[5] Human skin explant studies employing tissue from healthy donors stimulated with IL-36α demonstrated that peptide IL-36R inhibitors suppress multiple IL-36-responsive genes including IL36RN itself, IL-23, and the antimicrobial peptide gene SERPINB6 in a dose-dependent manner, though higher concentrations of the peptide were required for gene suppression in this more physiologically relevant tissue system compared to cultured cells, possibly reflecting the effects of plasma protein binding and tissue penetration.[5]

Beyond direct IL-36R antagonism, alternative approaches targeting the IL-36 signaling pathway have been explored, including targeting the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) that functions as the obligate coreceptor for IL-36R signaling. A monoclonal antibody targeting IL1RAP (CAN10) has entered clinical trials for systemic sclerosis and fibrotic diseases, with the hypothesis that blocking IL1RAP would simultaneously prevent signaling downstream of IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36, thereby blocking multiple profibrotic cytokine pathways simultaneously.[11][42] This approach represents a broader therapeutic strategy that exploits the shared usage of IL1RAP as a coreceptor by multiple IL-1 family cytokines to achieve broader anti-inflammatory effects compared to targeting a single agonist or receptor.[11][42] Additionally, transcriptional control approaches designed to upregulate IL36RN expression or inhibit the production of IL-36 agonists represent potential therapeutic strategies, though these approaches remain largely in preclinical development stages.

## Conclusion

The IL36RN gene encodes the interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), a critical negative regulator of epithelial barrier inflammation that functions as a competitive antagonist of the pro-inflammatory IL-36 agonist cytokines through high-affinity binding to the IL-36 receptor and prevention of the recruitment of the essential IL1RAP coreceptor required for signal transduction. The structural architecture of IL-36Ra reflects evolutionary conservation of the β-trefoil fold shared among IL-1 family members, with specific amino acid residues concentrated in the protein core that determine protein stability and surface-exposed residues that mediate receptor recognition and binding. Loss-of-function mutations in IL36RN represent a major cause of generalized pustular psoriasis and have been unified into the disease entity DITRA (deficiency of IL-36 receptor antagonist), a distinct autoinflammatory condition caused by uncontrolled IL-36 signaling at epithelial barriers. The phenotypic manifestations of IL36RN deficiency range from localized pustular disease associated with hypomorphic mutations to severe systemic pustulation and systemic inflammation associated with null mutations, reflecting the extent of IL-36 dysregulation. Recent therapeutic advances including the clinical approval of spesolimab, a monoclonal antibody blocking IL-36R, have validated IL-36R as a tractable drug target and have established effective treatment strategies for previously intractable IL36RN-associated pustular diseases. Ongoing investigation of IL-36 biology continues to reveal additional regulatory mechanisms including the production of soluble IL-36 receptor variants and the context-dependent engagement of alternative receptors including SIGIRR, suggesting that this signaling system possesses multiple independent regulatory circuits that collectively orchestrate epithelial barrier immune homeostasis. Future therapeutic development may exploit these multiple regulatory mechanisms to achieve enhanced efficacy in treating not only pustular psoriasis but also emerging evidence for IL-36 dysregulation in other inflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and other autoinflammatory conditions. The systematic molecular characterization of IL36RN mutations and their functional consequences has provided unprecedented insights into the structure-function relationships within the IL-1 family and has established a paradigm wherein genetic deficiency of a negative regulator drives specific inflammatory disease phenotypes, highlighting the essential biological role of this antagonist in maintaining immune tolerance at epithelial barriers and preventing excessive inflammatory activation in response to commensal microbes and environmental stimuli.
