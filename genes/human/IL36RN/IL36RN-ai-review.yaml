description: 'Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), a secreted cytokine of
  the IL-1 family that serves as the sole antagonist of the IL-36 signaling axis.
  Member of IL-36 subfamily which includes three pro-inflammatory agonists (IL-36α/β/γ)
  and this single antagonist. Encoded as 155-amino acid precursor that requires N-terminal
  proteolytic processing (removal of initiator Met and adjacent residues by neutrophil
  elastase) to achieve full antagonist activity - unprocessed form has drastically
  reduced receptor-binding capacity. Primary molecular function: competitive antagonist
  of IL-36 receptor (IL-36R/IL1RL2) - binds IL-36R with high affinity (Kd ~5-6 nM,
  much stronger than IL-36 agonists at 480-1800 nM) and slow dissociation rate, effectively
  blocking receptor occupancy. Critical mechanistic difference from agonists: IL-36Ra
  binding prevents recruitment of IL-1RAcP co-receptor, thereby blocking formation
  of functional signaling complex and preventing downstream MyD88-dependent activation
  of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Structurally adopts β-trefoil fold characteristic of
  IL-1 family but lacks conventional signal peptide - secreted via unconventional
  pathways (likely microparticles/exosomes or during cell stress). Expressed in barrier
  tissues (skin keratinocytes, intestinal epithelium) and immune cells (monocytes,
  macrophages, dendritic cells); some cells constitutively express IL-36Ra to maintain
  basal antagonism preventing spontaneous inflammation. Essential role in immune homeostasis:
  loss-of-function mutations cause generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP/DITRA), a severe
  autoinflammatory skin disease with widespread sterile pustules and systemic inflammation,
  demonstrating that unopposed IL-36 signaling is life-threatening. Patients with
  processing-defective variant (p.V2F) that cannot be N-terminally cleaved have inactive
  IL-36Ra despite normal expression, proving proteolytic maturation is mandatory for
  function. Also implicated in other inflammatory conditions: rare IL36RN mutations
  found in severe Crohn''s disease; IL-36Ra expressed in inflamed synovium in rheumatoid/psoriatic
  arthritis. Knockout mice show delayed wound healing due to excessive prolonged inflammation
  and neutrophil accumulation. IL-36Ra limits chemokine production (CXCL1, IL-8) and
  restrains Th17 responses. In 2022, FDA approved spesolimab (anti-IL-36R antibody)
  for GPP treatment, validating IL-36 pathway as therapeutic target and confirming
  IL-36Ra''s natural protective role. Beyond immunity, potential context-dependent
  roles in cancer (may suppress pro-tumor inflammation in some settings). IL-38 (IL1F10)
  can also antagonize IL-36R but with more restricted activity. Overall, IL-36Ra is
  paradigmatic cytokine antagonist maintaining immune equilibrium at epithelial barriers
  by tightly blocking IL-36-driven inflammatory amplification.'

  description: Binding to IL-36 receptor (IL-36R/IL1RL2, an IL-1 receptor family member)
    with high affinity (Kd ~5-6 nM) to competitively block IL-36 agonist cytokines
    from activating the receptor. Unlike agonists, IL-36Ra binding prevents recruitment
    of IL-1RAcP co-receptor, thereby blocking MyD88/NF-κB/MAPK signaling cascade.

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: cytokine receptor antagonist activity
  proposed_definition: The activity of binding to a cytokine receptor and blocking
    its activation by cognate agonist ligands, without inducing receptor signaling.
    Distinguished from classical receptor antagonism by cytokine-specific mechanisms
    (e.g., preventing co-receptor recruitment).
  justification: IL-36Ra and IL-1Ra exemplify a specific class of endogenous protein
    antagonists that block cytokine receptors through competitive binding. Current
    GO term 'cytokine receptor binding' doesn't capture the antagonist vs agonist
    distinction. IL-36Ra binds IL-36R but prevents signaling, contrasting with IL-36
    agonists.
