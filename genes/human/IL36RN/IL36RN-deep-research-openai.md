## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene IL36RN (Q9UBH0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Introduction and Gene Overview  
**IL36RN** (Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist) is a human gene (UniProt Q9UBH0) encoding a cytokine of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family. It is the sole antagonist ligand in the IL-36 subfamily of cytokines, which also includes three pro-inflammatory agonists (IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974?text=fulltext#:~:text=Interleukin%20,diseases%20of%20the%20intestine%2C%20and)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=agonists%20IL,1%20in%20conserved%20sequence%20and)). Discovered around 2000 in the IL-1 gene cluster on chromosome 2, IL-36RN is highly homologous to IL-1 cytokines in sequence and predicted structure ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=agonists%20IL,1%20in%20conserved%20sequence%20and)). The IL-36RN protein is also known by synonyms *IL-1F5* or *IL-36Ra*, reflecting its function as the IL-36 **receptor antagonist** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000136695-IL36RN/summary/gene#:~:text=GENERAL%20INFORMATION,all%20genes)). This protein is a member of the IL-1 family’s β-trefoil fold cytokines, and like other IL-1 family members it is primarily active *outside* the cell, regulating immune signaling by binding to cell-surface cytokine receptors ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=immunohistochemistry%2C%20IL,36Ra%20were%20produced)). Notably, IL-36Ra lacks a conventional signal peptide, but it is released into the extracellular space (likely via unconventional secretion or cell damage) where it can exert its function ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=immunohistochemistry%2C%20IL,36Ra%20were%20produced)). It is produced by a variety of cell types in barrier tissues – for example, keratinocytes in the skin and immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, etc.) are known to express IL-36Ra, often alongside the IL-36 agonists ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=immunohistochemistry%2C%20IL,36Ra%20were%20produced)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=as%20in%20various%20mouse%20models,17)). In resting conditions, certain myeloid cells even express IL-36Ra constitutively, suggesting a basal level of antagonist is maintained to prevent spontaneous inflammation ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=immunohistochemistry%2C%20IL,36Ra%20were%20produced)). Overall, IL36RN encodes a cytokine that serves as a key negative regulator in the IL-36 signaling axis, helping maintain immune homeostasis at epithelial barriers.  

# Molecular Function: IL-36 Receptor Antagonist Activity  
The IL-36RN gene product (IL-36Ra protein) functions as a **competitive antagonist** of IL-36 cytokine signaling. It binds to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R, also known as IL1RL2 or IL-1Rrp2) on the cell surface with high affinity, but – in contrast to the IL-36 agonists – IL-36Ra does **not** recruit the signaling co-receptor required for downstream activation ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). Specifically, IL-36 agonist ligands normally engage a receptor complex of IL-36R and the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which brings together intracellular TIR domains and triggers MyD88-dependent signaling cascades (activating NF-κB and MAP kinases) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=antagonist%20%28IL,36%20agonists%20do)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=complex%2C%20which%20consists%20of%20the,activated%20protein%20kinase%20%28MAPK)). IL-36Ra can bind to IL-36R in place of the agonist, but its binding prevents IL-1RAcP recruitment and receptor dimerization, thereby *blocking* the formation of a functional signaling complex ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=downstream%20immune%20and%20inflammatory%20responses,to%20be%20broadly%20expressed%20in)). In essence, IL-36Ra occupies the receptor without triggering it – earning its designation as a “true antagonist” of IL-36 signaling ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). This mechanism halts the downstream biochemical pathway: when IL-36Ra is bound, the IL-36R/IL-1RAcP complex cannot assemble, and thus the typical IL-36-induced activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and pro-inflammatory gene expression is suppressed ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=downstream%20immune%20and%20inflammatory%20responses,to%20be%20broadly%20expressed%20in)). 

Importantly, IL-36Ra’s binding affinity for the IL-36 receptor is substantially *stronger* than that of the agonist cytokines, which enables effective competitive inhibition. A biochemical kinetics study (J. Biol. Chem. 2017) measured IL-36Ra’s binding and showed a **dissociation constant (K_D)** of roughly 5–6 nM for IL-36R, compared to much weaker affinities of ~480 nM for IL-36α and ~1800 nM for IL-36γ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=solution.%20Antagonist%20IL,%E2%88%921%7D%29%20%28Fig.%205A)). In the same analysis, IL-36Ra was found to dissociate from the receptor extremely slowly (a markedly slower off-rate than the agonists) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=antagonist%20IL,36%20pathway%20activation%20and%20inhibition)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=solution.%20Antagonist%20IL,%E2%88%921%7D%29%20%28Fig.%205A)). This means once IL-36Ra is bound to IL-36R, it tends to remain bound, effectively outcompeting IL-36α/β/γ for receptor occupancy. These quantitative binding data provide a clear **mechanistic basis** for IL-36Ra’s function: by tightly and persistently occupying IL-36R, IL-36Ra prevents the pro-inflammatory IL-36 cytokines from delivering their signal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=antagonist%20IL,36%20pathway%20activation%20and%20inhibition)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=solution.%20Antagonist%20IL,%E2%88%921%7D%29%20%28Fig.%205A)). In summary, the primary **biochemical function** of the IL36RN gene product is to serve as a high-affinity receptor “blocker” that safeguards cells from excessive IL-36–mediated immunity. This antagonist action is conceptually analogous to the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in the IL-1 system, underlining a broader theme in IL-1 family biology where dedicated anti-cytokines modulate the activity of their pro-inflammatory counterparts ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). 

# Activation and Processing Requirements  
Like many IL-1 family cytokines, IL-36Ra is synthesized as a precursor that requires **proteolytic processing** to attain full activity. The unprocessed IL-36Ra protein (155 amino acids in length) has an N-terminal extension that *hinders* its receptor-binding capacity until removed ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). In vitro studies first showed that removing the very N-terminal methionine (and adjacent residues) dramatically increases IL-36Ra’s antagonist potency ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). This is analogous to IL-36 agonists, which also require N-terminal truncation by proteases (such as neutrophil proteases) to become fully active cytokines ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=while%20IL,activated%20protein%20kinase%20%28MAPK)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20order%20to%20have,domains%20and%20an%20intracellular%20Toll)). For IL-36Ra, neutrophil-derived proteases have been identified as key activating enzymes: **neutrophil elastase** can cleave IL-36Ra’s N-terminus, converting it into a significantly more potent antagonist form ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20order%20to%20have,domains%20and%20an%20intracellular%20Toll)). Macleod *et al.* (2016) demonstrated that elastase processing of IL-36Ra increases its ability to block IL-36 signaling, effectively “unlocking” its anti-inflammatory function ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20order%20to%20have,domains%20and%20an%20intracellular%20Toll)). 

Crucially, there is strong **in vivo** evidence that N-terminal processing is required for IL-36Ra’s function. A 2017 clinical genetics study reported a naturally occurring IL36RN mutation (p.V2F) in patients with autoinflammatory skin disease which *impairs* IL-36Ra processing ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). This missense mutation (valine to phenylalanine at position 2) did not prevent IL-36Ra protein expression, but it prevented the removal of the N-terminal methionine. The mutant IL-36Ra retained its initiator Met and was essentially **devoid of antagonist activity** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). Mass spectrometry confirmed that the pathogenic IL-36Ra variant was not being properly N-terminally trimmed in vivo ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=the%20in%20vivo%20contribution%20of,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). These findings provided the first direct evidence in humans that **cleavage of the N-terminus is a mandatory step** for IL-36Ra to achieve optimal receptor antagonist function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)). Without this maturation step, IL-36Ra cannot effectively bind IL-36R and block signaling, leading to unrestrained IL-36 activity in tissues. In summary, IL-36Ra is an **inactive pro-cytokine** until proteolytic processing (e.g. removal of the first methionine and likely adjacent residues) generates the active form ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=systemic%20inflammation,step%20to%20reach%20optimal%20antagonist)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20order%20to%20have,domains%20and%20an%20intracellular%20Toll)). This regulatory mechanism ensures that IL-36Ra’s inhibitory activity can be controlled – for instance, activated neutrophils in inflamed tissue can activate IL-36Ra when and where it is needed by cleaving it with elastase ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20in%20order%20to%20have,domains%20and%20an%20intracellular%20Toll)). Processing thus serves as a post-translational switch that licenses IL-36RN’s gene product to carry out its immune-modulatory function.  

# Biological Role in Immune Processes and Pathways  
**IL-36Ra is a key regulator of inflammatory responses**, particularly in skin and other epithelial barriers. By antagonizing IL-36 signaling, it keeps certain innate immune pathways in check to prevent damage from excessive inflammation. In the skin, IL-36 cytokines are potent drivers of keratinocyte and myeloid cell activation, and IL-36Ra provides critical counter-regulation. The importance of IL36RN in cutaneous immunity is highlighted by the rare **autoinflammatory disease** resulting from its loss. Patients with *homozygous loss-of-function mutations* in IL36RN develop generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a severe episodic inflammatory skin disease ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=Mutations%20and%20aberrant%20expression%20of,shown%20that%20loss%20of%20function)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=cytokines%20are%20involved%20in%20the,They%20are%20produced%20mainly%20by)). GPP is characterized by widespread sterile pustules and systemic inflammation, and these cases (collectively termed DITRA – *Deficiency of IL-36Ra*) revealed the *essential role* of IL-36Ra in controlling skin inflammation. The discovery in 2011 that IL36RN mutations cause GPP underscored that **unopposed IL-36 signaling can provoke life-threatening inflammation**, establishing IL-36Ra as a critical “brake” in skin innate immunity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=The%20identification%20of%20loss,Mass%20spectrometry)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=mutations%20in%20IL,serum%20of%20patients%20with%20psoriasis)). Indeed, experimental models confirm this: IL-36Ra–deficient mice exhibit exacerbated skin inflammation under challenge conditions ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=cytokines%20are%20involved%20in%20the,They%20are%20produced%20mainly%20by)). In psoriatic skin lesions, IL36RN expression is actually upregulated along with IL-36α/β/γ, suggesting a physiological feedback mechanism — the tissue increases production of the antagonist IL-36Ra in an attempt to counteract the high levels of IL-36 agonists in psoriasis ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=cytokines%20are%20involved%20in%20the,They%20are%20produced%20mainly%20by)). 

Within the **IL-36 signaling pathway**, IL-36Ra’s role is to modulate the activity of a classic pro-inflammatory cascade. When IL-36 agonists bind IL-36R on target cells (such as keratinocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes), the receptor complex recruits MyD88 and triggers downstream kinases (IRAKs, TRAF6), culminating in activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=antagonist%20%28IL,36%20agonists%20do)). This leads to production of numerous inflammatory mediators – for example, IL-36 signaling can induce **chemokines like CXCL1 (KC), IL-8, and cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23**, thereby amplifying immune cell recruitment and Th17-type responses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=infiltration%20and%20delayed%20wound%20healing,36R%20signaling%2C%20increased)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=cytokines%20are%20involved%20in%20the,They%20are%20produced%20mainly%20by)). By blocking IL-36R, IL-36Ra prevents these downstream signals, thereby *limiting* the release of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and other inflammatory cytokines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=infiltration%20and%20delayed%20wound%20healing,36R%20signaling%2C%20increased)). In essence, IL-36Ra helps maintain a balance: it allows initial inflammatory signals needed for host defense or tissue repair but prevents those signals from overshooting. For instance, **wound healing** studies illustrate this balance – IL36RN knockout mice show delayed wound closure due to excessive, prolonged inflammation. In the absence of IL-36Ra, wounds accumulate abnormally high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages and elevated inflammatory cytokines, impairing normal healing ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=IL,healing%20process.%20Therefore%2C%20we%20hypothesized)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=infiltration%20and%20delayed%20wound%20healing,36R%20signaling%2C%20increased)). This phenotype was rescued by interventions that block IL-36 signaling or related innate pathways, confirming that the **excess inflammation from unchecked IL-36** was the cause of the impaired healing ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=IL,healing%20process.%20Therefore%2C%20we%20hypothesized)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=infiltration%20and%20delayed%20wound%20healing,36R%20signaling%2C%20increased)). Thus, IL-36Ra’s regulatory role is crucial in the *early stages of tissue injury response* – it dampens the innate immune cell infiltration and cytokine surge to promote proper resolution and tissue recovery ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479622/#:~:text=IL,healing%20process.%20Therefore%2C%20we%20hypothesized)). 

Beyond the skin, IL36RN is increasingly recognized as an important player in other organ systems’ immunity. The IL-36/IL-36Ra axis is active in the gut mucosa, lungs, and joints, where it similarly governs local inflammatory processes ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974?text=fulltext#:~:text=Interleukin%20,diseases%20of%20the%20intestine%2C%20and)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). In the **intestines**, recent research has identified IL-36 signaling as a “key regulator” of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)). IL-36 agonists are broadly expressed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) lesions, and IL-36RN (IL-36Ra) is thought to counterbalance those signals to maintain mucosal integrity ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)). Notably, rare IL36RN mutations have been reported in severe Crohn’s disease patients, and functional assays show those variant IL-36Ra proteins are less effective inhibitors ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)). This suggests that even outside the skin, IL-36Ra dysfunction can contribute to uncontrolled inflammation. In support of this, inhibiting IL-36 signaling has shown therapeutic benefit in preclinical models of chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g. reducing pathological fibrosis in colitis) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974?text=fulltext#:~:text=inflammatory%20regulation,currently%20regarded%20as%20a%20promising)). Similarly, in *rheumatoid arthritis* and *psoriatic arthritis* joints, IL-36 family cytokines are elevated, and IL-36Ra is expressed in the inflamed synovium (notably by plasma cells) as part of the immune regulatory response ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,expressed%20in%20the%20salivary%20gland)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=match%20at%20L346%20IL,8%2C%20suggesting%20that)). Collectively, these observations indicate that IL-36Ra contributes to **maintaining immune equilibrium** at barrier sites: it restrains excessive IL-36–driven responses that would otherwise lead to tissue damage. In its absence (or inefficiency), pro-inflammatory pathways dominated by IL-36 can run unchecked, as evidenced by conditions like GPP, severe psoriasis, or possibly subsets of IBD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=Mutations%20and%20aberrant%20expression%20of,shown%20that%20loss%20of%20function)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)). 

It is worth noting that another IL-1 family cytokine, **IL-38**, has been identified as a functional analog that can also antagonize IL-36 receptor signaling. IL-38 (IL1F10) is located in the same gene cluster and shares structural similarity with IL-36Ra. Emerging evidence shows IL-38 can bind IL-36R and exert *IL-36 inhibitory* effects in certain contexts, potentially compensating when IL-36Ra is absent ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=proliferation%20%5B3%2C4%5D.%20IL,6%5D.%20However%2C%20the)). However, IL-38 appears to have a more restricted activity profile, and IL-36Ra remains the primary high-affinity antagonist dedicated to this pathway ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=proliferation%20%5B3%2C4%5D.%20IL,6%5D.%20However%2C%20the)). The presence of IL-38 underlines the physiological importance of tightly controlling IL-36: the body has evolved redundant inhibitors to fine-tune this potent inflammatory axis. 

# Cellular Localization and Biochemical Characteristics  
IL-36Ra carries out its function in the **extracellular milieu**, acting on cell-surface receptors. Once released from producing cells, IL-36Ra diffuses in the intercellular space and competes with IL-36 cytokines for receptor binding on target cells. As mentioned, IL-36Ra is predicted to be secreted, although it lacks a classic N-terminal secretion signal peptide ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=immunohistochemistry%2C%20IL,36Ra%20were%20produced)). This is a trait it shares with IL-1β and IL-18 – cytokines that are secreted through unconventional pathways (such as via secretory vesicles or during cell lysis) rather than the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi route. Experiments have found IL-36 family members (e.g. IL-36γ) can be released in microparticles and exosomes from activated macrophages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4945350/#:~:text=IL,Michael)), and IL-36Ra is thought to be similarly released during cell stress or inflammation. The **predicted localization** of IL-36Ra is not exclusively extracellular, however: database annotations (e.g. Human Protein Atlas) list it as both *secreted and intracellular* ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000136695-IL36RN/summary/gene#:~:text=Gene%20description,113065382)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000136695-IL36RN/summary/gene#:~:text=Human%20disease%20related%20genes%20Predicted,i%7D%204)). This may reflect multiple transcript variants of IL36RN – for instance, alternative splicing could produce an isoform that remains intracellular. Indeed, the closely related IL1RN gene (IL-1 receptor antagonist) produces distinct isoforms, one that is secreted and others that function inside cells. While the **major biologically active pool** of IL-36Ra is outside cells (neutralizing IL-36 ligands at the receptor level), researchers have noted some cell-intrinsic roles of IL-1 family antagonists. It remains an area of interest whether IL-36Ra has any non-canonical intracellular functions, but to date the **primary site of action** for IL-36Ra is the extracellular space where it engages IL-36R ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). 

In terms of biochemical properties, IL-36Ra is a relatively small protein (~17–18 kDa after processing) composed mostly of β-strands forming a β-trefoil fold – the hallmark structure of IL-1 family cytokines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=estimated%20from%20the%20single%20band,theoretical%20molecular%20mass%20of%2037)). It is not glycosylated (consistent with being a cytosolic protein prior to unconventional secretion). Upon binding the IL-36 receptor, IL-36Ra likely interacts with the receptor’s ligand-binding domain in a manner analogous to IL-1Ra binding IL-1R1 – sterically blocking the receptor’s critical contact sites for agonist and preventing receptor/co-receptor oligomerization ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=IL,1R%20accessory)). Recent *in silico* docking and mutagenesis studies are beginning to map the **interaction interface** between IL-36Ra and IL-36R. For example, Hassi *et al.* (J. Invest. Dermatol. 2023) performed a systematic analysis of IL36RN missense variants and identified several **critical residues** in IL-36Ra required for high-affinity receptor binding ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10824670/#:~:text=Generalized%20pustular%20psoriasis%20is%20a,systematically%20investigating%20the%20effects%20of)). Mutations at these sites (some found in patients with autoinflammatory diseases) weaken the IL-36Ra–receptor interaction and thus impair antagonist function. Such structure-function research is helping to elucidate how IL-36Ra physically occludes the receptor and which parts of the protein are essential for its inhibitory activity. Notably, the structural insights gained from these studies complement earlier findings on N-terminal processing – together they show that both the **correct proteolytic trimming and an intact receptor-binding surface** are needed for IL-36Ra to properly neutralize IL-36 signaling. 

# Clinical Significance and Current Applications  
Given IL-36Ra’s pivotal role in regulating inflammation, it has significant clinical and therapeutic relevance. The discovery of *IL36RN* mutations in generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) patients has not only provided a molecular diagnosis for these cases but also pointed to the IL-36 pathway as a drug target ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5767850/#:~:text=Mutations%20and%20aberrant%20expression%20of,shown%20that%20loss%20of%20function)). In fact, IL-36 signaling is now considered a driver of pathology in GPP and related disorders, and blocking this pathway can ameliorate disease. A major development in recent years was the **approval of a therapeutic antibody against IL-36R**: in 2022, the FDA approved *spesolimab*, a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-36 receptor, for the treatment of GPP ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=12%C2%A0%20%20,et%20al%3A%20Distinct%20expression%20of)). This first-in-class drug essentially mimics the action of IL-36Ra by preventing receptor activation, and it has shown remarkable efficacy in tamping down the uncontrolled skin inflammation in GPP ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=12%C2%A0%20%20,et%20al%3A%20Distinct%20expression%20of)). The success of spesolimab underscores the validity of IL-36Ra’s mechanism as a therapeutic strategy – reinforcing that IL-36RN’s natural function (when intact) is to protect against exactly this kind of cytokine storm in the skin. There is ongoing research into IL-36 pathway inhibitors for other diseases as well, ranging from localized pustular psoriasis variants to potentially **inflammatory bowel disease**. Early studies in Crohn’s disease patients with IL36RN mutations suggest that these individuals may benefit from IL-36 pathway blockade, and clinical trials are exploring IL-36R antibodies in IBD contexts ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974?text=fulltext#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20inhibiting%20IL%E2%80%9136%20signaling%20is,IL%E2%80%9136%20receptor%20are%20also%20discussed)). Moreover, IL-36 signaling has a complex role in cancer – e.g. in colorectal cancer models, absence of IL-36Ra led to heightened inflammation and increased tumor development, implying that IL-36Ra may normally suppress a pro-tumor inflammatory milieu ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=administration%20of%20IL,consistent%20with%20previous%20findings%20of)). Some reports conversely note that high IL36RN expression in certain tumors (like gastric cancer) correlates with an immunosuppressive environment and poorer outcomes, highlighting the nuanced tissue-specific effects of this pathway (pro-tumor vs. anti-tumor depending on context) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=administration%20of%20IL,consistent%20with%20previous%20findings%20of)). These findings are driving interest in **modulating IL-36Ra** or its receptor in diverse clinical settings: enhancing IL-36Ra activity could be beneficial in autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, whereas temporarily blocking IL-36Ra (to allow a stronger IL-36 immune response) might even be considered in settings like chronic infections or tumor immunity where a more robust inflammatory response is desired ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=match%20at%20L520%20administration%20of,consistent%20with%20previous%20findings%20of)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=increased%20incidence%20of%20colon%20tumorigenesis,Differential%20gene)). 

From an **expert perspective**, IL-36Ra is often highlighted alongside IL-1Ra as a paradigm of innate immune regulation. Prominent immunologists (e.g. Dr. Charles Dinarello and colleagues) have noted that the IL-36/IL-36Ra axis exemplifies how the IL-1 family orchestrates barrier immunity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28603914/#:~:text=The%20identification%20of%20loss,Mass%20spectrometry)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=cytokines%20are%20involved%20in%20the,They%20are%20produced%20mainly%20by)). IL-36 cytokines provide a rapid alarm system at interfaces like the skin and gut, while IL-36Ra (and IL-38) provide the “off-switch” to prevent collateral damage. The evolutionary conservation of IL36RN across mammals and its proximity to other IL-1 family genes suggest that controlling IL-36 activity is fundamentally important for organismal survival during injury or infection ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974#:~:text=agonists%20IL,1%20in%20conserved%20sequence%20and)) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/184/2/159/6412177#:~:text=proliferation%20%5B3%2C4%5D.%20IL,6%5D.%20However%2C%20the)). Recent reviews in 2023–2024 continue to emphasize IL-36Ra’s role in maintaining immune homeostasis: for instance, a 2023 review in *Experimental & Molecular Medicine* calls the IL-36 pathway a *“critical regulator of intestinal and skin inflammation”*, with IL-36Ra being indispensable for preventing chronic inflammatory diseases ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/etm.2023.11974?text=fulltext#:~:text=inflammatory%20regulation,currently%20regarded%20as%20a%20promising)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40447918/#:~:text=The%20IL,and%20functional%20assays%20demonstrated%20that)). In summary, IL36RN encodes a cytokine that is **centrally involved in immune regulation** – its protein product IL-36Ra is a potent anti-inflammatory mediator working by antagonizing IL-36 receptor signaling. It plays crucial roles in **protecting tissues from excessive inflammation**, and both genetic and biochemical evidence show that without a fully functional IL-36Ra, inflammatory pathways can spiral out of control. Ongoing research and clinical developments continue to leverage this knowledge, making IL-36Ra not only a subject of fundamental immunological interest but also a promising target in precision therapies for inflammatory diseases.
