## Question

Research the IL36RN (Q9UBH0) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **IL36RN gene** (UniProt: Q9UBH0) encodes the **interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra)**, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, particularly in epithelial tissues such as the skin.

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  IL-36Ra **binds to the interleukin-36 receptor (IL-36R)**, acting as a **competitive antagonist**. By occupying the receptor, it prevents the binding of pro-inflammatory IL-36 cytokines (IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ), thereby **inhibiting downstream signaling pathways** such as **NF-κB** and **MAPK** that drive inflammation[2][5][7][9].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  - **Negative regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling:** IL-36Ra suppresses the activation of inflammatory genes, maintaining immune homeostasis at barrier sites (skin, gut, lung)[6][12].
  - **Antifungal humoral response:** It is involved in the immune response against fungal pathogens[7][12].
  - **Regulation of inflammation:** Especially important in the skin, where it controls the extent and duration of inflammatory responses[2][4][6].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  IL-36Ra is **primarily expressed in the skin** and other epithelial tissues[2][4][13]. It is a **secreted protein** that acts in the extracellular space, binding to cell surface IL-36R[7][13].

---

### 2. Protein Domains

- **Domain Structure:**  
  IL-36Ra is a member of the **interleukin-1 cytokine family** and shares the typical **β-trefoil fold** found in this family[7].  
  - The protein consists of a single domain responsible for receptor binding and antagonism[7].
  - No additional functional domains or motifs have been reported beyond the conserved IL-1 family structure[7].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Receptor Binding:**  
  - **IL-36R (IL1RL2):** IL-36Ra binds to IL-36R, blocking the interaction of IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ[2][6][9].
  - **Accessory Protein (IL-1RacP):** By preventing IL-36R from associating with its accessory protein, IL-1RacP, IL-36Ra inhibits the formation of the active signaling complex[6].

- **Pathway Modulation:**  
  - **NF-κB and MAPK Pathways:** IL-36Ra blocks the activation of these pathways, which are central to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines[2][5][6].

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Generalized Pustular Psoriasis (GPP):**  
  - **Mutations in IL36RN** are strongly associated with GPP, a severe skin disorder characterized by widespread pustules, systemic inflammation, and fever[4][6][8].
  - Over a dozen pathogenic variants have been identified, often resulting in **loss of IL-36Ra function** and **uncontrolled skin inflammation**[4][6][8].
  - Not all individuals with IL36RN mutations develop GPP, indicating a role for additional genetic and environmental factors[4].

- **Other Inflammatory Skin Disorders:**  
  - IL36RN mutations have also been linked to other pustular and inflammatory skin diseases, including **acral pustulosis** and **pustular psoriasis variants**[4][8].

### 5. Recent Developments and Latest Research (2023–2024)

- **Functional Analysis of Mutations:**  
  Recent studies have used in silico and in vitro approaches to show that **IL36RN mutations disrupt protein expression, stability, and receptor binding**, leading to increased susceptibility to GPP and related disorders[6] (2024).

- **Therapeutic Targeting:**  
  - **Monoclonal antibodies** targeting the IL-36 pathway (e.g., anti-IL-36R antibodies) are under investigation for treating GPP and other inflammatory diseases, reflecting the pathway’s clinical relevance[1] (2023).

- **Expanded Disease Spectrum:**  
  New research suggests that **IL36RN variants may contribute to a broader range of autoinflammatory and epithelial diseases** than previously recognized[6] (2024).

---

### 6. Expert Opinions and Authoritative Analysis

- **Critical Role in Epithelial Immunity:**  
  Experts emphasize that **IL-36Ra is essential for maintaining immune balance at barrier surfaces**, and its deficiency leads to unchecked inflammation and tissue damage[6][10].

- **Distinct from Other IL-1 Family Antagonists:**  
  While functionally similar to IL-1Ra, IL-36Ra has unique tissue distribution and regulatory mechanisms, particularly in the skin[1][6].

---

### 7. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Prevalence of Mutations:**  
  - **IL36RN mutations** are found in a significant proportion of GPP cases, especially in populations with early-onset or familial disease[4][8].
  - The exact prevalence varies by ethnicity and clinical subtype[8].

---

### 8. Additional Information

- **Gene Location:**  
  IL36RN is located on **chromosome 2q14.1**, within a cytokine gene cluster[3][5].

- **Alternative Splicing:**  
  Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been reported[3].
