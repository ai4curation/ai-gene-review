description: >-
  TMEM43 (also known as LUMA) encodes a highly conserved integral inner nuclear membrane
  protein with
  four transmembrane domains. The protein functions primarily as a structural/adapter
  component at the
  inner nuclear membrane (INM), where it interacts with emerin, lamins A/C, and SUN2
  to maintain
  nuclear envelope integrity and contribute to mechanotransduction through LINC complex
  associations.
  TMEM43 is required for retaining emerin at the INM. Beyond the nuclear envelope,
  TMEM43 also localizes
  to the ER membrane and, in cardiomyocytes, to intercalated discs. In cochlear glia-like
  supporting cells,
  it contributes to passive conductance current through gap junction interactions
  with connexins (Cx26/Cx30).
  Pathogenic variants cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 5
  (ARVD5, notably p.S358L),
  Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 7 (EDMD7), and autosomal dominant auditory
  neuropathy (AUNA3).
  The protein also plays roles in NF-kappa-B signaling downstream of EGFR and modulates
  innate immune
  signaling through the cGAS-STING pathway via interaction with RNF26.

        TMEM43/LUMA is predominantly localized to the inner nuclear membrane (INM),

        The IBA annotation to lipid metabolic process is propagated from phylogenetic
        analysis.
        While TMEM43 localizes to membranes and some studies have linked it to lipid-related
        pathways
        in disease contexts (e.g., adipogenic replacement in ARVC), there is no direct
        experimental
        evidence that TMEM43 itself functions in lipid metabolism as a core activity.

        This annotation appears to be an over-annotation. While ARVC5 caused by TMEM43
        mutations
        involves fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes, this is a disease consequence
        rather than
        a direct function of the protein. TMEM43 is a structural membrane protein,
        not an enzyme or
        transporter involved in lipid metabolism. The phylogenetic inference may be
        drawing from
        indirect associations rather than core molecular function.

        While the IDA evidence from this preprint should be treated with caution given
        the
        controversial claims about channel activity, plasma membrane localization
        has been
        documented in other contexts (e.g., cochlear cells, PMID:34050020). Keeping
        consistent
        with the IEA annotation for plasma membrane.

        This represents the central disputed claim of the preprint. While TMEM43 has
        been grouped
        with putative channel proteins in some reviews, the consensus is that TMEM43
        functions primarily as a structural/adapter protein. Definitive electrophysiology
        proving
        intrinsic channel activity in native contexts is lacking.

        PMID:18230648 provides direct experimental evidence that TMEM43/LUMA is required

        This is the core biological process function of TMEM43, supported by direct
        experimental
        evidence. The study demonstrated that LUMA functions as a tetraspanin-like
        membrane
        organizer and that manipulation of LUMA levels affects emerin distribution
        and nuclear
        envelope structure.

        This may represent transient localization during trafficking or a minor pool
        of the
        protein. The primary localizations are INM and ER membrane. Golgi localization
        is not
        well-supported in the primary literature for TMEM43 function but could be
        valid for
        protein trafficking.
