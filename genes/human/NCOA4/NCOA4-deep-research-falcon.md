## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q13772
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:7671}; Short=NCoA-4 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Androgen receptor coactivator 70 kDa protein {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8643607}; Short=70 kDa AR-activator {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8643607}; Short=70 kDa androgen receptor coactivator {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8643607}; AltName: Full=Androgen receptor-associated protein of 70 kDa {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Ferritin cargo receptor NCOA4 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Ret-activating protein ELE1 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=NCOA4; Synonyms=ARA70 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8643607}, ELE1, RFG;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** NCoA-4. (IPR039947); NCOA4_N. (IPR022174); ARA70 (PF12489)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NCOA4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NCOA4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NCOA4** (gene ID: NCOA4, UniProt: Q13772) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity verified: The target is human NCOA4, UniProt Q13772, historically known as ARA70/ELE1/RFG. NCOA4α is a 614-aa protein. Domain features match literature: an N-terminal coiled-coil/nuclear receptor–binding region (~1–237) and a C-terminal ferritin (FTH1)-binding region (~238–614) with substantial intrinsically disordered regions. Organism and synonymy are consistent with recent peer‑reviewed reviews and structural work (le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 1-2, hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- NCOA4 (Nuclear receptor coactivator 4): a dual-function protein acting as the selective cargo receptor for ferritinophagy and as a nuclear receptor coactivator (originally ARA70). In ferritinophagy, NCOA4 binds ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) to deliver ferritin to autophagosomes/lysosomes for degradation, releasing iron to the labile Fe2+ pool and thereby influencing iron homeostasis and ferroptosis susceptibility (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).
- Ferritinophagy: selective autophagy of ferritin mediated by NCOA4, coupling iron storage turnover to cellular iron needs; excessive activation can increase labile iron and drive ferroptotic lipid peroxidation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).
- Ferroptosis: iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation–driven regulated cell death; NCOA4-driven ferritinophagy can sensitize cells by elevating labile iron (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 12-13, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).
- Nuclear receptor coactivation: NCOA4/ARA70 can enhance nuclear receptor transcriptional activity; this function maps to the N-terminal region distinct from the ferritin-binding C-terminus (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).

Molecular architecture, localization, and mechanism
- Domains and disorder: Recent work and reviews describe an N-terminal coiled-coil/nuclear receptor–binding region (~1–237) and a C-terminal FTH1-binding region (~238–614); NCOA4 is largely intrinsically disordered apart from these functional regions (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48151-1, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 1-2, hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Cryo-EM binding interface: A 2024 Nature Communications study resolved the NCOA4–FTH1 interface, identifying a 16-aa NCOA4 motif (residues 484–499; sequence DSFQVIKNSPLSEWLI) that docks into a hydrophobic patch on FTH1; critical residues include NCOA4 I489/W497 and FTH1 R23; binding is specific for FTH1, not FTL. The work provides a structural basis for modulating ferritinophagy (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48151-1, accepted April 19, 2024) (hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Cellular localization: NCOA4 resides in the cytosol and traffics with autophagosomes/lysosomes during ferritinophagy; NCOA4 also localizes to the nucleus in its coactivator role (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).
- Iron-dependent regulation via HERC2: Under iron-replete conditions, the E3 ligase HERC2 binds NCOA4 and mediates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, restraining ferritinophagy; iron depletion stabilizes NCOA4 and promotes ferritin turnover (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5, le2024theemergingrole pages 2-3).
- ATM phosphorylation: ATM kinase promotes ferritinophagy by phosphorylating NCOA4, enhancing NCOA4–ferritin interaction; loss/inhibition of ATM reduces ferroptosis sensitivity, positioning ATM–NCOA4 as a regulatory axis for iron availability and death signaling (summarized 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 12-13).
- NRF2–HERC2–VAMP8 axis: Reviews in 2023–2024 synthesize evidence that NRF2 affects both HERC2 (controlling NCOA4/FBXL5 stability) and autophagosome–lysosome fusion (VAMP8), thereby adjusting ferritinophagy flux and the labile iron pool (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5).
- Condensates/LLPS and alternative routing: NCOA4’s IDRs can support formation of ~120 nm NCOA4 condensates under iron-replete conditions, sequestering NCOA4 away from ferritin; alternative CD63/endosomal routes for ferritin trafficking have been reported, indicating pathway plasticity (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (le2024theemergingrole pages 2-3).

Primary biological roles and pathways
- Iron homeostasis: By directing ferritin degradation, NCOA4 mobilizes stored iron for processes including heme synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism, maintaining iron balance during fluctuating supply (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5).
- Erythropoiesis and systemic iron: NCOA4 is upregulated in erythroblasts; mouse studies show Ncoa4 deficiency impairs ferritin turnover, producing hypochromic microcytic anemia and altered iron mobilization after blood loss, indicating a role in hepatic iron release and red cell iron supply (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).
- Ferroptosis regulation: Excessive ferritinophagy increases labile Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation, sensitizing cells to ferroptosis; conversely, downregulating NCOA4 limits iron release and can reduce ferroptotic death (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).
- Nuclear receptor signaling: As ARA70, NCOA4 can coactivate androgen and other nuclear receptors, providing an iron‑independent functional facet that is domain‑separable from ferritin recognition (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Structural breakthrough: The 2024 cryo-EM structure of the NCOA4–FTH1 interface defines a 16‑aa NCOA4 motif (484–499) and critical residues (NCOA4 I489/W497; FTH1 R23), providing a detailed, druggable surface for ferritinophagy modulators (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48151-1, 2024) (hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Post-translational control: Updated reviews consolidate that iron status gates NCOA4 stability via HERC2-mediated ubiquitination, while ATM-dependent phosphorylation positively tunes NCOA4–ferritin coupling, integrating DNA damage sensing with iron mobilization (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 12-13, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5).
- Systems-level regulation: NRF2’s influence on HERC2 and VAMP8 connects antioxidant signaling to ferritinophagy flux and ferroptosis resistance, linking stress responses to iron handling (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5).
- Pathway plasticity/condensates: NCOA4 forms condensates and can route ferritin via endosomal/CD63 pathways depending on iron and lysosomal status, suggesting multiple modulatable checkpoints for iron turnover (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (le2024theemergingrole pages 2-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting concepts: Reviews emphasize NCOA4–ferritin as a targetable axis to modulate the labile iron pool—either to promote ferroptosis in cancer or to limit ferroptosis in degenerative/injury settings. The 2024 structure enables rational design of small molecules or peptides to tune the NCOA4–FTH1 interaction (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48151-1, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5).
- Biomarker and disease associations: Dysregulated NCOA4/ferritinophagy is implicated in cancers and neurodegeneration; pathway state (e.g., low NCOA4 or high ferritin) associates with disease phenotypes and ferroptosis sensitivity/resistance in models, supporting translational biomarker exploration (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).

Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Comprehensive reviews (2023–2024) concur that NCOA4 is the principal ferritin cargo receptor and a hub integrating iron homeostasis with ferroptotic vulnerability. They argue for targeted ferritinophagy modulation and highlight outstanding questions on lysosomal delivery signals and condensate control (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-023-01753-y, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5, le2024theemergingrole pages 2-3, le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Structural determinants: 16-aa NCOA4 motif (484–499; DSFQVIKNSPLSEWLI) binds an FTH1 hydrophobic patch; alanine scanning and interface hydrogen bonds (e.g., FTH1 N22–NCOA4 W497; FTH1 R23–NCOA4 S492; FTH1 D90–NCOA4 S485) support residue-level contributions, with specificity for FTH1 over FTL (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48151-1, 2024) (hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Isoforms and size: Human NCOA4 encodes at least two transcript variants; NCOA4α is 614 aa (~70 kDa), and literature notes additional isoforms from alternative splicing (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 1-2, le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).
- Phenotypic outcomes: Mouse deficiency studies link NCOA4 loss to impaired ferritin turnover, hypochromic microcytic anemia, and defective iron mobilization upon blood loss (https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13621, 2024) (li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7).

Conclusions
Human NCOA4 (Q13772) is a bifunctional protein central to selective autophagic ferritin turnover and to nuclear receptor coactivation. Mechanistically, its C-terminal 16-aa motif binds FTH1 with defined residue specificity, while HERC2-mediated ubiquitination limits NCOA4 under iron repletion and ATM phosphorylation promotes ferritinophagy during stress. NCOA4 thereby tunes iron homeostasis and ferroptosis sensitivity and is essential for erythroid iron mobilization. Recent structural advances now enable rational ferritinophagy modulators, offering translational routes to either induce ferroptosis in cancer or curb iron-driven damage in degenerative and injury contexts (hoelzgen2024structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 4-5, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 12-13, wang2023ferritinophagyresearchadvance pages 1-2, li2024ferritinophagyanovel pages 5-7, le2024theemergingrole pages 2-3, le2024theemergingrole pages 1-2).
