description: NCOA4 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4) is primarily the selective cargo
  receptor for ferritinophagy, the autophagic degradation of ferritin to release stored
  iron. NCOA4 directly binds ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) via a C-terminal 16-aa motif
  (residues 484-499) and delivers the ferritin complex to autophagosomes/lysosomes
  for degradation. This function is central to intracellular iron homeostasis and
  erythropoiesis. By mobilizing stored iron, NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy also positively
  regulates ferroptosis susceptibility by increasing the labile iron pool. The legacy
  function as a transcription coactivator for androgen receptor (AR) and other nuclear
  receptors is domain-separable (N-terminal region) and now considered secondary to
  its ferritinophagy role.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER. NCOA4 was
      originally characterized as ARA70, a coactivator for the androgen receptor (PMID:8643607).
      However, the ferritinophagy function is now understood to be the primary role
      of NCOA4 (PMID:25327288). The hormone response function is secondary and relates
      to the legacy transcription coactivator activity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While NCOA4/ARA70 was originally identified as an androgen receptor coactivator
      that responds to hormones, this represents the historical/legacy function. The
      primary function of NCOA4 is now understood to be ferritinophagy cargo reception.
      The hormone response annotation is technically valid but represents a secondary,
      non-core function.

    summary: IEA annotation based on InterPro mapping. NCOA4 was originally characterized
      as ARA70, an androgen receptor coactivator (PMID:8643607). The N-terminal region
      mediates nuclear receptor interactions. This function is domain-separable from
      the ferritinophagy function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The transcription coactivator activity is a legitimate but secondary function
      of NCOA4. Modern literature (2023-2024 reviews) emphasizes ferritinophagy as
      the primary function, with coactivator function being domain-separable (N-terminal
      vs C-terminal).

  title: Isolation and characterization of ARA160 as the first androgen receptor N-terminal-associated
    coactivator in human prostate cells.
  findings:
  - statement: Paper primarily about ARA160/TMF, not NCOA4
    supporting_text: we identified an androgen-enhanced AR N-terminal-associated protein
      ARA160, which consists of 1,093 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass
      of 160 kDa
  - statement: Mentions cooperative function between ARA160 and ARA70
    supporting_text: Our data further suggest that this AR N-terminal coactivator
      can function cooperatively with AR C-terminal coactivator, ARA70, in PC-3 cells

  title: Selective VPS34 inhibitor blocks autophagy and uncovers a role for NCOA4
    in ferritin degradation and iron homeostasis in vivo.
  findings:
  - statement: Seminal paper identifying NCOA4 as ferritinophagy cargo receptor
    supporting_text: NCOA4 directly binds ferritin heavy chain-1 (FTH1) to target
      the iron-binding ferritin complex with a relative molecular mass of 450,000
      to autolysosomes following starvation or iron depletion
  - statement: NCOA4 directly binds FTH1 to target ferritin to autolysosomes

      the iron-binding ferritin complex with a relative molecular mass of 450,000
      to autolysosomes
  - statement: Ncoa4-/- mice show iron accumulation in splenic macrophages
    supporting_text: Ncoa4(-/-) mice exhibit a profound accumulation of iron in splenic
      macrophages, which are critical for the reutilization of iron from engulfed
      red blood cells

  title: Deep research synthesis on NCOA4 (2023-2024 reviews)
  findings:
  - statement: NCOA4 is the principal ferritin cargo receptor for ferritinophagy
    supporting_text: Serves as the selective cargo receptor that binds ferritin (FTH1)
      and delivers it to autophagic/lysosomal degradation
  - statement: N-terminal region mediates nuclear receptor coactivation (secondary
      function)
    supporting_text: N-terminal coiled-coil / nuclear-receptor-binding region (~1-237);
      C-terminal ferritin-binding domain (~238-614)
  - statement: Ferritinophagy positively regulates ferroptosis by increasing labile
      iron
    supporting_text: Excessive ferritinophagy increases labile Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation,
      sensitizing cells to ferroptosis
core_functions:
- description: NCOA4 is the selective autophagy cargo adaptor that binds ferritin
    heavy chain (FTH1) via its C-terminal 16-aa motif (residues 484-499) and delivers
    ferritin complexes to autophagosomes/lysosomes for degradation, releasing stored
    iron. This is the primary function of NCOA4 discovered in 2014.

suggested_questions:
- question: Is there a ferritinophagy-specific GO term that should be created?
- question: Should there be a term for "ferritin binding" as a specific molecular
    function?
- question: How should the dual-function nature of NCOA4 be represented in GO annotations?

    and coactivator functions
