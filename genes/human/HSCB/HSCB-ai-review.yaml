description: HSCB (also known as HSC20 or DNAJC20) is a mitochondrial J-domain co-chaperone
  essential for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. It functions as the co-chaperone
  for the Hsp70 chaperone HSPA9 (mitochondrial mortalin), mediating the transfer of
  nascent Fe-S clusters from the scaffold protein ISCU to recipient apoproteins. The
  J-domain of HSCB stimulates HSPA9 ATPase activity (up to ~400-fold in bacterial
  orthologs), driving conformational changes that promote cluster release from ISCU
  and transfer to client proteins. HSCB recognizes LYR motifs on recipient proteins
  and accessory factors (e.g., SDHAF1, LYRM7), conferring substrate specificity in
  Fe-S cluster delivery to respiratory chain complexes I, II, and III. A cytoplasmic
  form (C-HSC20) has been identified that may integrate mitochondrial Fe-S assembly
  with cytosolic Fe-S delivery via CIAO1.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference. HSCB is essential for Fe-S
      cluster biogenesis but functions specifically in the transfer/delivery phase
      rather than de novo assembly. The deep research confirms HSCB "acts after NFS1-ISCU
      assembly of the nascent cluster" and "facilitates transfer to clients" (Maio
      & Rouault 2022).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: HSCB does not directly assemble Fe-S clusters; it mediates their transfer
      from the ISCU scaffold to recipient proteins. The more accurate term is the
      parent GO:0016226 'iron-sulfur cluster assembly' which encompasses both assembly
      and transfer phases, or better yet, a term reflecting its co-chaperone role
      in cluster transfer. Since the IBA annotation correctly associates HSCB with
      Fe-S cluster biogenesis, keeping as non-core is appropriate.

      HSPA9 (mitochondrial Hsp70), which is essential for Fe-S cluster transfer.

      cochaperone (HscB/Jac1/HSCB) dramatically increases stimulation (reported up
      to ~400-fold in bacterial systems)" and "HSCB binds ISCU and engages HSPA9 via

      ATPase activation is mechanistically central to Fe-S cluster transfer.

  review:
    summary: NEW annotation for the complex containing HSCB that mediates Fe-S cluster
      transfer. GO defines this complex as containing "HSPA9, HSCB, GLRX5, ABCB7 and
      GFER" in humans.
    action: NEW
    reason: HSCB is a core component of the Fe-S cluster transfer complex. PMID:24606901
      demonstrates the ISCU-HSC20-HSPA9 complex is responsible for Fe-S cluster delivery
      to recipient proteins. The GO definition explicitly lists HSCB as a component
      of this complex.

  review:
    summary: NEW annotation to specify the sub-mitochondrial localization of HSCB
      in the matrix where Fe-S cluster biogenesis occurs.
    action: NEW
    reason: HSCB functions in the mitochondrial matrix where the ISC machinery resides.
      The deep research confirms "The operative system is the mitochondrial matrix,
      where HSCB, HSPA9, ISCU, NFS1/ISD11, and FXN reside and act in ISC biogenesis"
      (Maio & Rouault 2022). This is a more specific localization than generic mitochondrion.

  description: HSCB is a J-domain co-chaperone that partners with HSPA9 (mitochondrial
    Hsp70) to mediate transfer of nascent Fe-S clusters from the ISCU scaffold to
    recipient apoproteins. Its J-domain (with conserved HPD motif) stimulates HSPA9
    ATPase activity up to ~400-fold, driving conformational changes that promote cluster
    release and transfer. HSCB's C-terminal domain binds LYR motifs on recipient proteins
    and accessory factors, conferring substrate specificity.
