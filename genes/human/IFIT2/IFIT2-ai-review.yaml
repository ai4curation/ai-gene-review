description: >-
  IFIT2 (ISG54) is an interferon-stimulated gene encoding a multifunctional protein
  with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. The protein functions as a critical
  component of innate antiviral immunity through multiple mechanisms: binding AU-rich
  RNA sequences, forming heterocomplexes with IFIT1 and IFIT3 to enhance antiviral
  activity, and interacting with eIF3 to inhibit translation of unmethylated viral
  mRNAs. Beyond antiviral functions, IFIT2 directly promotes mitochondrial apoptosis
  through BCL2 family proteins (BAX/BAK-dependent). The protein exists as a domain-swapped
  homodimer and is strongly induced by type I and III interferons via JAK-STAT signaling
  and IRF3. IFIT2 is downregulated in multiple cancer types where it acts as a tumor
  suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis.
