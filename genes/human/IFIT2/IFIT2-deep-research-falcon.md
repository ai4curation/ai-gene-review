## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P09913
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2; Short=IFIT-2; AltName: Full=ISG-54 K; AltName: Full=Interferon-induced 54 kDa protein; Short=IFI-54K; Short=P54;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IFIT2; Synonyms=CIG-42, G10P2, IFI54, ISG54;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IFIT family. .
- **Key Domains:** TPR-like_helical_dom_sf. (IPR011990); TPR_rpt. (IPR019734); TPR_8 (PF13181)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IFIT2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IFIT2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IFIT2** (gene ID: IFIT2, UniProt: P09913) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview: We verified target identity (IFIT2, UniProt P09913) and compiled recent mechanistic and translational literature, prioritizing 2024 sources and definitive structural/biophysical studies. We then synthesized evidence on molecular function, complexes and specificity, localization, apoptosis/cancer roles, and recent applications. A compact summary table is embedded to map claims to sources.

Gene/protein identity and family verification
- Target: Human IFIT2 (ISG54/IFI-54K), an interferon-stimulated gene encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein in the IFIT family. The literature consistently places IFIT2 within the IFIT family and indicates it engages in IFIT heteromeric complexes that act on viral RNA at the 5′ end to inhibit translation (consistent with TPR-like scaffolding) (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary biochemical role: IFIT2 functions as part of IFIT complexes that recognize features at the 5′ end of mRNAs and inhibit translation of “non-self” viral transcripts. It forms a domain-swapped heterodimer with IFIT3 that is necessary for recognition of viral mRNA 5′ ends and antiviral translation inhibition (Nature Microbiology, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02138-w) (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13).
- Specificity determinants: Two major dimensions define targeting. (i) Cap chemistry: 2′-O methylation (cap1) and cap-adjacent m6Am act as “self” signatures that reduce binding by IFIT complexes, whereas cap0/5′ppp RNAs permit binding; m6Am at the cap-adjacent nucleotide more effectively blocks IFIT complex association than cap1 alone (RNA, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11). (ii) 5′ UTR length: short 5′ UTRs (<50 nt) represent a molecular pattern recognized by the IFIT2–IFIT3 complex to inhibit translation, sensitizing viruses such as VSV and PIV3 (Nature Microbiology, Oct 2025; URL above) (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13).
- Complex assembly and synergy: IFIT1–IFIT3 binding is strongest (nanomolar), with IFIT2–IFIT3 forming a stable heterodimer that can recruit IFIT1 to form a trimer; these assemblies potentiate IFIT1-mediated recognition of non-self RNA to block translation (RNA, Jul 2024; URL above; Viruses, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071097) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11, smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13). Viral evasion via cap 2′-O-methylation (e.g., viral methyltransferases) is a recurrent theme summarized in recent analyses (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Biophysical and kinetic dissection of cap-dependent specificity: 2024 RNA work quantified interaction hierarchies among IFIT1/2/3 and showed cap-adjacent m6Am as a potent block to IFIT complex binding, while internal 5′UTR m6A is not recognized by IFITs and does not contribute to repression (RNA, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).
- Synthesis of translation inhibition by ISGs: 2024 review summarized how IFIT complexes interact with viral RNA to trigger global or targeted translation inhibition; it highlights enhanced antiviral activity when IFITs act in heteromers (IFIT1:IFIT2 and IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3) (Viruses, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071097) (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13).
- Emerging structural mechanism (late 2025 but mechanistically definitive): Cryo-EM at 3.2 Å of the IFIT2–IFIT3 heterodimer reveals a domain-swapped architecture underlying short 5′UTR recognition and translation inhibition, establishing 5′UTR length as a pattern of innate immune recognition (Nature Microbiology, Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02138-w) (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13).

Molecular function, pathways, and interacting partners
- Function: Translation inhibition of targeted viral mRNAs. IFIT2 does not act as an enzyme; rather, as a TPR scaffold within IFIT complexes, it contributes to selective recognition of 5′ terminal RNA features and repression of translation initiation (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).
- Complexes: IFIT2–IFIT3 heterodimer is a core antiviral module; IFIT1 is often recruited into higher-order complexes (trimeric assemblies) that enhance IFIT1’s cap0/5′ppp RNA recognition and translational repression (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11, smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13).
- Specificity: Determined by mRNA cap status (cap0 vs cap1; cap-adjacent m6Am) and by 5′UTR length, with short 5′UTRs being sufficient for inhibition by the IFIT2–IFIT3 complex (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13).
- Pathway context: IFIT2 is an interferon-stimulated gene downstream of type I interferon/JAK–STAT signaling, acting as an effector in innate immunity to restrict viral translation; viral evasion strategies include 2′-O-methylation of caps to bypass IFIT-mediated restriction (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).

Subcellular localization
- Site of action: Cytoplasm at the level of mRNA 5′ ends/translation initiation. Structural and biochemical evidence indicates binding to 5′ termini of mRNAs to inhibit translation; the mechanism implies cytoplasmic localization associated with the translational machinery (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).

Roles in apoptosis and cancer biology
- Apoptosis: IFIT2 has been described as pro-apoptotic in prior experimental work (e.g., ISG54 promoting apoptosis). Recent synthesis reaffirms IFIT family members’ links to apoptosis pathways and notes IFIT2’s pro-apoptotic activity as part of host antiviral defense; however, the 2023–2024 literature retrieved here focuses more on RNA/translation mechanisms than on new apoptosis experiments (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 19-21, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).
- Cancer: IFIT-family expression is frequently induced in tumors with interferon signatures; recent reviews emphasize IFIT complexes’ roles in innate immunity with potential implications for tumor immunity, but IFIT2-specific clinical implementations remain limited in the 2023–2024 period covered by the present evidence set (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarkers: IFIT signatures are widely used as readouts of interferon pathway activation across infections and inflammatory states; however, IFIT2-specific diagnostic or therapeutic implementations remain emergent based on the compiled 2023–2024 literature, with most applications being mechanistic or pathway-level rather than IFIT2-targeted interventions (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13).
- Antiviral breadth and evasion: The cap chemistry and 5′UTR-length dependencies rationalize why certain viruses (e.g., with short 5′UTRs) are sensitive to IFIT2–IFIT3-mediated restriction and how cap 2′-O-methylation by viral enzymes enables evasion—principles useful for antiviral strategy design (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- 2024 expert synthesis: Review of ISG-mediated translation inhibition underscores cooperative IFIT action and the centrality of 5′-end RNA features in restricting viral translation (Viruses, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071097) (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13).
- 2024 biophysical authority: Quantitative binding and kinetic analyses specifying IFIT complex assembly hierarchies and cap-dependent discrimination (RNA, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).

Relevant statistics and data points
- IFIT2–IFIT3 structural mechanism: Cryo-EM resolution 3.2 Å; 5′UTR length threshold <50 nucleotides necessary and sufficient to enable translation inhibition by IFIT2–IFIT3 (Nature Microbiology, Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-025-02138-w) (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13).
- Interaction strengths: IFIT1–IFIT3 binding in the nanomolar range; IFIT1–IFIT2 and IFIT2–IFIT3 about an order of magnitude weaker; cap-adjacent m6Am strongly blocks IFIT complex-RNA association relative to cap1 (RNA, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).

Conclusions and gaps
- Human IFIT2 (P09913) is a TPR-scaffolded interferon effector that functions primarily via complexes, especially the IFIT2–IFIT3 heterodimer, to recognize particular 5′-terminal RNA features and inhibit translation. Specificity integrates cap chemistry (cap0 vs cap1; cap-adjacent m6Am) and 5′UTR length, with a clear demonstration that short 5′UTRs sensitize viral mRNAs to IFIT2–IFIT3 (glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 1-2, glasner2025theifit2–ifit3antiviral pages 12-13, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2). IFIT synergy, particularly IFIT1:IFIT3 with IFIT2 participation, enhances antiviral recognition and repression (smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2). IFIT2’s pro-apoptotic roles are supported by prior literature and noted in recent syntheses, but fewer 2023–2024 primary studies directly extended apoptosis mechanisms; clinical applications remain largely at the pathway/biomarker level rather than IFIT2-directed interventions (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 19-21, smart2024translationinhibitionmediated pages 11-13, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).
