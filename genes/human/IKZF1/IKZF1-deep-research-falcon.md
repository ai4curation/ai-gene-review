## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q13422
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA-binding protein Ikaros; AltName: Full=Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1; AltName: Full=Lymphoid transcription factor LyF-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IKZF1; Synonyms=IK1, IKAROS, LYF1, ZNFN1A1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the Ikaros C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family.
- **Key Domains:** Ikaros_C2H2-ZF. (IPR050589); Znf_C2H2_sf. (IPR036236); Znf_C2H2_type. (IPR013087); zf-C2H2 (PF00096)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IKZF1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IKZF1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IKZF1** (gene ID: IKZF1, UniProt: Q13422) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
- Identity check: IKZF1 (UniProt Q13422) encodes the human DNA-binding protein Ikaros, a lymphoid-restricted C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor. Literature consistently places IKZF1/Ikaros in the Ikaros family of C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, with N-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers and C-terminal dimerization zinc fingers, matching the UniProt description and domain architecture. These features and its role in lymphopoiesis confirm we are working on the correct human gene/protein (Homo sapiens). (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 2-4)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity, domains, and isoforms: IKZF1/Ikaros contains four N-terminal Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc fingers (F1–F4) for DNA binding and two C-terminal zinc fingers (F5–F6) that mediate homo/heterodimerization and protein interactions. Alternative splicing yields ≥16 isoforms; IK1–IK3 retain ≥3 N-terminal fingers and bind DNA, whereas shorter isoforms (e.g., IK6 from deletion of exons 4–7) lack sufficient N-terminal fingers to bind DNA but retain C-terminal fingers for dimerization, acting as dominant negatives. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 2-4, paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 1-2)
- DNA-binding motif: Ikaros recognizes a pentameric GGGAA core motif (often represented a/gGGAA), bound by its N‑terminal zinc fingers. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 1-2)
- Cellular localization and dimerization: Ikaros localizes to the nucleus with enrichment at pericentromeric heterochromatin in lymphocytes during interphase and forms homo- and heterodimers (e.g., with IKZF3/Aiolos) via C‑terminal zinc fingers. (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.23.590758, Apr 2025) (dimond2025pbktopkmediatesikaros pages 1-5)
- Principal mechanism of action: Ikaros predominantly acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting the NuRD chromatin-remodeling/HDAC complex (CHD4/RBBP4/HDAC1). Rapid, direct repression follows Ikaros binding, with focal loss of chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac at enhancers; co-repressor partners include CtBP1 and KAP1, with additional heterochromatin-associated factors (DNMT1, UHRF1, HP1). (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.29.582782, Feb 2024; and peer-reviewed update https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024024787, Jan 2025) (zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 3-6, zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 1-3, zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 27-28, zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 10-12)

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- NuRD interaction mechanism resolved: New work mapped conserved helical motifs in the intrinsically disordered region of IKZF1 that bind RBBP4 in NuRD; mutation of key KRK residues disrupts NuRD recruitment and transcriptional repression in pre‑B cells. (https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024024787, Jan 2025; preprint Feb 2024) (zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 27-28, zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 10-12, zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 3-6, zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 1-3)
- Immediate repression dominates early Ikaros response: Time-resolved analyses show that upon Ikaros induction, downregulation of target transcripts and loss of local chromatin accessibility/H3K27ac at enhancers precede any activation events, clarifying the temporal sequence of Ikaros function. (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.29.582782, Feb 2024) (zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 3-6, zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 1-3)
- Mitosis-specific regulation: PBK/TOPK kinase phosphorylates Ikaros (and other C2H2-ZFs) to evict it from mitotic chromosomes; inhibition (OTS514) reverses eviction, revealing dynamic kinase–phosphatase control of mitotic chromatin association. (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.23.590758, Apr 2025) (dimond2025pbktopkmediatesikaros pages 12-14, dimond2025pbktopkmediatesikaros pages 1-5)
- CK2-linked modulation: Phosphorylation reduces Ikaros DNA binding; CK2 and other modifiers have been implicated among top interactors in pre‑B cells, consistent with classical regulation of Ikaros by CK2/PP1. (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.29.582782, Feb 2024; review https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 1-3, paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 1-2)

3) Function, biological processes, localization, and pathways
- Lineage specification and lymphoid development: Ikaros primes hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells toward lymphoid fates and is essential for B‑ and T‑cell development; mouse deletions of N‑terminal zinc fingers or exon 5 block lymphoid differentiation. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 2-4)
- Gene programs under Ikaros control: Ikaros regulates genes involved in chromatin/transcription (e.g., HDAC9), signaling (e.g., IL7R, FLT3, NOTCH1), and antigen receptor development (e.g., RAG1, DNTT), consistent with a central role in B‑cell lineage programming. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 2-4)
- Subcellular context: Nuclear and pericentromeric heterochromatin localization in lymphocytes, dimerization via C‑terminal ZFs, and NuRD-dependent repression at enhancers clarify where and how Ikaros executes its function. (preprint; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.23.590758, Apr 2025; preprint and peer-reviewed https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.29.582782; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024024787) (dimond2025pbktopkmediatesikaros pages 1-5, zhang2024conservedhelicalmotifs pages 3-6, zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 27-28, zhang2025conservedhelicalmotifs pages 10-12)

4) Clinical relevance: alterations, biomarkers, and outcomes in B‑ALL
- Spectrum and frequencies of IKZF1 alterations: IKZF1 deletions are found in ≈15% of Ph‑negative pediatric B‑ALL overall (up to ≈30% in NCI high‑risk Ph‑negative cohorts), ≈70% in BCR::ABL1-positive (Ph+) ALL, and up to ≈68% in Ph‑like ALL; point mutations (≈2% in high‑risk pediatric cohorts) and rare fusions occur but are less common. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 4-6, paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7)
- Dominant-negative isoform IK6: The hallmark intragenic deletion of exons 4–7 generates IK6, a non‑DNA‑binding dominant negative that suppresses wild-type IKZF1 and family members. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 2-4)
- IKZF1plus biomarker: IKZF1plus is defined as an IKZF1 deletion coexisting with deletions of PAX5, CDKN2A/2B, or the PAR1 region, in the absence of ERG deletion. In AIEOP‑BFM ALL 2000, IKZF1plus occurred in ~6% and conferred adverse outcomes (5‑yr EFS 53% vs 79% for IKZF1del alone and 87% for IKZF1‑intact; 5‑yr relapse incidence 44% vs 11%). (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7)
- Population disparities and higher prevalence in specific settings: Hispanic/Latino children show enrichment of high‑risk features; IKZF1 deletions have been reported at ~30% vs 13% in non‑H/L cohorts and IKZF1plus contributes to outcome disparities. (https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.30996, Apr 2024) (kovach2024ikzf1plusalterationscontribute pages 10-14)
- Country-specific prevalence and outcomes: In an unselected Mexican pediatric B‑ALL cohort (NGS detection), IKZF1plus frequency was 21.8%, associated with older age, enrichment in high‑risk classification, and reduced 5‑yr OS; IK6 (exons 4–7 loss) and whole‑gene deletions were the most common IKZF1 events. (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1337954, Apr 2024) (garciasolorio2024ikzf1plusisa pages 6-9)
- Prognostic impact across subtypes: IKZF1 deletions associate with inferior EFS/DFS in Ph+ ALL (pre‑ and post‑TKI eras) and in Ph‑like ALL (children: 5‑yr EFS 48% vs 72%; young adults: 19% vs 43%). Even in favorable subtypes (ETV6::RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy), IKZF1 deletions, when present, reduce EFS. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7)

5) Therapeutic applications and real-world implementations
- Cereblon-recruiting degraders (IMiDs and CELMoDs): Thalidomide analogs and next‑generation CELMoDs act as molecular glues to recruit CRBN (CRL4^CRBN), triggering proteasomal degradation of IKZF1/IKZF3, which downregulates IRF4 and MYC programs and augments T/NK cell activation. (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1512666, Dec 2024) (hu2024moleculargluedegrader pages 2-4)
- Agents and clinical progression (2023–2024 emphasis): Lenalidomide and pomalidomide remain standards; next‑generation CELMoDs (iberdomide CC‑220, mezigdomide CC‑92480) bind CRBN with 10–20× higher affinity than IMiDs and induce more profound/faster IKZF1/3 degradation, showing activity in IMiD‑refractory multiple myeloma (e.g., ORR ~26% for iberdomide and ~40% for mezigdomide in early studies). Trial activity includes phase 1/2/3 studies (e.g., NCT02773030, NCT04975997, NCT03989414). (https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2024.285636, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1512666, Dec 2024) (teoh2024resistancetoimmunomodulatory pages 14-15, hu2024moleculargluedegrader pages 10-11)
- Broader hematology/oncology landscape: Reviews highlight ongoing development of CRBN-based molecular glues and CELMoDs across hematologic malignancies (including NHL), with multiple agents advancing clinically and efforts to improve selectivity and overcome resistance. (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1512666, Dec 2024) (hu2024moleculargluedegrader pages 10-11)

6) Resistance and expert analyses
- CRBN-dependent and CRBN-independent resistance: Resistance to IMiDs/CELMoDs can arise from alterations along the CRBN–IKZF1/3 axis and from parallel adaptive mechanisms. Documented non‑CRBN pathways include Wnt/β‑catenin/CD44 upregulation (adhesion-mediated resistance), MEK/ERK activation (e.g., RAS/RAF mutations; re-sensitization by MEK inhibitors in models), TRAF2 modulation, metabolic changes (elevated lactate), extracellular vesicle signaling (SORT1/LAMP2), and immune dysfunction (T‑cell exhaustion, decreased TCR diversity). Compensatory transcription factors (e.g., BATF, ETV4) can sustain IRF4/MYC despite IKZF1/3 loss. (https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2024.285636, Nov 2024) (teoh2024resistancetoimmunomodulatory pages 7-9, teoh2024resistancetoimmunomodulatory pages 6-7)
- Next‑generation strategies: Reviews propose using more potent CELMoDs (iberdomide/mezigdomide), rational combinations, and integrative CRISPR/single‑cell profiling to tackle multi‑factorial resistance in the tumor and microenvironment. (https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2024.285636, Nov 2024) (teoh2024resistancetoimmunomodulatory pages 14-15)

7) Quantitative data highlights (frequencies, outcomes)
- IKZF1 deletion frequencies: ≈15% in pediatric Ph‑negative B‑ALL overall (up to ≈30% in NCI high‑risk); ≈70% in Ph+ ALL; up to ≈68% in Ph‑like ALL. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 4-6, paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7)
- IKZF1plus outcomes (AIEOP‑BFM ALL 2000): 5‑yr EFS ~53% for IKZF1plus vs 79% for IKZF1del alone and 87% for IKZF1‑intact; 5‑yr relapse incidence 44% vs 11%. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7)
- Ethnic disparity example: IKZF1 deletions ~30% in Hispanic/Latino children compared with ~13% in non‑H/L cohorts; IKZF1plus contributes to outcome disparities. (https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.30996, Apr 2024) (kovach2024ikzf1plusalterationscontribute pages 10-14)
- Country cohort (Mexico): IKZF1plus prevalence 21.8% by NGS; associated with older age, high‑risk classification, and reduced 5‑yr OS; IK6 (exons 4–7 loss) was most frequent intragenic deletion. (https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1337954, Apr 2024) (garciasolorio2024ikzf1plusisa pages 6-9)

Notes and limitations
- Specific guideline text (e.g., ELN 2024 adult ALL diagnostic/risk recommendations) was not captured in the evidence set above; therefore, we refrain from quoting it directly here. The clinical literature summarized (including multi‑cohort and multinational studies) consistently supports integrating IKZF1 and IKZF1plus status into risk stratification due to their robust and reproducible prognostic impact in B‑ALL. (https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12010089, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1337954, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.30996, Apr 2024) (paolino2024ikzf1alterationsand pages 6-7, garciasolorio2024ikzf1plusisa pages 6-9, kovach2024ikzf1plusalterationscontribute pages 10-14)

Conclusion
IKZF1/Ikaros (Q13422) is a nuclear, lymphoid-restricted C2H2 zinc‑finger transcription factor that binds a/gGGAA motifs and predominantly enforces transcriptional repression by recruiting NuRD (CHD4/RBBP4/HDAC1) and allied co‑repressors, causing rapid loss of chromatin accessibility and enhancer H3K27ac at target sites. Its function depends on zinc‑finger–mediated DNA binding and C‑terminal dimerization, with activity modulated by phosphorylation (e.g., PBK/TOPK-driven mitotic eviction; classical CK2/PP1 control). Clinically, IKZF1 deletions and the composite IKZF1plus profile occur at substantial frequencies and consistently predict inferior outcomes in B‑ALL across ages and subtypes, with notable enrichment in certain populations. Therapeutically, CRBN-recruiting IMiDs and CELMoDs exploit IKZF1/3 degradation to treat plasma/B‑lineage malignancies, with next‑generation CELMoDs delivering deeper IKZF1/3 loss and activity in IMiD‑refractory disease, while resistance mechanisms—both CRBN‑dependent and independent—motivate rational combinations and next‑gen designs.
