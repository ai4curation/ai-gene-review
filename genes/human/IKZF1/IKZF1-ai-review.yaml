description: >-
  IKZF1 (Ikaros) is a lymphoid-restricted C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor that serves as a master
  regulator of hematopoietic cell differentiation, particularly lymphocyte development. The protein contains
  four N-terminal zinc fingers (F1-F4) that mediate sequence-specific DNA binding to a/gGGAA pentameric motifs,
  and two C-terminal zinc fingers (F5-F6) that mediate homo- and heterodimerization with other Ikaros family
  members (IKZF3/Aiolos, IKZF4/Eos, IKZF5/Pegasus). Ikaros predominantly functions as a transcriptional
  repressor by recruiting the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex (CHD4/RBBP4/HDAC1) to target gene enhancers,
  causing rapid loss of chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac marks. It also associates with the BAF (SWI/SNF)
  complex via SMARCA4. Ikaros localizes to the nucleus with enrichment at pericentromeric heterochromatin in
  proliferating lymphocytes. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation (by CK2, SYK, PBK/TOPK, and
  dephosphorylation by PP1). Alternative splicing generates multiple isoforms; IK1-IK3 retain DNA-binding
  capacity, while shorter isoforms (e.g., IK6, lacking exons 4-7) act as dominant negatives. IKZF1 deletions
  and mutations are frequent in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and are associated with poor
  prognosis. Ikaros is a therapeutic target via cereblon-recruiting immunomodulatory drugs (lenalidomide,
  pomalidomide) that trigger IKZF1 proteasomal degradation in multiple myeloma.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      Ikaros is a well-established DNA-binding transcription factor that binds a/gGGAA motifs via its
      N-terminal zinc fingers and modulates transcription of target gene sets in lymphocytes. The IBA
      annotation at this level is appropriate. However, given that Ikaros predominantly acts as a
      transcriptional repressor via NuRD recruitment, the more specific term GO:0001227 (DNA-binding
      transcription repressor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific) would be more informative for the
      primary function. Ikaros can also activate some genes, so GO:0003700 is not wrong as a general annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Ikaros is unambiguously a DNA-binding transcription factor. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic
      inference is well-supported by extensive experimental evidence from multiple publications
      demonstrating sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This term is at the
      right level of generality since Ikaros can both repress and activate transcription depending on
      context.

      This is a valid broader IEA annotation. There are more specific IDA and IBA annotations (GO:0000978,

      are nuclear. This annotation appears to be based on isoform Ik6 behavior.

      While the canonical Ikaros isoforms are nuclear, the dominant-negative Ik6 isoform (lacking
      exons 4-7 and thus the DNA-binding zinc fingers) localizes to the cytoplasm. The IEA is derived
      from UniProt subcellular location which notes this. The annotation is technically correct but

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning model. Hematopoietic cells are derived from mesoderm,
      so there is an indirect connection, but Ikaros is not a core regulator of mesoderm development
      per se. Its role is specifically in lymphoid and hematopoietic cell differentiation.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While hematopoietic cells are mesodermal derivatives, annotating Ikaros to mesoderm development
      is over-annotation. Ikaros functions specifically in hematopoietic and lymphoid lineage commitment
      and differentiation, not in broad mesoderm specification. The ARBA model likely inferred this from
      the association of lymphoid development with mesodermal lineage, but the annotation is too general
      and misleading for Ikaros's actual role.

      Ikaros predominantly functions as a transcriptional repressor. It recruits the NuRD chromatin
      remodeling/HDAC complex to target gene enhancers, causing rapid loss of chromatin accessibility
      and H3K27ac. Recent work (Zhang et al., Blood 2025) mapped the conserved helical motifs in the
      Ikaros disordered region that mediate NuRD binding. Time-resolved analyses show that repression
      (downregulation of targets, loss of H3K27ac) is the immediate dominant response upon Ikaros
      induction, preceding any activation events. This is the most specific and informative MF term
      for Ikaros's primary transcriptional activity, as recommended by the GO TF annotation guidelines.

      Per GO transcription factor annotation guidelines, the recommended MF annotation for a DNA-binding
