        MISANNOTATION: ERG is an ETS-family transcription factor that is extensively
        PHOSPHORYLATED by kinases. PMID:8502479 explicitly states "ERG-2 is a nuclear
        phosphoprotein" and "ERG-2 protein is phosphorylated by activation of protein
        kinase C" - ERG is the SUBSTRATE of phosphorylation, not the enzyme. ERG has
        DNA-binding and transcription activator activity, not kinase activity. The
        phosphorylation of ERG by PKC and other kinases regulates its function as
        a
        transcription factor.
