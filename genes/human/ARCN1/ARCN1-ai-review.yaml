description: Archain 1 (ARCN1) encodes the delta subunit of the coat protein I 
  (COPI) coatomer complex, a heptameric protein assembly essential for 
  retrograde vesicle-mediated transport from the Golgi apparatus to the 
  endoplasmic reticulum and for intra-Golgi trafficking. As δ-COP, ARCN1 
  functions as a structural component of the F-subcomplex (adaptor-like complex)
  of coatomer, participating in cargo recognition of proteins bearing dilysine 
  motifs and HDEL-type ER retrieval signals. The protein localizes to the Golgi 
  membrane, ER membrane, COPI-coated vesicles, and cytosol, where it cycles 
  between membrane-bound and cytoplasmic pools depending on ARF1 GTPase 
  activity. ARCN1 is highly evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes and is 
  essential for cell viability; heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause a 
  recognizable developmental syndrome with micrognathia, short stature, and 
  developmental delay.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for Golgi localization based on phylogenetic 
      inference. ARCN1 as a COPI coatomer subunit is involved in maintaining 
      Golgi organization through retrograde transport and cisternal maturation 
      mechanisms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects a core function of ARCN1. The 
      deep research indicates that "ARCN1 participates in retrograde transport 
      within the Golgi stack itself, a process critical for driving cisternal 
      maturation and maintaining proper Golgi organization" and that "disruption
      of COPI function results in Golgi fragmentation and dispersal into 
      punctate cytoplasmic structures." The IBA evidence is well-supported by 
      the protein's essential role in COPI-mediated recycling that maintains 
      Golgi structural integrity.

      supporting_text: The participation of ARCN1 in maintaining Golgi 
        morphology and structural integrity represents another important aspect 
        of its cellular functions. The Golgi apparatus adopts a characteristic 
        stacked cisternae organization in most mammalian cells, maintained 
        through precise balance between anterograde cargo flux and retrograde 
        recycling of membrane components. Disruption of COPI function, whether 
        through depleting ARCN1 or other COPI subunits, results in Golgi 
        fragmentation and dispersal into punctate cytoplasmic structures, 
        indicating that COPI-dependent recycling actively maintains Golgi 
        architectural organization.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for ER to Golgi transport. While ARCN1/COPI 
      primarily mediates retrograde (Golgi to ER) transport, it does participate
      indirectly in maintaining the forward ER-to-Golgi pathway through 
      recycling mechanisms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This annotation is partially correct but misleading regarding the 
      primary directionality of ARCN1 function. ARCN1 is a component of COPI, 
      which primarily mediates retrograde transport FROM Golgi TO ER, not the 
      anterograde direction implied by this term. While COPI function is 
      essential for maintaining ER-Golgi cycling and indirectly supports 
      anterograde transport by recycling ER-escaped proteins and Golgi enzymes, 
      the primary role is retrograde. The more accurate annotation would be the 
      retrograde process GO:0006890, which is also present in the annotation 
      set.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct and represents a core cellular component 
      localization of ARCN1. The term GO:0030137 (COPI-coated vesicle) is

      structure. While there is some redundancy with other COPI component terms,
      the different aspects (coat vs vesicle vs membrane) provide complementary

      interacts closely with δ-COP within coatomer, binds to RNA binding 
      proteins including nucleolin" and suggests "potential roles for COPI in 
      intracellular RNA trafficking." However, it is unclear whether ARCN1 
      itself directly binds RNA, whether this is mediated through associated 
      proteins, or whether this represents a non-specific association. Without 
      mechanistic data demonstrating direct RNA binding by ARCN1 or showing that
      this activity is functionally important for ARCN1's role in vesicular

  review:
    summary: ISS annotation based on sequence similarity to experimentally 
      characterized ortholog (likely yeast Ret2). ARCN1 is a core COPI vesicle 
      coat component.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct. ISS (Inferred from Sequence or 
      Structural Similarity) evidence from orthologs like yeast Ret2 (the S. 
      cerevisiae ortholog of ARCN1) supports this annotation. The COPI complex 
      and its delta subunit are highly conserved across eukaryotes. This 
      represents a fourth independent line of evidence (IBA, IEA, NAS, ISS) for 
      ARCN1's fundamental role as a COPI coat component, which is well-justified
      given the extreme evolutionary conservation of this function.

        extends beyond simple sequence identity to encompass functional 
        equivalence, as yeast Ret2 can substitute for mammalian ARCN1 in 
        complementation experiments.

  review:
    summary: TAS annotation from the original ARCN1 gene characterization paper.
      This is an accurate general term for ARCN1's biological process function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct and comes from the seminal paper 
      characterizing the human ARCN1 gene (PMID:7782067). The abstract states 
      ARCN1 has "a possible role in vesicle structure or trafficking" based on 
      its relationship to clathrin-associated proteins. While this is a general 
      parent term, it accurately captures ARCN1's role in intracellular protein 
      transport. The more specific child terms (retrograde transport, ER-Golgi 
      transport) provide mechanistic detail, while this appropriately describes 
      the broad functional category. This is one of the earliest experimental 
      characterizations linking ARCN1 to protein transport.

  evidence_type: ISS
  review:
    summary: Proposed new annotation for structural molecule activity based on 
      ARCN1's role as the delta subunit of the COPI coatomer complex. ARCN1 
      contributes to the structural integrity of the heptameric coatomer 
      assembly.
    action: NEW
    reason: ARCN1 functions as a structural component of the COPI coatomer 
      complex, contributing to the overall architecture and stability of the 
      heptamer. The delta subunit forms part of the F-subcomplex (adaptor-like 
      complex) and interacts extensively with beta-COP to maintain coat 
      integrity. This structural role is essential for vesicle formation and 
      cargo packaging. The ISS evidence code reflects inference from sequence 
      similarity to well-characterized orthologs including yeast Ret2.
