description: Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2 is a secreted plasma protein that is a component of the inter-alpha-inhibitor (IαI) protease inhibitor complex. ITIH2 acts as a carrier and regulatory protein for hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix, participating in ECM stabilization through TSG-6-mediated transfer of heavy chains to hyaluronan. The protein contains VIT and VWFA domains, is linked to bikunin via chondroitin sulfate, and is phosphorylated by FAM20C in the extracellular space.

    label: serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation is based on InterPro domain mapping and UniProtKB keyword assignment. While ITIH2 is part of the inter-alpha-inhibitor complex, the actual serine protease inhibitor activity resides in the bikunin subunit, not in the ITIH2 heavy chain itself.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: ITIH2 (the heavy chain H2) does not possess intrinsic serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity. The inhibitory activity of the inter-alpha-inhibitor complex comes from the bikunin light chain, not from the heavy chains. As stated in PMID:2476436, "each protein contained a single, identical, trypsin-inhibitory chain of 30,000 Da" referring to bikunin, while "Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor contains noninhibitory heavy chains of 65,000 and 70,000 Da." ITIH2 is one of these noninhibitory heavy chains. The deep research confirms "ITIH2 acts as a serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor" is misleading - it's the bikunin component that has this activity.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation is based on UniProtKB subcellular location vocabulary mapping. ITIH2 is indeed a secreted protein found in plasma and extracellular fluids. However, this term is very broad and less informative than more specific cellular component annotations available.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this annotation is correct, it is quite general. ITIH2 is secreted into plasma and the extracellular space as confirmed by UniProt ("Secreted") and deep research showing it is a "secreted plasma protein found in the extracellular space." The annotation is supported by experimental evidence (PMID:14718574) which identified ITIH2 in the human plasma proteome. This term is acceptable as a broad localization statement, though more specific terms like "extracellular matrix" provide better functional context.

    label: hyaluronan metabolic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation is based on InterPro domain mapping. ITIH2 plays a crucial role in hyaluronan biology through TSG-6-mediated transfer of heavy chains to hyaluronan, stabilizing the ECM and regulating hyaluronan localization and interactions.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures a core function of ITIH2. The protein is directly involved in hyaluronan metabolic processes through its interactions with hyaluronan. PMID:20463016 demonstrates that "TSG-6/HC2 transfer HCs from bikunin proteins to HA" and shows "a dynamic shuffling of the HCs occur in vivo" between glycosaminoglycans including hyaluronan. The deep research confirms ITIH2 "binds and stabilizes hyaluronan in the ECM" and is "covalently linking to hyaluronan, mediated by TSG-6." UniProt states ITIH2 may act as "a binding protein between hyaluronan and other matrix protein...to regulate the localization, synthesis and degradation of hyaluronan."

    label: peptidase inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword mapping. Like GO:0004867, this annotation incorrectly attributes the protease inhibitor activity of the inter-alpha-inhibitor complex to the ITIH2 heavy chain, when it actually resides in the bikunin subunit.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: ITIH2 itself does not have peptidase inhibitor activity. This is the same fundamental issue as GO:0004867. The heavy chains (including ITIH2/HC2) are structural components that are linked to bikunin via chondroitin sulfate, but they do not possess enzymatic inhibitor activity. PMID:2476436 clearly identifies bikunin as "the trypsin-inhibitory chain" while describing ITIH2 and other heavy chains as "noninhibitory." The annotation conflates the complex's activity with ITIH2's individual molecular function.

  review:
    summary: This IPI annotation is based on experimental evidence showing ITIH2 interaction with bikunin in the context of TSG-6-mediated complex formation. While technically correct, the generic "protein binding" term is uninformative and should be replaced with more specific molecular function terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:16873769 demonstrates that TSG-6 interacts with heavy chains from inter-alpha-inhibitor, stating "TSG-6 forms covalent complexes with heavy chains (HCs) from inter-alpha-inhibitor and pre-alpha-inhibitor and associates noncovalently with their common bikunin chain." While this confirms protein-protein interaction, the term "protein binding" is too vague per curation guidelines. ITIH2's role is better captured by more specific terms describing its function in hyaluronan binding and ECM organization rather than generic protein binding.

While protein binding is occurring, this generic term does not capture the specific molecular function.

PMID:20463016 directly demonstrates that "heavy chain (HC) subunits of the bikunin proteins...can be transferred to different hyaluronan (HA) molecules by TSG-6/HC2" and shows "HC·HA complex" formation. The paper demonstrates reversible binding, showing "HCs transferred to HA may function as HC donors in subsequent transfer reactions" and "a dynamic shuffling of the HCs occur in vivo."

UniProt states ITIH2 may act as "a binding protein between hyaluronan and other matrix protein." The HDA evidence from proteomics studies of ECM is appropriate for this localization, as ITIH2 functions in the ECM compartment through its interactions with hyaluronan and other matrix components.

The deep research notes "ITIH2 is downregulated in multiple solid tumors (breast, colon, lung), correlating with loss of tumor suppressor activity and increased invasiveness." The identification of ITIH2 in ECM preparations from cancer tissues, even if at altered levels, confirms its ECM localization and is consistent with its biological role.

    summary: This TAS annotation is based on Reactome pathway annotation for FAM20C phosphorylation of substrates. While ITIH2 is phosphorylated by FAM20C, this kinase is an extracellular kinase, not an ER-localized one.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation appears to be incorrect. The Reactome pathway R-HSA-8952289 describes "FAM20C phosphorylates FAM20C substrates" and notes that "Extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase FAM20C is an extracellular kinase." UniProt confirms ITIH2 is "Phosphorylated by FAM20C in the extracellular medium." ITIH2 is a secreted protein that functions in the extracellular space and is phosphorylated there, not in the ER lumen. While ITIH2 transiently passes through the ER during secretion, annotation to ER lumen does not represent a functionally relevant localization for this mature, secreted protein.

  review:
    summary: This HDA annotation is based on proteomic analysis of exosomes from prostatic secretions. While ITIH2 was detected in these preparations, this likely represents contamination with abundant plasma proteins rather than specific exosomal localization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: ITIH2 is an abundant plasma protein, and its detection in exosome preparations may reflect plasma contamination rather than bona fide exosomal localization. Exosomes are secreted in biological fluids that also contain plasma proteins, making it difficult to distinguish true exosomal components from co-purifying plasma proteins in HDA studies. While ITIH2 may be present in exosomal fractions, this does not represent a core functional localization. The primary and functionally relevant localization of ITIH2 is in plasma and the ECM where it stabilizes hyaluronan. This annotation should be kept but marked as non-core.

Detection in blood microparticle preparations likely reflects the plasma milieu in which these particles exist rather than specific functional association with microparticles. The title of PMID:22516433 indicates "high individual variability" in the proteomic analysis, suggesting some non-specific associations. While this annotation may be technically correct, it does not represent a core functional localization for ITIH2, whose primary functions are in plasma and ECM.
