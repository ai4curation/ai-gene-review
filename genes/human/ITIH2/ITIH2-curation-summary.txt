ITIH2 GO Annotation Curation Summary
=====================================

Gene: ITIH2 (Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2)
UniProt: P19823
Date: 2025-11-16

OVERVIEW:
ITIH2 is a secreted plasma protein that serves as a heavy chain component of the inter-alpha-inhibitor complex. Its core function involves binding and stabilizing hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix through TSG-6-mediated transfer reactions.

ANNOTATION REVIEW RESULTS:
Total annotations reviewed: 16
- ACCEPT: 6 annotations
- REMOVE: 4 annotations  
- MODIFY: 2 annotations
- KEEP_AS_NON_CORE: 4 annotations

KEY FINDINGS:

1. REMOVED PROTEASE INHIBITOR ANNOTATIONS (4 annotations):
   - GO:0004867 (serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity) - IEA
   - GO:0030414 (peptidase inhibitor activity) - IEA
   - GO:0004866 (endopeptidase inhibitor activity) - TAS
   
   Rationale: These annotations incorrectly attribute the protease inhibitor activity of the inter-alpha-inhibitor COMPLEX to the ITIH2 heavy chain itself. PMID:2476436 clearly demonstrates that the inhibitory activity resides in the bikunin light chain (30 kDa), while ITIH2 and other heavy chains (65-70 kDa) are "noninhibitory." This is a critical correction as ITIH2 does not possess intrinsic protease inhibitor activity.

2. ACCEPTED CORE FUNCTIONS (6 annotations):
   - GO:0005540 (hyaluronic acid binding) - IDA from PMID:20463016 ✓ CORE
   - GO:0030212 (hyaluronan metabolic process) - IEA ✓ CORE  
   - GO:0031012 (extracellular matrix) - HDA x3 studies ✓ CORE
   - GO:0005576 (extracellular region) - IEA and NAS ✓

3. MODIFIED GENERIC ANNOTATIONS (2 annotations):
   - GO:0005515 (protein binding) x2 - IPI from PMID:16873769 and PMID:20463016
   
   Action: MODIFY to GO:0005540 (hyaluronic acid binding)
   Rationale: Per curation guidelines, "protein binding" is too vague and uninformative. The specific molecular function is hyaluronan binding through TSG-6-mediated interactions.

4. REMOVED INCORRECT LOCALIZATION:
   - GO:0005788 (endoplasmic reticulum lumen) - TAS from Reactome
   
   Rationale: ITIH2 is phosphorylated by FAM20C, which is an EXTRACELLULAR kinase, not an ER kinase. While ITIH2 transiently passes through the ER during secretion, this does not represent a functionally relevant localization.

5. NON-CORE LOCALIZATIONS (4 annotations):
   - GO:0070062 (extracellular exosome) - HDA x2 
   - GO:0072562 (blood microparticle) - HDA
   
   Rationale: As an abundant plasma protein, ITIH2 detection in exosomal/microparticle preparations likely reflects plasma contamination rather than specific functional association. Kept but marked as non-core.

CORE FUNCTION SYNTHESIS:
Molecular Function: GO:0005540 (hyaluronic acid binding)
Biological Process: GO:0030212 (hyaluronan metabolic process)  
Cellular Component: GO:0031012 (extracellular matrix)

ITIH2's primary function is binding and stabilizing hyaluronan in the ECM through dynamic, TSG-6-mediated heavy chain transfer reactions. This creates HC-HA complexes that regulate ECM organization, cell migration, and tissue integrity.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- ECM stabilization and organization
- Regulation of inflammation (negative acute phase protein)
- Tumor suppression (downregulated in breast, colon, lung cancers)
- Potential biomarker for SLE and cancer
