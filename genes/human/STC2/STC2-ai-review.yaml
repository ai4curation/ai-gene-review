description: >-
  STC2 (Stanniocalcin-2) is a secreted glycoprotein hormone belonging to the stanniocalcin family,
  functioning as an autocrine/paracrine regulator. It localizes to the ER and Golgi apparatus
  and is secreted to the extracellular space, with secretion enhanced during ER stress. STC2 is
  robustly induced by the unfolded protein response (UPR) via the PERK-ATF4 pathway and provides
  cytoprotective effects under cellular stress. Mechanistically, STC2 acts as (1) a negative
  modulator of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through physical interaction with the ER
  calcium sensor STIM1, (2) an inhibitor of pappalysin metalloproteinases (PAPP-A/PAPP-A2),
  thereby reducing IGFBP proteolysis and modulating local IGF bioavailability, and (3) a
  regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis with anti-hypocalcemic properties. STC2 also
  forms complexes with heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), binds heme, and functions as a heat shock
  protein. The protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers and is N-glycosylated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      STC2 regulates intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, consistent with the stanniocalcin family's
      ancestral role in fish as calcium-regulating hormones. In mammals, STC2 is described as having
      anti-hypocalcemic action on calcium and phosphate homeostasis (UniProt). Deep research indicates
      STC2 is a negative modulator of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through physical interaction
      with STIM1, thereby modulating calcium homeostasis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation is consistent with the conserved role of stanniocalcins in calcium/phosphate
      regulation and with experimental evidence showing STC2 modulates calcium signaling via SOCE/STIM1.
      This represents a core function of STC2.

  review:
    summary: >-
      STC2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of pappalysin metalloproteinases (PAPP-A and PAPP-A2).
      By inhibiting these metalloendopeptidases, STC2 reduces IGFBP proteolysis and thereby
      modulates local IGF bioavailability. This represents a well-established mechanism of STC2
      action supported by biochemical and genetic studies.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This molecular function is not currently annotated in GO for STC2 but is well-supported
      by deep research literature. PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 are metalloendopeptidases, and STC2
      inhibition of their activity is a core function linking STC2 to growth regulation
      via the IGF axis.

    description: >-
      STC2 is a secreted glycoprotein hormone belonging to the stanniocalcin family. It functions
      as an autocrine/paracrine regulator with anti-hypocalcemic action on calcium and phosphate
      homeostasis. STC2 regulates target cell function including suppression of steroidogenesis
      in granulosa cells.

    description: >-
      STC2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of pappalysin metalloproteinases (PAPP-A and PAPP-A2),
      thereby reducing IGFBP proteolysis and modulating local insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
      bioavailability. This is a key mechanism linking STC2 to growth regulation.

      label: heme binding
    description: >-
      STC2 binds hemin via a consensus heme regulatory motif. This was demonstrated experimentally
      and suggests STC2 may function in heme metabolism as part of a stressosome complex with HO-1.

      STC2 forms disulfide-linked homodimers. This is the functional form of the protein required
      for its hormone activity.
