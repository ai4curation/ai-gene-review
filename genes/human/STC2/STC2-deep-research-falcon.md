## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O76061
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stanniocalcin-2; Short=STC-2; AltName: Full=Stanniocalcin-related protein; Short=STC-related protein; Short=STCRP; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=STC2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the stanniocalcin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Stanniocalcin. (IPR004978); Stanniocalcin (PF03298)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "STC2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'STC2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **STC2** (gene ID: STC2, UniProt: O76061) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: In-progress objectives 2–6. We verified target identity (Objective 1: completed) and gathered peer‑reviewed evidence spanning mechanism, localization, and 2023–2024 translational studies for human STC2 (UniProt O76061). Below is a comprehensive research report. An at‑a‑glance artifact table is embedded.

Gene/protein identification and definitions
- Identity and family: STC2 (stanniocalcin‑2) is a human secreted glycoprotein hormone in the stanniocalcin family (paralog of STC1), originally related to fish stanniocalcins that regulate mineral balance. Mammalian STC2 is widely expressed and functions primarily in autocrine/paracrine modes rather than as a high‑abundance circulating hormone (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004; Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011; Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6, zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2, joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 1-2). URL (Ito 2004): https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.24.21.9456-9469.2004; URL (Zeiger 2011): https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05140-11; URL (Joshi 2020): https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00172. Published: Nov 2004; Sep 2011; Mar 2020, respectively.
- Domain features and processing: STC2 contains an N‑terminal signal peptide for ER import, is N‑glycosylated, and forms part of the secretory pathway. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation place endogenous STC2 predominantly in the ER and Golgi, and it is secreted into conditioned media—particularly during ER stress (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.24.21.9456-9469.2004. Published: Nov 2004.

Primary functions, pathways, and localization
- ER stress/UPR regulation and cytoprotection: STC2 is a robust unfolded protein response (UPR) target induced by ER stressors (tunicamycin, thapsigargin) via the PERK→ATF4 arm and contributes to cytoprotection under stress. In primary astrocytes, Stc2 transcripts are upregulated hundreds‑fold by ER stress; protein is strongly induced and secreted. Localization remains ER/Golgi with increased secretion upon stress (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004; Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011; Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6, zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2, joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5). URL (Ito 2004): https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.24.21.9456-9469.2004; URL (Zeiger 2011): https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05140-11; URL (Joshi 2020): https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00172.
- Calcium handling: STC2 is a negative modulator of store‑operated calcium entry (SOCE). STC2 deficiency increases Ca2+ influx after ER store depletion, while overexpression attenuates SOCE. STC2 physically interacts with the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1, linking it to ER→plasma membrane Ca2+ signaling (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011) (zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05140-11. Published: Sep 2011.
- IGF axis modulation (biochemical mechanism): Mammalian STC2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of pappalysin metalloproteinases (PAPP‑A/PAPP‑A2), thereby reducing IGFBP proteolysis and modulating local insulin‑like growth factor (IGF) bioavailability. Human genetic observations and experimental work link impaired STC2‑mediated inhibition to altered IGF signaling. While receptor identity for STC2 remains undefined, the PAPP‑A/IGFBP/IGF axis provides a well‑supported biochemical pathway of action (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00172. Published: Mar 2020.

Recent developments (2023–2024 emphasis)
- Population/heritability statistics: In a 2023 elderly twin cohort (n=596; age 73–94), median serum STC2 ≈ 29.3 ng/mL; males had ≈18% higher concentrations than females (all sex differences P<0.001). Broad‑sense heritability for circulating STC2 was substantial (~66%), indicating a strong genetic contribution to interindividual variation (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2023) (hjortebjerg2023heritabilityandcirculating pages 3-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1193742. Published: Jun 2023.
- ER stress and cancer prognosis: Multi‑omics and clinical IHC studies in osteosarcoma (2024) implicated STC2 as an ER stress‑related risk indicator for disease progression. STC2 was higher in tumors than adjacent tissues and integrated into ER stress–based prognostic models (Frontiers in Oncology, 2024) (yu2024endoplasmicreticulumstressrelated pages 7-10). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1453173. Published: Jul 2024.
- Tumor immune microenvironment and antigen presentation: In osteosarcoma models and clinical samples, high STC2 was linked to immune evasion: STC2 knockdown increased MHC‑I component expression (HLA‑A, HLA‑B, B2M) and enhanced CD8+ T‑cell effector markers; STC2 protein inversely correlated with CD8+ T‑cell infiltration (p<0.0001, R≈−0.35; n=62). Pan‑cancer bioinformatics showed STC2 upregulation across multiple tumor types and association with immune checkpoint pathways (Journal of Translational Medicine, 2024) (chen2024constructionofan pages 7-11). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04794-0. Published: Jan 2024.

Cellular/subcellular site of action and secretion
- Localization: Predominantly ER and Golgi compartments under basal and stress conditions; secreted to the extracellular milieu, especially during ER stress (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.24.21.9456-9469.2004.
- Mode of action: Autocrine/paracrine secreted factor with intracellular roles in ER Ca2+ handling (via STIM1 interaction) and extracellular modulation of IGF bioavailability via PAPP‑A/PAPP‑A2 inhibition (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011; Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2, joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05140-11; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00172.

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Biomarker and prognostic utility in cancer: Multiple studies link higher STC2 to aggressive features and worse outcomes across cancers; in osteosarcoma, ER stress–based models and tissue IHC established STC2 as a prognostic risk indicator and an immune‑evasion mediator (Frontiers in Oncology, 2024; Journal of Translational Medicine, 2024) (yu2024endoplasmicreticulumstressrelated pages 7-10, chen2024constructionofan pages 7-11). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1453173; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04794-0.
- Population biomarker characteristics: Circulating STC2 is measurable in older adults (median ~29.3 ng/mL), shows sex differences (≈18% higher in men), and substantial heritability (~66%), all relevant to clinical biomarker development and interpretation (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2023) (hjortebjerg2023heritabilityandcirculating pages 3-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1193742.

Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic consensus: The most consistent, experimentally grounded roles for human STC2 are (i) a UPR‑inducible secreted glycoprotein that promotes cytoprotection under stress; (ii) a negative regulator of SOCE through interaction with STIM1, thereby modulating Ca2+ signaling; and (iii) an inhibitor of PAPP‑A/A2 that shapes local IGF bioavailability. These mechanisms are supported by rigorous cell biology and biochemistry (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004; Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011; Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6, zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2, joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5). URLS above.
- Translational implications (2023–2024): Recent oncology studies suggest STC2 contributes to ER stress adaptation and immune escape in tumors. Its consistent induction by cellular stress and its capacity to dampen antigen presentation and CD8+ infiltration in osteosarcoma position STC2 as a candidate biomarker and potential therapeutic target to enhance antitumor immunity. However, a bona fide cell‑surface receptor remains unidentified, and the precise extracellular signaling pathway beyond PAPP‑A/A2 inhibition is incomplete, indicating a need for receptor discovery and careful target validation before drug development (Frontiers in Oncology, 2024; Journal of Translational Medicine, 2024) (yu2024endoplasmicreticulumstressrelated pages 7-10, chen2024constructionofan pages 7-11).

Relevant statistics and data
- ER stress induction of STC2: Up to ~400–900‑fold mRNA induction by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in primary astrocytes; secreted protein robustly increases with ER stress in cultured cells (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2004) (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.24.21.9456-9469.2004.
- Serum/population metrics: Elderly twins (n=596) — median STC2 ≈ 29.3 ng/mL; males 18% higher than females; broad‑sense heritability ~66% (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2023) (hjortebjerg2023heritabilityandcirculating pages 3-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1193742.
- Tumor immune contexture: In osteosarcoma samples, STC2 inversely correlated with CD8+ T‑cell infiltration (p<0.0001, R≈−0.35, n=62) and STC2 knockdown increased MHC‑I gene expression and CD8+ effector markers in co‑culture assays (Journal of Translational Medicine, 2024) (chen2024constructionofan pages 7-11). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04794-0.

Open questions and limitations
- Receptor identification: No definitive STC2 cognate receptor has been described in humans; many actions likely reflect a combination of intracellular ER/Golgi processes (e.g., SOCE modulation) and extracellular modulation of protease activity in the IGF axis (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020; Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2011) (joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5, zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2). URLS: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00172; https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05140-11.
- Context specificity in cancer: While many datasets link higher STC2 to aggressive biology, exceptions exist (e.g., context‑dependent effects in some breast cancer models), emphasizing the need to resolve lineage‑specific and microenvironmental determinants (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2020) (joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 5-6).

*Table: Concise summary table of human STC2 (UniProt O76061) covering identity, processing, localization, mechanistic roles (Ca2+ handling, IGF‑axis modulation, stress regulation), and 2023–2024 translational/population evidence with primary sources cited.*

Conclusion
STC2 (UniProt O76061) is a human stanniocalcin family glycoprotein that is ER/Golgi‑localized and secreted, potently induced by ER stress through PERK→ATF4, and acts as a negative regulator of SOCE via STIM1 as well as an extracellular inhibitor of PAPP‑A/PAPP‑A2, thereby tuning local IGF bioavailability. Recent 2023–2024 studies strengthen its relevance in oncology—linking STC2 to ER stress–based prognosis and tumor immune evasion—while population data establish measurable, heritable circulating STC2 levels. The absence of a defined receptor remains a key knowledge gap; nonetheless, STC2’s convergence on Ca2+ signaling, stress adaptation, and the IGF axis make it a plausible biomarker and potential therapeutic node in stress‑adapted and immune‑evasive tumors (ito2004characterizationofstanniocalcin pages 4-6, zeiger2011stanniocalcin2is pages 1-2, joshi2020newinsightsinto pages 3-5, yu2024endoplasmicreticulumstressrelated pages 7-10, chen2024constructionofan pages 7-11, hjortebjerg2023heritabilityandcirculating pages 3-5).
