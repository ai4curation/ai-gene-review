description: >-
  SDHD encodes the small cytochrome b-like membrane anchor subunit (CybS) of
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, Complex II), a heterotetrameric enzyme
  (SDHA/SDHB/SDHC/SDHD) embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. SDHD
  has three transmembrane helices and, together with SDHC, forms the membrane
  anchor domain that attaches the hydrophilic SDHA/SDHB catalytic head to
  the inner membrane. SDHD and SDHC together coordinate one heme b group
  (with His102 of SDHD serving as an axial ligand) and form the
  ubiquinone-binding entrance channel (involving SDHD TM2 helix and
  Tyr114 directly contacting ubiquinone). Complex II is unique among OXPHOS
  complexes in that it does NOT pump protons across the inner membrane.
  SDHD has no independent catalytic activity but contributes structurally
  to the ubiquinone binding site and electron sink function of heme b.
  SDHD functions as a tumor suppressor; heterozygous loss-of-function
  germline mutations cause hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma
  syndrome type 1 (PPGL1) via succinate accumulation acting as an
  oncometabolite. Biallelic mutations cause mitochondrial complex II
  deficiency type 3 (MC2DN3) with encephalomyopathy and cardiomyopathy.

      inner membrane protein with a short N-terminal region (residues 57-63) in the
      matrix and the bulk of the protein spanning the membrane. The cryo-EM structure
      (PMID:37098072) maps SDHD topology showing matrix-facing and IMS-facing regions.
      This annotation is misleading because SDHD is not primarily active in the matrix;
      its functional role is within the membrane and at the quinone-binding site.

      SDHD is an integral membrane protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
      While a small N-terminal loop faces the matrix, calling SDHD 'is_active_in'

      is the inner mitochondrial membrane (GO:0005743) which is already well-annotated.

      SDHD alone cannot catalyze this reaction; it provides the membrane anchor and

      TAS annotation for electron transfer activity based on the original cloning study

      heme b (electron sink) and forming the ubiquinone-binding site where the terminal
      electron transfer step occurs. However, SDHD itself does not harbor iron-sulfur
      clusters or FAD; the primary electron transfer function resides in SDHB. The

      semiquinone intermediates rather than being a primary electron carrier.

      SDHD contributes to electron transfer through heme b coordination and ubiquinone

  description: >-
    SDHD is the small cytochrome b-like membrane anchor subunit (cybS) of succinate
    dehydrogenase (Complex II). Together with SDHC, it forms the membrane anchor domain
    that attaches the catalytic SDHA:SDHB subcomplex to the inner mitochondrial membrane.
    SDHD provides the His102 axial ligand to the heme b (cytochrome b560) iron atom shared
    between SDHC and SDHD, making heme binding (GO:0020037) its primary subunit-specific
    molecular function. SDHD also contributes to ubiquinone binding at the Q-site (Tyr114
    directly contacts ubiquinone at the entrance pocket formed by SDHC TM1, SDHD TM2, and
    SDHB C-terminus). SDHD has no independent catalytic activity but contributes to the
    overall succinate dehydrogenase (quinone) activity (GO:0008177) of the Complex II
    heterotetramer. The heme b coordinated by SDHD and SDHC serves as an electron sink
    stabilizing semiquinone intermediates during ubiquinone reduction. Through Complex II,
    SDHD participates in mitochondrial electron transport from succinate to ubiquinone
    (GO:0006121) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (GO:0006099). Complex II is unique among
    OXPHOS complexes in that it does NOT pump protons across the inner membrane.
