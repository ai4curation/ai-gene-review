description: >-
  Wolframin (WFS1) is a multi-pass transmembrane glycoprotein primarily localized to the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs).
  The protein plays essential roles in ER calcium homeostasis by positively modulating
  ER Ca2+ levels through increasing the rate of Ca2+ uptake [PMID:16989814]. WFS1 also
  functions as a negative regulator of ER stress signaling, particularly by suppressing
  ATF6alpha-mediated unfolded protein response through stabilization of the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase HRD1 and promotion of ATF6alpha proteasomal degradation [PMID:20160352].
  Additionally, WFS1 interacts with and stabilizes V-ATPase subunit ATP6V1A and
  Na+/K+-ATPase beta1 subunit (ATP1B1), regulating their expression and stability
  [PMID:23035048, PMID:17947299]. Mutations in WFS1 cause Wolfram syndrome (DIDMOAD -
  diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness), characterized by
  progressive beta-cell loss and neurodegeneration due to dysregulated ER stress and
  calcium homeostasis.

      WFS1 is directly involved in the UPR, functioning as a negative regulator of
      ER stress signaling. WFS1 suppresses expression of ATF6alpha target genes and
      represses ATF6alpha-mediated activation of the ER stress response element promoter
      [PMID:20160352]. WFS1 expression is transcriptionally upregulated by ER stress,
      indicating it is part of the ER stress response machinery [PMID:15994758].

      ISS suggesting dendritic localization based on neuronal expression.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      WFS1 is expressed in neurons and may localize to dendrites, but primary
      localization is ER membrane. Neuronal expression is important for
      understanding the neurodegeneration phenotype.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
