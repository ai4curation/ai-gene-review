description: SSR1 encodes Translocon-associated protein subunit alpha (TRAP-alpha), a single-pass type I ER membrane glycoprotein that is a core component of the heterotetrameric TRAP complex (TRAP-alpha/beta/gamma/delta, encoded by SSR1-4). The TRAP complex stably associates with the Sec61 protein-conducting channel and ribosomes at the ER membrane, facilitating co-translational translocation of secretory and membrane proteins, particularly those with weak or atypical signal peptides. TRAP-alpha features a large N-terminal luminal domain positioned beneath the Sec61 channel exit site and a single long transmembrane helix that contacts Sec61. The complex coordinates with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) to couple translocation with N-glycosylation. TRAP-alpha also participates in ER quality control and ERAD pathways.

- term:

    label: endoplasmic reticulum
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for ER localization based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER. TRAP-alpha is well-established as an ER-resident protein across eukaryotes. Recent cryo-EM structures confirm TRAP as a core ER translocon component [SSR1-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core localization annotation. TRAP-alpha is definitively an ER membrane protein. The IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive structural and biochemical evidence showing TRAP-alpha as a core component of the ER translocon complex [Pauwels et al. 2023; Karki et al. 2023; PMID:36697828].

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core localization annotation. TRAP-alpha is a single-pass type I membrane protein anchored in the ER membrane. UniProt confirms this topology with a luminal N-terminal domain and cytoplasmic C-terminus. Structural studies confirm ER membrane integration [PMID:36697828].

    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the protein binding annotation reflects genuine interactions, it is uninformative. The study shows TRAP complex involvement in ERAD and interaction with misfolded substrates like alpha1-antitrypsin NHK variant. A more specific term capturing the functional interaction would be appropriate.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: The protein binding term is too generic. The interaction with calnexin is functionally significant - palmitoylated calnexin associates with the ribosome-translocon complex to facilitate glycoprotein folding. A more specific MF term should be used.

  review:
    summary: NAS annotation from ComplexPortal. However, this term refers to post-translational translocation, whereas TRAP is primarily involved in co-translational translocation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term is inaccurate. TRAP/SSR1 is primarily involved in co-translational protein targeting, not post-translational. The structural study and all functional evidence show TRAP associating with translating ribosomes at the ER. Should be replaced with co-translational targeting term.

  evidence_type: TAS

  review:
    summary: TAS annotation based on observation that TRAP-alpha transcripts are induced by GM-CSF and more abundant in growing vs quiescent cells.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This is a pleiotropic effect rather than a core function. The study shows TRAP-alpha mRNA is upregulated in proliferating cells stimulated by GM-CSF, but this reflects increased demand for protein secretion capacity rather than direct regulation of proliferation. TRAP-alpha's primary function is in protein translocation, not proliferation control.
