## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O60925
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Prefoldin subunit 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PFDN1; Synonyms=PFD1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the prefoldin subunit beta family.
- **Key Domains:** PFD_beta-like. (IPR002777); Prefoldin. (IPR009053); Prefoldin_2 (PF01920)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PFDN1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PFDN1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PFDN1** (gene ID: PFDN1, UniProt: O60925) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human PFDN1 (UniProt O60925; Prefoldin subunit 1)

Publication-date note: This report prioritizes 2023–2024 sources when available, but key mechanistic evidence for PFDN1 derives from earlier primary studies (2015–2021) that remain foundational. All major claims are supported by citations to retrieved full text.

1. Target verification (gene/protein identity)

The target is human PFDN1 (UniProt O60925), whose protein product is “Prefoldin subunit 1,” a β-type subunit of the canonical hetero-hexameric prefoldin (PFD) complex in eukaryotes (PFDN1–PFDN6). This is supported by human-cell experimental papers and systems-level proteomics mapping that explicitly list PFDN1 within canonical prefoldin assemblies and describe its cochaperone role with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT/TRiC. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 18-19, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

2.1 Canonical prefoldin and PFDN1’s molecular role

Prefoldin is a conserved hetero-hexameric cochaperone complex that binds non-native polypeptides, protects exposed hydrophobic regions to prevent aggregation, and transfers/shuttles folding clients to the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT for productive folding. PFDN1 is one of the canonical subunits of this complex and is repeatedly listed among prefoldin components in human-cell studies. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 18-19, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

A core, experimentally supported client class is cytoskeletal proteins: actin and tubulin monomers. In colorectal cancer cells, PFDN1 is described as enhancing the efficiency of actin and tubulin folding by returning partially folded substrates to CCT for additional folding cycles, consistent with a prefoldin–CCT functional relay. (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

2.2 Prefoldin–CCT/TRiC coupling and complex membership evidence

Human-cell experiments link prefoldin to CCT/TRiC not just conceptually but via co-recovery/co-association in proteomic and interaction studies: in a pVHL folding/stability study, mass spectrometry from VHL pulldowns recovered multiple prefoldin subunits (including PFDN1) and CCT/TRiC subunits, consistent with a shared folding network around client proteins. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 5-6, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 18-19)

A 2024 Nature Methods study that maps “prefoldin family complexes” provides systems-level evidence that canonical prefoldin subunits, including PFDN1, form a defined assembly and show association/coelution patterns linked to CCT/TRiC. (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 8-8, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

2.3 Cellular localization: cytosol and non-canonical nuclear roles

Canonical prefoldin function is cytosolic in protein quality control and cytoskeletal biogenesis, but PFDN1 has also been reported to localize to the nucleus in cancer contexts and to exert transcriptional regulatory activity, indicating non-canonical nuclear functions beyond cytoskeletal folding. (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2)

3. Functional biology of PFDN1 (processes, pathways, and mechanistic models)

3.1 Protein homeostasis and client stabilization: pVHL as an example client

Prefoldin can stabilize specific client proteins by preventing aggregation and assisting folding via CCT/TRiC. In the context of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), the prefoldin complex physically associates with pVHL in human cells, and prefoldin knockdown reduces pVHL expression; in yeast, prefoldin mutants promote pVHL aggregation. These findings support a role for prefoldin (and by implication PFDN1 as a subunit) in client stabilization and folding/quality control. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 18-19, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 5-6)

3.2 Cytoskeletal reorganization and tumor cell phenotypes (CRC example)

In colorectal cancer models (SW480, RKO), PFDN1 knockdown produces less spread/aggressive morphology, reduces cytoskeletal structures (stress fibers), decreases F-actin levels, and weakens α-tubulin staining, consistent with impaired cytoskeletal homeostasis. (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

Quantitatively, in nude-mouse xenografts derived from SW480 cells, stable PFDN1 knockdown markedly reduced tumor burden and proliferation: tumor weights were 346.8 ± 118.1 mg in shPFDN1 tumors versus 783.4 ± 163.8 mg (mock) and 737.2 ± 203.2 mg (NC), with reported P < 0.01; Ki-67 positive fraction was 38 ± 10% in shPFDN1 versus 65 ± 17% (mock) and 71 ± 12% (NC), with reported P < 0.05. (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

3.3 EMT/metastasis pathways and transcriptional repression (lung cancer example)

In lung cancer, PFDN1 is reported to increase during TGF-β1-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and nuclear localization of PFDN1 is detected. Mechanistically, PFDN1 can repress cyclin A expression by directly interacting with the cyclin A promoter near the transcription start site; cyclin A overexpression can abrogate PFDN1-driven EMT/invasion phenotypes, while cyclin A knockdown can phenocopy EMT-like changes. Together these data support a non-canonical nuclear transcriptional mechanism (TGF-β1/PFDN1/cyclin A axis) contributing to EMT and metastasis. (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2)

3.4 Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation (gastric cancer example)

In gastric cancer, PFDN1 is reported as upregulated and associated with metastasis and poor prognosis; mechanistically, PFDN1 is described as promoting migration/invasion/metastasis by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling with EMT marker changes. (zhou2020pfnd1predictspoor pages 1-2)

4. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)

4.1 2024 systems-level prefoldin complex mapping by DIP-MS (Nature Methods)

A major 2024 advance is the introduction/application of DIP-MS (deep interactome profiling by mass spectrometry) to resolve organization of the “human prefoldin family of complexes.” This work reports that prefoldin assemblies include canonical subunits (including PFDN1) and reveals alternative assemblies/complex isoforms, supported by both DIP-MS and AP–MS strategies. Experiments are reported with n = 3 biologically independent replicates, and structural comparisons report similarity metrics (TM score > 45; TM scores reported as mean ± s.e.m.). (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

The visual evidence (cropped figure regions) from this study shows canonical prefoldin composition including PFDN1 and coelution/association patterns involving prefoldin subunits and CCT/TRiC subunits. (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction media 5b2ee584, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction media 01045fb5)

Interpretation: These 2024 findings strengthen current understanding that PFDN1’s functional context is best described at the “prefoldin family complex” level rather than as a lone factor, and that prefoldin may exist in modular/alternative assemblies that could underlie context-specific functions.

URL / publication date: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y (published March 2024). (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

4.2 2024 cancer dependency on a prefoldin-like complex (Molecular Cell)

A 2024 Molecular Cell study on medulloblastoma reports that a non-canonical ORF (ASNSD1-uORF/ASDURF) is required for cancer cell survival through engagement with a prefoldin-like chaperone complex, in which PFDN1 is shown as a member of prefoldin(-like) assemblies. The figure excerpt indicates CRISPR/sgRNA perturbation designs with n = 3 replicate annotations and multiple comparisons labeled with very strong significance (p < 0.0001) in proteomics-based analyses. (hofman2024translationofnoncanonical pages 57-57)

Interpretation: Although not a direct “PFDN1-only” mechanism, this supports a 2024 view that prefoldin(-like) assemblies (including PFDN1) can be rewired or co-opted by oncogenic programs and non-canonical translated ORFs.

URL / publication date: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.12.003 (published January 2024). (hofman2024translationofnoncanonical pages 57-57)

5. Current applications and real-world implementations

5.1 Biomarker/prognostic indicator concepts

PFDN1 has been positioned as a prognostic indicator/biomarker candidate in multiple cancers in translational primary studies and reviews. In colorectal cancer, mechanistic evidence links PFDN1 to increased tumor growth and cytoskeletal-driven motility, consistent with its use as a prognosis-associated marker in that context. (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

A review-level synthesis integrating TCGA and literature reports indicates PFDN1 mRNA is moderately but significantly increased in colorectal cancer (fold change 0.35; p < 5.0E-3), supporting a population-level expression shift consistent with biomarker exploration. (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 18-20)

5.2 Experimental/technical implementations used in the field

Common experimental implementations for PFDN1 functional inference include:

• Genetic perturbation (siRNA/shRNA knockdown; overexpression) followed by phenotyping of proliferation, migration/invasion, and EMT marker changes. (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2, wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

• In vivo xenografts in nude mice to quantify tumor growth/proliferation impacts of PFDN1 modulation (with Ki-67 IHC readouts). (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

• Chromatin/promoter interaction assays supporting direct transcriptional repression (cyclin A promoter interaction by PFDN1). (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2)

• Proteomics and interactome mapping (BioID/AP–MS; DIP-MS) to define complex membership and coupling to CCT/TRiC. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 5-6, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

6. Expert opinions and authoritative analysis (reviews)

A 2022 review on prefoldin in proteostasis and disease emphasizes canonical prefoldin function as transfer of cytoskeletal polypeptides to TRiC/CCT, while highlighting non-canonical functions (transcription regulation and proteasome-dependent degradation) and disease links including cancer. The review specifically cites PFDN1 contributions to cancer progression and metastasis via Wnt/β-catenin and via transcriptional suppression mechanisms (cyclin A axis). (tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 8-9)

A 2021 iScience review provides an integrative analysis of prefoldins in cancer, including TCGA-derived expression statistics and a synthesis of functional phenotypes from PFDN1 perturbation in colorectal cancer. (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 18-20)

7. Relevant statistics and data (selected, with context)

7.1 Quantitative tumor biology readouts (CRC xenograft)

PFDN1 knockdown reduced xenograft tumor weight and proliferation index as follows (SW480-derived tumors, day 25):

• Tumor weights: 346.8 ± 118.1 mg (shPFDN1) vs 783.4 ± 163.8 mg (mock) and 737.2 ± 203.2 mg (negative control), P < 0.01.

• Ki-67 index: 38 ± 10% (shPFDN1) vs 65 ± 17% and 71 ± 12%, P < 0.05.

These data link PFDN1 functionally to in vivo tumor proliferation and provide quantitative support for its role in CRC growth. (wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

7.2 Population-scale expression statistics (TCGA-derived CRC mRNA increase)

A TCGA analysis summarized in an iScience review reports PFDN1 mRNA is significantly increased in colorectal cancer compared with adjacent tissue (fold change 0.35; p < 5.0E-3). (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 18-20)

7.3 Quantitative systems biology (2024 DIP-MS)

The 2024 Nature Methods study reports prefoldin complex mapping with n = 3 biologically independent replicates and quantitative coelution and structural similarity metrics (TM score > 45; TM scores reported as mean ± s.e.m.). These results quantify the robustness of inferred assemblies and support PFDN1-containing canonical and alternative prefoldin complexes. (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8)

8. Synthesis: Primary functional annotation of human PFDN1 (O60925)

Primary molecular function: PFDN1 is a β-subunit of the canonical cytosolic prefoldin cochaperone complex that binds non-native polypeptides and facilitates their folding by transferring/shuttling them to the CCT/TRiC chaperonin system, with actin and tubulin being key client classes. (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 18-19, wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10, fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 8-8)

Cellular location of action: Predominantly cytosolic as part of prefoldin assemblies involved in proteostasis and cytoskeletal biogenesis; however, nuclear localization and direct transcriptional promoter interaction have been reported in cancer/EMT settings, supporting context-dependent nuclear roles. (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2)

Pathways and processes: PFDN1’s canonical pathway is the prefoldin→CCT/TRiC folding relay for cytoskeletal proteins. In cancer contexts, PFDN1 is implicated mechanistically in EMT/metastasis through (i) TGF-β1-associated EMT via transcriptional repression of cyclin A and (ii) Wnt/β-catenin signaling-associated EMT in gastric cancer, in addition to cytoskeletal reorganization effects that influence motility and growth. (wang2017prefoldin1promotes pages 1-2, zhou2020pfnd1predictspoor pages 1-2, wang2015pfdn1anindicator pages 9-10)

9. Limitations and evidence gaps (within retrieved corpus)

• 2023–2024 literature in the retrieved set is strongest for prefoldin complex organization (Nature Methods 2024) and prefoldin-like complex dependency in medulloblastoma (Molecular Cell 2024), but less rich for new 2023–2024 PFDN1-specific single-gene mechanistic discoveries.

• Some clinically oriented metrics (e.g., multivariable hazard ratios, AUCs for biomarker performance) are not present in the retrieved excerpts for gastric or lung cancer studies and would require additional full-text extraction beyond the subset retrieved here.
