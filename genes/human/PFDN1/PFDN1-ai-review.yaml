description: >-
  PFDN1 (Prefoldin subunit 1) encodes a beta-type subunit of the heterohexameric
  prefoldin complex (also known as GimC). The prefoldin complex is a jellyfish-shaped
  molecular chaperone composed of two alpha subunits (PFDN3, PFDN5) and four beta
  subunits (PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN4, PFDN6). Prefoldin functions as a co-chaperone/holdase
  that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides -- primarily actin and tubulin -- and
  delivers them to the group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding. The
  prefoldin-TRiC interaction is mediated through a conserved electrostatic interface,
  and PFD alternates between open and closed conformations during substrate transfer.
  Beyond cytoskeletal protein folding, prefoldin has been shown to inhibit amyloid-beta
  fibrillation and alpha-synuclein aggregation, suggesting roles in neuroprotection.
  PFDN1 is ubiquitously expressed and located on chromosome 5.

      GO:0006457 "protein folding" is a well-supported core function of PFDN1.
      This IBA annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER) with
      evidence from yeast GimC/prefoldin (SGD:S000003715), Arabidopsis, and human
      PFDN1 itself. The prefoldin complex is a bona fide co-chaperone that captures
      unfolded nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin) and delivers them
      to TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding (PMID:9630229). Gestaut et al. 2019
      (PMID:30955883) showed that PFD enhances the rate and yield of TRiC-mediated
      folding, directly demonstrating involvement in protein folding. The Reactome
      pathway R-HSA-389957 "Prefoldin mediated transfer of substrate to CCT/TriC"
      also supports this annotation. This is the central biological process for
      PFDN1.

      This IBA annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER) with
      evidence from yeast (SGD:S000003715) and human PFDN1 itself. While prefoldin
      does indeed bind unfolded proteins, the term "unfolded protein binding" is a
      pure binding term that fails to capture the functional significance of this
      interaction. Prefoldin acts as a holdase/transfer chaperone: it captures
      unfolded substrates (primarily actin and tubulin) and delivers them to the
      TRiC/CCT chaperonin for folding. As described in Vainberg et al. 1998
      (PMID:9630229), "Prefoldin binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-cpn)
      and transfers target proteins to it." The more appropriate term is GO:0044183
      "protein folding chaperone" which captures the functional chaperone activity
      rather than just substrate binding. Notably, PFDN1 already has an IBA annotation

      the GOA qualifier "is_active_in" confirms that PFDN1 is active in the
      cytoplasm. Liang et al. 2020 (PMID:32699605) describe prefoldin as "a

      This IEA annotation was inferred electronically from InterPro domain mapping

      GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" (NAS) from ComplexPortal, citing
      Herranz-Montoya et al. 2021 (PMID:34761191). The GO definition of protein
      stabilization is "Any process involved in maintaining the structure and
      integrity of a protein and preventing it from degradation or aggregation."
      Prefoldin does prevent aggregation of unfolded substrates by capturing them
      and delivering them to TRiC/CCT (PMID:9630229). However, "protein
      stabilization" typically implies maintaining a folded protein in its native
      state, whereas prefoldin acts on unfolded nascent polypeptides as a holdase
      and transfer chaperone. The term is not entirely wrong -- prefoldin does
      prevent aggregation -- but it mischaracterizes the nature of the chaperone
      activity. The more accurate process annotation is GO:0006457 "protein
      folding," which is already well-annotated.

      While prefoldin does prevent protein aggregation (which is part of the GO
      definition of protein stabilization), the primary function is not to
      stabilize already-folded proteins but rather to capture unfolded substrates
      and transfer them to TRiC/CCT for folding. The annotation is not wrong
      but represents a secondary aspect of prefoldin function rather than its
      core activity. The core process (protein folding, GO:0006457) is already
      well-annotated with IBA, IDA, and NAS evidence.

      This IDA annotation cites Gestaut et al. 2019 (PMID:30955883), which used
      cryo-EM, crosslinking mass spectrometry, and biochemical reconstitution to
      characterize the structural and functional interplay between the prefoldin
      (PFD) complex and TRiC/CCT chaperonin. The study demonstrates that prefoldin
      associates with TRiC through a conserved electrostatic interface and undergoes
      conformational cycling between "latched" (open) and "engaged" (closed) states
      during substrate transfer. Critically, the paper shows that PFD functions not
      merely as a passive binder of unfolded substrates but as an active co-chaperone
      that "can act after TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and yield of
      the folding reaction, suppressing non-productive reaction cycles." This
      demonstrates prefoldin is a bona fide protein folding chaperone. GO:0044183
