description: >-
  CAPG (macrophage-capping protein, gCap39) is a calcium-sensitive actin-binding protein
  belonging to the gelsolin/villin superfamily. It contains three gelsolin-like domains
  (C1-C3) and functions primarily as a barbed-end actin filament capping protein,
  reversibly blocking barbed ends to modulate actin filament dynamics. Critically,
  CAPG does NOT sever actin filaments, distinguishing it from gelsolin. The protein
  is regulated by calcium (activating) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2,
  antagonizes capping), enabling rapid and reversible control during cell signaling
  and membrane remodeling. CAPG also contains redox-sensitive cysteines (C282/C290)
  that affect its localization and migration function. The protein localizes to both
  cytoplasm and nucleus, with dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling via importin-beta/NTF2/Ran-dependent
  nuclear import. In macrophages, CAPG is particularly abundant and concentrated at
  ruffles and leading lamellipodia. CAPG is overexpressed in multiple cancers and
  promotes invasion and migration.

        CAPG is a member of the gelsolin/villin family that functions in actin cytoskeleton
        regulation. UniProt indicates localization at the membrane-cytoplasm interface

        organization.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is INCORRECT for CAPG. Unlike gelsolin (which has 6 domains
        and
        severs filaments), CAPG (with only 3 domains) does NOT sever actin filaments.
        This is a well-established distinction in the gelsolin family. The original
        1992 paper explicitly states CAPG does not sever preformed actin filaments.
        While engineered mutants can acquire severing activity (PMID:7814409), the
        native wild-type protein lacks this function.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        CAPG explicitly does NOT sever actin filaments. The original characterization
        (PMID:1322908) states unambiguously that CAPG "does not sever preformed actin
        filaments." This is a key functional distinction between CAPG (3 gelsolin
        domains,
        capping only) and gelsolin (6 domains, severing + capping). The IBA annotation
        appears to be an over-extension from the gelsolin family, but CAPG specifically
        lacks severing activity. Deep research confirms "native CAPG does not sever
        filaments under typical conditions."

          Macrophage capping protein (MCP) is a Ca(2+)-sensitive protein which reversibly
          blocks the barbed ends of actin filaments but does not sever preformed actin
          filaments

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the functional significance of CAPG nuclear localization?
  - question: Does CAPG have nuclear actin-related functions or transcriptional 
      roles?
  - question: What is the relationship between CAPG redox sensitivity and cancer
      progression?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Characterize the role of CAPG in nuclear actin regulation
    hypothesis: CAPG regulates nuclear actin dynamics for gene expression or 
      chromatin organization
    experiment_type: biochemical assay
  - description: Investigate CAPG's role in nucleolar function and ribosomal 
      gene transcription
    hypothesis: CAPG nucleolar localization is functionally linked to rRNA 
      transcription
    experiment_type: gene expression
  - description: Determine the functional significance of CAPG-RAVER1 
      interaction
    hypothesis: CAPG-RAVER1 interaction at adhesion complexes regulates cell 
      migration
