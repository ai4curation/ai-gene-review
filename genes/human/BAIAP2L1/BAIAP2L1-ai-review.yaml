description: >-
  BAIAP2L1 (also known as IRTKS, Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Substrate) is a
  BAR-superfamily
  scaffold protein containing an inverse-BAR (I-BAR/IMD) domain that senses and induces
  negative
  membrane curvature, an SH3 domain for protein-protein interactions with proline-rich
  motifs,
  and a C-terminal actin-binding region. The protein functions as a curvature-sensing
  adaptor
  that couples membrane topology with actin cytoskeleton dynamics, promoting filopodium
  formation
  and membrane protrusions. IRTKS plays key roles in: (1) plasma membrane shape homeostasis
  through I-BAR-mediated recognition of nanoscale membrane evaginations and recruitment
  of
  Rac1-WAVE-Arp2/3 actin machinery; (2) actin filament bundling through its C-terminal
  actin-binding region; (3) a nuclear role in heterochromatin maintenance via LLPS
  condensates
  with HP1alpha. The protein is exploited by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) through
  its
  SH3 domain binding to bacterial effector EspF(U) and its IMD domain binding to Tir,
  enabling
  pathogen-driven actin pedestal formation.

proposed_new_terms:

    proposed_definition: >-
      A membrane curvature sensing activity mediated by an I-BAR (inverse-BAR) domain
      that preferentially binds to and induces negative membrane curvature (outward
      protrusions such as filopodia), in contrast to F-BAR domains that induce positive
      curvature (invaginations).
    justification: >-
      While GO has F-BAR domain binding (GO:1990808), there is no specific term for
      I-BAR
      (inverse-BAR) domain activity. I-BAR domains induce negative membrane curvature
      (outward protrusions) in contrast to F-BAR domains that induce positive curvature
      (invaginations). This distinction is functionally significant for proteins like
      IRTKS, IRSp53, and MIM.
