## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UHR4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BAR/IMD domain-containing adapter protein 2-like 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:21649}; AltName: Full=Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2-like protein 1; Short=BAI1-associated protein 2-like protein 1; AltName: Full=Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BAIAP2L1; Synonyms=IRTKS;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AH/BAR_dom_sf. (IPR027267); Baiap2l1_I-BAR_dom. (IPR030060); I-BAR_dom. (IPR013606); IRSp53/IRTKS/Pinkbar. (IPR027681); IRTKS_SH3. (IPR035592)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BAIAP2L1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BAIAP2L1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BAIAP2L1** (gene ID: BAIAP2L1, UniProt: Q9UHR4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report: BAIAP2L1 (IRTKS) — functional annotation and recent advances

Executive verification (critical identity checks)
• Gene/protein match: BAIAP2L1 encodes insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS), also known as BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1, in Homo sapiens. Literature describes IRTKS as a BAR-superfamily scaffold with an inverse-BAR (I-BAR/IMD) domain, SH3 domain, and a PPPDY WW-binding motif, matching UniProt’s description. (Williams 2013; DOI: 10.1093/hmg/dds486; Zhang & Zhang 2025; DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2025.13437) (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2)
• Organism: All sources cited here study the human protein or human tumors/cell lines; no conflicting gene symbol usage detected. (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12, renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10, xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Domain/family alignment: IRTKS belongs to the IRSp53/MIM I-BAR family; domain composition (I-BAR/IMD, SH3) and motifs (PPPDY) are consistently reported, including their retention/utilization in oncogenic fusions. (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions
• Molecular identity and domains: IRTKS/BAIAP2L1 is a multi-domain adaptor that couples plasma-membrane curvature with the actin cytoskeleton via an I-BAR/IMD domain (negative curvature sensing/induction), an SH3 domain mediating interactions with actin regulators, and a PPPDY motif that can engage WW domains. These features underpin roles in filopodia and membrane remodeling. (Zhang & Zhang 2025, accepted 19 Dec 2024; DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2025.13437; Williams 2013, online 21 Nov 2012; DOI: 10.1093/hmg/dds486) (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2, williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2)
• Cellular localization: IRTKS localizes to plasma-membrane protrusions/filopodial structures and, unexpectedly, to nuclear puncta/condensates where it contributes to heterochromatin organization. (EMBO J 27 Aug 2024; DOI: 10.1038/s44318-024-00212-3) (xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Primary functional theme: IRTKS acts as a curvature-sensing and actin-assembling scaffold integrating signaling inputs (including insulin receptor pathways) with membrane/actin dynamics and, as newly shown, nuclear chromatin maintenance. (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2, xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
• Nanoscale mechanosensing by I-BAR proteins: Quiroga et al. (eLife, 25 Sep 2023; DOI: 10.7554/eLife.72316) demonstrated that mechanical stretch/compression generates ~100 nm plasma-membrane evaginations that are recognized by I-BAR proteins (including IRSp53 family). Recognition triggers Rac1→WAVE/Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization that re-flattens the membrane. The resorption requires Arp2/3/WRC but not formins or myosin, defining a local curvature→actin feedback circuit. This general mechanism directly supports a role for IRTKS in nanoscale membrane-shape homeostasis. (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 15-16)
• IRTKS condensates enforce heterochromatin (EMBO J 2024): Xie et al. showed IRTKS undergoes LLPS, infiltrates HP1α condensates, and recruits the E2 ligase Ubc9 to SUMOylate/stabilize HP1α. IRTKS loss leads to heterochromatin erosion, genome-wide chromatin accessibility changes, cGAS–STING activation, type I interferon signaling, and cellular senescence/SASP. This establishes IRTKS as an epigenetic mediator of chromatin integrity and inflammation restraint. (Published online 27 Aug 2024; DOI: 10.1038/s44318-024-00212-3) (xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• FMNL2 interactome (IJMS 2024): Quantitative BioID/SILAC proteomics identified BAIAP2L1 (IRTKS) as a proximal interactor of the formin FMNL2, implicating coordinated regulation of actin assembly and subcellular trafficking; the study also shows FMNL2 presence in exosomes. (Int J Mol Sci, 31 May 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms25115686) (fox2024identificationofan pages 10-11)

3) Functions, pathways, and subcellular site of action
• Membrane/actin coupling at the cortex: Through its I-BAR domain, IRTKS senses and/or generates negative curvature at the plasma membrane, recruiting actin machinery via SH3-mediated interactions. The eLife 2023 work places I-BAR proteins at the core of a mechanochemical feedback that restores local membrane flatness, mechanistically aligning with IRTKS’s established role in membrane protrusions and filopodia. (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 15-16, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2)
• Nuclear/epigenetic role: IRTKS LLPS within heterochromatin and stabilization of HP1α consolidates constitutive heterochromatin; its loss activates immune signaling and senescence, localizing a major IRTKS function to the nucleus under specific contexts. (xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Signaling crosstalk: Historically linked to insulin receptor signaling and membrane dynamics, IRTKS’s domain architecture supports scaffolding of small GTPases and actin regulators (Ena/VASP, WAVE, formins), and its SH3/WW-binding motifs enable broader signaling assemblies at membranes and, via LLPS, in the nucleus. (zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2, xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Interaction with formins: The FMNL2 proximity labeling result suggests IRTKS coordinates with formins in location-specific actin assembly, potentially bridging curvature sensing with linear actin polymerization pathways in trafficking and protrusion contexts. (fox2024identificationofan pages 10-11)

4) Disease relevance, applications, and real-world implementations
• FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 fusion oncogene (urothelial/lung):
  – Discovery and domain architecture: A t(4;7) translocation fuses FGFR3 to BAIAP2L1, retaining FGFR3 residues 1–760 and BAIAP2L1 IRSp53/IMD and SH3 domains plus PPPDY motif. Fusion proteins are constitutively active and transform NIH/3T3 cells; in immortalized urothelial cells, they activate MAPK but not PLCγ1 due to loss of the PLCγ1-binding exon in FGFR3. (Human Mol Genet, 21 Nov 2012 online; DOI: 10.1093/hmg/dds486) (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 2-3)
  – Prevalence statistics: Williams et al. detected FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 in 4/43 bladder tumor cell lines and 2/32 selected bladder tumor tissues. Nakanishi et al. reported fusion transcripts in 1/28 lung adenocarcinoma, 1/28 lung squamous carcinoma, and 2/46 bladder cancers; an additional bladder cohort showed 2/89 cases. (Mol Cancer Ther, Mar 2015; DOI: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0927-T; HMG 2013) (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12, williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2)
  – Mechanism of activation and domain requirements: The BAIAP2L1 BAR/I-BAR dimerization motif is essential for fusion-driven activation; kinase-dead mutants abrogate oncogenicity. (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12)
  – Therapeutic sensitivity: Fusion-positive lines (e.g., SW780) show marked sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors. CH5183284/Debio 1347 inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, suppressed FRS/ERK phosphorylation, and showed in vivo activity in xenografts, while sparing wild-type FGFR tumors. Other FGFR TKIs also suppressed growth. These findings support fusion-guided FGFR-targeted therapy. (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12)
• BAIAP2L1–BRAF fusion (thyroid, spitzoid melanocytic tumors):
  – Thyroid cancer (PTC): A BAIAP2L1–BRAF rearrangement (patient with thyroiditis) transformed immortalized human thyroid cells; oncogenicity requires BRAF kinase activity and the BAIAP2L1 coiled-coil domain. MAPK pathway activation was robust; pharmacologic testing indicated paradoxical MAPK activation by low-dose vemurafenib, with additional testing of trametinib and PLX-8394. (Molecular Cancer, 13 Oct 2022; DOI: 10.1186/s12943-022-01665-y) (renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10)
  – Spitzoid tumors: RNA-seq identified BAIAP2L1–BRAF among kinase fusions with intact kinase domains; FISH confirmed rearrangement in ≥30% of cells in the BAIAP2L1 case. (Modern Pathology, Apr 2016; DOI: 10.1038/modpathol.2016.37) (wu2016thelandscapeof pages 5-9)
• Biomarker evidence in ovarian cancer: BAIAP2L1 is upregulated by IHC in 193 ovarian cancers vs 20 normals, with higher expression in 12/14 metastatic lesions compared to matched primaries; public datasets corroborate upregulation (e.g., GSE14407 p=0.004). Knockdown reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting oncogenic support functions. (PLoS ONE, 15 Jul 2015; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0133081) (chao2015bai1associatedprotein2like pages 6-9)

5) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
• Authoritative mechanistic frameworks: The eLife 2023 study provides an experimentally supported model in which I-BAR proteins decode nanoscale curvature into localized Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization to restore membrane topology; this places IRTKS/BAIAP2L1 within a generalizable curvature→actin homeostasis circuit at the cortex. (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 15-16)
• Epigenetic paradigm shift: EMBO J 2024 establishes IRTKS as a heterochromatin organizer via LLPS and HP1α SUMOylation, expanding its functional repertoire beyond the cortex to nuclear chromatin integrity and inflammation control. This suggests disease links not only through membrane signaling but also chromatin-state maintenance and senescence. (xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Fusion oncogene logic: Mechanistic analyses underscore that scaffold domains contributed by BAIAP2L1 (I-BAR dimerization, CC) can drive receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR3) or RAF kinase oligomerization/activation, rationalizing sensitivity to pathway-targeted inhibitors (FGFR TKIs; RAF/MEK modulators) with attention to paradoxical activation phenomena. (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12, renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10)

6) Quantitative statistics and key data points
• FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 prevalence:
  – Bladder cell lines: 4/43; bladder tissues: 2/32 selected. (HMG 2013; DOI: 10.1093/hmg/dds486) (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2)
  – Additional screening: 2/46 bladder; 2/89 bladder in broader cohort; 1/28 lung adenocarcinoma; 1/28 lung squamous carcinoma. (MCT 2015; DOI: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0927-T) (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12)
• Therapeutic experiments: Debio 1347 (CH5183284) suppressed growth and ERK signaling and induced apoptosis in FGFR3–BAIAP2L1-positive models; in vivo anti-tumor activity was demonstrated in SW780 and Rat-2_F3-B xenografts. (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12)
• BAIAP2L1–BRAF: Oncogenic transformation depends on kinase activity and BAIAP2L1 CC domain; MEK/ERK activation is robust; responses to RAF/MEK agents require careful dosing to avoid paradoxical activation. (renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10)
• Ovarian cancer cohorts: IHC n=193 tumors vs 20 normals; 12/14 metastasis pairs with higher BAIAP2L1; multiple external datasets show significant overexpression (e.g., GSE14407 p=0.004). (chao2015bai1associatedprotein2like pages 6-9)

Mechanistic synthesis: primary function and site of action
• Primary function: IRTKS is a curvature-sensing adaptor that coordinates membrane topology with actin assembly to shape protrusions and restore membrane homeostasis; it also forms nuclear condensates essential for heterochromatin stability. (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 15-16, xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Site(s) of action: Plasma membrane/cortex (I-BAR-mediated curvature recognition and actin recruitment) and nucleus (LLPS with HP1α to maintain heterochromatin and restrain innate immune activation). (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, xie2024heterochromatinformationand pages 1-2)
• Pathways: Cortical actin via Rac1-WAVE-Arp2/3; MAPK activation via oncogenic fusions (FGFR3–BAIAP2L1, BAIAP2L1–BRAF); historical insulin receptor signaling scaffolding consistent with its “substrate” nomenclature. (quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 1-2, quiroga2023amechanosensingmechanism pages 15-16, williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10, zhang2025insulinreceptortyrosine pages 1-2)

Therapeutic and implementation implications
• Diagnostics: Detect FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 by RNA-based fusion panels/FISH in bladder and lung tumors; consider BAIAP2L1–BRAF in thyroid or spitzoid melanocytic lesions. (williams2013oncogenicfgfr3gene pages 1-2, nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12, wu2016thelandscapeof pages 5-9, renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10)
• Targeted therapy: FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 predicts sensitivity to selective FGFR inhibitors (e.g., Debio 1347) in preclinical models; MAPK-pathway inhibitors may be applicable to BAIAP2L1–BRAF with attention to paradoxical RAF inhibitor effects and MEK/ERK blockade strategies. (nakanishi2015mechanismofoncogenic pages 9-12, renaud2022multiomicanalysisof pages 7-10)
• Prognostic/biomarker roles: Elevated BAIAP2L1 associates with proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotypes in ovarian cancer and is higher in metastases, supporting its consideration as a biomarker and potential target in select contexts. (chao2015bai1associatedprotein2like pages 6-9)

| BAIAP2L1–BRAF fusions (thyroid, spitzoid) | BAIAP2L1–BRAF fusion identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma (oncogenic, kinase‑ and CC‑domain dependent) and reported as a BRAF partner in spitzoid melanocytic tumors; fusion drives MAPK activation and transformation.

| Ovarian cancer biomarker data | BAIAP2L1 upregulated in ovarian tumors vs normals (IHC cohort: 193 tumors vs 20 normals); in 14 matched primary/metastatic pairs 12 showed higher expression in metastases; public datasets (GSE14407 p=0.004 etc.) support upregulation and functional assays show decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis after knockdown.

| Domain requirements for fusion oncogenicity | For FGFR3–BAIAP2L1 the BAIAP2L1 BAR/I‑BAR dimerization motif is essential for activation; for BAIAP2L1–BRAF kinase activity and the BAIAP2L1 coiled‑coil (CC) are required for transformation, indicating fusion partner domains (BAR/CC) enable constitutive activation.
