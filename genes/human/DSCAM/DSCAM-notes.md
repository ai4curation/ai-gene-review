# DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) Notes - ISOFORMS Project

## CRITICAL CAVEAT: Human vs Drosophila

**Human DSCAM has ONLY 2 isoforms** - NOT the extreme diversity of Drosophila Dscam1!

### Drosophila Dscam1 (for context)
- 38,016 potential isoforms through mutually exclusive splicing
- 4 variable exon clusters with combinatorial diversity
- Each neuron expresses unique isoform repertoire
- Enables neuronal self-avoidance and dendritic patterning

### Human DSCAM Reality
UniProt lists only **2 isoforms**:

| Isoform | UniProt ID | Synonym | Feature |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Long** | O60469-1 | CHD2-42 | Displayed/canonical |
| **Short** | O60469-2 | CHD2-52 | Alternative splicing |

### How Vertebrates Achieve Neuronal Diversity

Vertebrates use **clustered protocadherins** (PCDH) instead:
- 50+ protocadherin genes
- Stochastic expression creates unique cell identity
- Provides self-avoidance mechanism analogous to Dscam1

### Human DSCAM Function

Per UniProt:
- "Primarily expressed in brain"
- "Ig-like C2-type domains 7 to 9 are sufficient for interaction with NTN1"
- Functions as netrin receptor
- Involved in commissural axon guidance

**Important caveat in UniProt:**
> "Has been reported to enhance netrin-induced phosphorylation of PAK1 and FYN; and the interaction between DSCAM, PAK1 and RAC1 has been described. This article has been withdrawn by the authors."

## Why DSCAM is Still Relevant to ISOFORMS Project

1. **Educational contrast** with Drosophila
2. **Limited isoform biology** is itself notable
3. The two isoforms may still have distinct functions (Long vs Short)

## Expected Annotation Issues

1. Most annotations should apply to both isoforms (only 2)
2. Check for inappropriate extrapolation from Drosophila literature
3. Netrin receptor function is primary documented role

## GOA Annotation Count: 50
