description: 'DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) is a transmembrane immunoglobulin
  superfamily member involved in neural development. CRITICAL CAVEAT: Human DSCAM
  has ONLY 2 isoforms (Long/Short), NOT the 38,016 isoform diversity of Drosophila
  Dscam1. Vertebrates achieve neuronal self-avoidance through clustered protocadherins
  instead. The two human isoforms are: (1) Long/CHD2-42 (O60469-1, canonical) and
  (2) Short/CHD2-52 (O60469-2). UniProt states it is "primarily expressed in brain"
  and functions as a netrin (NTN1) receptor via Ig-like domains 7-9. Functions in
  commissural axon guidance. CAUTION: UniProt notes a withdrawn publication about
  PAK1/FYN/RAC1 interactions. Most annotations should apply to both isoforms given
  the limited isoform diversity in humans.'

    review:
      summary: DSCAM is a type I transmembrane protein that localizes to the 
        plasma membrane. UniProt confirms that the Long isoform (O60469-1) is a 
        single-pass type I membrane protein localized to the cell membrane 
        [PMID:9426258]. The Short isoform lacks the transmembrane domain and is 
        secreted. This annotation is well-supported by the protein's domain 
        architecture and multiple lines of evidence.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Plasma membrane localization is a core feature of the canonical 
        Long isoform of DSCAM, which contains a transmembrane domain. This is 
        supported by the original cloning paper [PMID:9426258] and UniProt

        with the conserved transmembrane topology of DSCAM family members across

    review:
      summary: DSCAM mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion through its 
        extracellular Ig domains. UniProt describes DSCAM as a homodimer that 
        mediates homophilic interactions to promote cell adhesion. This function
        is documented in experimental studies showing that DSCAM promotes 
        lamina-specific synaptic connections via homophilic interactions 
        [PMID:10925149 per UniProt].
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Homophilic cell adhesion is a core function of DSCAM, 
        well-documented in both human and model organism studies. This is a 
        primary molecular mechanism underlying DSCAM's role in neuronal 
        patterning and self-avoidance. The IBA annotation is consistent with

    review:
      summary: DSCAM plays a role in neuronal self-avoidance including dendrite 
        self-avoidance. UniProt states DSCAM "Promotes repulsion between 
        specific neuronal processes of either the same cell or the same subtype 
        of cells" and mediates "isoneuronal self-avoidance for creating an 
        orderly dendritic arborization." However, vertebrate DSCAM with only 2 
        isoforms may have reduced capacity for this function compared to 
        Drosophila Dscam1 which achieves self-avoidance through 38,016 isoforms.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While vertebrates use clustered protocadherins as the primary 
        self-avoidance mechanism, mammalian DSCAM still contributes to dendrite 
        self-avoidance particularly in retinal neurons. The IBA annotation is 
        consistent with mouse studies showing DSCAM function in dendritic

        UniProt states DSCAM "Interacts with PTK2" (FAK) and "Interacts with

        by netrin-1.

      action: MODIFY
      reason: The term "netrin receptor binding" implies binding to a netrin 
        receptor, but DSCAM IS a netrin receptor that binds netrin-1. The 
        appropriate term would be "netrin binding" (GO:0005114) or the
