description: >-
  RGS20 (Regulator of G-protein signaling 20, also known as RGSZ1 or Gz-GAP) is a member
  of the RZ subfamily of RGS proteins. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
  that accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits,
  thereby terminating GPCR signaling. RGS20 exhibits strong selectivity for Galpha-z and
  can also act on Galpha-i1/i3 subunits but not Galpha-i2 or Galpha-s. The protein is
  brain-enriched with high expression in the caudate nucleus and temporal lobe. It modulates
  mu-opioid receptor and melatonin MT1 receptor signaling. RGS20 contains a C-terminal RGS
  domain for GAP activity and an N-terminal cysteine-rich region for membrane association
  via palmitoylation. The protein shuttles between cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus and shows
  stimulus-dependent relocalization to the Golgi complex.

    summary: >-
      RGS20 is a well-characterized GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that accelerates
      GTP hydrolysis on heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits. This is the core
      biochemical function of RGS proteins, supported by direct biochemical assays

      family members [PMID:9748279].

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is technically incorrect for RGS20. RGS proteins do not possess
      intrinsic GTPase activity; rather, they act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)
      that enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha subunits. RGS20 stimulates
      hydrolysis of GTP bound to Galpha-z/i but does not hydrolyze GTP itself.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      RGS20 does not have GTPase activity. It has GTPase activator activity (GAP activity),
      meaning it accelerates the GTPase activity of its substrates (Galpha-z, Galpha-i).
      This is a common over-annotation error where GAP function is confused with GTPase
      activity. The correct term is GO:0005096 (GTPase activator activity).

    description: >-
      RGS20 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that accelerates the
      intrinsic GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, particularly
      Galpha-z and Galpha-i1/i3. This is the core biochemical function of RGS20.
