description: >-
  PTPN22 encodes a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP/PEP) that is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. It catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues on protein substrates (EC 3.1.3.48). The protein contains an N-terminal classical PTP catalytic domain (residues 24-289) and a C-terminal regulatory region with four proline-rich motifs (P1-P4). The P1 motif mediates binding to the SH3 domain of CSK (C-terminal Src kinase), forming an inhibitory complex at the plasma membrane. PTPN22 is a key negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, directly dephosphorylating activating tyrosines on LCK (Tyr-394), ZAP-70 (Tyr-493), TCR-zeta, Vav, and other signaling molecules. Beyond TCR signaling, PTPN22 modulates innate immune receptor pathways including TLR-driven type I interferon production (via TRAF3 interaction) and NOD2-induced cytokine release and autophagy. It also dephosphorylates NLRP3 at Tyr-861 to regulate inflammasome assembly. The common R620W variant (rs2476601) disrupts CSK binding and is one of the strongest non-HLA autoimmune risk alleles, associated with type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune diseases.

    summary: >-
      PTPN22 regulates innate immune responses through multiple mechanisms.
      Wang et al. (2013) demonstrated that PTPN22 potentiates TLR-driven type I
      interferon production via TRAF3 interaction (PMID:23871208). Spalinger et al.
      (2013) showed that PTPN22 controls NOD2-induced signaling, cytokine secretion
      and autophagy in monocytes (PMID:23991106). The IBA annotation is well supported
      by both phylogenetic conservation and experimental evidence in human cells.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      PTPN22 has established roles in regulating innate immunity through both TLR
      and NOD2 signaling pathways. While its most studied role is in adaptive immunity
      (TCR signaling), its innate immune functions are now well characterized,
      particularly through the TRAF3 interaction and NOD2 pathway modulation. IBA
      is appropriate as the term captures a core function.

      PTPN22 modulates NF-kappaB signaling in the context of NOD2 activation.
      Spalinger et al. (2013) demonstrated that PTPN22 knockdown affects both
      canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB subunits in MDP-stimulated cells.
      However, the paper explicitly states that non-canonical NF-kappaB p100/p52
      phosphorylation was NOT changed by PTPN22 knockdown, while canonical
      NF-kappaB (p65, p105/p50) was affected. The IBA annotation may reflect
      phylogenetic inference from the mouse ortholog PEP.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the evidence in PMID:23991106 is more nuanced (canonical NF-kappaB
      was more clearly affected than non-canonical), the IBA annotation based on

      ISS from mouse PEP (P29352). PTPN22's P1 proline-rich motif binds the SH3

  description: >-
    PTPN22 is a classical non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48)
    that catalyzes removal of phosphate from phosphotyrosine residues. Its primary
    substrates include Lck (Tyr-394), ZAP-70 (Tyr-493), TCR-zeta, Vav, SKAP2,
    and NLRP3 (Tyr-861). The catalytic domain (residues 24-289) contains the
    active site Cys-227 that forms a phosphocysteine intermediate.
