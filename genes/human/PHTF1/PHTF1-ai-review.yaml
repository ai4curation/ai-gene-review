  PHTF1 (Protein PHTF1) is a conserved multi-pass transmembrane protein localized to the
  endoplasmic reticulum membrane and cis-Golgi network membrane. Despite its historical
  name ("Putative Homeodomain Transcription Factor"), experimental and structural evidence
  demonstrates it is NOT a transcription factor but rather an integral membrane protein.
  Recent structural analysis using AlphaFold2 has identified PHTF1 as a candidate member
  of the 7TMIC (seven-transmembrane insect chemoreceptor-like) superfamily, though direct
  functional activity (e.g., ion channel function) has not been experimentally demonstrated
  in mammals. PHTF1 interacts with FEM1B via its N-terminal region (validated by Y2H and
  co-IP), and this interaction enhances FEM1B association with membranes. Expression is
  enriched in testis and cerebellum. The protein contains 8 predicted transmembrane helices
  and a PHTF domain at its N-terminus (aa 6-150). Its molecular function remains to be
  fully elucidated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on InterPro domain mapping (IPR039775 - PHTF1/2 family).
      The annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence showing PHTF1 localizes to
      the ER in rodent germ cells via biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence
      colocalization with ER markers [Oyhenart et al., Biol Reprod 2005]. UniProt also
      explicitly annotates subcellular location as "Endoplasmic reticulum membrane" based
      on similarity evidence. However, the more specific term GO:0005789 (endoplasmic
      reticulum membrane) is more appropriate for this multi-pass transmembrane protein
      since it resides in the ER membrane rather than the ER lumen.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While PHTF1 is indeed associated with the ER, as an integral multi-pass membrane
      protein with 8 transmembrane helices, it specifically resides in the ER membrane
      rather than the ER lumen or general ER. The more specific term GO:0005789
      (endoplasmic reticulum membrane) is already annotated and is more accurate for this
      protein. Experimental evidence from Oyhenart et al. (2005) demonstrated ER
      localization using carbonate extraction (confirming integral membrane protein status)
      and immunofluorescence colocalization with ER markers in rodent germ cells.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation from UniProt subcellular location vocabulary mapping is accurate
      and well-supported by experimental evidence. PHTF1 is a multi-pass transmembrane
      protein with 8 predicted transmembrane helices that localizes to the ER membrane.
      Experimental validation comes from rodent studies showing resistance to carbonate
      extraction (confirming integral membrane status) and immunofluorescence colocalization
      with ER markers [Oyhenart et al., Biol Reprod 2005]. The 2023 eLife study by
      Benton and Himmel using AlphaFold2 structural analysis further supports the multi-pass
      membrane topology with a 7TM-like fold.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the most appropriate cellular component annotation for PHTF1. The protein
      has 8 predicted transmembrane helices (UniProt feature annotations) and experimental
      evidence demonstrates it is an integral ER membrane protein resistant to carbonate
      extraction. This annotation accurately captures the protein's subcellular localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation from UniProt subcellular location vocabulary mapping is supported
      by similarity evidence. UniProt annotates PHTF1 localization to "Golgi apparatus,
      cis-Golgi network membrane" based on similarity to UniProtKB:F1M8G0 (bovine PHTF1).
      Experimental evidence from rodent studies shows PHTF1 localizes to the ER domain
      adjacent to the Golgi ("Golgi pole") during spermatogenesis [Oyhenart et al., 2005].
      However, the more specific term GO:0033106 (cis-Golgi network membrane) would be
      more accurate based on UniProt annotation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The general term "Golgi apparatus" is too broad. UniProt specifically annotates
      PHTF1 to the "cis-Golgi network membrane" based on similarity evidence. As an
      integral multi-pass membrane protein, the membrane-specific term is more appropriate.
      The localization to the ER-Golgi interface region is consistent with the experimental
      observation that PHTF1 is found at the "Golgi pole" of the ER in germ cells.
