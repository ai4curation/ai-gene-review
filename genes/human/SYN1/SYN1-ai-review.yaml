description: >-
  Synapsin-1 is a neuron-specific presynaptic phosphoprotein that coats synaptic vesicles
  and serves as a multivalent scaffold to organize synaptic vesicle (SV) clusters within
  presynaptic boutons. Through its interactions with both SV membranes (via domain A
  phospholipid binding) and the actin cytoskeleton (via domain C), SYN1 maintains the
  reserve pool of synaptic vesicles and regulates their mobilization to the readily
  releasable pool. The central domain C contains an ATP-binding site. SYN1 undergoes
  liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form dynamic presynaptic condensates that
  compartmentalize SVs. Multiple phosphorylation sites (by PKA, CaMK2, MAPK) and
  SUMOylation regulate its membrane and actin binding properties, thereby controlling
  SV clustering and neurotransmitter release dynamics. Loss-of-function mutations cause
  X-linked epilepsy and intellectual disability due to disrupted excitatory/inhibitory
  balance at synapses.

    summary: >-
      Synapsin-1 is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with synaptic vesicle membranes
      through its N-terminal domain A, which binds phospholipids with preference for negatively
      charged species [PMID:2110562, UniProt]. The protein coats synaptic vesicles and is
      concentrated at presynaptic terminals associated with SV clusters [Sansevrino 2023,
      Longfield 2024].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core annotation for SYN1. The protein is well-established as a synaptic vesicle-associated
      protein that binds SV membranes extrinsically through its domain A. Deep research confirms
      SYN1 is concentrated at presynaptic terminals and enriched on SV clusters. IBA annotation
      is phylogenetically sound for this conserved function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Synaptic vesicle clustering is the primary function of synapsin-1. The protein maintains
      SV clusters within presynaptic boutons through multivalent interactions with vesicle
      membranes and actin, and through self-oligomerization. Recent studies show SYN1 drives
      vesicle condensation via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) [Alfken 2024, Sansevrino 2023].
      Loss of synapsin family members increases reserve SV mobility [Longfield 2024].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core biological process function of SYN1. Deep research extensively documents
      that synapsin maintains SV clustering and the reserve pool; loss or knockout increases SV
      mobility and reduces vesicle packing. The IBA annotation correctly captures this conserved,
      central function across the synapsin family.

    Cryo-EM structural analysis of SYN1 condensates with synaptic vesicles to determine

    its intrinsically disordered domains.
