description: >-
  RAB7A is a small GTPase (EC 3.6.5.2) of the Rab family that serves as a master
  regulator of late endocytic trafficking, autophagy, and lysosomal biogenesis.
  It functions as a molecular switch cycling between inactive GDP-bound (cytosolic)
  and active GTP-bound (membrane-associated) states. When active, RAB7A localizes
  to late endosomes, lysosomes, autophagosomes, and phagosomes where it recruits
  effector proteins (RILP, FYCO1, HOPS, retromer) to control vesicle maturation,
  transport, tethering, and fusion. RAB7A is activated by the Mon1-Ccz1 guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and inactivated by TBC-domain GTPase-activating
  proteins (GAPs) including TBC1D5 and TBC1D15. The protein governs the critical
  Rab5-to-Rab7 endosomal maturation transition, late endosome-lysosome fusion,
  autophagosome-lysosome fusion, phagosome maturation, and retrograde transport.
  Mutations in RAB7A cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B (CMT2B) neuropathy through
  dysregulated nucleotide exchange and inappropriate activation.

      RAB7A functions as a small GTPase molecular switch (EC 3.6.5.2), cycling between
      inactive GDP-bound (cytosolic) and active GTP-bound (membrane-associated) states.
      This GTPase activity is essential for regulating late endocytic trafficking,
      autophagy, and lysosomal biogenesis. Activation requires Mon1-Ccz1 GEF, and
      inactivation is accelerated by TBC-domain GAPs (TBC1D5, TBC1D15).

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      How do CMT2B mutations in RAB7A lead specifically to sensory neuron
      degeneration despite ubiquitous expression? CMT2B mutations cause increased
      nucleotide exchange and inappropriate activation rather than loss of function.
      Understanding the neuronal vulnerability could inform therapeutic strategies.

  - question: >-
      What is the relative contribution of RAB7A to different autophagy pathways
      (macroautophagy, lipophagy, mitophagy)? RAB7A participates in multiple selective
      autophagy pathways but the specific mechanisms and relative importance may differ.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Systematic comparison of RAB7A effector binding profiles in neurons vs.
      non-neuronal cells to understand CMT2B tissue specificity. This could reveal
      neuron-specific RAB7A functions that explain why CMT2B mutations cause
      peripheral neuropathy.

  - description: >-
      Live imaging of RAB7A membrane cycling dynamics in patient-derived neurons
      carrying CMT2B mutations. Would directly test the hypothesis that dysregulated
      membrane cycling underlies neurodegeneration.
