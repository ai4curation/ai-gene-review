description: >-
  CREB1 (Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1) is a nuclear bZIP transcription
  factor that binds as homo- or heterodimers to cAMP response elements (CRE; palindromic
  sequence TGACGTCA) in target gene promoters. The protein contains an N-terminal
  transactivation domain (with Q1-KID-Q2 regions) and a C-terminal basic leucine zipper
  (bZIP) domain for DNA binding and dimerization. Phosphorylation of Ser-119 (Ser-133 in
  some numbering) by upstream kinases (PKA, CaMKs, AKT, RSKs, MSKs) promotes recruitment
  of coactivators CBP/p300 via the KID-KIX interaction, activating transcription. CRTC
  coactivators can also enhance CREB-dependent transcription independently of Ser-119
  phosphorylation. CREB1 mediates cAMP-responsive gene expression in response to diverse
  stimuli including hormones, growth factors, and neuronal activity.

      This IEA annotation is based on the UniProt keyword "Biological rhythms". While
      CREB1 can regulate some clock gene expression and phosphorylation of Ser-119 and
      Ser-128 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) participates in circadian rhythm
      generation, rhythmic process is NOT a core function of CREB1. The deep research

      cancer, and immune function without emphasis on circadian rhythms.

      CREB1's core function is cAMP-responsive transcription. While it may regulate
      some clock genes, this is context-dependent and not a defining function. The
      annotation appears to derive from studies showing CREB involvement in SCN
      signaling, but rhythm regulation is downstream of its core transcription factor

      While CREB1 may regulate clock genes in the SCN, circadian rhythm is not a
      core function. The deep research review focuses on cAMP-responsive transcription,
      neuronal plasticity, metabolism, cancer, and immune function without emphasis
      on circadian rhythms. This appears to be over-annotation based on tissue-specific
      phenotypic effects.

      MISANNOTATION: CREB1 is a bZIP transcription factor that is extensively
      PHOSPHORYLATED by kinases (CaMK1/2/4, AKT, RPS6KA3/4/5, SGK1, TSSK4, HIPK2)
      at Ser-119, Ser-128, and Ser-257. PMID:8798441 describes "phosphorylated CREB
      was present in DHL-4 cells" - CREB1 is the SUBSTRATE of phosphorylation, not
      the enzyme. CREB1 has no kinase activity (EC number). This is a transcription
      factor that regulates bcl-2 expression when phosphorylated. The paper shows
      CREB1 being phosphorylated by upstream kinases like PKA and PKC, not CREB1
      catalyzing phosphorylation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Incorrect annotation. CREB1 is phosphorylated by upstream kinases - it is a
      substrate, not an enzyme. CREB1 has no kinase domain or kinase activity.
