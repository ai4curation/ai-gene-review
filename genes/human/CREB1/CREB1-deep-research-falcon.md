## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P16220
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1; Short=CREB-1; Short=cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CREB1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bZIP family. .
- **Key Domains:** bZIP. (IPR004827); bZIP_sf. (IPR046347); CREB1-like_pKID. (IPR003102); Leuzip_CREB. (IPR001630); bZIP_1 (PF00170)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CREB1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CREB1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CREB1** (gene ID: CREB1, UniProt: P16220) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: CREB1 (P16220) functional annotation and recent advances

Executive summary
CREB1 encodes the human cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1, a nuclear bZIP transcription factor that binds palindromic cAMP response elements (CRE; TGACGTCA) as dimers through a C‑terminal basic leucine zipper. Its N‑terminal transactivation region is intrinsically disordered and comprises Q1–KID–Q2. Phosphorylation of Ser133 within the kinase‑inducible domain (KID) promotes binding to the KIX domain of the coactivators CBP/p300, while dephosphorylated/activated CRTC coactivators can drive CREB-dependent transcription independently or cooperatively with Ser133 phosphorylation. Recent work (2023–2024) refined the structural biophysics of the disordered transactivation domain, and translational studies connected CREB1 signaling to cancer progression, neuropsychiatric disease, and immune regulation, with emerging pharmacologic strategies (e.g., KID–KIX disruptors, selective GR modulators in CRPC) (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 10-11, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2, bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 7-9, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 13-14, jin2024theroleof pages 6-8).

1) Key concepts and definitions; current understanding
– Identity and domains: Human CREB1 (P16220) is a member of the bZIP family. It binds CRE sites, canonically the palindrome TGACGTCA, as a dimer via its C‑terminal bZIP; the N‑terminal transactivation domain contains Q1 (glutamine rich), KID, and Q2, with KID centered on Ser133 that recruits CBP/p300 upon phosphorylation (KID–KIX interaction) (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 10-11, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 8-9).
– Intrinsic disorder and activation domain architecture: The transactivation domain is intrinsically disordered with dynamic intra‑ and intermolecular interactions mediated by Q-rich regions; phosphorylation expands KID and facilitates coactivator access (PNAS, 2023) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– DNA recognition and dimerization: CREB1 binds CREs as homo‑ or heterodimers; bZIP leucine zipper mediates dimerization, basic region contacts DNA; Ser133 phosphorylation regulates coactivator recruitment but not DNA binding affinity per se (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 10-11, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 7-8).

2) Principal mechanisms and signaling pathways
– Upstream kinases that phosphorylate Ser133: cAMP/PKA, Ca2+/CaMKs (notably CaMKIV), MAPK→RSK/MSK, and PI3K/AKT; additional contributions from p38/MSK and PKC are reported. Ser133 phosphorylation promotes KID–KIX (CBP/p300) recruitment and transcriptional activation, though Ser133-P alone can be insufficient without cofactor activation (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 33-36, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 6-7, jin2024theroleof pages 1-3, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 30-33, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 5-6).
– Ser133 versus CRTCs: CRTCs (also called TORCs) serve as CREB coactivators that translocate to the nucleus upon dephosphorylation and can enhance recruitment of TFIID/TAFII130 and coactivators, enabling robust transcription even when Ser133 phosphorylation is transient or suboptimal. CRTC action can be partially independent of Ser133 status (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 36-40, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 8-9).
– Subcellular localization and dynamics: CREB1 is nuclear; it exists as preformed dimers via the bZIP and engages chromatin. The disordered Q1/KID/Q2 regions modulate non‑specific DNA affinity and target search behavior, offering a physical mechanism for efficient site finding in the crowded nucleus (gaudez2025disorderedactivationdomains pages 1-5, gaudez2025disorderedactivationdomains pages 10-13, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).

3) Function and biological processes; cellular localization
– Molecular function: DNA‑binding transcription factor that recognizes CRE elements to regulate target gene expression. Coactivator recruitment (CBP/p300 via pSer133‑KID–KIX; CRTCs) drives transcriptional activation. CREB1 functions primarily in the nucleus at promoters/enhancers containing CREs (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 8-9, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 36-40, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10).
– Biological roles: Activity‑dependent gene expression in neurons, metabolic regulation (gluconeogenesis, stress responses), cell survival/proliferation, and immune functions. While DNA binding can occur to full or half‑CRE sites, transcriptional specificity depends on signaling context, coactivators, and chromatin state (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 33-36, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 36-40).

4) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
– Structural/biophysical: PNAS 2023 mapped glutamine‑rich TAD behavior and showed phosphorylation‑dependent expansion of KID, rationalizing enhanced CBP/p300 access; it also highlighted dynamic intra/intermolecular interactions of Q1/Q2 that may tune coactivator engagement (Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2313835120) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– Oncology: In castration‑resistant prostate cancer, GR activation after AR antagonism elevated cAMP/PKA signaling with increased pCREB‑Ser133; selective GR modulators (SGRMs) combined with enzalutamide delayed xenograft progression and reduced PKIB expression (Nov 2024, https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0479) (bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 7-9, bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 1-2). A 2024 review summarized CREB activation via PKA, AKT, CaMK, RSK/MSK and cataloged inhibitor classes, linking CREB signaling to metabolism, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance (Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.53941/ijddp.2024.100011) (jin2024theroleof pages 1-3, jin2024theroleof pages 5-6, jin2024theroleof pages 6-8).
– Immunology/hematology: In multiple myeloma, CREB1 directly upregulated immune checkpoint HLA‑E; pharmacologic/genomic CREB1 inhibition lowered HLA‑E and restored NK cell cytotoxicity against MM cells and patient samples (Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-024-02303-w) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– Mast cell biology: CREB was required for maintaining degranulation competence; inhibition (666‑15 or RNAi) impaired FcεRI/MRGPRX2‑dependent exocytosis despite modest effects on receptor levels (Oct 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13201681) (steven2020whatturnscreb pages 13-14).
– Neuroscience/psychiatry: A 2024 neuropharmacology review updated CREB’s roles in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and psychiatric disorders, synthesizing downstream pathways and therapeutic implications (Dec 2024, https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159x22666240206111838) (jin2024theroleof pages 1-3).

5) Current applications and real‑world implementations
– Direct CREB pathway modulation: Small‑molecule KID–KIX disruptors and DNA‑binding inhibitors have been reported. KG‑501 (naphthol AS‑E phosphate) disrupts KID–KIX and modulates cAMP‑dependent targets; arylstibonic acids (e.g., P6981) inhibit DNA binding; 666‑15 is a potent CREB transcription inhibitor with in vivo tolerability, and 653‑47 enhances 666‑15 efficacy (citations through 2020–2024 for class summaries) (steven2020whatturnscreb pages 15-16, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 13-14, jin2024theroleof pages 6-8).
– Axis‑level interventions: In CRPC, targeting GR with SGRMs reduced pCREB‑Ser133 and delayed tumor progression when combined with AR antagonism, suggesting a clinically translatable axis (Nov 2024, https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0479) (bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 7-9, bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 1-2).
– Immuno‑oncology: In multiple myeloma, CREB1 inhibition downregulated HLA‑E to restore NK cell killing, indicating a potential combination with NKG2A‑directed therapies (Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-024-02303-w) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– Diagnostic biomarkers: Rare tumors with EWSR1::CREB1 fusions (e.g., primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma) provide diagnostic signatures guiding management (Feb 2024, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-024-05634-4) (jin2024theroleof pages 5-6).

6) Expert opinions and analysis
– Mechanistic sufficiency: Ser133 phosphorylation is necessary but often not sufficient for robust CREB‑mediated transcription; effective activation integrates Ser133‑dependent CBP/p300 recruitment with CRTC coactivator availability and nuclear Ca2+ signaling to CBP (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 33-36, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 36-40).
– Disorder‑enabled regulation: Intrinsically disordered Q‑rich TAD segments mediate multivalent contacts that tune coactivator engagement and limit non‑specific DNA binding, improving target search and possibly conferring context sensitivity in vivo (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– Translational targeting: In cancers where CREB drives tumor programs (metabolism, survival, immune evasion), indirect axis modulation (e.g., GR–cAMP/PKA in CRPC) may currently be more clinically proximal than direct TF inhibitors; immune‑checkpoint regulation by CREB1 (HLA‑E) suggests immunotherapy combinations (bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 7-9, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2, jin2024theroleof pages 6-8).

7) Relevant statistics and data (recent)
– GR→cAMP/PKA→pCREB in CRPC: Enzalutamide plus SGRM (C297/C335) significantly delayed time to tumor doubling versus enzalutamide alone in LAPC4 xenografts; combination reduced tumor PKIB mRNA and pCREB‑Ser133, supporting on‑pathway effects (Nov 2024; doi:10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0479) (bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 7-9, bennett2023glucocorticoidreceptor(gr) pages 1-2).
– NK cytotoxicity in MM: CREB1 directly bound the HLA‑E promoter; genetic/pharmacologic CREB1 inhibition reduced HLA‑E and restored NK cell killing in MM cell lines and patient samples (Jun 2024; doi:10.1038/s41375-024-02303-w) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).
– Structural biophysics: Q1/Q2 exhibit transient β‑hairpins that mediate dynamic contacts; phosphorylation expands KID, facilitating CBP access (PNAS Nov 2023; doi:10.1073/pnas.2313835120) (martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 10-10, martinezyamout2023glutaminerichregionsof pages 1-2).

Mechanistic pathway synopsis (concise)
– Signal inputs: GPCR→AC→cAMP→PKA; Ca2+ influx→CaMKs (esp. CaMKIV); RTK/Ras→ERK→RSK and p38→MSK; PI3K→AKT. Outputs converge on CREB1 Ser133 and/or CRTC dephosphorylation/nuclear entry. Activated CREB1 dimers on CREs recruit CBP/p300 (via pKID–KIX) and/or CRTCs to engage TFIID and Pol II, producing stimulus‑ and context‑specific gene expression programs (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 33-36, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 6-7, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 36-40, jin2024theroleof pages 1-3, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 30-33, belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 5-6).

Notes on gene/protein identification
– The gene symbol CREB1 (Homo sapiens) matches UniProt P16220; domain/family features (bZIP, KID/KIX, Q‑rich regions) are consistent across sources; no conflicting non‑human or alternative gene symbol literature was used (belgacem2017crebatthe pages 27-30, steven2020whatturnscreb pages 10-11, chowdhury2024multifacetedregulationof pages 8-9).
