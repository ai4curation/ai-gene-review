### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CASP14" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CASP14' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CASP14** (gene ID: CASP14, UniProt: P31944) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Objective: Compile a current, well‑cited research report on human CASP14 (UniProt P31944) covering function, activation, substrates, localization, roles in epidermal biology and disease, recent developments (2023–2024), applications, and evolutionary context.
- Identity verification: CASP14 is a human cysteine protease (peptidase C14A family) specialized for epidermal cornification rather than classical apoptosis; literature consistently describes maturation into p20/p10 subunits and localization to differentiating epidermal layers, aligning with the UniProt entry, organism (Homo sapiens), family, and caspase‑like domains (e.g., caspase catalytic cysteine and p10/p20 modules) (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5, markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and class. CASP14 encodes caspase‑14, an epidermis‑associated cysteine endopeptidase in the caspase (C14A) family. Unlike apoptotic or inflammatory caspases, caspase‑14 functions primarily during keratinocyte terminal differentiation (cornification) to support barrier formation and environmental protection (UVB, water loss) (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5).
- Enzymatic activation and maturation. Caspase‑14 is synthesized as a procaspase and is proteolytically processed at aspartate to generate the typical large (p20) and small (p10) subunits; activation coincides with the transition from stratum granulosum to stratum corneum. In vitro enzymatic activity of the processed enzyme requires kosmotropic salts, consistent with activity in the dehydrating stratum corneum milieu (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5).
- Substrate specificity and validated substrate. (Pro)filaggrin/(filaggrin) is a validated physiological substrate of caspase‑14. Casp14 deficiency alters filaggrin fragment patterns and impairs further breakdown into free amino acids that constitute the skin’s natural moisturizing factors (NMFs), linking caspase‑14 activity to hydration and barrier homeostasis (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4).

Biochemical function and pathways
- Reaction and specificity. As a caspase, caspase‑14 cleaves after aspartate within specific sequence contexts; human and mouse orthologs differ in S4 subsite preferences (human favors bulky aromatic residues such as Trp/Tyr). The enzyme acts downstream in the filaggrin processing cascade, enabling or facilitating subsequent exo/endopeptidase activities that generate hygroscopic amino acids of NMF (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).
- Site and timing of action. Caspase‑14 localizes to keratohyalin granules in the stratum granulosum and remains present in corneocytes of the stratum corneum; activation occurs at the granular–cornified interface. Expression and processing are developmentally programmed and detectable during late embryogenesis in skin when the stratum corneum forms (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4).

Cellular and tissue localization
- Tissue distribution. Expression is largely confined to cornifying epithelia (epidermis, hair follicles) and absent from non‑cornifying epithelia; subcellular associations include keratohyalin granules and cornified structures consistent with a role in late differentiation (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5).
- Subcellular localization in epidermis. In situ and biochemical data place caspase‑14 in late differentiating keratinocytes and the stratum corneum, where only activated enzyme is detected, consistent with a function in the dehydrated, lipid‑rich barrier (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5).

Physiological roles in epidermal barrier, UV protection, and hydration
- Barrier and hydration. In vivo, Casp14 knockout skin shows altered scaling, impaired conversion of filaggrin to free amino acids (reduced NMF), increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and reduced hydration, indicating a direct role in barrier competence (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).
- UVB photoprotection. Caspase‑14 contributes to UVB defense: deficiency increases UVB‑induced DNA photolesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), and agents that induce caspase‑14 such as EGCG confer photoprotective effects (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).

Regulation of expression and activity
- Differentiation and lipid signals. CASP14 is induced during keratinocyte differentiation; vitamin D3, ceramides/sphingoid base signaling, and MAPK pathways (p38/JNK) upregulate CASP14. Polyphenols (e.g., EGCG) increase CASP14 and correlate with barrier improvement and photoprotection (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6, markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 3-5).
- Cytokines and retinoids. Th2 cytokines (IL‑4/IL‑13) suppress CASP14 in keratinocytes; retinoids downregulate CASP14 expression in a differentiation‑associated manner (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3).

Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024) and latest research
- Skin barrier and cell death crosstalk. 2024 reviews detail how keratinocyte death programs shape stem cell niches and barrier integrity, reinforcing the specialized, non‑apoptotic role of caspase‑14 in cornification among broader death pathways in skin (Cell Death & Differentiation, 2024; DOI 10.1038/s41418-024-01297-3) (lecomte2024celldeathas pages 1-2).
- Autophagy in terminal differentiation. A 2024 synthesis (Cells, 2024; DOI 10.3390/cells13201675) highlights autophagy‑mediated remodeling during epidermal differentiation; in this context, caspase‑14 is recognized as the keratinocyte‑associated caspase linked to cornification rather than apoptosis, fitting into the multilayered proteolysis of barrier formation (eckhart2024autophagymediatedcellularremodeling pages 1-2).
- AD pathogenesis and barrier markers. Multi‑omics (IJMS, 2024; DOI 10.3390/ijms25021042) emphasizes barrier genes and proteins (including CASP14) within proteomic signatures of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis; clinically, AD prevalence approaches ~10% in adults and ~20% in children, underscoring the public health impact of barrier biology (rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2).
- NLRP10–barrier axis. 2024 mechanistic work (Cell Death & Disease, 2024; DOI 10.1038/s41419-024-07146-y) on NLRP10 shows barrier differentiation programs encompassing terminal markers such as filaggrin and caspase‑14, integrating CASP14 within broader keratinocyte survival/differentiation networks relevant to AD (cho2024nlrp10maintainsepidermal pages 1-2).
- Natural product modulation and barrier restoration. 2024 reviews of barrier‑restorative approaches (Pharmaceuticals, 2024; DOI 10.3390/ph17091176) discuss natural compounds that can promote CASP14 activity/expression (e.g., ginsenosides), aligning with earlier findings on EGCG, and support cosmeceutical angles for barrier repair (yang2024insightsfromtraditional pages 1-3, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).
- Cancer context updates. A 2024 review on melanoma summarizes roles of caspases; CASP14 is variably expressed in melanocytic lesions, with dysregulation linked to tumor biology in selected studies, though its role is not canonical apoptotic execution (Curr Issues Mol Biol, 2024; DOI 10.3390/cimb46090562) (szmurło2024theroleof pages 1-2). Additional oncologic multi‑omics studies mention aberrant expression/localization of CASP14 in oral cancers (NPJ Precision Oncology, 2024; DOI 10.1038/s41698-024-00764-x) (szmurło2024theroleof pages 1-2).
- Evolutionary genomics. Two 2024 Scientific Reports studies provide strong evolutionary context: sirenians show pseudogenization of CASP14 (and FLG) in dugong with retention in manatee, paralleling independent loss in cetaceans, indicating convergent aquatic adaptations of skin barrier genes; monotremes (echidna) possess multiple CASP14 copies, underscoring lineage‑specific expansion of epidermal proteases (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-60099-2; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-51926-7) (steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsofa pages 1-2, steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsof pages 1-2).
- Barrier therapeutics context. While not targeting CASP14 directly, a 2024 study demonstrated that recombinant filaggrin‑2 (FLG2) improves UVB‑induced barrier dysfunction and increases expression of differentiation markers including caspase‑14 in models, underscoring the therapeutic logic of enhancing the filaggrin axis in which caspase‑14 participates (Antioxidants, 2024; DOI 10.3390/antiox13081002) (li2024dermalinjectionof pages 1-2).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Biomarkers and assays. CASP14 protein has been repeatedly quantified in epidermis and stratum corneum by immunoblotting, IHC, and proteomics; research ELISAs and targeted proteomics have been applied in disease states (reviewed in 2021) (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 11-12). Multi‑omics profiling in 2024 places CASP14 within proteomic panels for differentiating inflammatory skin diseases and monitoring therapeutic response (rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2).
- Cosmeceuticals and photoprotection. Polyphenols (e.g., EGCG) and other bioactives can induce CASP14 and are associated with reduced UVB damage and improved barrier function in experimental models, providing a mechanistic basis for cosmeceutical strategies aimed at enhancing CASP14‑mediated cornification (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6, yang2024insightsfromtraditional pages 1-3).
- Barrier‑centric therapeutics. Strategies to restore the filaggrin/NMF axis (e.g., recombinant FLG2) may secondarily increase CASP14 expression and act synergistically with CASP14‑dependent processing to improve barrier integrity and photoprotection (li2024dermalinjectionof pages 1-2).

Disease associations and clinical relevance
- Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. CASP14 is typically reduced in AD and psoriatic lesions and correlates with barrier disruption; these conditions feature altered differentiation and diminished filaggrin/NMF pathways in which CASP14 is integral (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 11-12, rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2).
- Keratinization disorders. CASP14 deficiency or dysregulation perturbs filaggrin processing and NMF generation, contributing to scaling and barrier defects that phenocopy aspects of ichthyotic presentations in models (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).
- Oncology. CASP14 expression is variable across tumors; increased, decreased, or mislocalized expression has been reported depending on tumor type and context (e.g., some melanomas, oral squamous lesions), reflecting non‑canonical roles beyond apoptosis (markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 7-8, szmurło2024theroleof pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data
- Barrier disease burden. AD affects approximately 10% of adults and 20% of children, highlighting the population‑level significance of barrier proteins such as CASP14 within disease mechanisms and potential biomarker panels (rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2).
- Functional phenotypes. In caspase‑14–deficient skin, failure to generate NMF amino acids leads to increased TEWL and reduced hydration; increased UVB sensitivity is measurable by higher cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, directly linking enzyme activity to biophysical barrier metrics (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- J Cell Biol 2008 perspective and mechanistic synthesis. Denecker et al. clarified activation, substrate validation, and in vivo functions in barrier and UVB protection, forming the bedrock for subsequent translational research (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5).
- 2024 reviews (Cells; Cell Death & Differentiation) situate CASP14 in the modern framework of epidermal remodeling and regulated cell death, endorsing its cornification‑specific role (eckhart2024autophagymediatedcellularremodeling pages 1-2, lecomte2024celldeathas pages 1-2).
- 2024 multi‑omics dermatology review underlines CASP14’s value among skin barrier proteins within diagnostic/prognostic proteomic readouts in IMIDs (rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2).
- 2024 evolutionary genomics pinpoints convergent loss and lineage‑specific expansion of CASP14, validating its specialized role in terrestrial barrier adaptation (steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsofa pages 1-2, steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsof pages 1-2).

Conclusion
Human caspase‑14 (CASP14; UniProt P31944) is a keratinocyte differentiation‑associated caspase that becomes active at the granular–cornified transition, localizes to keratohyalin granules/corneocytes, and processes (pro)filaggrin to enable NMF generation. Its functions—epidermal barrier maturation, photoprotection, and hydration—are supported by in vivo genetic and biochemical evidence. CASP14 is induced by differentiation and lipid/MAPK signaling and suppressed by Th2 cytokines/retinoids. Recent work (2023–2024) integrates CASP14 into barrier homeostasis networks, multi‑omics disease signatures, and evolutionary adaptation of skin barrier genes, while applied studies point toward barrier‑targeted interventions (e.g., FLG2 supplementation) and cosmeceutical modulation of CASP14 as translational avenues (denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 3-4, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 5-6, denecker2008caspase14revealsits pages 4-5, markiewicz2021caspase14—frombiomolecularbasics pages 2-3, rusinol2024multiomicsapproachto pages 1-2, cho2024nlrp10maintainsepidermal pages 1-2, eckhart2024autophagymediatedcellularremodeling pages 1-2, yang2024insightsfromtraditional pages 1-3, li2024dermalinjectionof pages 1-2, steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsofa pages 1-2, steinbinder2024comparativegenomicsof pages 1-2).
