description: 'CASP14 encodes caspase-14, a unique non-apoptotic cysteine protease
  essential for keratinocyte terminal differentiation and cornification. Unlike other
  caspases involved in apoptosis, CASP14 functions specifically in the formation of
  the epidermal barrier by cleaving filaggrin to generate natural moisturizing factors
  and facilitating nuclear degradation during cornification. The protein is expressed
  in suprabasal layers of the epidermis and is critical for maintaining skin hydration
  and barrier function.'
