description: >-
  PFDN5 (Prefoldin subunit 5) encodes an alpha-type subunit of the heterohexameric
  prefoldin complex (also known as GimC). The prefoldin complex is a jellyfish-shaped
  molecular chaperone composed of two alpha subunits (PFDN3, PFDN5) and four beta
  subunits (PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN4, PFDN6). Prefoldin functions as a co-chaperone/holdase
  that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides -- primarily actin and tubulin -- and
  delivers them to the group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding. PFDN5
  is also known as MM-1 (Myc Modulator-1) and has a well-characterized moonlighting
  function as a transcriptional corepressor of c-Myc. PFDN5/MM-1 binds the MBII region
  of the c-Myc N-terminal domain and represses c-Myc transcriptional activity through
  multiple mechanisms including recruitment of the TIF1beta/HDAC-mSin3 corepressor complex,
  promotion of c-Myc proteasomal degradation via Rabring7, and negative regulation of Wnt4
  expression via Egr-1 binding. The MM-1 isoforms show differential localization: MM-1alpha
  and MM-1gamma are nuclear and bind c-Myc, while MM-1beta is cytoplasmic and does not
  repress c-Myc transcription. Beyond cytoskeletal protein folding, the prefoldin complex
  has been shown to inhibit amyloid-beta fibrillation, suggesting roles in neuroprotection.
  PFDN5 is also implicated in RNA polymerase assembly through phylogenetic inference from yeast.

      PFDN5. This IBA annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER)
      with evidence from yeast (SGD:S000001871, SGD:S000004559), Arabidopsis, and
      human PFDN5 itself. The prefoldin complex is a cytoplasmic chaperone that
      operates in the cytosol to capture unfolded nascent polypeptides and deliver
      them to the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT (PMID:9630229). Liang et al. 2020
      (PMID:32699605) describe prefoldin as "a cytoplasmic chaperone protein." The
      term "cytoplasm" is appropriately broad, as a more specific CC annotation to
      "prefoldin complex" (GO:0016272) is already present. Having both is correct:
      one describes the subcellular location and the other describes complex membership.

      Transcription corepressor activity is a well-established moonlighting function of
      PFDN5/MM-1, distinct from the core cytoplasmic co-chaperone role. It is mediated
      specifically by the nuclear isoforms (MM-1alpha, MM-1gamma) and involves binding
      to the MBII region of c-Myc's N-terminal domain and recruitment of
      TIF1beta/HDAC-mSin3 corepressor complex (PMID:9792694, PMID:32699605). While
      this is an important biological function, the primary identity of PFDN5 is as a
      prefoldin subunit, so this is classified as non-core.

      PMID:18281035. PFDN5/MM-1 is well-established as a transcriptional regulator through
      its c-Myc corepressor function. However, this term is redundant with the more specific

      than the existing GO:0045892 annotation, it is not wrong -- PFDN5 does regulate
      transcription. This is a secondary/moonlighting function. The more specific

    summary: >-
      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the most appropriate molecular function
      term for PFDN5 as a prefoldin subunit. This annotation is proposed as a NEW entry
      to match the IBA annotation that exists for PFDN1 (which has this term with IBA
      evidence). Prefoldin functions as a holdase/transfer chaperone that captures unfolded
      nascent polypeptides and delivers them to TRiC/CCT for folding (PMID:9630229).
      Gestaut et al. 2019 (PMID:30955883) demonstrated that the PFD-TRiC supra-chaperone
      assembly enhances folding rates. This term is also the recommended replacement for
      the obsoleting GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding." Note: PFDN5 does not currently
      have an explicit IBA annotation to GO:0044183 in the GOA data, unlike PFDN1 which
      does. The two MODIFY actions for GO:0051082 above recommend this term as replacement.

      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the core molecular function of PFDN5 as

      substrates and delivers them to TRiC/CCT (PMID:9630229, PMID:30955883). This term
      should be added to PFDN5 to replace the obsoleting GO:0051082.

    Moonlighting function as c-Myc transcriptional corepressor (MM-1). Nuclear
    isoforms (MM-1alpha and MM-1gamma) bind the MBII region of the c-Myc
    N-terminal domain and repress c-Myc transcriptional activity through
    multiple mechanisms including recruitment of the TIF1beta/HDAC-mSin3
    corepressor complex, promotion of c-Myc proteasomal degradation via Rabring7,
    and negative regulation of Wnt4 expression via Egr-1 binding. This function
    is independent of the cytoplasmic prefoldin co-chaperone role and is mediated
