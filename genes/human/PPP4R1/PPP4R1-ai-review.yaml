        MISANNOTATION - OPPOSITE REACTION: PPP4R1 is the regulatory subunit of protein
        phosphatase 4 (PP4), which catalyzes DEPHOSPHORYLATION, not phosphorylation!
        UniProt describes it as "Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4 regulatory
        subunit 1". PMID:18614045 states "A PP4-phosphatase complex dephosphorylates
        gamma-H2AX". Phosphatases REMOVE phosphate groups, kinases ADD them. This
        is
        a fundamental misannotation - the gene should be annotated to dephosphorylation
        or protein phosphatase activity, not protein phosphorylation.
