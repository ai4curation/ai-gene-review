description: LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 2, member of LY6 family characterized
  by three-finger LU domain (snake toxin-like fold) stabilized by disulfide bonds.
  GPI-anchored cell surface protein. LY6 family members typically function as modulators
  of receptor signaling, cell adhesion, or immune responses. LYPD2 may regulate nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) or other receptors at cell surface. Expression
  in specific tissues suggests specialized roles in cell signaling or cell-cell communication.
  GPI anchor allows lateral mobility in membrane and potential release by phospholipases.
  May participate in immune modulation, neuronal signaling, or cell migration.
