description: 'Stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3, SLP-3) is a 291-amino acid integral
  membrane protein of the stomatin/band-7/SPFH family and the mammalian ortholog
  of C. elegans MEC-2 required for touch sensation. STOML3 contains an N-terminal
  hydrophobic hairpin anchoring it to membranes and a conserved stomatin domain that
  mediates oligomerization and channel modulation. It is the first molecule shown
  essential for touch sensation in mammals. STOML3 is selectively expressed in sensory
  neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia, where it concentrates
  at peripheral nerve endings detecting mechanical stimuli. STOML3 binds cholesterol
  via a conserved N-terminal motif and localizes to cholesterol-rich membrane rafts,
  where it stiffens the local membrane microenvironment to facilitate force transfer
  to mechanotransducer channels. STOML3 forms higher-order oligomers required for
  its function, acting as a critical accessory subunit that tunes mechanosensitive
  ion channel properties. It potentiates Piezo1 and Piezo2 channel activity by lowering
  their activation threshold from approximately 100 nm to approximately 10 nm displacements,
  enabling detection of molecular-scale movements relevant for fine touch. STOML3
  also interacts with acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, and 4), modulating
  their gating properties. STOML3-positive vesicles are Rab11-positive and microtubule-dependent,
  suggesting a role in trafficking transduction complexes to sensory endings. Stoml3
  knockout mice show profound mechanosensory deficits: approximately 35-40% of cutaneous
  mechanoreceptors become mechanically silent, remaining units require approximately
  10-fold larger displacements for activation, and tactile discrimination is impaired.
  Small-molecule inhibitors (OB-1, OB-2) that block STOML3 oligomerization reverse
  pathological mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic and diabetic pain models,
  validating STOML3 as a therapeutic target for mechanical pain modulation.'

    label: ion channel inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: The IBA annotation to ion channel inhibitor activity is phylogenetically
      inferred from the stomatin family but is overly restrictive. STOML3 functions
      as a bidirectional modulator of mechanosensitive ion channels rather than a
      simple inhibitor. It potentiates Piezo1/2 channels by lowering their activation
      threshold while modulating (including suppressing) ASIC gating properties.
      A more accurate term would be ion channel regulator activity (GO:0099106).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: STOML3 does not simply inhibit ion channels; it sensitizes Piezo channels
      to mechanical stimuli while modulating ASICs. The term "ion channel regulator
      activity" better captures its bidirectional modulatory function.
