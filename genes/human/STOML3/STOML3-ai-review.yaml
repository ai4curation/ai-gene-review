description: 'Stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3, SLP-3), integral membrane protein (~291
  amino acids) of stomatin family characterized by conserved SPFH (stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C)
  domain. Mammalian homologue of C. elegans MEC-2 required for touch sensation in
  worms. First molecule shown essential for touch sensation in mammals. Single transmembrane
  region near N-terminus, predominantly localizes to plasma membrane within cholesterol-rich
  membrane rafts. Forms oligomers in membrane - oligomerization functionally significant
  for mechanotransduction. Critical accessory subunit of mechanosensory protein complexes
  in sensory neurons. Essential modulator of mechanotransduction - conversion of mechanical
  stimuli into electrochemical signals. Not ion channel itself but serves as critical
  accessory that tunes mechanosensitive channel properties. Selectively expressed
  in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (cells detecting
  touch and pain). Concentrated at peripheral nerve endings where mechanical stimuli
  detected. Also in inner ear mechanosensory fibers, ciliated cells of olfactory epithelium
  (olfactory sensory neuron cilia), and motile cilia of respiratory/reproductive epithelia.
  Binds cholesterol via conserved N-terminal motif - cholesterol-binding allows organization
  of specialized membrane microdomains, locally stiffening membrane where mechanotransducer
  proteins reside. Interacts with multiple mechanosensitive ion channels: Piezo1/Piezo2
  stretch-activated cation channels and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in nociceptive
  neurons. Co-localizes with Piezo channels and enhances their sensitivity to mechanical
  force - lowers activation threshold and increases mechanically evoked currents.
  Effect depends on cholesterol-binding (P40S mutation disrupting cholesterol binding
  prevents channel potentiation). Facilitates force transfer to Piezo channels by
  creating stiffer lipid microenvironment, tuning channel gating kinetics. Also binds
  ASIC subunits altering their gating properties (suppresses peak amplitude, slows
  inactivation). STOML3 and stomatin form complexes with ASICs regulating mechanonociception.
  Mice lacking STOML3: ~35% of cutaneous mechanoreceptive neurons completely lose
  response to mechanical stimuli. Many mechanogated ion currents abolished. Reduced
  responses to gentle touch, loss of touch-evoked pain (tactile allodynia) after nerve
  injury. Required for functional plasticity of proprioceptors after nerve injury.
  Essential for olfactory sensory neurons'' normal encoding: STOML3-deficient OSNs
  show reduced spontaneous firing, fewer/shorter spikes in response to odors. Small-molecule
  inhibitor OB-1 prevents STOML3 oligomerization, dampens mechanically activated currents,
  silences mechanoreceptor fibers, alleviates mechanical pain behaviors in animal
  models. Validates STOML3 as therapeutic target for mechanical pain modulation. Functions
  in mechanosensory pathways of cutaneous touch receptors, proprioceptive neurons,
  and modulates olfactory sensory transduction.'

    label: ion channel inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Ion channel inhibitor activity is overly restrictive - STOML3 modulates
      channels (can both sensitize Piezo and suppress ASIC peak currents) rather than
      simply inhibiting. Better term would be 'ion channel regulator activity'.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Channel modulator, not just inhibitor.
