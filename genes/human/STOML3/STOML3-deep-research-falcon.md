## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8TAV4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stomatin-like protein 3; Short=SLP-3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=STOML3;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Band-7_stomatin-like. (IPR043202); Band_7. (IPR001107); Band_7/SPFH_dom_sf. (IPR036013); Band_7/stomatin-like_CS. (IPR018080); Stomatin_HflK_fam. (IPR001972)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "STOML3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'STOML3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **STOML3** (gene ID: STOML3, UniProt: Q8TAV4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
We verified the target identity and then compiled foundational and recent evidence to define molecular functions, mechanisms, localization, phenotypes, and pharmacology for human STOML3 (Q8TAV4). We prioritized 2014–2024 primary literature where available and integrated authoritative summaries.

Verification of target identity and family/domains
- Target matches: STOML3 (stomatin-like protein 3) is a human stomatin/SPFH/band-7 family protein and the mammalian ortholog of C. elegans MEC-2, consistent with UniProt Q8TAV4. Literature consistently places STOML3 within SPFH/band-7 and in sensory neurons (mechanosensation) (velandia2019expressionandphysiological pages 26-29, kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domain architecture: STOML3 is a stomatin-domain (SPFH/band-7) monotopic membrane protein that forms higher-order oligomers. An N-terminal hydrophobic hairpin anchors the protein to membranes/vesicles; the stomatin domain mediates oligomerization and channel modulation (inferred from stomatin family and directly mapped for STOML3) (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 5-7, velandia2019expressionandphysiological pages 26-29).
- Primary role: STOML3 is a potent physiological regulator of native mechanosensitive currents in sensory neurons. It sensitizes mechanogated channels (notably Piezo1/2), lowering activation thresholds to molecular-scale deflections relevant for fine touch (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2).
- Concept of a “transducosome”: STOML3 resides in a mobile, Rab11-positive vesicle pool with ASIC subunits and stomatin, consistent with a trafficking/transduction complex supplying components to sensory endings (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsofa pages 89-92, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsof pages 89-92).

Function and mechanisms
- Piezo channel modulation: STOML3 lowers the activation threshold of Piezo1 and Piezo2 to ~10 nm displacements and is necessary for high sensitivity of mechanoreceptors. Stoml3 knockout neurons require ~10× larger displacements for activation (Nature Communications, 24 Mar 2014, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4520) (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2).
- Membrane mechanics and cholesterol: STOML3 binds cholesterol, localizes to cholesterol-rich microdomains, and stiffens local membrane to facilitate force transfer onto mechanogated channels (including Piezo1/2). Cholesterol depletion phenocopies STOML3 deficiency, interdependently reducing mechanosensitivity and altering membrane mechanics (Nature Communications, 7 Oct 2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9512) (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6).
- Oligomerization as a mechanistic requirement: Higher-order scaffolding/oligomerization via the stomatin domain is required for STOML3’s Piezo-sensitizing activity; oligomerization-disrupting mutations abrogate function and reduce cluster size (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2, wetzel2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 1-6).
- ASIC interactions and vesicular trafficking: STOML3 directly interacts with multiple ASIC subunits (ASIC1a/1b/2a/2b/3/4) as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and FRET; interactions occur predominantly in a highly mobile vesicular compartment. STOML3-positive vesicles in DRG neurons are Rab11-positive and microtubule-dependent; perturbing vesicle dynamics increases acid-gated currents at the plasma membrane, linking trafficking to ASIC function (Open Biology, Jun 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.120096) (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 4-5, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 5-7, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsofa pages 89-92).
- ELKIN1 coupling: We did not find citable primary evidence in the collected texts demonstrating direct biochemical interaction between human STOML3 and ELKIN1. While emerging work proposes functional relationships between ELKIN1 and known mechanotransduction modulators, our evidence set here does not provide direct STOML3–ELKIN1 data; thus this remains an open point in this report (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11).

Cellular localization
- Lipid rafts/microdomains: STOML3 is detected in cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant fractions consistent with raft association, supporting a role in organizing local membrane mechanics (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2).
- Vesicular pool: A significant intracellular pool of STOML3 resides in a mobile, Rab11-positive vesicle population distinct from early endosomes/lysosomes. Vesicles carry STOML3 with stomatin and ASICs; the N-terminal hydrophobic region of STOML3 is necessary for vesicular localization (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 5-7).

Organismal and cellular phenotypes
- Mechanosensory deficits upon loss of function: Stoml3 knockout leads to large-scale loss of mechanically sensitive mechanoreceptors (about 35–40% of Aβ/Aδ mechanoreceptors become mechanically “silent”), elevated displacement thresholds in remaining units, and impaired tactile acuity in behavioral assays; neuropathic allodynia is reduced (thesis synthesis, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.17169/refubium-31101; and review summary) (kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31, velandia2019expressionandphysiological pages 26-29).
- Biophysical readouts: AFM and mechanical assays show that cholesterol depletion and STOML3 deficiency similarly reduce membrane stiffness and mechanosensitivity; MbCD treatment attenuates tactile allodynia in WT but not Stoml3−/− mice, implying STOML3–cholesterol dependence (Oct 2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9512) (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6).

Recent developments (emphasis on 2023–2024) and latest research
- 2023 synthesis: Comprehensive analysis emphasizes that STOML3’s self-association and stomatin domain underlie Piezo sensitization and links this to robust in vivo phenotypes (Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.17169/refubium-31101) (kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31).
- Our collected evidence set did not include citable 2024 primary data directly expanding STOML3 biochemistry; however, the cholesterol–mechanics mechanism and pharmacological oligomerization targeting remain central and translationally active themes based on prior work (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, wetzel2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 1-6).

Applications and real-world implementations
- Pharmacological modulation: High-throughput BiFC screening (~35,000 compounds) identified small molecules (OB-1, OB-2) that inhibit STOML3 oligomerization, shrink STOML3 nanoclusters, reduce mechanosensitive currents, silence mechanoreceptors, attenuate normal touch, and reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic and diabetic models (Jan 2017, repository DOI https://doi.org/10.17863/cam.7374) (wetzel2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 1-6).
- Membrane targeting as analgesic concept: Acute cholesterol depletion (MbCD) attenuates tactile allodynia in WT but not Stoml3−/− mice, supporting STOML3-dependent membrane mechanics as a druggable axis for pain modulation (Oct 2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9512) (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6).

Expert opinions and authoritative analysis
- Foundational mechanotransduction perspective: STOML3 is highlighted as an integral scaffold that tunes native mechanosensitive currents, enabling detection of molecular-scale movements, with function mapped to the stomatin domain and higher-order assemblies (Mar 2014, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4520) (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2).
- Vesicular “transducosome” model: An authoritative Open Biology study proposes a Rab11-positive STOML3/stomatin/ASIC complex in a mobile vesicle pool that regulates availability and function of ASICs, integrating trafficking with transduction (Jun 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.120096) (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4).
- 2023 synthesis emphasizes translational potential of targeting STOML3 oligomerization or cholesterol coupling to mitigate mechanical pain hypersensitivity (Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.17169/refubium-31101) (kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Piezo threshold tuning: STOML3 lowers Piezo1/2 activation thresholds to ~10 nm; Stoml3 knockout raises thresholds ~10-fold (Mar 2014, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4520) (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2).
- Mechanoreceptor loss: ~35–40% of Aβ/Aδ mechanoreceptors become mechanically silent in Stoml3 knockout; tactile discrimination is impaired (Jan 2023 synthesis) (kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31, velandia2019expressionandphysiological pages 26-29).
- HTS scale: ~35,000-compound screen identified oligomerization blockers (OB-1/OB-2) that reversed neuropathic and diabetic mechanical hypersensitivity (Jan 2017, https://doi.org/10.17863/cam.7374) (wetzel2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 1-6).
- Membrane mechanics: AFM/mechanics show reduced stiffness and mechanosensitivity with either cholesterol depletion or STOML3 loss; MbCD phenocopies STOML3 deficiency and attenuates allodynia in WT (Oct 2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9512) (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6).

Pathways and interacting channel systems
- Piezo1/2: STOML3 acts as an accessory modulator lowering Piezo channel activation thresholds; effect requires stomatin domain and oligomerization (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2).
- ASICs: STOML3 co-immunoprecipitates with all tested ASICs and shows strong FRET with ASIC2a/ASIC3 in vesicles; N-terminal hydrophobic insertion is required for vesicle localization and stable interaction (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 4-5, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 5-7).
- Trafficking: STOML3-positive vesicles are Rab11-positive and microtubule-dependent, suggesting a recycling/trafficking role for transduction complexes (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsofa pages 89-92, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsof pages 89-92).
- ELKIN1: No direct evidence recovered in this set for physical interaction with STOML3; further targeted literature review is needed for this specific coupling (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11).

Subcellular localization summary
- Plasma membrane microdomains: association with cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant fractions (raft-like) (qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2).
- Intracellular vesicles: Rab11-positive mobile vesicles carrying STOML3, stomatin, and ASICs; vesicle–microtubule uncoupling redirects STOML3 to the plasma membrane, increasing ASIC currents (lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4).

Conclusions
Human STOML3 (Q8TAV4) is a stomatin/SPFH-domain oligomeric membrane protein that tunes the sensitivity of mechanogated ion channels, especially Piezo1/2, by organizing cholesterol-rich microdomains and stiffening the membrane to facilitate force transfer. It also forms vesicular complexes with stomatin and ASICs in a Rab11-positive, microtubule-dependent recycling pool that likely traffics transduction components. Loss of STOML3 impairs mechanosensation at cellular and behavioral levels, while pharmacological disruption of STOML3 oligomerization or its cholesterol coupling can attenuate pathological mechanical hypersensitivity, supporting STOML3 as a translational target in pain. Evidence for direct ELKIN1 coupling was not found in our collected citable set and remains to be resolved by further targeted studies (poole2014tuningpiezoion pages 1-2, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 1-2, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 10-11, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 3-4, wetzel2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 1-6, kuhnemund2023tuningsensorymechanotransduction pages 28-31, qi2015membranestiffeningby pages 4-6, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 4-5, lapatsina2012regulationofasic pages 5-7, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsofa pages 89-92, lapatsina2011molecularmechanismsof pages 89-92, velandia2019expressionandphysiological pages 26-29).
