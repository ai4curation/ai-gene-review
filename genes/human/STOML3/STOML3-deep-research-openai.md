## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene STOML3 (Q8TAV4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# STOML3 (Stomatin-Like Protein 3) – Overview and Key Features

**Stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3)**, also known as SLP-3, is an integral membrane protein of the stomatin family that plays a key role in sensory mechanotransduction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Stomatin%20and%20STOML3%20are%20closely,many%20cutaneous%20afferents%2C%20and%20a)). The human STOML3 gene encodes a protein of ~291 amino acids (Uniprot ID Q8TAV4) characterized by a conserved **stomatin (SPFH) domain**. This domain is shared with other “band-7” family proteins (stomatin, flotillin, prohibitin, etc.) and mediates membrane association and oligomerization. STOML3 contains a single transmembrane region near its N-terminus and predominantly localizes to cell membranes – especially within cholesterol-rich **membrane rafts** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=membrane%20mechanics%20by%20binding%20cholesterol,Targeting)). Notably, STOML3 was identified as the mammalian homologue of *C. elegans* MEC-2 (a protein required for touch sensation in worms) ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=detect%20specific%20modalities%20of%20mechanical,driven%20behaviours)), and it was the first molecule shown to be **essential for touch sensation in mammals** ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). 

**Tissue Distribution:** In humans, STOML3 is selectively expressed in certain tissues and cell types. It is highly expressed in **sensory neurons** of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia – the cells that detect touch and pain stimuli ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Immunolocalization studies show STOML3 is concentrated at the **peripheral nerve endings** of these neurons where mechanical stimuli are detected ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). In the mouse inner ear, STOML3 is found in mechanosensory nerve fibers (though it is not the mechanotransducer of hair cells themselves) and in other mechanosensitive tissues ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Intriguingly, STOML3 is also present in **ciliated cells** beyond the nervous system. For example, in the olfactory epithelium STOML3 localizes to the **cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7986538/#:~:text=Stomatin,be%20involved%20in%20modulating%20odorant)), and Human Protein Atlas data indicate STOML3 enrichment in the **motile cilia** of respiratory and reproductive epithelia (e.g. fallopian tube) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000133115-STOML3/tissue#:~:text=HUMAN%20PROTEIN%20ATLAS%20INFORMATION,IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY%20DATA%20RELIABILITY)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000133115-STOML3/tissue#:~:text=Multiplex%20immunofluorescence%20staining%20of%20ciliated,i)). This suggests a broader role for STOML3 in ciliary membrane domains. Consistently, subcellular studies place STOML3 at the **plasma membrane** (especially within lipid raft microdomains) and in some intracellular vesicles that traffic to the membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=membrane%20mechanics%20by%20binding%20cholesterol,Targeting)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=match%20at%20L888%20same%20vesicular,%E2%88%92%2F%E2%88%92%7D%20mutant%20mice%20may%20reflect)).

**Structural and Biochemical Features:** Like other stomatin-family proteins, STOML3 forms **oligomers** in the membrane, which is important for its function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)). The protein’s SPFH/stomatin domain enables it to interact with membrane lipids and partner proteins. A notable biochemical property of STOML3 is its ability to **bind cholesterol** via a conserved motif in its N-terminus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Sensing%20force%20is%20crucial%20to,required%20to%20maintain%20membrane%20mechanics)). This cholesterol-binding capacity allows STOML3 to organize specialized membrane microdomains – effectively **stiffening the local membrane** where mechanotransducer proteins reside ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Sensing%20force%20is%20crucial%20to,required%20to%20maintain%20membrane%20mechanics)). **Qi *et al.* (2015)** showed that STOML3’s association with cholesterol has a direct impact on membrane mechanics and mechanosensitivity: STOML3 partitions into lipid rafts and by **recruiting cholesterol it locally increases membrane stiffness**, thereby facilitating efficient transfer of force to mechanosensitive ion channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Sensing%20force%20is%20crucial%20to,required%20to%20maintain%20membrane%20mechanics)). Mutational analysis supports this mechanism – for instance, a point mutation in STOML3 (P40S) that disrupts cholesterol binding abolishes STOML3’s ability to sensitize mechanogated ion channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20its%20function,modulates%20Piezo1%20channel%20activity%20via)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=its%20function%20in%20sensitization%20of,modulates%20Piezo1%20channel%20activity%20via)). Together, these features define STOML3 as a **membrane scaffolding or adapter protein** that organizes mechanotransduction complexes.

# Mechanosensory Function and Ion Channel Modulation

**Primary Role in Mechanotransduction:** The principal function of STOML3 is to enable and modulate **mechanotransduction** – the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals in sensory cells. STOML3 is not an enzyme or ion channel itself; rather, it serves as a **critical accessory subunit** of mechanosensory protein complexes ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=protein%203%20,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). In touch receptors, STOML3 is required for the normal function of mechanosensitive ion channels that respond to pressure or touch. Notably, mice lacking STOML3 have profound deficits in touch sensation: approximately **35% of cutaneous mechanoreceptive neurons completely lose their response to mechanical stimuli** in STOML3 mutants ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Electrophysiological recordings show that many mechanogated ion currents in sensory neurons are **abolished without STOML3** ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Accordingly, tactile-driven behaviors are impaired in Stoml3-knockout mice – for example, mutant mice show reduced responses to gentle touch and even a loss of touch-evoked pain (tactile allodynia) after nerve injury ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=protein%203%20,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). These findings established STOML3 as an **indispensable component of the mechanotransducer apparatus** in a subset of touch receptors ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=in%20many%20sensory%20neurons%20do,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)).

**Ion Channel Interactions:** At the molecular level, STOML3 interacts with multiple ion channels involved in mechanosensation: most prominently the **Piezo family** of stretch-activated cation channels, and **acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs)** in nociceptive neurons. STOML3 co-localizes with **Piezo1 and Piezo2** channels in mechanosensitive cells and **enhances their sensitivity** to mechanical force ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Sensing%20force%20is%20crucial%20to,required%20to%20maintain%20membrane%20mechanics)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Piezo2%2BSTOML3%2BM%CE%B2CD%3A%20n%3D5%2C%20Piezo2%2BSTOML3,0.0001.%20Error%20bars%20indicate%20s.e.m)). In heterologous cell experiments, co-expression of STOML3 lowers the threshold for Piezo1/2 activation and increases the mechanically evoked currents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=unknown%2C%20Piezo%20channels%20have%20been,We%20therefore%20first)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=its%20function%20in%20sensitization%20of,modulates%20Piezo1%20channel%20activity%20via)). This effect depends on STOML3’s cholesterol-binding function – cholesterol depletion or mutating STOML3’s cholesterol-interaction site (P40S) prevents STOML3 from potentiating Piezo currents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20its%20function,modulates%20Piezo1%20channel%20activity%20via)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=its%20function%20in%20sensitization%20of,modulates%20Piezo1%20channel%20activity%20via)). Mechanistically, STOML3 is thought to **facilitate force transfer to Piezo channels** by creating a stiffer lipid microenvironment around the channel, effectively tuning the channel’s gating kinetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Piezo2%2BSTOML3%2BM%CE%B2CD%3A%20n%3D5%2C%20Piezo2%2BSTOML3,0.0001.%20Error%20bars%20indicate%20s.e.m)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=currents%20%28Fig,to%20the%20cellular%20toxicity%20of)). In vivo, deleting STOML3 or acutely disrupting its cholesterol associations both cause a similar reduction in mechanosensory current amplitude, supporting this model ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=membrane%20mechanics%20by%20binding%20cholesterol,Targeting)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=fails%20to%20increase%20the%20mechanosensitivity,agent%2C%20in%20C57BL%2F6N%20but%20not)). Consistent with its role, *in vitro* studies found STOML3 enriched at the site of Piezo2-containing mechanotransducer complexes in touch receptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=membrane%20mechanics%20by%20binding%20cholesterol,Targeting)), and *in vivo* **cholesterol depletion blunts touch sensitivity in wild-type mice but not in Stoml3-knockout mice** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=STOML3%20is%20detected%20in%20cholesterol,offer%20an%20alternative%20strategy%20for)) (implying STOML3 is required for cholesterol-dependent modulation of touch).

Beyond Piezo channels, STOML3 (and its relative stomatin) also **physically associate with ASIC channels** in sensory neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=match%20at%20L88%20Both%20STOML3,2012)). ASICs are proton-gated cation channels implicated in certain mechanosensory and pain pathways. STOML3 was shown to bind ASIC subunits and **alter their gating properties**: it can suppress the peak amplitude of ASIC currents and slow their inactivation kinetics in recombinant systems ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=match%20at%20L88%20Both%20STOML3,2012)). All three proteins – STOML3, stomatin (STOM), and ASIC – can form complexes, and genetically removing these components leads to overlapping deficits in mechanonociception ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Both%20STOML3%20and%20stomatin%20can,2012)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=asic3,mechanosensitivity%20of%20nociceptors%20in%20the)). For example, knockout of *Stoml3* or *Asic3* individually each causes partial loss of certain pain-sensing mechanoreceptors, but combined *Asic3/Stoml3* double-knockout produces an exacerbated loss of mechanosensitivity in Aδ-fiber nociceptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=indicated%20that%20a%20stomatin%2FSTOML3%20interaction,deficits%20in%20the%20mechanosensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Stomatin%20and%20STOML3%20are%20closely,many%20cutaneous%20afferents%2C%20and%20a)). This synergistic phenotype indicates STOML3 and ASIC3 normally **work in concert to tune mechanosensitivity** in those high-threshold mechanonociceptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=indicated%20that%20a%20stomatin%2FSTOML3%20interaction,deficits%20in%20the%20mechanosensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=,and%20ASIC3%2C%20regulate%20mechanosensory%20transduction)). Similarly, STOML3 and stomatin can compensate for each other to some extent, as double-knockouts of *Stoml3* and *Stom* reveal greater deficits than single mutants in certain fibers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=indicated%20that%20a%20stomatin%2FSTOML3%20interaction,deficits%20in%20the%20mechanosensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=ASIC3,thus%20reasoned%20that%20important%20functional)). In summary, STOML3 **interacts with multiple ion channels (Piezo1/2, ASIC2/3, etc.) and modulates their activity**, serving as a scaffold that organizes these channels in membrane microdomains and fine-tunes their gating in response to mechanical stimuli ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=match%20at%20L88%20Both%20STOML3,2012)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=Piezo2%2BSTOML3%2BM%CE%B2CD%3A%20n%3D5%2C%20Piezo2%2BSTOML3,0.0001.%20Error%20bars%20indicate%20s.e.m)).

**Oligomerization and Mechanotransducer Complexes:** An important aspect of STOML3’s function is its ability to form higher-order oligomers. STOML3 molecules can self-associate (likely as dimers and larger oligomeric assemblies), and this oligomerization is functionally significant ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)). The STOML3 oligomers may cluster around mechanosensitive ion channels in the membrane, creating a multimeric complex that optimizes force transmission. **Disrupting STOML3 oligomerization** has been shown to impair mechanotransduction. For instance, a small-molecule inhibitor called **OB-1** prevents STOML3 from oligomerizing and thereby reduces its functional interaction with mechanogated channels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)). In sensory neuron cultures, OB-1 treatment significantly **dampens mechanically activated currents** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,24%E2%80%9317)). Likewise, in ex vivo nerve preparations, OB-1 “silences” many mechanoreceptor fibers – Aβ and Aδ touch fibers lose responsiveness when STOML3 oligomers are blocked ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). These findings support a model where a **STOML3 oligomeric lattice** around ion channels is needed to effectively gate the channel in response to membrane stretch ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). Without the oligomeric scaffold, mechanotransducer channels either fail to open or require much stronger force to activate.

# Biological Roles and Pathways

**Touch and Mechanosensation:** STOML3 is best known for its role in the sense of touch. It is expressed in a subset of **cutaneous mechanoreceptors** – the sensory neurons innervating the skin that detect light touch, pressure, and vibration. These include low-threshold mechanoreceptors associated with gentle touch (like Merkel cell–neurite complexes and hair follicle receptors) as well as some mechanosensitive nociceptors for painful pressure ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Stomatin%20and%20STOML3%20are%20closely,many%20cutaneous%20afferents%2C%20and%20a)). In normal animals, mechanical stimuli at the skin surface activate mechanotransducer channels in the nerve endings, leading to depolarization and action potentials. STOML3 is a **critical component of this transduction machinery**: in *Stoml3*-mutant mice, many skin mechanoreceptors cannot convert mechanical stimuli into neural signals ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Approximately one-third of myelinated mechanoreceptive fibers in the skin have **no mechanosensitive response without STOML3** ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=stomatin%20homology%20domain,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)), indicating those receptors’ transducer channels absolutely require STOML3. Consequently, STOML3-deficient mice show behavioral deficits in touch perception, such as reduced responsiveness to light touch and impaired tactile acuity ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=protein%203%20,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). Even certain forms of mechanically evoked pain (like pain from gentle touch after nerve injury) are absent in these mutants, suggesting those pathological touch-pain signals (tactile allodynia) depend on STOML3-mediated mechanotransduction ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=protein%203%20,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)). In contrast, other sensory modalities (e.g. responses to heat or noxious chemical pain) are largely intact in *Stoml3* knockouts, underscoring that STOML3 is selectively required for mechanosensory pathways ([scholars.mssm.edu](https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/publications/a-stomatin-domain-protein-essential-for-touch-sensation-in-the-mo-2#:~:text=protein%203%20,subunit%20of%20a%20mammalian%20mechanotransducer)).

It is noteworthy that **not all sensory fibers rely equally on STOML3**. Research has uncovered fiber-type specificity in STOML3’s contribution. Myelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (Aβ fibers) and certain thin myelinated nociceptors (Aδ fibers) critically depend on STOML3, whereas many unmyelinated C-fiber nociceptors do not ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Lapatsina%20et%20al,order%20to%20ask%20whether%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=%28b%29%20application%20of%20OB,Reduced%20activity%20was%20observed)). Initial studies found **C-fiber mechanonociceptors retained normal mechanosensitivity in Stoml3-knockout mice** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Lapatsina%20et%20al,order%20to%20ask%20whether%20the)), even though A-fiber mechanoreceptors were severely affected. Recent work in a bone pain model similarly showed that blocking STOML3 function with OB-1 strongly reduced the firing of Aδ mechanosensitive afferents, **without significantly altering C-fiber responses** to mechanical stimuli ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=%28b%29%20application%20of%20OB,Reduced%20activity%20was%20observed)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=match%20at%20L282%20OB,0.05)). These observations suggest that STOML3 is an essential transduction component for **fast-conducting mechanoreceptors** (responsible for acute touch and pressure detection), while **C-fiber mediated mechanosensation** (such as certain dull pressure pain or mechanical inflammation responses) may use alternative molecular mechanisms that do not involve STOML3 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Lapatsina%20et%20al,order%20to%20ask%20whether%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=match%20at%20L259%20neurons%20recorded,1)). This fiber-specific role is an active area of research, as it hints that different mechanotransduction complexes operate in different classes of sensory neurons.

**Proprioception:** Beyond cutaneous touch, STOML3 has been implicated in **proprioceptive mechanotransduction** – the sensing of body position and muscle force. Proprioceptive neurons (muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ afferents) are also mechanosensors, and they express many of the same transduction molecules as cutaneous touch receptors. A recent study by Haseleu *et al.* (2025) demonstrated that STOML3 is **required for the functional plasticity of proprioceptors** after nerve injury ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=skin%20previously%20occupied%20by%20the,The%20dramatic)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=were%20largely%20identical%20to%20normal,factor%20required%20for%20functional%20plasticity)). In an experimental nerve cross-reinnervation, muscle proprioceptive neurons were surgically redirected to innervate skin (a context where they normally would form touch receptors). In wild-type mice, the redirected muscle afferents were able to form functioning skin mechanoreceptors and responded to cutaneous touch, effectively adopting a cutaneous mechanosensory phenotype ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=that%20even%20muscle%20afferents%20directed,However%2C%20in%20mice)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=skin%20previously%20occupied%20by%20the,The%20dramatic)). However, in *Stoml3*-knockout mice, these proprioceptive neurons **failed to acquire mechanosensitivity** in the skin – even though they established anatomically normal nerve endings, they could not transduce mechanical stimuli ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=were%20largely%20identical%20to%20normal,factor%20required%20for%20functional%20plasticity)). The STOML3-deficient muscle afferents remained largely **silent to mechanical stimulation**, indicating that STOML3 is necessary for them to become functional mechanoreceptors ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=were%20largely%20identical%20to%20normal,factor%20required%20for%20functional%20plasticity)). Interestingly, the lack of mechanotransduction did not prevent those neurons from establishing correct central synaptic connections, suggesting STOML3’s role is specifically in the transduction machinery rather than guiding innervation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=mechanosensitive%20receptive%20fields%2C%20despite%20making,plasticity%20following%20peripheral%20nerve%20injury)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40163784/#:~:text=from%20both%20wild,factor%20required%20for%20functional%20plasticity)). This finding highlights STOML3 as a fundamental **“molecular switch” for mechanosensitivity** – sensory neurons require STOML3 to assemble or operate the mechanotransducer complexes that make them responsive to physical force. Without STOML3, even neurons capable of morphologically adapting to a new target cannot gain mechanosensory function, underscoring how crucial STOML3 is for mechanotransduction across different sensory modalities.

**Olfactory Sensory Modulation:** While STOML3 is primarily studied in touch and proprioception, emerging evidence suggests it also contributes to **olfactory sensory function**. STOML3 is robustly expressed in the **cilia of olfactory sensory neurons**, the site of odorant signal transduction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7986538/#:~:text=Stomatin,be%20involved%20in%20modulating%20odorant)). These olfactory cilia contain the molecular machinery (odorant receptors, G-proteins, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, etc.) that initiates smell signals. The presence of STOML3 in this compartment raised the question of whether it influences olfactory signal transduction. In 2021, Agostinelli *et al.* investigated olfaction in *Stoml3* knockout mice and found that **olfactory neurons require STOML3 for normal sensory encoding** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7986538/#:~:text=responses%20in%20OSNs,a%20physiological%20role%20in%20olfaction)) ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=cilia%20of%20olfactory%20sensory%20neurons,peripheral%20coding%20of%20sensory%20stimuli)). Single-cell recordings from olfactory neurons showed that *Stoml3* KO cells have **abnormally low spontaneous firing activity** and altered inter-spike interval patterns compared to wild-type ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7986538/#:~:text=responses%20in%20OSNs,a%20physiological%20role%20in%20olfaction)) ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=and%20Stoml3%20KO%20olfactory%20sensory,Significance%20Statement%20Olfactory%20transduction)). Moreover, when stimulated with odorants, STOML3-deficient OSNs produced **significantly fewer action potentials and shorter-lasting responses** than normal neurons ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=and%20Stoml3%20KO%20olfactory%20sensory,that%20take%20place%20in%20the)) ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=by%20olfactory%20sensory%20neurons,both%20the%20number%20of%20spikes)). Importantly, the primary odor transduction current (receptor potential) appeared to be attenuated in the knockouts, rather than there being a general inability to fire action potentials ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=and%20Stoml3%20KO%20olfactory%20sensory,that%20take%20place%20in%20the)) ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=possible%20frequency%20range%20of%20their,peripheral%20coding%20of%20sensory%20stimuli)). This points to a **deficit at the transduction level** – consistent with STOML3 acting near the sensory transduction complex in olfactory cilia. The effect of STOML3 in OSNs seems to be a **modulatory one**: it helps set the baseline excitability (spontaneous firing rate) and allows OSNs to sustain and broaden their firing responses to odor stimuli ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=cilia%20of%20olfactory%20sensory%20neurons,peripheral%20coding%20of%20sensory%20stimuli)). In practical terms, STOML3 enables olfactory neurons to encode odor information with a greater dynamic range of spike frequency and duration ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=cilia%20of%20olfactory%20sensory%20neurons,peripheral%20coding%20of%20sensory%20stimuli)). These findings introduce STOML3 as a **novel player in olfactory signal transduction**, suggesting that even in non-mechanosensory systems, STOML3’s scaffolding role in ciliary membranes can influence sensory signaling. It is an open question whether STOML3 modulates the gating of specific ciliary ion channels (such as the cyclic-nucleotide gated channel or Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel in OSNs) or perhaps affects the mechanical environment of the cilium during the rapid fluid movements of sniffing. Nonetheless, the **physiological role of STOML3 in olfaction** is now evident: it is required for maintaining normal sensitivity and response patterns in smell receptors ([www.pharm.ox.ac.uk](https://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1166353#:~:text=cilia%20of%20olfactory%20sensory%20neurons,peripheral%20coding%20of%20sensory%20stimuli)).

# Recent Advances and Therapeutic Implications

Given STOML3’s central role in mechanosensory function, it has attracted interest as a **therapeutic target**, particularly for treating neuropathic pain and other disorders of touch sensitivity. Mechanical pain (such as allodynia and hyperalgesia) is a major feature of many chronic pain conditions, and research suggests that aberrant STOML3-dependent mechanotransduction contributes to these symptoms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). For example, in models of diabetic neuropathy and nerve injury, animals exhibit exaggerated mechanosensitivity (touch becomes painful), but **pharmacologically blocking STOML3 function can reverse this mechanical hypersensitivity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). Small-molecule inhibitors of STOML3 have been developed to probe this effect. Notably, a compound named **OB-1** was identified in a screen of ~35,000 molecules for inhibitors of mechanotransduction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=Small%20molecules%20that%20interact%20with,21%20%7D%20silences)). OB-1 binds to STOML3 and selectively **disrupts STOML3 oligomerization** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=screening%20unit,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,It%20reduces%20the%20sensitivity%20of)). By doing so, it functionally “knocks down” STOML3’s ability to support mechanogated ion channels. In vitro, OB-1 markedly reduces the amplitude of mechanically activated currents in DRG neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). In ex vivo nerve recordings, OB-1 application silences the firing of touch-sensitive Aβ and Aδ fibers without affecting unrelated electrical excitability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). Most importantly, OB-1 has shown efficacy in vivo: **in animal models of pain, OB-1 alleviates mechanical pain behaviors** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=inhibition%20of%20STOML3%20oligomerisation%20with,bone%20pain%20by%20reducing%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=inhibition%20of%20STOML3%20oligomerisation%20with,bone%20pain%20by%20reducing%20the)). For instance, in a rat model of inflammatory bone pain, local injection of OB-1 led to increased weight-bearing on the injured limb, indicating pain relief due to reduced noxious mechanical input from bone afferents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=inhibition%20of%20STOML3%20oligomerisation%20with,bone%20pain%20by%20reducing%20the)). Similarly, in mouse models of neuropathy (diabetic neuropathy and chronic nerve constriction injury), systemic OB-1 treatment reversed mechanical allodynia, bringing pain sensitivity back toward normal levels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). These outcomes demonstrate that **targeting STOML3-mediated mechanotransduction can modulate touch and pain perception** in vivo, validating STOML3 as a promising analgesic target.

Importantly, STOML3 inhibitors achieve pain relief by **modulating the mechanosensory apparatus upstream of nerve firing**, rather than by blocking neurotransmission or general excitability. This might offer a selective way to dampen pathological touch and pain (for example, reducing painful tactile sensations) without completely numbing all sensation. Indeed, because C-fiber pain pathways (e.g. for heat pain or certain internal pains) do not rely on STOML3 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3853495/#:~:text=Lapatsina%20et%20al,order%20to%20ask%20whether%20the)), a STOML3 blocker might specifically reduce mechanical pain (like pressure-induced pain or allodynia) while sparing other sensory modalities. The specificity of OB-1’s action is also indicated by its lack of direct effect on unrelated ion channels: for example, OB-1 does not block proton-gated ASIC currents directly and does not mimic general anesthetics ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11384071B2/en#:~:text=US11384071B2%20,%28b%29%20Stomatin%20inhibits)). Its action is confined to interfering with the STOML3 scaffold, which in turn silences mechanotransduction at the sensory nerve endings ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). This mode of action has led researchers to propose STOML3-based strategies as novel treatments for conditions involving abnormal touch or pain sensitivity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=STOML3%20is%20detected%20in%20cholesterol,offer%20an%20alternative%20strategy%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)). A 2015 study suggested that **disrupting the STOML3–cholesterol interaction** could be one such strategy, effectively “softening” the membrane microdomains and raising the threshold for mechanoreceptor activation as a way to reduce pain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=STOML3%20is%20detected%20in%20cholesterol,offer%20an%20alternative%20strategy%20for)). The subsequent development of oligomerization inhibitors like OB-1 aligns with this idea by functionally removing the STOML3 scaffold and thus desensitizing mechanoreceptors. As of 2023–2024, **patent applications and preclinical research** have been detailing STOML3 inhibitors for pain therapy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11384071B2/en#:~:text=US11384071B2%20,%28b%29%20Stomatin%20inhibits)), and ongoing studies continue to explore STOML3’s role in touch disorders (e.g. tactile allodynia in neuropathic pain, or even hypersensitivity in autism or other conditions affecting touch perception).

In summary, **STOML3 is a pivotal mechanotransduction protein** with a well-established role in touch, pressure, and pain sensation. It acts as a membrane-bound adapter that links mechanical forces to ion channel activation, by shaping the lipid–protein microenvironment of mechanosensory complexes. Its presence is required at the cellular level (nerve endings and sensory cilia) for normal mechanosensitive currents, and at the organism level for normal tactile behaviors. Recent research (2021–2024) has expanded our understanding of STOML3’s function – revealing its contributions to olfactory signaling and to sensory neuron plasticity – and has highlighted its potential as a target for modulating touch and pain in disease. Going forward, **the continued study of STOML3** offers both fundamental insights into how cells sense mechanical stimuli and a pathway to therapeutic innovations for pain and sensory disorders ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633829/#:~:text=STOML3%20is%20detected%20in%20cholesterol,offer%20an%20alternative%20strategy%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10734363/#:~:text=characteristic%20that%20is%20important%20for,15%20%E2%80%93%2019)).
