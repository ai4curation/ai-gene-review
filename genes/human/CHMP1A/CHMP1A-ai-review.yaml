description: >-
  CHMP1A (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 1A) is a member of the SNF7 family and
  a core subunit of the
  ESCRT-III complex. CHMP1A functions as a membrane-remodeling protein that mediates
  topologically equivalent
  membrane fission events at multiple cellular sites. Its primary roles include: (1)
  MVB/ILV biogenesis
  at endosomes where it contributes to receptor downregulation and cargo sorting;
  (2) cytokinetic abscission
  at the midbody during the final stages of cell division; (3) nuclear envelope reformation
  following
  mitosis; (4) plasma membrane repair; and (5) autophagosome maturation. CHMP1A self-associates
  and interacts
  with VPS4A/B ATPases for polymer disassembly, and with other ESCRT-III subunits
  including CHMP1B and IST1.
  The protein also has a nuclear function related to chromatin condensation through
  interaction with the
  Polycomb group protein BMI1. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CHMP1A cause
  pontocerebellar hypoplasia
  type 8 (PCH8), linking defective MVB/extracellular vesicle biogenesis to neurodevelopmental
  pathology.
