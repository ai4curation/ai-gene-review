## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P19438
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A; AltName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; Short=TNF-R1; AltName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor receptor type I; Short=TNF-RI; Short=TNFR-I; AltName: Full=p55; AltName: Full=p60; AltName: CD_antigen=CD120a; Contains: RecName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A, membrane form; Contains: RecName: Full=Tumor necrosis factor-binding protein 1; Short=TBPI; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=TNFRSF1A; Synonyms=TNFAR, TNFR1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** DEATH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011029); Death_dom. (IPR000488); TNFR/NGFR_Cys_rich_reg. (IPR001368); TNFR_1A. (IPR020419); TNFRSF1A. (IPR052493)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TNFRSF1A" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TNFRSF1A' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TNFRSF1A** (gene ID: TNFRSF1A, UniProt: P19438) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update
- Identity verified: TNFRSF1A (TNFR1/CD120a), UniProt P19438, human. Literature consistently describes a type I transmembrane receptor with extracellular cysteine‑rich domains (CRDs) that include a pre‑ligand assembly domain (PLAD), and a cytoplasmic death domain (DD), matching the UniProt context (Nov 2023 review; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837; and Jan 2024 review; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2, yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).

Comprehensive research report: TNFRSF1A (TNFR1) functional annotation

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity, structure, and localization: TNFRSF1A encodes TNFR1 (CD120a/p55), a ubiquitously expressed type I transmembrane receptor of the TNF receptor superfamily. Its extracellular region comprises multiple cysteine‑rich domains (CRDs) that mediate ligand binding and receptor organization; a pre‑ligand assembly domain (PLAD) within CRD1 promotes preassembly/clustering. The intracellular tail contains a death domain (DD) that nucleates adaptor binding. TNFR1 resides at the plasma membrane and is also released as a soluble ectodomain (sTNFR1) by sheddase cleavage, modulating ligand availability and signaling (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837; Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4; Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2, yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4, salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).
- Ligand forms and receptor preference: TNF is produced as a 26‑kDa transmembrane trimer that is cleaved by ADAM17/TACE to a 17‑kDa soluble trimer. Both forms bind TNFR1; soluble TNF preferentially activates TNFR1, whereas transmembrane TNF more strongly engages TNFR2 (Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6; Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10, yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
- Shedding: ADAM17/TACE mediates ectodomain shedding of both TNF and TNFR1, producing sTNF and sTNFR1, respectively; this is a key regulatory checkpoint for TNF/TNFR signaling (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4; Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4, salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).

Mechanistic signaling: current understanding and 2023–2024 updates
- Complex I (membrane‑proximal pro‑survival/inflammatory signaling): TNF binding allows the TNFR1 DD to recruit TRADD, which scaffolds RIPK1, TRAF2/5, and cIAP1/2. K63/linear ubiquitination of RIPK1 by cIAP1/2 and LUBAC drives canonical NF‑κB and MAPK activation, inducing inflammatory and survival gene expression (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4; Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4, salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).
- Death‑inducing assemblies (Complex II and necrosome): When RIPK1 ubiquitination/survival signaling fails, components dissociate from the receptor to form cytosolic complexes. Complex IIa/IIb recruits FADD and caspase‑8 (with cFLIP as a rheostat) to trigger extrinsic apoptosis; alternatively, in contexts of caspase‑8 inhibition/insufficiency, RIPK1 engages RIPK3 to phosphorylate MLKL, assembling the necrosome and executing necroptosis. Recent reviews underscore RIPK1 as the switch controlling outcomes downstream of TNFR1 (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837; Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2, yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
- Receptor cross‑talk and context dependence (updated insights): TNFR2 and Fn14 can sequester TRAF2 with cIAP1/2, limiting their availability for TNFR1 and thereby tuning TNFR1 outcomes from NF‑κB activation to apoptosis/necroptosis; this cross‑regulation is highlighted in 2023 analyses and refines understanding of cell‑type/context‑specific TNF responses (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2).

Current applications and clinical relevance
- Anti‑TNF therapeutics and infectious risk: Systemic TNF blockade is widely used in inflammatory diseases but is associated with increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation; human/animal data underscore TNF/TNFR1’s importance in granuloma maintenance and host defense (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
- Differential targeting of TNF forms/receptors: Established pharmacology indicates soluble TNF preferentially signals via TNFR1, while membrane TNF favors TNFR2; this underpins interest in therapeutic strategies that spare TNFR2 or selectively temper TNFR1 to preserve homeostatic TNF functions (Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).

Human genetics and disease associations (with recent data)
- TNFRSF1A variants and TRAPS: Heterozygous pathogenic TNFRSF1A variants cause TNF receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease. Many pathogenic variants affect conserved extracellular cysteines, disrupting disulfide bonds, promoting misfolding/ER retention, unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, and aberrant signaling. A 2024 family carrying p.C125Y showed conservation at the site, modeling consistent with disulfide loss, normal shedding in stimulated monocytes, but increased UPR markers (CHOP, spliced XBP1), supporting misfolding/UPR pathogenesis. Clinically, TRAPS features recurrent fevers with elevated acute‑phase reactants; the most serious complication is AA amyloidosis. Reported median age at onset is 4.3 years (Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2024.1413641) (qian2024araremissense pages 2-4, qian2024araremissense pages 9-9).
- Variant interpretation nuances: Not all TNFRSF1A variants are fully penetrant or equally pathogenic; genotype–phenotype correlations and careful curation (including population frequency, conservation, and functional readouts) are required to distinguish TRAPS‑causing alleles from variants of uncertain significance (Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2024.1413641) (qian2024araremissense pages 2-4).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Refined domain/function mapping and cross‑talk: 2023 analyses consolidate the role of the PLAD in preassembly and clarify that TNFR1, unlike Fas/DR4/DR5, signals to apoptosis/necrosis via cytosolic complexes formed after initial membrane signaling, with TRAF2/cIAP1/2 availability (influenced by TNFR2/Fn14) as an important determinant (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2).
- Sheddase biology in immunity and infection: Contemporary work emphasizes ADAM17/TACE as a key modulator of TNF/TNFR1 availability and signaling tone across tissues, including in infection and mucosal biology contexts, aligning with observed differences between soluble vs membrane TNF activities (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4; Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4, salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative immunology/rheumatology reviews converge on a consensus model: TNFR1 is the principal conduit for soluble TNF signals driving inflammation; its Complex I signaling depends on ubiquitin scaffolding at RIPK1, with a licensed switch to apoptosis/necroptosis governed largely by caspase‑8/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL. Targeted modulation that preserves beneficial tmTNF/TNFR2 interactions while restraining excessive TNFR1 signaling is frequently proposed as a therapeutic ideal (Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6; Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10, yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
- Cross‑receptor regulation matters: 2023 analyses highlight how TNFR2 and Fn14 engagement can deplete TRAF2/cIAP pools, shifting TNFR1 outputs; this systems‑level view may explain variable clinical responses and informs combinatorial or receptor‑biased strategies (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- TRAPS epidemiology/phenotype: Median age at TRAPS onset reported as 4.3 years; laboratory activity includes elevations of acute‑phase reactants, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis during febrile episodes; AA amyloidosis is the major long‑term risk (Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2024.1413641) (qian2024araremissense pages 2-4, qian2024araremissense pages 9-9).
- Infectious risk under anti‑TNF: Clinical/translational evidence indicates increased TB reactivation risk with systemic anti‑TNF therapy, consistent with essential roles of TNF/TNFR1 in granuloma integrity in humans and animal models (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).

Primary function and pathway role
- TNFR1 is a signaling receptor (not an enzyme or transporter). At the cell surface, trimeric TNF engagement of preassembled/clustered TNFR1 trimers initiates Complex I, activating canonical NF‑κB and MAPKs to induce inflammatory/survival programs; subsequent cytosolic Complex II or necrosome formation determines apoptotic or necroptotic cell death outcomes. Functionally, TNFR1 integrates inflammatory danger signals with cell‑fate checkpoints, with ADAM17‑mediated shedding and receptor cross‑talk shaping the amplitude and quality of responses (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4; Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837; Jul 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-021-00639-6) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4, siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2, salomon2021insightsintothe pages 7-10).

Mandatory verification steps
- Gene symbol matches protein description: TNFRSF1A encodes TNFR1/CD120a/p55, the prototypic death‑domain TNF receptor (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2).
- Organism verified: Evidence summarized here is human‑focused and consistent with Homo sapiens TNFR1 biology (Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e4) (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
- Domains/family alignment: CRDs (including PLAD), transmembrane region, and intracellular DD, ascribed to a TNFRSF member, align with UniProt’s domain annotations (Nov 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1267837) (siegmund2023fn14andtnfr2 pages 1-2).

Notes on scope and open items
- TNFR1‑selective antagonist strategies (e.g., receptor‑biased or dominant‑negative TNF variants) are under investigation, but up‑to‑date clinical trial specifics were not captured within the evidence set curated here. The report therefore emphasizes well‑supported mechanistic and genetic data and established clinical insights (anti‑TNF and infection risk) from 2023–2024 sources (yuk2024tnfinhuman pages 2-4).
