description: >-
  TNFRSF1A (also known as TNFR1, p55, CD120a) encodes Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor
  Superfamily Member 1A, a ubiquitously expressed type I transmembrane receptor that
  serves as the principal signaling receptor for soluble TNF (TNFSF2) and lymphotoxin-alpha
  (TNFSF1/LTA). The extracellular domain contains four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs),
  including a pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD) in CRD1 that mediates ligand-independent
  receptor preassembly as homotrimers. The intracellular domain contains a death domain
  (DD) that nucleates adaptor recruitment. Upon TNF binding, the DD recruits TRADD, which
  scaffolds two distinct signaling outcomes. Complex I (membrane-proximal) comprises
  TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF2/5, cIAP1/2, and LUBAC, leading to K63/linear ubiquitination of
  RIPK1 and activation of canonical NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways that promote inflammatory
  gene expression and cell survival. When Complex I pro-survival signaling fails (e.g.,
  loss of cIAP or LUBAC activity), a cytosolic Complex II forms containing TRADD, FADD,
  and caspase-8, which triggers extrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions of caspase-8
  inhibition, RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL assemble the necrosome to execute necroptosis. TNFR1
  ectodomain is shed by ADAM17/TACE to generate soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1), which acts as
  a decoy receptor. The receptor also activates neutral and acid sphingomyelinases via
  its NSD and DD domains, respectively. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the
  extracellular cysteine-rich domains cause TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic
  syndrome), an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease. An intronic variant affecting
  alternative splicing of exon 6 produces a soluble isoform (Delta6-TNFR1) associated
  with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro domain IPR020419 (TNFR_1A). While TNF signaling via TNFR1 can
      indirectly influence prostaglandin metabolism through NF-kappaB-mediated induction of COX-2,
      TNFR1 does not directly participate in prostaglandin metabolism. This is a downstream pleiotropic
      effect of TNF signaling.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The link between TNFR1 and prostaglandin metabolism is indirect and downstream. TNF/TNFR1 signaling
      can activate NF-kappaB, which induces COX-2 expression, leading to prostaglandin production. However,
      annotating TNFR1 directly to prostaglandin metabolic process overstates its involvement. TNFR1 does
      not catalyze or directly regulate prostaglandin synthesis. MADD (which binds TNFR1) was shown to
      activate ERK and phospholipase A2, providing a link to arachidonic acid release, but this is still

      apoptotic signaling pathway via death domain receptors) is already annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the more specific death-domain-mediated extrinsic apoptosis term is also annotated, this

      Regulation of gene expression is an extremely broad term. While TNFR1 does activate NF-kappaB
      which is a transcription factor, annotating the receptor itself to "regulation of gene expression"
      is too distant from the receptor's direct molecular role. The annotation chain is receptor ->

  review:
    summary: >-
      TNFR1-mediated signaling is the best-characterized inducer of necroptosis. When
      caspase-8 is inhibited, RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL assemble a necrosome downstream of TNFR1
      Complex II, executing programmed necrotic cell death. This is a core signaling outcome
      of TNFR1 activation under specific conditions (PMID:12887920).
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Necroptosis is a well-established signaling outcome downstream of TNFR1, particularly
      when caspase-8 is inhibited. The GO definition of GO:0070266 explicitly references
      death domain receptor signaling and RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL dependence. This is missing from
      the existing annotation set and represents a core function of the receptor under
      specific signaling contexts.

      Many diverse activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are signaled through TNF

    When Complex I pro-survival signaling fails (e.g., loss of cIAP or LUBAC activity),
    TRADD and RIPK1 dissociate from the receptor to form cytosolic Complex II with FADD

      A second complex (complex II) is formed after TRADD and RIP1 associate with FADD
      and caspase-8, and the modified RIP1 in complex II keeps caspase-8 in an inactive
      state. When NF-kappa B is activated by complex I, expression of antiapoptotic
      genes are activated, which are sufficient to block the pro-apoptotic activity of
      complex II.

      A FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor
      of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these
      two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.
