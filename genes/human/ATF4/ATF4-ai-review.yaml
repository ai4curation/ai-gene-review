description: ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4) is a bZIP transcription factor
  that serves as the central effector of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Under
  basal conditions, ATF4 translation is suppressed by upstream open reading frames
  (uORFs) in its 5'UTR. Upon cellular stress (ER stress, amino acid deprivation, oxidative
  stress, mitochondrial stress), phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by stress-sensing kinases
  (PERK, GCN2, HRI, PKR) leads to preferential translation of ATF4. In the nucleus,
  ATF4 heterodimerizes with other bZIP transcription factors (CHOP/DDIT3, C/EBP family
  members, CREB, ATF3) via its leucine zipper domain and binds to cAMP response elements
  (CRE) and C/EBP-ATF response elements (CARE/AARE) to activate transcription of stress-responsive
  genes involved in amino acid metabolism (ASNS, SLC7A11), redox homeostasis, autophagy,
  and apoptosis. ATF4 also plays non-stress roles in osteoblast differentiation and
  bone development.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: ATF4 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds to CRE and CARE/AARE sequences
      in promoters to regulate transcription. This molecular function annotation is
      appropriate and consistent with its well-established role as a sequence-specific
      DNA-binding transcription factor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: ATF4's binding to specific regulatory sequences (CRE, CARE/AARE) is extensively
      documented and represents a core molecular function (PMID:12871976, PMID:11960987).

  review:
    summary: ATF4 functions predominantly as a transcriptional activator for stress-responsive
      genes including ASNS, GRP78/BiP, CHOP, and TRB3. This annotation accurately
      reflects its primary molecular function.

  description: ATF4 is a bZIP transcription factor that serves as the central effector
    of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). ATF4 binds to cAMP response elements
    (CRE) and C/EBP-ATF response elements (CARE/AARE) as homo- or heterodimers to
    activate transcription of stress-responsive genes. Key targets include amino acid
    metabolism genes (ASNS, PSAT1, PHGDH), amino acid transporters (SLC7A11/xCT, SLC1A5),
    autophagy genes (MAP1LC3B, BECN1, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12), ER chaperones (GRP78/BiP),
    and transcription factors (CHOP/DDIT3, ATF3). ATF4 translation is uniquely controlled
    by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that enable preferential translation when
    eIF2alpha is phosphorylated by stress-sensing kinases (PERK, GCN2, PKR, HRI).
    ATF4 also cooperates with NRF2 as an obligatory metabolic activator of the antioxidant
    response (PMID:37410595). Neill and Masson (PMID:36825279) catalogued 41 well-validated
    ATF4 target genes.

  description: ATF4 forms heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors via its
    leucine zipper domain, including CHOP/DDIT3, C/EBP family members (CEBPB, CEBPG),
    CREB1, ATF1, ATF3, and other bZIP partners. The choice of dimerization partner
    determines target gene specificity and whether the outcome is adaptive or pro-apoptotic.
    Neill and Masson (PMID:36825279) catalogued 14 direct dimerization partners for
    ATF4.

suggested_questions:
- question: What determines whether ATF4 promotes cell survival (adaptive ISR) versus
    cell death (terminal UPR/apoptosis)?
- question: How do different bZIP dimerization partners affect ATF4 target gene specificity?
- question: What is the significance of ATF4 localization to the centrosome and its
    interaction with NEK6?
suggested_experiments:
- description: ChIP-seq comparing ATF4 chromatin binding with different stress conditions
    (ER stress vs amino acid starvation vs mitochondrial stress) to define stress-specific
    target genes

    adaptive targets from late pro-apoptotic targets
  hypothesis: Temporal dynamics of ATF4 activity determines cell fate
- description: CRISPR screens to identify ATF4-dependent genes essential for survival
    during different stress conditions
  hypothesis: Specific ATF4 target genes are required for stress adaptation
