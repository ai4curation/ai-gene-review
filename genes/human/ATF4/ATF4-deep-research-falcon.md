- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bZIP family. .
- **Key Domains:** bZIP. (IPR004827); bZIP_sf. (IPR046347); bZIP_1 (PF00170)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATF4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATF4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Research plan and verification
- Identity check: The protein of interest is human ATF4 (UniProt P18848), a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor historically known as CREB-2/CREB2. It belongs to the bZIP family (IPR004827; PF00170) and functions predominantly as a nuclear DNA-binding factor. This aligns with the integrated stress response (ISR) effector ATF4 extensively described in the human literature.
- Organism: Homo sapiens (Human) is correct.
- Family/domains: bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization domain, consistent with ATF4’s requirement to homo- or heterodimerize with other bZIP factors (e.g., C/EBP family, CHOP/DDIT3, ATF3) to regulate transcription.

Executive summary
ATF4 is the principal transcriptional effector of the ISR that is preferentially translated when eIF2α is phosphorylated by the stress-sensing kinases PERK, GCN2, HRI, or PKR. In the nucleus, ATF4 dimerizes via its bZIP domain and binds C/EBP–ATF response elements (CARE/AARE) to control genes in amino-acid transport and biosynthesis (e.g., ASNS, SLC7A11/Slc7a11), redox balance (SESN2, ATF5, CHAC1), autophagy/mitophagy (BNIP3), proteostasis (DDIT3/CHOP), and metabolic rewiring (REDD1/DPHL4, SESN2), thereby determining adaptive survival or, under chronic stress, pro-death outcomes. Beyond canonical translation control by uORFs in the ATF4 5′UTR, emerging work in 2023–2024 refined ISR–translation coupling (eIF2B allostery; GCN2 paradoxical activation by kinase inhibitors), ATF4’s chromatin engagement and crosstalk with mTORC1 and STING, and disease-directed applications (cardiotoxicity mitigation, oncology metabolism, neurodegeneration trials of ISR modulators).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and domain architecture: ATF4 is a bZIP transcription factor (PF00170) that dimerizes and binds CARE/AARE motifs to activate or repress transcription. It is cytosol-synthesized and primarily nuclear-localized upon stress, with regulated nuclear import/export mediated by importin pathways and interaction partners.
- Core pathway: Integrated stress response (ISR)
  • Four eIF2α kinases sense distinct stresses: PERK (ER proteostasis), GCN2 (amino acid/translation stress), HRI (heme/mitochondrial stress, OMA1–DELE1–HRI axis), PKR (viral dsRNA). Phosphorylated eIF2α lowers ternary complex (TC) and global initiation, but increases translation of uORF-programmed mRNAs including ATF4.
  • ATF4 target program: amino-acid transporters and biosynthetic enzymes (e.g., ASNS), redox defense (SLC7A11, SESN2), autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis (BNIP3), apoptosis switch with CHOP (DDIT3), and feedback (GADD34/PPP1R15A) that dephosphorylates eIF2α.
  • Cross-pathway crosstalk: ATF4 interface with mTORC1 (REDD1, SESN2), cGAS–STING–PERK–eIF2α, and lysosome-v-ATPase–mTORC1 signaling that can directly phosphorylate ATF4 (UPRmt context).
- Translation control of ATF4: Two upstream ORFs (uORFs) in the 5′UTR enforce low basal ATF4 translation; p-eIF2α reduces re-initiation at inhibitory uORFs, enabling main ORF translation. Additional modifiers include termination efficiency, eIF3 subunit stoichiometry, and noncanonical initiation factors; the role of eIF2A appears minor in many human contexts.
- Dimerization partners: ATF4 forms homo- or heterodimers (e.g., CHOP/DDIT3, C/EBP family, ATF3), and partner choice, post-translational modifications, and chromatin context help determine adaptive versus apoptotic outputs.

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Allostery at the ISR hub (eIF2B) and pharmacology: Structural and biochemical work in 2023–2024 delineated a central helical fulcrum/switch-helix in eIF2B controlling active/inactive states and the ISRIB pocket mechanism, sharpening how ISRIB-like activators restore eIF2B function and limit ATF4 induction in disease models.
- Paradoxical activation of GCN2 by ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors: Multiple 2024 studies show RAF/BRAF and even nominal GCN2 inhibitors can allosterically activate GCN2, inducing eIF2α-P and ATF4; this off-target ISR activation modulates therapeutic responses, highlighting assay and design needs for true GCN2 inhibitors.
- Mitochondrial ISR signaling refinement: OMA1–DELE1–HRI axis and lysosome–v-ATPase–mTORC1-dependent ATF4 phosphorylation integrate mitochondrial and lysosomal signals, separating UPRmt from UPRER outputs and positioning ATF4 as a convergence node for organelle stress.
- ISR-selective activation reveals metabolic rewiring: Synthetic selective ISR activation shows an ATF4-centered module rerouting carbon toward amino-acid production and away from TCA/lipogenesis, with an ATF4-independent lipid droplet program—refining our map of ISR sufficiency and partitioning of outputs.
- Chromatin and occupancy logic: ATF4’s stress-selective transcription appears conditioned by pre-established occupancy and chromatin organization with partner bZIPs; this supports cell type– and stimulus-specific gene programs.
- Disease-focused advances
  • Cardiotoxicity: GCN2–ATF4 drives ponatinib cardiotoxicity; ISRIB mitigates in cell and mouse models without impairing anti-tumor actions, motivating ISR modulators for safety management.
  • Oncology: ISR–ATF4 supports metabolic plasticity (glutamine axis, uORF-driven oncogene translation such as MET under ISR), ferroptosis control via CHAC1/ATF4, and immunomodulation; context-dependent tumor roles reported (e.g., ccRCC ATF4–NUPR1 axis; colon cancer data indicating both pro- and anti-tumor facets depending on context and GCN2 coupling).
  • Neuroscience: ATF4 represses long-term memory in excitatory neurons; ISR modulators (ISRIB analogs; eIF2B activators) are under investigation for neurodegeneration and ALS, though translational outcomes are mixed.
  • Immunity/virology: Viruses co-opt or suppress ISR; ATF4 mediates antiviral and sometimes proviral programs. ZIKV restriction involves ISR→ATF4→ATF3 innate immune enhancement; EBV LMP1 can inhibit PERK/GCN2 activity, lowering ATF4/CHOP to modulate epithelial differentiation and reactivation.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Small-molecule ISR modulators
  • eIF2B activators (ISRIB and clinical analogs) to dampen ISR/ATF4: preclinical neurodegeneration, ALS, mood disorders, and cardiotoxicity mitigation use-cases.
  • PERK and GCN2 modulators: tool compounds and early clinical exploration; off-target GCN2 activation by many kinase inhibitors is increasingly recognized and may be leveraged or avoided depending on disease context.
  • Emerging strategies: Stabilizers of inhibitory eIF2B–eIF2(αP) complexes (ISR activators) and eIF2B allosteric inhibitors (to upregulate ATF4) in oncology; direct promoter G-quadruplex stabilization of ATF4 to suppress tumor persisters in glutamine restriction.
- Therapeutic areas
  • Oncology: Targeting ISR nodes to sensitize tumors (e.g., WEE1 inhibitor synergy with ISR activation; leveraging GCN2–ATF4 to overcome metabolic vulnerabilities; combining ISR modulators with immunotherapy or ribosome biogenesis inhibitors). Caution: cell-type and context determine whether ATF4 promotes survival or apoptosis.
  • Cardio-oncology: ISR damping (eIF2B activation) counters TKI-induced mitochondrial stress and ATF4 hyperactivation.
  • Neurology: eIF2B activators to normalize translation and reduce maladaptive ATF4 programs; cell-type–specific ATF4 ablation improves memory in mice, encouraging selective targeting.
  • Bone biology/regeneration: PERK–eIF2α–ATF4 axis supports osteoblast lineage differentiation and skeletal anabolism; ATF4 regulates osteogenic targets (e.g., BNIP3-mediated mitophagy, PSAT1, and β-catenin coupling) and systemic metabolism via osteoblasts.

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- ATF4 as a tunable switch: Partner selection (e.g., CHOP vs. C/EBP), PTMs, and chromatin priming bias ATF4 toward adaptive or apoptotic outputs. Short, pulsatile ISR favors adaptive amino-acid/redox gene programs; chronic, high-amplitude ISR favors CHOP, GADD34 and apoptotic genes.
- Precision ISR pharmacology: Recent structural and chemical biology clarify why ISRIB-class eIF2B activators work and why ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors paradoxically activate GCN2. This underlines a precision approach: choose ISR levers (eIF2B, kinases, phosphatases) and timing (acute vs. chronic) to achieve desired ATF4 output.
- Disease-context heterogeneity: ATF4’s role is tissue- and state-specific—pro-survival in nutrient stress, pro-death in persistent ER stress. In cancer, ATF4 can enable metabolic adaptation and drug tolerance, yet excessive ISR can be exploited for synthetic lethality.

5) Relevant statistics and recent data highlights
- Cardiotoxicity model: In human iPSC cardiomyocytes and mouse models exposed to ponatinib, GCN2-mediated ISR activation increased ATF4 and CHOP; ISRIB treatment improved cardiac function readouts and protected cells without blunting anti-tumor activity (preclinical quantitative proteomics and functional assays).
- Selective ISR activation profiling: Time-/dose-resolved multi-omics indicate a compact, sensitive ATF4 transcriptional module predominantly encompassing amino-acid metabolism genes, with measurable bioenergetic rerouting away from TCA/fatty acid synthesis and quantifiable lipid droplet biogenesis via DGAT enzymes (ATF4-independent arm).
- eIF3 remodeling and ATF4 translation: Ribo-seq in HeLa cells upon eIF3 subunit manipulations shows ATF4 uORF-program sensitivity, quantitatively altering ATF4 translation alongside other short-uORF mRNAs.
- Clinical-translational: ISR modulators (e.g., eIF2B activators) are in or have completed early-phase trials in ALS and other indications; multiple kinase inhibitors show measurable ISR/ATF4 activation signatures in cells, explaining efficacy/toxicity dimensions.

Functional annotation: mechanism, substrates/targets, localization, pathways
- Primary function: sequence-specific transcription factor. Not an enzyme, transporter, or structural cytoskeleton component. It binds DNA as a bZIP dimer to regulate transcription of stress-response genes.
- DNA recognition/partnering: Binds CARE/AARE elements; partner choice (CHOP, ATF3, C/EBPβ, others) modulates activation vs repression and gene set selection.
- Subcellular localization: Synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes; accumulates in the nucleus upon stress. Nuclear import is facilitated by importins (e.g., KPNB1), and ATF4 shuttling has been reported in specific contexts with regulated nuclear retention.
- Pathways/context of action
  • ISR: PERK/GCN2/HRI/PKR → eIF2α-P → increased ATF4 translation → transcriptional program (ASNS, SLC7A11, SESN2, GADD34, DDIT3/CHOP, TRIB3, REDD1, ATF5, CHAC1). Feedback: GADD34 dephosphorylates eIF2α.
  • Mitochondrial stress/UPRmt: OMA1–DELE1–HRI axis; lysosome–v-ATPase–mTORC1 phosphorylates ATF4 to promote UPRmt; ATF4 targets support mitochondrial redox and proteostasis.
  • mTORC1 crosstalk: ATF4 targets (REDD1, SESN2) suppress mTORC1; prolonged ATF4 can drive chronic mTOR suppression linked to neurodegeneration models.
  • Immunity/viral stress: ATF4 mediates antiviral and inflammatory programs, intersects with ATF3/CHOP; viruses may suppress or hijack ATF4 signaling.
  • Bone and connective tissue: ATF4 required for osteoblast differentiation and matrix gene expression; integrates with β-catenin/Runx2; regulates BNIP3-dependent mitophagy.

Open questions and best practices for functional studies
- Dissect partner-specific outputs: Use motif-centric ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN with perturbation of CHOP, C/EBPβ, ATF3 to parse survival vs apoptosis programs.
- Temporal ISR control: Time-resolved phospho-proteomics and nascent RNA-seq to separate early adaptive ATF4 targets from late CHOP-dominant programs.
- Translation-level quantification: Reporter constructs with WT/mutated ATF4 uORFs; Ribo-seq under graded eIF2B activation to map ATF4 translation thresholds.
- Subcellular dynamics: Live-cell imaging of ATF4 nuclear import/export (e.g., KPNB1 dependence) under distinct kinase activation (PERK vs GCN2 vs HRI).

Limitations of current evidence
- Context dependence: Many results are cell-type– or stressor-specific; extrapolation requires care.
- Off-target pharmacology: Several kinase inhibitors engage ISR nodes unintentionally, complicating attribution unless orthogonal validation is performed.

Conclusion
Human ATF4 (UniProt P18848) is a bZIP transcription factor at the core of the ISR, integrating diverse organelle and environmental stresses through translation reprogramming to execute targeted transcriptional programs. Recent 2023–2024 advances sharpen mechanistic understanding at the ISR hub (eIF2B allostery), reveal unanticipated drug–GCN2 interactions, define metabolic rewiring attributable to selective ISR/ATF4 activation, and illuminate translational opportunities in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and bone biology. Future applications will benefit from precise, time- and context-tuned ISR modulation to bias ATF4’s output toward desired adaptive or cytotoxic outcomes.
