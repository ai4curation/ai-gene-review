description: Tumor suppressor p53 is a multifunctional transcription factor that acts
  as a guardian of the genome, coordinating cellular responses to diverse stress signals
  including DNA damage, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and metabolic stress. It regulates
  cell fate decisions through transcriptional control of genes involved in cell cycle
  arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and metabolism. TP53 is the most frequently
  mutated gene in human cancers (~50%), underlining its critical role in preventing
  malignant transformation. Beyond its canonical tumor suppressive functions, p53
  also regulates ferroptosis, autophagy, immune responses, and stemness.

  review:
    summary: TP53 is a well-established DNA-binding transcription factor that directly
      binds to p53 response elements in target gene promoters. This is one of its
      core molecular functions, supported by extensive experimental evidence including
      the IDA annotations from PMID:15710329 and PMID:17996705.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately represents a core molecular function of p53.

suggested_questions:
- question: How does p53 integrate diverse stress signals to determine cell fate decisions
    between survival, senescence, and apoptosis?
- question: What determines the selectivity of p53 for different target gene promoters
    and how is this modulated by post-translational modifications?
- question: How do p53 isoforms and mutant forms interact to modulate tumor suppressor
    function in heterozygous cancer cells?
