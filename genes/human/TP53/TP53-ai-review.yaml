description: 'Tumor suppressor p53 is a multifunctional transcription factor that acts as a guardian of the genome, coordinating cellular responses to diverse stress signals including DNA damage, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and metabolic stress. It regulates cell fate decisions through transcriptional control of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and metabolism. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers (~50%), underlining its critical role in preventing malignant transformation. Beyond its canonical tumor suppressive functions, p53 also regulates ferroptosis, autophagy, immune responses, and stemness.'
