description: >-
  KCTD12 (also known as Pfetin) is a BTB/POZ domain-containing protein that functions
  as an auxiliary subunit of GABA-B (metabotropic GABA) receptors. The protein
  constitutively associates with the C-terminal domain of GABAB2 via its N-terminal
  T1-type BTB domain and directly engages G-protein beta-gamma subunits upon receptor
  activation. This interaction accelerates receptor activation kinetics and promotes
  rapid desensitization of GABA-B receptor signaling. KCTD12 forms pentameric assemblies
  and is localized at both pre- and post-synaptic membranes where GABA-B receptors
  operate. The protein also influences receptor surface expression levels. KCTD12
  is highly expressed in fetal tissues, particularly the cochlea and brain, and has
  been characterized as a prognostic biomarker (Pfetin) in gastrointestinal stromal
  tumors (GIST).

        which are present at presynaptic terminals. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic
        inference is consistent with experimental evidence for this synaptic localization.

        The annotation derives from a large-scale mRNA interactome capture study (Castello

        KCTD12
        was detected in this screen, there is no evidence that RNA binding represents
        a functionally significant activity for this protein. The core function of
        KCTD12
        is clearly as a GABA-B receptor auxiliary subunit. This annotation should
        be
        retained but marked as non-core, as it may represent a secondary or indirect
        association rather than a primary molecular function.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does KCTD12 have any Cullin3-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase 
      activity like some other KCTD family members?
  - question: What is the functional significance of KCTD12 RNA binding detected
      in mRNA interactome studies?
  - question: How does the pentameric vs tetrameric assembly state affect KCTD12
      function at GABA-B receptors?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Cryo-EM structure of full GABA-B receptor complex with KCTD12 
      to understand binding interface
    hypothesis: Structural determination will reveal how KCTD12 pentamers dock 
      onto the GABAB2 C-terminal domain
  - description: In vivo electrophysiology in KCTD12 knockout to quantify 
      effects on GABA-B receptor kinetics
    hypothesis: Loss of KCTD12 will slow receptor desensitization and activation
      kinetics
  - description: Investigation of potential KCTD12-Cullin3 interaction and 
      ubiquitin ligase activity
    hypothesis: Unlike some KCTD family members, KCTD12 may not engage Cullin3 
      due to specialized GBR auxiliary function
