description: >-
  BCAP31 (also known as BAP31) is an abundant ER-resident integral membrane protein
  that functions as a chaperone and cargo receptor for ER quality control. It has
  three
  transmembrane domains with a cytosolic C-terminal coiled-coil domain containing
  a
  KKXX ER-retrieval motif. BCAP31 plays essential roles in (1) ER-to-Golgi transport
  of select membrane proteins, (2) ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by promoting
  retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins via interaction with Sec61 and Derlin-1,
  and (3) mitochondrial homeostasis via ER-mitochondria contact sites through interaction
  with Tom40 to facilitate import of Complex I components. Importantly, while BCAP31
  is cleaved by caspase-8 during apoptosis to generate a p20 fragment, this reflects
  its role as a SUBSTRATE of apoptosis machinery, not a direct participant in apoptosis
  initiation. The p20 cleavage product induces ER calcium release and mitochondrial
  fission as a consequence of apoptotic signaling. Loss-of-function mutations cause
  DDCH syndrome (deafness, dystonia, central hypomyelination).

        This annotation derives from the UniProt "Apoptosis" keyword. However, BCAP31
        is a SUBSTRATE of caspase-8, not an active participant in apoptosis. Being
        cleaved
        during apoptosis does not make a protein "involved in" apoptotic process.
        The p20
        cleavage product does induce downstream effects (ER Ca2+ release, mitochondrial
        fission), but this is a CONSEQUENCE of apoptotic signaling, not a core function.
        This is analogous to other caspase substrates like AIMP1 that are over-annotated
        to apoptosis simply because they are cleaved.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: >-
        BCAP31 is a caspase-8 substrate cleaved during apoptosis (PMID:9334338), not
        an active regulator of apoptosis. The core functions are ER quality control,
        cargo transport, and mitochondrial homeostasis. Being a target of caspases
        does
        not constitute involvement in apoptotic process - this conflates being affected
        BY apoptosis with causing or regulating apoptosis.

      BCAP31 functions as a cargo receptor for selective ER-to-Golgi transport of
      membrane proteins including MHC class I molecules and tetraspanins.

  - molecular_function:
      id: GO:0140597
      label: protein carrier chaperone
    description: >-
      BCAP31 promotes ERAD by interacting with the Sec61 translocon, TRAM, and Derlin-1
      complex to facilitate retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation of misfolded
      ER membrane proteins like CFTR-deltaF508.

    description: >-
      BCAP31 forms a bridging complex with Tom40 at ER-mitochondria contact sites
      (MAMs) to facilitate import of mitochondrial Complex I components (NDUFS4, NDUFB11),
      maintaining mitochondrial respiratory function.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the relative contribution of BCAP31's ERAD function vs. its ER-to-Golgi
      transport function in neural development, given that BCAP31 mutations cause
      DDCH syndrome with hypomyelination?
  - question: >-
      Does the ER-mitochondria bridging function via Tom40 represent an evolutionarily
      conserved role or a specialized function in certain cell types?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Structure-function analysis separating the ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport
      functions to determine which is critical for DDCH syndrome pathogenesis.
  - description: >-
      Proximity labeling to comprehensively identify BCAP31 cargo proteins beyond
      MHC class I and CFTR.
