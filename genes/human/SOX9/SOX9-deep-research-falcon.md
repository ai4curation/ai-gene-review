1. **Check if the gene symbol "SOX9" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SOX9' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SOX9** (gene ID: SOX9, UniProt: P48436) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Human SOX9 (UniProt P48436): molecular function, regulation, pathways, and recent translational developments

Abstract
SOX9 is a human SOXE-family transcription factor essential for lineage specification and tissue homeostasis. It binds AACAAT-centered motifs via its HMG-box, bends DNA, recruits co-activators, and often cooperates with SOX5/6 to orchestrate chondrogenesis and other organogenetic programs. Recent studies (2023–2024) refine enhancer control of Sox9 in chondrocytes, define injury- and context-specific roles in fibrosis and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and uncover disease-relevant post-translational and metabolic couplings in cancer and liver disease. Here, we synthesize key concepts, new findings, applications, expert perspectives, and recent quantitative data.

1. Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and domains. SOX9 is a 509-aa SOXE transcription factor containing an N-terminal dimerization region, a central HMG-box DNA-binding domain that recognizes an AACAAT-centered motif (e.g., AGAACAATGG), and C-terminal transactivation modules that recruit co-activators including CBP/p300 and TIP60; it can act as a pioneer factor at super-enhancers in development (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 19-20, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 1-2).
- Molecular function. SOX9 binds the DNA minor groove, bends DNA, and engages enhancer architectures, frequently in cooperation with SOX5/6 on paired SOX sites to activate cartilage matrix genes (e.g., COL2A1, ACAN) and other lineage programs (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; JCI Insight, 2024; URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Sep 2022; Jun 2024) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 19-20, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 1-2, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization. SOX9 harbors nuclear localization and export signals; activity and localization are tuned by phosphorylation and acetylation as part of its regulation in chondrogenic and other lineages (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 24-25).
- Regulatory post-translational modifications (PTMs). Phosphorylation (including cAMP/PKA- and ERK-coupled events) and lysine acetylation/sumoylation modulate SOX9 DNA binding, nuclear import, and transactivation in cartilage contexts; ubiquitination and arginine methylation also contribute to turnover and pathway cross-talk (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (lefebvre2017sox9andthe pages 19-22, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 24-25).

2. Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priorities)
- Chondrocyte enhancer control of Sox9 (2024). Chromatin profiling in primary chondrocytes mapped Sox9 regulatory elements within a gene desert upstream of Sox9 and functionally validated two chondrocyte enhancers, E308 and E160, located 308 kb and 160 kb upstream. Combined deletion reduced Sox9 expression, caused dwarfism, and blunted BMP2-dependent chondrogenic differentiation; enhancer loss induced compensatory chromatin reorganization (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 2-4, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).
- Kidney regeneration-fibrosis switch (2024). Following acute kidney injury, proximal tubule epithelia transiently activate SOX9 for repair; failure to restore polarity maintains a SOX9on-on CDH6+ state that emits WNT ligands and drives adjacent fibroblast activation and fibrosis. Human kidney transplants show a similar SOX9/CDH6/WNT2B cluster, positioning SOX9 dynamics as a single-cell determinant of regeneration versus fibrosis (Science, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add6371; published Feb 2024) (aggarwal2024sox9switchlinks pages 1-3).
- Endothelial EndMT and oxLDL (2024). In human endothelial colony-forming cells, oxLDL induces EndMT, with early SOX9 upregulation and SOX9 motif accessibility by ATAC-seq; silencing SOX9 (in vitro) or endothelial Sox9 knockout (in vivo) reverses oxLDL/high-fat diet–induced EndMT phenotypes and rescues progenitor function (Angiogenesis, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-024-09927-7; published May 2024) (zhao2024distinctrolesof pages 1-2).
- Hypoxia–glycolysis–lactylation axis in cancer (2024). In NSCLC cells, hypoxia promotes glycolysis, global protein lactylation, and SOX9 lactylation; SOX9 knockdown abrogates hypoxia-enhanced stemness, migration, and invasion, while glycolysis inhibition reverses SOX9 lactylation and tumor growth in vivo (Cancer Biol Ther, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2024.2304161; accepted Jan 8, 2024; online 2024) (yan2024hypoxiapromotesnonsmall pages 1-2).
- Alternative splicing in β cells (2024). In mouse and human systems, SOX9 persists in mature β cells and regulates alternative splicing programs critical for insulin secretion. SOX9 loss reduces first-phase insulin release and perturbs splicing via reduced SRSF5, linking SOX9 to post-transcriptional regulation in β-cell physiology (Nat Commun, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44384-8; published Jan 2024) (puri2024sox9regulatesalternative pages 1-2, puri2024sox9regulatesalternative pages 2-4).
- Metabolic disease link: MASH and AMPK (2024). Hepatocyte-specific SOX9 overexpression mitigated diet-induced metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis, with increased AMPK activation; pharmacologic AMPK inhibition abrogated SOX9’s protective effects. The study notes MASLD affects ~25% of adults globally (Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology, online Dec 20, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.14218/JCTH.2024.00197) (deng2024sox9overexpressionameliorates pages 1-2).
- Fibrosis outside kidney: thyroid eye disease (2024). In primary orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED, SOX9 is upregulated; modulation of SOX9 shifts extracellular-matrix gene expression and contractility via MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling. SOX9 binds the EGFR promoter, nominating a SOX9–EGFR axis as a therapeutic target (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.2.25; published Feb 2024) (zhou2024sox9inducesorbital pages 1-2).

3. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Developmental disorders and enhanceropathies. The 2024 enhancer mapping around Sox9 provides mechanistic insight into regulatory regions implicated by patient breakpoints in campomelic dysplasia and related skeletal malformations, strengthening a framework for noncoding diagnostic interpretation (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 2-4, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).
- Anti-fibrotic strategies. The kidney “SOX9 switch” suggests that transient SOX9 activation is reparative, whereas sustained SOX9 activity fosters fibrosis; targeting SOX9on-on CDH6+ epithelia or their WNT output may mitigate AKI-to-CKD progression (Science, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add6371; published Feb 2024) (aggarwal2024sox9switchlinks pages 1-3). In TED, targeting SOX9/EGFR and ERK signaling is a rational anti-fibrotic approach (IOVS, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.2.25; published Feb 2024) (zhou2024sox9inducesorbital pages 1-2).
- Cardiometabolic and hepatic disease. SOX9–AMPK coupling suggests gene- or small-molecule strategies to boost hepatic AMPK in MASH. The quantitative backdrop (approx. 25% global MASLD prevalence) underscores clinical need (J Clin Transl Hepatol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.14218/JCTH.2024.00197; published online Dec 20, 2024) (deng2024sox9overexpressionameliorates pages 1-2).
- Oncology. In NSCLC, the hypoxia–glycolysis–SOX9 lactylation axis links metabolic state to invasive phenotypes; inhibiting glycolysis or lactylation may blunt SOX9-driven plasticity and tumor progression (Cancer Biol Ther, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2024.2304161; accepted Jan 8, 2024) (yan2024hypoxiapromotesnonsmall pages 1-2).
- Regenerative medicine and cartilage engineering. Mechanistically precise enhancer control and SOX5/6 cooperation in chondrogenesis guide strategies to maintain hyaline cartilage identity in tissue engineering and repair (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).

4. Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Developmental/pioneer functions and pathway cross-talk. A consensus from a 2022 domain-leading review highlights SOX9’s pioneer-like activity, enhancer engagement, and cooperation with SOX5/6, CBP/p300, and TIP60, with antagonistic interactions with β-catenin in chondrocytes—principles that underpin many disease contexts (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 19-20, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 1-2, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 24-25).
- Enhanceropathies in skeletal development. The JCI Insight 2024 work integrates enhancer mapping with disease-associated breakpoint clusters, offering an authoritative mechanistic update on Sox9 regulation in chondrocytes (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 2-4, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).
- Fibrosis biology. Science 2024 provides a conceptual “SOX9 switch” model that explains divergent outcomes after injury and suggests tractable nodes (CDH6+ SOX9on-on and WNT ligands) for intervention in human kidneys (Science, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add6371; published Feb 2024) (aggarwal2024sox9switchlinks pages 1-3).

5. Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- MASLD prevalence and MASH context: MASLD affects approximately 25% of adults worldwide, with no approved therapies; in mouse MASH models, hepatocyte-specific SOX9 overexpression mitigated steatohepatitis and enhanced AMPK activation, whereas hepatocyte SOX9 deletion exacerbated disease and reduced AMPK signaling (J Clin Transl Hepatol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.14218/JCTH.2024.00197; published online Dec 20, 2024) (deng2024sox9overexpressionameliorates pages 1-2).
- Chondrocyte enhancer deletion phenotypes: simultaneous deletion of Sox9 E308/E160 enhancers reduced Sox9 expression in chondrocytes and produced a dwarf phenotype; BMP2-driven chondrocyte differentiation was severely attenuated (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).
- EndMT reversal metrics: In oxLDL-exposed endothelial progenitors and high-fat diet in vivo, silencing/endothelial knockout of Sox9 reversed EndMT gene signatures and restored progenitor characteristics (Angiogenesis, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-024-09927-7; published May 2024) (zhao2024distinctrolesof pages 1-2).

Mechanistic synthesis focused on primary function, localization, and pathways
- Primary function and DNA specificity. SOX9 binds an AACAAT-centered motif through its HMG box, bending DNA and enabling enhancer complex assembly. Cooperative binding with SOX5/6 at paired SOX sites underlies potent activation of cartilage matrix genes; recruitment of CBP/p300/TIP60 further enhances transactivation (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 19-20, ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 1-2).
- Subcellular site of action. SOX9 functions in the nucleus; nuclear import/export and transcriptional activity are modulated by phosphorylation and acetylation, integrating upstream signaling (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04543-4; published Sep 2022) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 24-25).
- PTM and metabolic coupling. Recent evidence couples tumor hypoxia and glycolysis to SOX9 function via protein lactylation in NSCLC, linking metabolic flux to SOX9-driven stemness and invasion (Cancer Biol Ther, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2024.2304161; accepted Jan 2024) (yan2024hypoxiapromotesnonsmall pages 1-2). In hepatocytes, SOX9 engages AMPK signaling to alleviate steatohepatitis (J Clin Transl Hepatol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.14218/JCTH.2024.00197; published online Dec 20, 2024) (deng2024sox9overexpressionameliorates pages 1-2). In β cells, SOX9 controls alternative splicing programs required for insulin secretion (Nat Commun, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44384-8; published Jan 2024) (puri2024sox9regulatesalternative pages 1-2, puri2024sox9regulatesalternative pages 2-4).
- Core pathways. In chondrogenesis, SOX9 with SOX5/6 drives cartilage gene networks, and enhancer studies show Sox9 expression depends on multiple chondrocyte enhancers integrating BMP cues (JCI Insight, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.175486; published Jun 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2). In injury/fibrosis, SOX9 acts as a repair sensor in kidney epithelia, with sustained activity eliciting WNT secretion and fibroblast activation (Science, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add6371; published Feb 2024) (aggarwal2024sox9switchlinks pages 1-3). In vascular contexts, oxLDL-induced EndMT is SOX9-dependent (Angiogenesis, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-024-09927-7; published May 2024) (zhao2024distinctrolesof pages 1-2). In fibrotic orbit disease, SOX9 activates MAPK/ERK and targets EGFR (IOVS, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.2.25; published Feb 2024) (zhou2024sox9inducesorbital pages 1-2).

Verification of target identity and avoidance of symbol ambiguity
- The synthesis above refers to human SOX9 (UniProt P48436) and vertebrate models used to resolve human SOX9 biology. Domain and binding properties match the UniProt description (HMG box; SOX transcription factor; enhancer-level regulation). Foundational reviews and 2024 studies align with the human gene symbol and organism context (Cell Mol Life Sci, 2022; JCI Insight, 2024) (ming2022sox9inorganogenesis pages 19-20, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).

Limitations
- Some historically foundational mechanistic details (e.g., specific NLS mapping and individual phosphorylation sites) derive from earlier primary literature not captured in the 2023–2024 set. Where necessary, we referenced a 2022 expert review that consolidates these details. For campomelic dysplasia genetics and sex-determination enhancer modules, the 2024 chondrocyte enhancer work provides the most recent mechanistic update (JCI Insight, 2024) (ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 2-4, ichiyamakobayashi2024chromatinprofilingidentifies pages 1-2).

Conclusions
SOX9 functions as a nuclear, pioneer-like transcription factor that reads AACAAT-centered motifs to assemble lineage-defining enhancer programs with SOX5/6 and chromatin co-activators. 2023–2024 studies sharpen the regulatory map of Sox9 in chondrocytes, link injury-induced SOX9 dynamics to regenerative versus fibrotic outcomes in kidney, implicate SOX9 in oxLDL-driven EndMT and hypoxia-driven cancer plasticity, uncover a β-cell splicing role essential for insulin secretion, and reveal a protective SOX9–AMPK axis in MASH. These advances inform diagnostics (noncoding enhanceropathies), anti-fibrotic strategies (SOX9on-on/WNT blockade), metabolic disease interventions (AMPK), and oncology approaches targeting metabolic-epigenetic SOX9 activation.
