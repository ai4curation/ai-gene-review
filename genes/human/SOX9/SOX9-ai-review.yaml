description: |
  SOX9 is a SOXE-family transcription factor that plays dual core roles in development.
  First, SOX9 is the master regulator of chondrogenesis, cooperating with SOX5 and SOX6
  to drive cartilage matrix gene expression (COL2A1, ACAN) and promoting chondrocyte
  differentiation while antagonizing osteoblast differentiation via beta-catenin inhibition.
  Second, SOX9 is critical for oligodendrocyte differentiation and glial fate specification,
  promoting glial over neuronal fates in the CNS. SOX9 binds AACAAT-centered DNA motifs
  via its HMG-box domain, bends DNA, and recruits co-activators CBP/p300 and TIP60. It
  functions exclusively in the nucleus with nuclear localization and export signals.
  Post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation
  regulate its activity. While SOX9 has additional developmental roles in sex determination,
  heart valve, kidney, and other epithelial programs, its core molecular functions center
  on transcriptional activation in cartilage and glial lineages.

    review:
      summary: |
        SOX9 is a bona fide RNA Pol II transcription factor with experimentally validated
        DNA-binding and transactivation domains (deep research, UniProt). It binds the
        AACAAT motif via HMG-box and activates transcription of cartilage and other target
        genes.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: |
        This is a core molecular function of SOX9. The IBA annotation correctly captures
        SOX9's role as an RNA Pol II-specific transcription factor, supported by extensive
        experimental evidence showing DNA binding, transactivation, and regulation of Pol
        II-transcribed genes.
