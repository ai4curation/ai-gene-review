description: >-
  PFDN6 encodes prefoldin subunit 6, a beta-class subunit of the canonical heterohexameric prefoldin
  co-chaperone complex (2 alpha + 4 beta subunits). The prefoldin complex captures non-native/unfolded
  polypeptides, particularly nascent actin and tubulin, and delivers them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin
  for ATP-dependent folding. PFDN6 contributes one coiled-coil tentacle bearing hydrophobic residues
  at its tip to engage exposed hydrophobic patches on non-native substrates. PFDN6 is also a component
  of the PAQosome (prefoldin-like module containing URI1, PFDN2, PFDN6, PDRG1, UXT, and ASDURF), which
  is involved in the biogenesis of several protein complexes. The protein localizes primarily to the
  cytoplasm. Beyond its canonical co-chaperone role, prefoldin subunits have been reported to exhibit
  nuclear functions related to transcriptional regulation, and recent work has linked PFDN6 upregulation
  to colorectal cancer biology.

      PFDN6 is a cytoplasmic protein as part of the prefoldin heterohexamer that captures unfolded
      substrates in the cytoplasm and delivers them to TRiC/CCT. This is well supported by the
      IBA annotation which is phylogenetically consistent across eukaryotes. UniProt does not specify
      a subcellular location annotation for PFDN6, but the canonical function of prefoldin as a
      cytosolic co-chaperone is well established (PMID:9630229).

      NAS annotation from the original Vainberg et al. 1998 paper. The paper demonstrated
      that prefoldin captures unfolded actin and delivers it to the chaperonin. However, the
      molecular function is better described as GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" since
      prefoldin actively assists in folding rather than merely binding unfolded proteins.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The original paper demonstrates that prefoldin's function goes beyond simple unfolded
      protein binding; it actively captures and transfers substrates to the chaperonin for
      productive folding. GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the more appropriate
      molecular function term.

      IDA annotation from Vainberg et al. 1998. The paper showed that deletion of a prefoldin

      NAS annotation from the original Vainberg et al. 1998 paper describing prefoldin's
      role in protein folding. The paper demonstrated that prefoldin promotes folding by

      PFDN6, as a subunit of the prefoldin complex, functions as a protein folding chaperone
      that captures non-native substrates and delivers them to TRiC/CCT. This molecular function
      term is more appropriate than GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" because it captures the
      active co-chaperone role rather than passive binding. Gestaut et al. 2019 demonstrated that
      prefoldin alternates between conformations to align substrate binding chambers with TRiC/CCT
      and enhances the rate and yield of the folding reaction (PMID:30955883).
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the most appropriate molecular function term for
      prefoldin subunits. It is defined as "Binding to a protein or a protein-containing complex
      to assist the protein folding process" which exactly matches prefoldin's function. This
      annotation should replace the existing GO:0051082 annotations.

          PFD alternates between an open "latched" conformation and a closed "engaged"
          conformation that aligns the PFD-TRiC substrate binding chambers. PFD can act after
          TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and yield of the folding reaction,
          suppressing non-productive reaction cycles.

  - description: >-
      PFDN6 is a beta-type subunit of the heterohexameric prefoldin co-chaperone
      complex that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin)
      and delivers them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin for ATP-dependent folding.
      PFDN6 contributes a coiled-coil tentacle with hydrophobic residues that
      engages exposed hydrophobic patches on non-native substrates. Deletion of
      prefoldin subunit genes impairs actin and tubulin cytoskeleton function.
