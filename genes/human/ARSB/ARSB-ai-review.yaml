description: 'Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of 4-sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine residues within chondroitin-4-sulfate
  and dermatan sulfate. This sulfatase activity is essential for the ordered degradation
  of glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes. Deficiency of ARSB leads to mucopolysaccharidosis
  type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), characterized by accumulation of dermatan sulfate
  and chondroitin sulfate. Beyond its lysosomal role, ARSB regulates extracellular
  matrix composition, cell migration, and signaling pathways by controlling sulfation
  patterns of glycosaminoglycans.'

    label: sulfuric ester hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation correctly identifies ARSB as a sulfuric ester hydrolase,
      which is accurate as ARSB catalyzes hydrolysis of sulfate ester bonds. This
      is the broader enzymatic class encompassing the more specific N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase
      activity. The phylogenetic evidence supporting this annotation is strong across
      mammalian orthologs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an appropriate molecular function term that accurately reflects
      the core catalytic activity of ARSB. While more general than the specific N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase
      activity, it correctly places ARSB in the sulfatase family. The IBA evidence
      based on phylogenetic conservation is robust.

  review:
    summary: This annotation correctly identifies the specific enzymatic activity
      of ARSB. The EC mapping (EC:3.1.6.12) accurately reflects that ARSB catalyzes
      the hydrolysis of 4-sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine residues in both
      chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. This is the primary and most specific
      molecular function of ARSB.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most precise molecular function term for ARSB and should be
      retained as a core annotation. Although this is IEA based on EC mapping, it
      is also supported by multiple experimental studies (IDA annotations from PMID:18285341

    summary: This annotation identifies ARSB as having arylsulfatase activity, which

    summary: This annotation indicates ARSB localizes to the cell surface. While ARSB
      is primarily lysosomal, there is evidence from UniProt and literature that ARSB
      can be detected at the cell membrane in certain cell types, particularly in

      surface localization should not be dismissed. The deep research document notes
      that ARSB has been detected at cell membranes, and this may represent a non-core
      but biologically relevant localization. There is also an ISS annotation supporting

    reason: While ARSB does bind metal ions, specifically calcium, the current term
      is too generic. A more specific term would be calcium ion binding (GO:0005509),

  review:
    summary: This annotation suggests ARSB is involved in autophagy, based on orthology
      to rat ARSB. While ARSB is a lysosomal enzyme and lysosomes are involved in
      autophagy, there is no direct evidence that ARSB specifically participates in
      autophagic processes beyond being a general lysosomal enzyme.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation appears to be an over-annotation. While ARSB is lysosomal
      and lysosomes participate in autophagy, there is no specific evidence that ARSB
      has a direct functional role in autophagy itself. ARSB's primary function is
      glycosaminoglycan degradation, not autophagy regulation. This annotation likely
      arises from guilt-by-association with the lysosome rather than a specific biological

      there is no evidence it specifically responds to or regulates pH.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is an over-annotation. While ARSB activity is pH-dependent (like
      most lysosomal enzymes that function optimally at acidic pH), this does not
      mean ARSB is involved in pH response as a biological process. The term implies
      ARSB actively participates in sensing or responding to pH changes, which is

      on similarity evidence.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While there is supporting evidence from UniProt (based on similarity)

  review:
    summary: This is another experimental (IDA) confirmation of ARSB's N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase
      activity from a different study. This study demonstrated that modulating ARSB
      expression affects chondroitin-4-sulfate content and related cellular functions.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is independent experimental evidence for the core molecular function
      of ARSB. Having multiple IDA annotations from different studies strengthens
      the evidence for this critical activity. This should definitely be retained.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: This appears to be a misannotation. While ARSB deficiency leads to lysosomal
      storage disease (MPS VI), this does not mean ARSB's primary function is to organize
      lysosomes. ARSB is a lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycans; its
      absence causes substrate accumulation and lysosomal dysfunction, but this is
      a consequence of enzyme deficiency, not evidence that ARSB actively organizes

    reason: This is a misannotation. The reference describes ARSB as a cargo being
      transported to lysosomes, not as performing transport functions. ARSB is a lysosomal
