gene_symbol: CLPSL1
product_type: PROTEIN
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: Colipase-like protein 1, member of colipase family. Similar to CLPS and
  CLPSL2 with colipase domain structure. Putative lipase cofactor that may facilitate
  enzyme-substrate interactions for lipolytic enzymes in specific tissues. Expression
  pattern suggests tissue-specific or developmental role. Secreted protein functioning
  extracellularly. Function incompletely characterized but likely involved in lipid
  metabolism or digestion-related processes.
