## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene CLPSL1 (A2RUU4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# CLPSL1 (Colipase-Like Protein 1) – Function, Processes, and Localization

## Overview and Key Characteristics  
**CLPSL1 (Colipase-Like 1)** is a human gene encoding a small secreted protein that closely resembles pancreatic colipase in sequence and domain structure ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W036.html#:~:text=Gene%20%2A%20Signal%20transduction%20,enzyme%20required%20for%20optimal)). Colipases are cofactors required for digestive lipase enzymes, and CLPSL1 is predicted to function as an **enzyme activator** in a similar capacity ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20enzyme,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jul%202025)). Like the canonical colipase (product of the **CLPS** gene), CLPSL1 is synthesized as a precursor (preproprotein) that includes an N-terminal signal peptide and an activation peptide. Upon secretion into the digestive tract or other luminal spaces, the precursor is cleaved by trypsin to release a short **pentapeptide** and the mature colipase-like domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). (In pancreatic colipase, this pentapeptide is known as **enterostatin**, which has been implicated in satiety signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=Studies%20involving%20the%20administration%20of,choice)). By analogy, CLPSL1 likely produces a similar peptide, though its specific bioactivity has not been studied.) The mature CLPSL1 protein is only about 90–100 amino acids in length (∼10 kDa) and belongs to the **colipase family**, characterized by a conserved disulfide-rich fold ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W036.html#:~:text=Gene%20%2A%20Signal%20transduction%20,enzyme%20required%20for%20optimal)). These structural features suggest CLPSL1 can assume the same **architectural functionality** as colipase, i.e. a compact, stable cofactor capable of binding lipases and lipid micelles ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). Current genomic annotations (Alliance of Genome Resources, 2025) classify CLPSL1 as a secreted **protein cofactor** with enzyme activator activity, involved in nutrient response ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20enzyme,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jul%202025)), consistent with its homology to colipase. Notably, the CLPSL1 gene is located on chromosome 6p21.31 in close proximity to the pancreatic colipase gene, indicating it arose from a gene duplication in this region ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=1208#:~:text=Annotation%20release%20%20,NC_000006.12%20%2835794982..35797323%2C%20complement)). To date, CLPSL1 remains less characterized in the literature; however, protein-level evidence confirms its existence and supports a role analogous to pancreatic colipase ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/single%2Bcell#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20expression%20cluster,Protein%20predicted%20to%20be%20secreted)). 

## Molecular Function – Enzyme Cofactor Activity  
The primary function of Colipase-like 1 is inferred from its **high similarity to pancreatic colipase** (CLPS). Pancreatic colipase is a well-studied **cofactor for pancreatic triglyceride lipase**, essential for efficient dietary fat digestion ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). Colipase itself does not catalyze lipid hydrolysis; instead, it binds both to the lipase enzyme and to the lipid-water interface (e.g. emulsified dietary triglycerides), thereby anchoring and stabilizing the lipase at the lipid droplet surface ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=cl24053%20Location%3A23%20%E2%86%92%20110%20COLIPASE%3B,lipid%20interface%20and)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). In the intestinal lumen, bile salts present in digestive juices can displace lipase from fat droplets, inhibiting lipase activity. Colipase resolves this problem by serving as a **bridge**: one face of colipase binds tightly to the C-terminal, non-catalytic domain of pancreatic lipase, while the opposite face binds to the bile-salt–covered lipid micelle ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). This interaction **stabilizes an active conformation** of the lipase and greatly increases the effective hydrophobic binding site, overcoming bile salt inhibition ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). Without colipase, pancreatic lipase is washed off the lipid interface by bile, drastically reducing fat breakdown ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). Given that CLPSL1 contains the same conserved **COLIPASE domain** (including key cysteine residues for the colipase fold) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=cl24053%20Location%3A23%20%E2%86%92%20110%20COLIPASE%3B,lipid%20interface%20and)), it is presumed to perform an analogous molecular function. In other words, CLPSL1 likely acts as an **enzyme activator that binds lipases**, promoting their attachment to triglyceride substrates and restoring activity in the presence of bile acids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). The substrates in this context are the **dietary lipids** (triacylglycerols) being hydrolyzed and the enzymes are pancreatic lipases; CLPSL1 itself serves as a required cofactor rather than an enzyme. 

Importantly, **experimental characterization of CLPSL1’s biochemical activity is limited**, so this functional assignment is based primarily on homology and bioinformatic prediction. No unique catalytic activity or alternative binding partners for CLPSL1 have been reported in literature as of 2023. However, large-scale proteomic interaction studies have detected CLPSL1 in complex with other proteins, suggesting it is expressed and folds properly in cells ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/1197416#:~:text=CLPSL1%20TNFAIP1%20%20,High)). (For instance, CLPSL1 was identified in affinity-purification mass spectrometry screens of the human proteome, although its specific interacting partners in those experiments – such as TNFAIP1 – may reflect intracellular context or experimental artifacts ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/1197416#:~:text=CLPSL1%20TNFAIP1%20%20,High)).) Overall, the **consensus expert opinion** is that CLPSL1 likely functions as a **colipase paralog**, fulfilling a similar cofactor role for pancreatic lipase or related enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)). Any subtle differences in substrate or enzyme specificity between CLPSL1 and classical colipase remain to be determined. 

## Biological Processes and Pathway Involvement  
Given its inferred role as a lipid digestion cofactor, CLPSL1 is believed to participate in **digestive processes**, particularly the **dietary fat digestion and absorption pathway**. In the exocrine pancreas, CLPSL1 would be secreted alongside pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum. There, it would function in concert with **pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PNLIP)** and bile salts to enable the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). This places CLPSL1 in the same pathway context as colipase – namely, the **intestinal phase of lipid digestion**. Key processes include emulsification of fats by bile, lipase-colipase binding to the micelle, and subsequent hydrolysis of fats. By anchoring lipases at the lipid interface, colipase family proteins are **essential for efficient lipid nutrient absorption** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). Consistent with this, **gene ontology** annotations (updated 2025) associate CLPSL1 with “response to food” ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20enzyme,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jul%202025)). This term likely reflects the fact that expression of digestive cofactors like colipase is nutritionally regulated – for example, pancreatic colipase levels rise with high-fat feeding, and its activation peptide (enterostatin) acts as a feedback signal to modulate fat intake ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=Studies%20involving%20the%20administration%20of,choice)). While CLPSL1’s regulation has not been specifically examined, the annotation suggests it may be co-regulated with dietary intake or feeding signals in a similar manner. Indeed, **enterostatin** (the cleaved product of procolipase) was shown to suppress fat consumption in animal models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=Studies%20involving%20the%20administration%20of,choice)), highlighting how the colipase system links digestion to satiety and nutritional homeostasis. If CLPSL1 produces an analogous peptide upon activation, it could conceivably partake in such gut-brain signaling, though this remains speculative without direct evidence.

Outside of the digestive tract, CLPSL1 might have a more localized physiological role. Notably, this gene is expressed in the **male reproductive tract (epididymis)**, where its function is less clear (see below). The epididymis is known to secrete many proteins that modify sperm and the luminal environment; CLPSL1’s presence there hints it could be involved in **lipid modification or signaling in seminal fluids**. For example, it might interact with lipids or lipases in the epididymal fluid, potentially influencing sperm membrane composition or providing nutritional support to maturing sperm. However, no specific epididymal substrate or pathway for CLPSL1 has been identified so far. Therefore, the **best-understood context for CLPSL1’s activity is still the pancreatic digestive enzyme pathway**, paralleling colipase in facilitating lipid breakdown in the small intestine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6444705/#:~:text=split%20into%20the%20N,for%20the%20efficient%20digestion%20of)). Future studies (e.g. targeted knockout or biochemical assays) would be needed to confirm this role and to explore any additional pathways where CLPSL1 may be active.

## Expression Profile and Localization  
**Tissue distribution** of CLPSL1 is distinctive: it is most highly expressed in the **pancreas** and the **epididymis**, with relatively lower expression in other tissues. Transcriptomic and proteomic data classify CLPSL1 as “group enriched” in pancreas and epididymis ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20expression%20cluster%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%200.95)). Specifically, RNA-seq analyses (GTEx and HPA datasets) show that CLPSL1 mRNA is abundant in pancreatic tissue (especially the exocrine pancreas) and in the epididymal epithelium, whereas most other organs have only minimal levels ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20expression%20cluster%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%200.95)). This expression pattern aligns with the gene’s proposed function in secretory processes. In the pancreas, **acinar cells** (the exocrine cells that produce digestive enzymes) are the likely source of CLPSL1. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing data place CLPSL1 in a cluster of **pancreatic exocrine cell genes associated with proteolytic digestion** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/single%2Bcell#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20expression%20cluster,Protein%20predicted%20to%20be%20secreted)). In the epididymis, CLPSL1 appears to be produced by the **epithelial principal cells** that line the epididymal duct, which secrete various proteins into the luminal fluid important for sperm maturation.

At the protein level, CLPSL1 has been **detected and localized** in human tissues. The Human Protein Atlas (HPA, 2023) reports **cytoplasmic expression in epididymal cells** on immunohistochemistry, consistent with a protein being made and stored for secretion ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/tissue#:~:text=match%20at%20L43%20Protein%20expression,antibody%20staining%20and%20RNA%20expression)). This cytoplasmic staining likely represents CLPSL1 in the secretory granules or endoplasmic reticulum of epididymal epithelial cells. In pancreas, direct immunohistochemical data for CLPSL1 is not explicitly documented in HPA (possibly due to technical limitations), but co-expression with other pancreatic enzymes strongly suggests it is produced in the pancreatic acini ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/single%2Bcell#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20expression%20cluster,Protein%20predicted%20to%20be%20secreted)). Supporting this, CLPSL1 has “**evidence at protein level**” in databases like neXtProt/HPA, meaning peptides from CLPSL1 have been identified by mass-spectrometry in proteomic studies ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/single%2Bcell#:~:text=Brain%20cluster%20specificity,Protein%20predicted%20to%20be%20secreted)). 

**Subcellular localization:** CLPSL1 is a **secreted protein**. It contains a signal peptide that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum, and from there it is trafficked through the Golgi to secretory vesicles. The **predicted location** from UniProt/GO annotations is **extracellular (secreted)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20enzyme,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jul%202025)), which aligns with the known behavior of colipase in pancreatic secretions. Before secretion, CLPSL1 would reside in the lumen of the ER/Golgi and in zymogen granules. Once secreted, its functional locale is **outside the cell** – in the intestinal lumen (for pancreas-derived CLPSL1) or in the **epididymal lumen** (for epididymis-derived CLPSL1). In these extracellular environments, CLPSL1 can interact with its target enzymes and substrates (e.g. binding to pancreatic lipase in the gut). There is no evidence that CLPSL1 has a nuclear or cytosolic role; all data indicate it follows the secretory pathway. The protein’s structure (absence of transmembrane regions, presence of disulfide bonds) is typical of a stable secreted cofactor, not an intracellular enzyme. Consistently, **cell culture studies** did not find CLPSL1 in the nucleus or other organelles; any reported intracellular protein–protein interactions involving CLPSL1 ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/1197416#:~:text=CLPSL1%20TNFAIP1%20%20,High)) are more likely due to experimental overexpression or retention of the protein in the ER during secretion. Thus, the **functional localization** of CLPSL1 is the **extracellular space**, where it can carry out its role in enzyme activation.

## Current Research and Perspectives  
Due to its close similarity to pancreatic colipase, CLPSL1 has not yet been the focus of many unique studies – it is often annotated based on **inference from its paralog**. As of 2024, there are **no dedicated biochemical studies** isolating CLPSL1 protein to test its activity, and it lacks a detailed entry in curated databases (for example, UniProt lists CLPSL1 but with no reviewed functional summary) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CLPSL1#:~:text=No%20data%20available%20for%20CIViC,piRNA%20Summary%20for%20CLPSL1%20Gene)). Most functional insights come from **bioinformatic analysis, evolutionary context, and expression data**. For instance, a 2008 transcriptome analysis of the human epididymis identified CLPSL1 (then called **dJ510O8.6 or C6orf127**) as a previously uncharacterized transcript enriched in that tissue, highlighting it as a potential epididymal secretory protein ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=NCBI%20www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%20%20...,18390568%2C%20Free%20PMC%20Article%202)). Additionally, a proteomic survey of human tissues in 2011 and large-scale mapping of the human “interactome” (BioPlex project, 2017–2021) both detected CLPSL1, confirming that the mRNA is translated and the protein integrates into cellular protein networks ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/1197416#:~:text=CLPSL1%20TNFAIP1%20%20,High)). These high-throughput studies, while not focused on CLPSL1’s function, provide **evidence that CLPSL1 is a bona fide expressed protein** and not merely a predicted ORF. They also raise new questions – for example, CLPSL1’s interaction with TNFAIP1 in a pulldown assay ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/1197416#:~:text=CLPSL1%20TNFAIP1%20%20,High)) was unexpected for a secretory enzyme cofactor and might hint at off-target interactions or a dual localization under certain conditions. Such findings underscore the need for follow-up research.

From a clinical or applied perspective, **no specific disorders have been linked to CLPSL1 mutations or dysregulation** to date. In contrast, loss of pancreatic colipase (CLPS) is known to cause fat malabsorption and failure to thrive (as part of rare **colipase deficiency syndromes**) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3147715/#:~:text=pancreatic%20lipase%20causes%20catalysis%20in,cannot%20take%20place%20without%20colipase)). Since CLPSL1 is presumably functionally redundant (or at least overlapping) with colipase, it’s plausible that it could compensate partially for colipase loss, or vice versa. However, humans with colipase deficiency still have significant digestive problems ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3147715/#:~:text=pancreatic%20lipase%20causes%20catalysis%20in,cannot%20take%20place%20without%20colipase)), suggesting CLPSL1 cannot fully substitute in normal digestion – possibly due to lower expression or slightly different activity. On the other hand, the specific contribution of CLPSL1 to digestion under normal conditions remains unknown; it might be minor given the abundance of classical colipase. Its notable expression in the epididymis also raises the possibility of a role in fertility or sperm function, but again, concrete evidence is lacking. Some researchers have pointed out that many **epididymis-enriched genes in humans (e.g. certain secretory proteins)** do not have murine orthologs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10095261/#:~:text=DE,Step%20Evagreen)), complicating the use of standard mouse models to study them. CLPSL1 may fall into this category (the mouse genome has a single Clps gene and little evidence of a Clpsl1 ortholog), which could explain the paucity of functional studies – it hasn’t been a target in typical rodent experiments.

In summary, **CLPSL1 is currently understood through the lens of its homology to pancreatic colipase**. Authoritative reviews on digestive enzymes (e.g. van Tilbeurgh *et al.*, 1999, in *BBA* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies))) emphasize the critical role of colipase in lipid hydrolysis, and by extension, CLPSL1 is expected to serve a similar cofactor role. Genomic and proteomic data from the last decade have established that CLPSL1 is expresssed in key secretory tissues (pancreas and epididymis) and is present at the protein level ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/tissue#:~:text=Tissue%20expression%20cluster%20%28RNA%29,i%7D%200.95)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204140-CLPSL1/single%2Bcell#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20expression%20cluster,Protein%20predicted%20to%20be%20secreted)). The **next steps** in research will be to determine whether CLPSL1 indeed binds pancreatic lipase (or perhaps other lipases) and how its activity compares to the canonical colipase. Structural modeling (e.g. AlphaFold) already predicts a colipase-like fold for CLPSL1, so experimental validation of structure and binding is feasible ([www.ensembl.org](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Transcript/Summary?t=ENST00000373861#:~:text=This%20transcript%20has%203%20exons%2C,maps%20to%20150%20oligo%20probes)). Another open question is the physiological significance of having two colipase-like proteins: there may be subtle differences in their regulation or in the context of their action (digestive vs. reproductive systems). **Expert opinion** holds that CLPSL1’s broader importance will be clarified by such studies – for instance, whether it modulates dietary fat metabolism or male fertility in any measurable way. Until then, CLPSL1 remains an intriguing **paralog of an essential digestive cofactor**, with a well-founded predicted function but as-yet **unverified specific role** in human biology ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340204#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20enzyme,of%20Genome%20Resources%2C%20Jul%202025)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10570245/#:~:text=Colipase%20is%20a%20small%20protein,Whether%20this%20structural%20analogy%20implies)).
