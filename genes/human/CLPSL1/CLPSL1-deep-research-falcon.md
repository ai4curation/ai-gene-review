## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** A2RUU4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Colipase-like protein 1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CLPSL1; Synonyms=C6orf127;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the colipase family. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-
- **Key Domains:** Colipase. (IPR001981)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CLPSL1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CLPSL1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CLPSL1** (gene ID: CLPSL1, UniProt: A2RUU4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan overview
We first verified the gene/protein identity for human CLPSL1 (C6orf127; UniProt A2RUU4) and assessed possible symbol ambiguity. We then gathered evidence on expression, localization, family/domain context, computational/functional inference, disease associations, CNV/evolutionary context, and proteome catalog status. Given the sparse direct literature on CLPSL1, we prioritized authoritative proteomics and population-genomics sources and highlighted limitations.

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: CLPSL1 encodes a colipase-like protein (a paralog of the pancreatic colipase CLPS). In population-genomics context, CLPSL1 is grouped with genes involved in lipid digestion and transport and treated as “Colipase Like 1” (paralog of CLPS) (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7). The colipase family consists of small secreted proteins that act as cofactors for pancreatic lipase to facilitate triglyceride hydrolysis; CLPSL1 is considered colipase-like by homology and paralogy to CLPS in humans (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7).
- Protein existence and localization: Enhanced Human Protein Atlas (HPA) antibody-validation indicates CLPSL1 protein detection in human tissue; immunohistochemistry (IHC) shows cytoplasmic staining in glandular cells of the epididymis (Journal of Proteome Research, 2020) (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- Proteome catalog status: CLPSL1 has been cataloged among “missing proteins” in proteome surveys, including the HPA-validated cohort and studies targeting human spermatozoa proteomes (JPR 2016; JPR 2020) (vandenbrouck2016lookingformissing pages 39-40, sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Direct, gene-specific publications for CLPSL1 remain scarce in 2023–2024 among the retrieved texts. The most directly informative, recent evidence is from enhanced antibody validation that confirmed protein detection and a broader population-genomics preprint linking CLPSL1 to lipid-digestion gene sets and CNV trends (2020 and 2021, respectively). No 2023–2024 CLPSL1 mechanistic papers were retrieved in this search scope; this reflects the gene’s continuing status as a poorly characterized or “missing” protein in many resources (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11, vandenbrouck2016lookingformissing pages 39-40, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Antibody-based proteomics and protein existence pipelines: CLPSL1 was included in rigorous HPA antibody validation to substantiate protein existence and tissue localization. This is a real-world pipeline for curating previously unvalidated human proteins (JPR 2020) (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- Biomarker signatures in oncology: CLPSL1 mRNA appears in a four-gene prognostic signature (EPHA8, CLPSL1, KRT85, GABRA3) associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and poorer prognosis in colorectal cancer (Journal of Cancer 2020). The combined signature achieved an AUC of 0.730 and stratified risk across multiple clinical subgroups (li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 9-10, li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 6-9).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Proteome experts emphasize the need for orthogonal antibody validation for proteins of uncertain existence. In this framework, CLPSL1 was validated with IHC showing epididymis cytoplasmic staining in glandular cells, supporting protein existence and a specific tissue signal (JPR 2020) (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- Population-genomics analysis interprets CLPSL1 within a lipid digestion/transport gene cohort and reports positive CNV trends for CLPS/CLPSL1 in Neandertals (Hn), suggesting evolutionary modulation of lipid-metabolic components. The authors’ digestion/metabolism panel is “principally expressed in digestive organs,” consistent with the colipase-like identity (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 3-4, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Tissue localization by IHC: epididymis, cytoplasm of glandular cells (JPR 2020; enhanced HPA validation) (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- CRC biomarker performance: four-mRNA signature including CLPSL1 had AUC = 0.730 for prognosis and was independently prognostic in subgroups; CLPSL1 expression was higher in LNM vs. non-LNM (p < 0.05) (Journal of Cancer 2020) (li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 9-10, li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 6-9).
- Evolutionary CNV trends: positive CNV trend for CLPSL1 (and CLPS) reported in Neandertals; panel framed as digestion/lipid metabolism-related genes (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12).

Functional annotation synthesis for CLPSL1
- Family/domain and predicted function: By homology, CLPSL1 belongs to the colipase-related family and is a paralog of CLPS in humans. Colipases are secreted cofactors that position and stabilize pancreatic lipase at the lipid–water interface, enhancing triglyceride hydrolysis—a core step in dietary fat digestion. Population-genomics categorization places CLPSL1 in a lipid digestion/transport cohort, consistent with a colipase-like identity (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12). Direct biochemical activity or substrate-specificity data for human CLPSL1 are not available in the retrieved sources; thus, function is inferred from family/domain context rather than experimentally demonstrated for CLPSL1.
- Localization and compartment: Antibody-validated HPA/IHC indicates cytoplasmic staining in epididymis glandular cells, supporting protein existence and a specific tissue signal. No direct secretory pathway evidence for CLPSL1 was shown in the retrieved texts; however, colipases are classically secreted pancreatic proteins. In the absence of CLPSL1-specific secretion data, the subcellular site of action remains unproven for CLPSL1 (JPR 2020; family-informed inference) (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- Expression profile: The HPA antibody-validation paper provides tissue-level localization for CLPSL1 (epididymis). The population-genomics preprint places CLPSL1 in a set “principally expressed in digestive organs,” consistent with the digestive role inferred by homology, although explicit HPA-based digestive expression statements for CLPSL1 were not present in the quoted passages (bioRxiv 2021; JPR 2020) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 3-4, sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).
- Disease and biomarker context: CLPSL1 mRNA participates in a four-gene signature associated with lymphatic metastasis and prognosis in colorectal cancer; higher CLPSL1 expression correlates with LNM. The signature, rather than CLPSL1 alone, provides prognostic performance (AUC 0.730). Mechanistic roles of CLPSL1 in CRC metastasis were not established and require follow-up (Journal of Cancer 2020) (li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 9-10, li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 6-9).
- Evolutionary and CNV context: Positive CNV trends for CLPS/CLPSL1 in Neandertals suggest selection on lipid digestion pathways in archaic human populations. The same work frames an 11-gene digestion/metabolism panel including CLPSL1, reinforcing the lipid-digestion inference (bioRxiv 2021) (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12).
- Proteome status and evidence quality: Independent lines of proteomics evidence have considered CLPSL1 a “missing protein.” Antibody-based validation now supports existence in human tissue (epididymis), but broad functional characterization remains limited (JPR 2016; JPR 2020) (vandenbrouck2016lookingformissing pages 39-40, sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11).

Critical verification per user instructions
1) Gene symbol match: CLPSL1 is explicitly referred to as “colipase like 1” and paralogous to CLPS in the population-genomics source, consistent with the UniProt description provided (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7).
2) Organism: All cited evidence pertains to human datasets or human tissue proteomics (sivertsson2020enhancedvalidationof pages 9-11, li2020acombinedfourmrna pages 9-10, vandenbrouck2016lookingformissing pages 39-40, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7).
3) Family/domain: Sources group CLPSL1 with colipase/lipid digestion genes, consistent with the colipase domain family context in the UniProt metadata (vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 6-7, vicedomini2021geneticdietaryadaptation pages 9-12).
4) Ambiguity: No conflicting genes with the CLPSL1 symbol were found in the retrieved literature. Nonetheless, literature remains sparse, so interpretations rely partly on family/domain inference and curated proteomics pipelines.

Limitations and open questions
- Direct biochemical assays for CLPSL1 activity, substrate specificity, and cofactors in human tissues are lacking in the retrieved texts.
- Comprehensive tissue expression and secretion pathway data specific to CLPSL1 were not identified here; digestive expression and secretory behavior are inferred from paralogy and panel membership rather than shown experimentally for CLPSL1.
- Oncology associations to date come from multigene signatures; CLPSL1’s individual causal role remains to be established.
