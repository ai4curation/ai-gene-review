description: >-
  KCTD7 encodes BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD7, a soluble protein of ~289
  amino acids
  with an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain homologous to the T1 tetramerization domain of
  Kv channels.
  It lacks transmembrane segments and is not itself an ion channel. KCTD7 functions
  as a
  CUL3 adaptor in CRL3-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The protein hyperpolarizes
  neuronal
  membranes in a K+-dependent manner and regulates the neuronal glutamine transporter
  SAT2
  (SLC38A2), coupling K+ homeostasis to neurotransmitter precursor supply. Biallelic
  pathogenic
  variants cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 3 (EPM3/CLN14).
