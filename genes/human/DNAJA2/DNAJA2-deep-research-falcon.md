### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DNAJA2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DNAJA2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DNAJA2** (gene ID: DNAJA2, UniProt: O60884) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human DNAJA2 (UniProt O60884)

Publication date: 2026-02-20

Primary identifier verification
DNAJA2 (UniProt O60884) encodes a human class A Hsp40/J-domain protein (also called CPR3/HIRIP4) that functions as an Hsp70 co-chaperone through its conserved N-terminal J-domain (HPD motif) and C-terminal client-binding domains, consistent with the UniProt description and the class A JDP domain organization discussed in the literature. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, ye2007definitionofprb pages 10-12)

1. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

1.1. What DNAJA2 is (conceptual definition)
DNAJA2 is an Hsp40/J-domain protein (JDP) that acts as a co-chaperone for Hsp70-family chaperones (including the constitutively expressed Hsc70/HSPA8), stimulating Hsp70 ATPase activity via the J-domain and contributing client specificity by binding particular unfolded/misfolded client proteins. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2)

1.2. Domain architecture (class A JDP features)
Class A JDPs (including DNAJA2) are characterized by an N-terminal J-domain with the conserved HPD motif, a Gly/Phe-rich region, two C-terminal β-barrel substrate-binding domains (CTDI and CTDII), a dimerization domain, and a zinc-finger-like region insertion associated with class A members. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

1.3. Functional framing: “folding vs degradation” triage
A central functional concept for DNAJA2 is that Hsp70–JDP systems can promote either productive folding/trafficking or quality-control degradation depending on JDP identity, client context, and partnering factors (e.g., CHIP E3 ligase or lysosomal CMA machinery). In CFTR biogenesis, DNAJA2 is experimentally shown to bias triage toward degradation under certain conditions (notably overexpression), illustrating how a JDP can redirect client fate. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2, chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 5-8)

2. Molecular function, pathways, and localization

2.1. Core biochemical function: Hsc70 engagement and client binding
DNAJA2 binds client proteins through its C-terminal domains and engages Hsc70/Hsp70 through its J-domain; this provides a mechanistic basis for directing Hsc70 onto clients and influencing outcomes such as holding, refolding, and/or targeting to degradation pathways. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 8-10)

2.2. Self-association and structural regulation of activity (key mechanistic advance)
A major recent advance is that purified human DNAJA2 reversibly self-assembles into highly ordered tubular oligomers that can dissociate into dimers, and this association equilibrium regulates its client-binding (“holding”) activity and its productive interaction with Hsc70. (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 1-2)

Cryo-EM and EM analyses show a hollow cylindrical/tubular architecture of ~200 Å width, with “disks” formed by five DNAJA2 dimers (D5 symmetry), and reconstructions at ~8.7–9.2 Å resolution (limited by flexibility). (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 3-4, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium media 2bf40e8f)

DNAJA2 oligomer dissociation is temperature-sensitive; heat shock (40 °C) promotes dissociation with reported kinetics k = 0.43 min−1 and t1/2 = 2.3 min, and assemblies can reassociate upon cooling to 25 °C. (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 1-2)

The intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (final ~52 residues; V361–Q412) regulates holding activity and productive interaction with Hsc70; deletion of this C-terminal region destabilizes oligomers toward smaller particles by DLS. (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 1-2, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 2-3)

Hsc70 can drive DNAJA2 assembly disassembly in an ATP-dependent manner: binding/disassembly is impaired by an ATPase-defective Hsc70 mutant and by a DNAJA2 J-domain HPD→QPN mutant that prevents productive Hsc70 engagement, supporting the model that Hsc70 ATPase cycling coupled to J-domain interaction triggers oligomer disassembly. (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 8-10)

2.3. Protein quality control at the ER: CFTR folding versus ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
In inducible HEK293 CFTR systems, DNAJA2 overexpression reduces CFTR maturation (reduced mature “band C”), consistent with increased ER-associated proteasomal degradation (ERAD) of immature CFTR (“band B”). The effect is J-domain dependent: a J-domain deletion mutant (DJA2ΔJ) lacks the strong degradation phenotype. Proteasome inhibition with MG132 increases immature CFTR and restores mature CFTR in DNAJA2-overexpressing cells, supporting ERAD as the mechanism. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 5-8)

Mechanistically, DNAJA2 acts with Hsc70/Hsp70 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP to promote degradation at the ER, highlighting DNAJA2 as a co-chaperone that can tip client fate toward degradation. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2)

Quantitative example from the CFTR study: after induction, mature CFTR (band C) was ~30% of band B; DNAJA2 overexpression reduced band C to below ~40% of initial levels (versus ~80% retention in vector control), indicating markedly reduced maturation/stability. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 5-8)

2.4. Anti-aggregation chaperoning: tau (MAPT) amyloid suppression
DNAJA2 is an experimentally supported suppressor of tau amyloid formation. In vitro Thioflavin-T assays show DNAJA2 can completely inhibit tau fibril formation for >16 hours under tested conditions, and even at sub-stoichiometric DNAJA2:tau ratios it reduces fibril length and mass. (irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 3-5, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 10-12)

Quantitative tau inhibition and binding data include:
• At DNAJA2:tau = 0.5:1, an 88% reduction in fibril mass was reported; at 0.25:1 most fibers were 0.5–2.0 µm; at 0.5:1 fibers were too short to be detected. (irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 10-12)
• Fluorescence anisotropy binding affinities: for preformed tau4R fibrils, KD ≈ 7.6 ± 0.6 µM for DNAJA2 (and 1.7 ± 0.2 µM for DNAJB1); for monomeric tau, DNAJA2 binds with relatively low affinity KD ≈ 43 ± 8 µM (no monomer binding observed for DNAJB1). (irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 3-5, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 12-14)

Mechanistically, DNAJA2 uses at least two binding sites: CTDI recognizes inert monomeric tau (consistent with interaction around PHF6/PHF6*), while CTDII binds aggregation-prone tau species and mature fibers, allowing DNAJA2 to suppress both nucleation and elongation. (irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 14-15, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 12-14)

A systems-level chaperone–tau survey identified DNAJA2 as a potent inhibitor across a large interaction matrix (~30 chaperones × ~20 tau variants ≈ 600 combinations), and reported correlation of DNAJA2 levels with tau pathology in human brain samples, supporting biological relevance beyond in vitro assays. (mok2018mappinginteractionswith pages 1-3)

2.5. Centrosome/mitosis quality control via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and innate immunity coupling (2023)
Huang et al. (Nature Communications, 2023-08) provide evidence that DNAJA2 localizes to centrosomes (colocalizing with centrosomal markers and Hsc70) and is required for centrosome homeostasis by promoting timely degradation of centriolar satellite proteins PCM1 and CEP290 through Hsc70-dependent chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) requiring the lysosomal receptor LAMP2A. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 2-3, huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2)

Loss of DNAJA2 leads to abnormal mitosis and chromosome instability:
• Approximately ~50% of DNAJA2-deficient mitotic HeLa cells showed abnormal spindles (multipolar/monopolar/diffuse). (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2)
• Chromosome alignment was perturbed: ~80% of WT cells had well-aligned chromosomes versus ~55% in DNAJA2-depleted cells; WT abnormal alignment/lagging chromosomes ~20%. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 2-3)

Mechanistic evidence that PCM1 is a CMA substrate includes co-immunoprecipitation of PCM1 with Hsc70 in WT but not DNAJA2−/− cells and dependence on PCM1 KFERQ-like motifs (CMA-inaccessible PCM1-2AA mutant). (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 6-7)

These mitotic defects generate micronuclei that activate the cGAS–STING pathway; DNAJA2 depletion increased phosphorylation of STING/TBK1/STAT1 and increased expression of IFNβ and interferon-stimulated genes (e.g., ISG15, IRF7, CXCL10), and these changes were reduced by cGAS or STING double knockout. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 7-9)

2.6. Genome maintenance: transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER) via DNAJA2–Hsc70 CMA of CSB (2023)
Huang et al. (Cell Discovery, 2023-10) show DNAJA2 facilitates Hsc70-dependent CMA to degrade CSB (Cockayne syndrome B protein) during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. DNAJA2 interacts with CSB and enables Hsc70 to recognize sumoylated CSB, triggering CSB (and associated RNA polymerase II) removal from UV lesion sites in a LAMP2A-dependent manner; defects in DNAJA2/Hsc70/LAMP2A abolish CSB degradation and block TC-NER. (huang2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2)

The study provides evidence that CSB must translocate from nucleus to cytosol for lysosomal degradation: nuclear export inhibition with leptomycin B largely blocks UV-induced CSB degradation, increases chromatin-bound CSB and Pol II 2 h after UV, and delays CPD removal and TC-NER activity. (huang2023heatshockprotein pages 8-10)

3. Recent developments and latest research emphasis (2023–2024)

3.1. 2023: Structural regulation by self-assembly
The 2023 structural work establishes a new regulatory paradigm for a class A JDP: DNAJA2 can store J-domains in an ordered scaffolded tubular assembly, and Hsc70 ATPase cycling can dismantle that assembly to release active dimers with enhanced unfolded-client binding, linking supramolecular assembly to functional switching under stress. (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 1-2, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 8-10)

3.2. 2023: DNAJA2 as a CMA specificity factor in mitosis and DNA repair
Two independent 2023 studies position DNAJA2 as a factor that can “present” specific substrates (PCM1/CEP290 in centrosome homeostasis; SUMO-CSB in TC-NER) to the Hsc70/LAMP2A CMA pathway, suggesting DNAJA2 can function beyond generic folding assistance as a specificity determinant for selective lysosomal degradation. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2, huang2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2)

3.3. 2024: limitations of currently retrieved DNAJA2-specific primary evidence
Within the retrieved set, 2024 DNAJA2-specific mechanistic primary studies were limited. A 2024 ischemic stroke genetics paper referencing DNAJA2 SNP associations was retrieved, but numeric extraction was not successful from available text segments; therefore, this report does not reproduce those genetics statistics beyond what is explicitly present in other evidence. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

4. Current applications and real-world implementations

4.1. Proteostasis modulation in cystic fibrosis (CFTR)
DNAJA2’s capacity to direct CFTR toward degradation suggests a therapeutic angle: inhibiting the Hsp70 system can increase levels of mature CFTR and improve function of ΔF508-CFTR when combined with a corrector (VX809) in the reported system, supporting chaperone network modulation as a strategy in CFTR misfolding disease. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2)

4.2. Neurodegeneration: tau aggregation suppression
DNAJA2’s direct inhibition of tau amyloid formation, combined with the reported correlation of DNAJA2 levels with tau pathology in human brains, positions it as a candidate modifier of tau proteostasis (e.g., via augmenting specific chaperone activities or preventing seeding/propagation). However, practical therapeutic targeting remains indirect (e.g., via proteostasis network modulation rather than DNAJA2-specific drugs in current evidence). (mok2018mappinginteractionswith pages 1-3, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 10-12)

4.3. Cancer immunotherapy: leveraging cGAS–STING activation via DNAJA2/CMA disruption
The 2023 centrosome/CMA study suggests DNAJA2 deficiency (or CMA disruption) increases micronuclei and activates cGAS–STING, enhancing response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in tumor models, while DNAJA2 overexpression or LAMP2A overexpression is associated with ICB resistance in the described experiments. This supports DNAJA2/CMA components as potential biomarkers or intervention points for immunotherapy sensitization strategies. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 11-12, huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 7-9)

Open Targets also reports a DNAJA2 association with neoplasm (score ~0.092; evidence count=1 in the returned query), consistent with emerging interest in DNAJA2 in cancer-related contexts. ()

4.4. Clinical trials status
A clinical trial registry search for “DNAJA2” returned no DNAJA2-focused trials in the retrieved results, suggesting no direct interventional programs targeting DNAJA2 are captured by this search at present. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 24-25)

5. Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative synthesis)

5.1. JDPs as specificity determinants for Hsp70
Reviews of J-domain proteins emphasize that JDPs are critical determinants of Hsp70 functional specificity by stimulating Hsp70 ATPase and presenting clients; DNAJA2 fits this paradigm as a class A JDP with multi-domain client binding. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

5.2. A unifying model for DNAJA2 functional annotation
Across multiple primary studies, DNAJA2 can be functionally annotated as a “client-selective Hsc70 co-chaperone” that:
• binds aggregation-prone protein conformers (e.g., tau intermediates/fibers) to suppress aggregation, and
• biases quality-control decisions toward degradation through either proteasomal ERAD (e.g., CFTR with CHIP) or lysosomal CMA (e.g., PCM1/CEP290 and CSB), depending on cellular compartment and accessory factors. (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2, huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2, huang2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 10-12)

6. Key statistics and data highlights (recent/representative)

• DNAJA2 oligomer architecture: tubular assembly ~200 Å width; disk of five dimers; cryo-EM ~8.7–9.2 Å; dissociation kinetics at 40 °C k=0.43 min−1, t1/2=2.3 min; disordered tail ~52 residues (V361–Q412). (velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 3-4, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium pages 1-2, velascocarneros2023theselfassociationequilibrium media 2bf40e8f)
• Mitosis phenotypes: ~50% abnormal spindles in DNAJA2-deficient mitotic HeLa; chromosome alignment ~80% WT aligned vs ~55% DNAJA2-depleted. (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2, huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 2-3)
• Tau binding and inhibition: KD ~43 ± 8 µM for monomeric tau binding; KD ~7.6 ± 0.6 µM for tau4R fibrils; 88% reduction in fibril mass at 0.5:1 DNAJA2:tau ratio; strong suppression of fibrillization for >16 h in ThT assays. (irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 3-5, irwin2021hsp40splaycomplementary pages 10-12)
• CFTR maturation/degradation: DNAJA2 overexpression reduces mature CFTR band C to <40% of initial levels (vs ~80% in control), with J-domain dependence and proteasome-inhibitor rescue (MG132). (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 5-8)

7. Subcellular localization summary (evidence-based)
DNAJA2 is experimentally linked to multiple cellular locales consistent with its client spectrum:
• Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation context (CFTR ERAD through Hsc70/Hsp70 + CHIP). (chiaw2019hsp70anddnaja2 pages 1-2)
• Centrosomes/centriolar satellites (colocalization with centrosome markers and Hsc70; regulates PCM1/CEP290 turnover via CMA). (huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 2-3, huang2023dnaja2deficiencyactivates pages 1-2)
• Nuclear chromatin lesion context with required nuclear export to cytosol for CMA degradation of CSB (TC-NER regulation). (huang2023heatshockprotein pages 8-10, huang2023heatshockprotein pages 1-2)
• Nuclear/chromatin remodeling context through interaction with HIRA and pRB and promotion of SAHF upon ectopic expression. (ye2007definitionofprb pages 10-12)

8. Notes on evidence gaps and caution
• 2024 human genetics statistics: While a 2024 ischemic stroke paper was retrieved, the available extracted text did not yield the requested DNAJA2 SNP statistics in a citable evidence snippet in this run; accordingly, the report does not restate those statistics without direct extraction. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)
• Some mechanistic assertions (e.g., broad disease implications) are best supported by direct primary studies cited above; where only review-level or indirect evidence exists in the retrieved corpus, conclusions are stated cautiously. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)
