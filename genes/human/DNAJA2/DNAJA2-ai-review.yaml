description: >-
  DNAJA2 (DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 2) is a class I J-domain protein (HSP40
  co-chaperone) that functions as a co-chaperone for HSP70 family members. It contains
  an N-terminal J domain (with conserved HPD motif) that stimulates the ATPase activity
  of HSP70, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region, a zinc-finger cysteine-rich domain
  (CR-type, with four CXXCXGXG repeats coordinating two zinc ions) involved in substrate
  recognition, and two C-terminal beta-barrel substrate-binding domains (CTDI and CTDII)
  plus a dimerization domain. DNAJA2 participates in the HSP70-mediated foldase pathway,
  delivering unfolded or misfolded protein substrates to HSP70 and stimulating ATP
  hydrolysis to promote productive protein refolding. It is farnesylated at Cys-409
  and localized to the cytosol and membranes. DNAJA2 works in combination with specific
  nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) to generate functionally distinct HSP70 chaperone
  complexes. A key structural feature is that DNAJA2 reversibly self-assembles into
  highly ordered tubular oligomers (~200 angstrom width, D5 symmetry disks of five
  dimers) that can dissociate into active dimers; this self-association equilibrium
  is temperature-sensitive (heat shock at 40 degrees C promotes dissociation with
  t1/2 ~2.3 min) and regulates its client-binding ("holding") activity and productive
  interaction with Hsc70 (DOI:10.1038/s41467-023-41150-8). Beyond general protein
  refolding, DNAJA2 functions as a client-selective Hsc70 co-chaperone that can bias
  quality-control decisions toward degradation through ERAD (e.g., CFTR with CHIP,
  DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0220984) or chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) of specific
  substrates such as PCM1/CEP290 at centrosomes (DOI:10.1038/s41467-023-40952-0)
  and CSB during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair
  (DOI:10.1038/s41421-023-00601-8). DNAJA2 also potently suppresses tau amyloid
  formation in vitro by binding both monomeric tau and preformed fibrils through
  distinct C-terminal domains (DOI:10.7554/elife.69601).

      in yeast when overexpressed. This is a heterologous overexpression assay in yeast
      and does not demonstrate a specific role in positive regulation of cell proliferation
      in human cells. The effect is most likely attributable to general HSP40 chaperone
      activity assisting cell cycle protein homeostasis rather than a direct
      proliferation-regulatory function. No subsequent studies have established DNAJA2
      as a specific regulator of cell proliferation.

          We have identified 13 human CPR (cell cycle progression restoration) genes and
          11 yeast OPY (overproduction-induced pheromone-resistant yeast) genes that
          specifically block the G1 arrest by mating pheromone. The CPR genes represent
          a variety of biochemical functions including a new cyclin, a tumor suppressor
          binding protein, chaperones, transcription factors, translation factors,
          RNA-binding proteins, as well as novel proteins.

      DNAJA2 is a class I J-domain co-chaperone (foldase-type) that delivers unfolded or
      misfolded protein substrates to HSP70 for productive ATP-dependent refolding. Its
      domain architecture includes an N-terminal J domain (HPD motif), a Gly/Phe-rich
      region, a zinc-finger cysteine-rich domain (four CXXCXGXG repeats coordinating two
      zinc ions) for substrate recognition, two C-terminal beta-barrel substrate-binding
      domains (CTDI and CTDII), and a dimerization domain. DNAJA2 reversibly self-assembles
      into highly ordered tubular oligomers (~200 angstrom width, D5 symmetry disks of
      five dimers) that serve as a storage form; heat shock (40 degrees C) drives rapid
      dissociation into active dimers (t1/2 ~2.3 min), and Hsc70 ATPase cycling coupled
      to J-domain interaction triggers oligomer disassembly
      (DOI:10.1038/s41467-023-41150-8). Beyond general protein refolding, DNAJA2 acts
      as a client-selective Hsc70 co-chaperone that can bias quality-control decisions
      toward degradation through ERAD (e.g., CFTR with Hsc70/CHIP,
      DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0220984) or chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) of
      specific substrates such as PCM1/CEP290 at centrosomes
      (DOI:10.1038/s41467-023-40952-0) and CSB during TC-NER
      (DOI:10.1038/s41421-023-00601-8). DNAJA2 also potently suppresses tau amyloid
      formation using distinct CTDI (monomer-binding) and CTDII (fibril-binding)
      sites, achieving 88% reduction in fibril mass at sub-stoichiometric ratios
      (DOI:10.7554/elife.69601). DNAJA2 works in combination with specific nucleotide
      exchange factors (NEFs) to generate functionally distinct HSP70 chaperone complexes
      with varying foldase potency.

          Overexpressed chaperones that suppressed polyQ aggregation were found not to
          be able to stimulate luciferase refolding. Inversely, chaperones that

          activity of the combinations in ATPase and luciferase refolding assays were
          dependent on the identity and stoichiometry of both the J protein and NEF so
          that some combinations were potent chaperones, whereas others were inactive.

    description: >-
      DNAJA2 stimulates the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP70 (HSPA1A/B, HSPA8/Hsc70)
      through its conserved J-domain HPD motif, driving the HSP70 chaperone cycle for
      substrate binding, folding, and release. Directly demonstrated in vitro with
      purified recombinant DNAJA2, Hsp72, and nucleotide exchange factors
      (PMID:24318877). The J-domain interaction is also critical for DNAJA2 oligomer
      regulation: an HPD-to-QPN mutation prevents productive Hsc70 engagement and
      impairs ATP-dependent oligomer disassembly, supporting the model that J-domain-
      stimulated ATPase cycling triggers release of active DNAJA2 dimers from the
      tubular storage form (DOI:10.1038/s41467-023-41150-8). ATPase stimulation is
      also required for DNAJA2-dependent degradation functions, as the J-domain
      deletion mutant (DJA2-deltaJ) fails to promote CFTR ERAD
      (DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0220984).
