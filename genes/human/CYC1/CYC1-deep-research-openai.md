## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene CYC1 (P08574) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Overview of CYC1 (Cytochrome c1) in Human Mitochondria

**CYC1** is the gene encoding **cytochrome c1**, a heme-containing protein that is an integral subunit of the mitochondrial **cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex** (Complex III of the respiratory chain) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,proximal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9976869/#:~:text=Introduction%3A)). Complex III is a multi-subunit enzyme in the inner mitochondrial membrane that **transfers electrons from ubiquinol (coenzyme QH₂) to cytochrome c**, contributing to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,1%7D%20Cytochrome%20c_%7B1%7D%20%28Cyt%20c_%7B1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=3%E2%80%90phosphate%20dehydrogenase%29,2%7D%20in%20this)). Cytochrome c1 plays a **central role in this electron transfer**, serving as the bridge between the *Rieske* iron–sulfur protein and the mobile cytochrome c carrier ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)). In essence, CYC1’s product is a **redox-active component** of oxidative phosphorylation, crucial for cellular energy production ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9976869/#:~:text=Introduction%3A)). Mutations in CYC1 can destabilize cytochrome c1 and impair Complex III function, underscoring its essential role in mitochondrial respiration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=affected%20individuals,stability%20and%20complex%20III%20activity)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4864557/#:~:text=In%20our%20previous%20report%2C%20CYC1,role%20of%20CYC1%20in%20tumor)).

## Protein Structure and Cellular Localization

Human cytochrome c1 is synthesized as a precursor in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, where it is incorporated into Complex III. The mature protein is anchored in the **inner mitochondrial membrane** by a single C-terminal transmembrane helix ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=and%20IV%20,proximal)), with its N-terminal domain protruding into the **intermembrane space** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=and%20IV%20,proximal)) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=Transmembrane%20Regions%20282,Mitochondrion%20inner%20membrane%20Gene%20sequence)). Cytochrome c1 is a **c-type cytochrome**, meaning it contains a heme *c* cofactor covalently attached to the protein via two thioether bonds (formed by a CXXCH motif) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=by%20deletion%20of%20a%20stretch,helix)). The heme attachment and maturation of cytochrome c1 require the mitochondrial enzyme **holocytochrome c synthase (HCCS)**, which catalyzes heme ligation for both cytochrome c and cytochrome c1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11991887/#:~:text=eukaryotes%20requires%20the%20mitochondrial%20enzyme,are%20like%20yeast%20and%20encode)). This covalently bound heme is located in the intermembrane-space domain of cytochrome c1 and is the redox-active center that accepts and donates electrons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=and%20IV%20,proximal)). 

Structurally, cytochrome c1 is about 30 kDa in size and is one of three catalytic subunits of Complex III. It associates with **cytochrome b** (a multi-helical protein that binds quinone) and the **Rieske iron–sulfur protein** (which contains a [2Fe–2S] cluster) to form the functional core of the bc₁ complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=electrons%20from%20ubiquinol%20to%20cytochrome,terminal%20domain%2C%20located%20in%20the)). High-resolution structural studies have shown that Complex III is a dimer (two copies of cytochrome b, c1, and Rieske protein form a functional dimeric complex) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=3%E2%80%90phosphate%20dehydrogenase%29,2%7D%20in%20this)). In this dimer, cytochrome c1 features an extended loop on its surface that contacts the c1 subunit from the opposite monomer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=protein%20form%20compact%20molecules%20each,avian%2C%20mammalian%2C%20and%20fungal%20mitochondrial)). This unique 25-Å loop is conserved in mammalian and fungal cytochrome c1 and likely helps stabilize the dimeric complex ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=protein%E2%80%9D%29%2C%20and%20the%20mono,The%20loop%20motif%20is)). Thus, cytochrome c1’s structure is specialized for its role: a membrane-anchored globular domain containing the heme cofactor positioned to interact with its redox partners in the intermembrane space.

## Function in Electron Transport (Complex III Activity)

**Primary function – electron transfer:** The cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex (Complex III) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from **ubiquinol (QH₂)** to **cytochrome c**, while pumping protons across the inner membrane – a mechanism known as the **Q cycle** ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=ATP%20synthase.%20The%20cytochrome%20b,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)). Cytochrome c1 is the subunit that directly interacts with **cytochrome c**, the small mobile electron carrier in the intermembrane space. In each catalytic cycle, cytochrome c1’s heme *c* accepts an electron from the Rieske iron–sulfur protein and then **reduces a molecule of cytochrome c** by transferring that electron to cytochrome c’s heme ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)). Two such one-electron transfer events occur for every ubiquinol molecule oxidized: effectively, **two cytochrome c molecules are reduced per ubiquinol**, coupled with proton translocation to the intermembrane space ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)). Cytochrome c1, therefore, acts as a critical *electron conduit* that facilitates this conversion of a two-electron carrier (ubiquinol) into two one-electron carriers (cytochrome c), which then ferry electrons to Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=molecules%20are%20oxidized%20to%20Q%2C,electron%20transport%20chain%2C%20another%204)). 

**Q-cycle and proton pumping:** In the Q cycle mechanism, Complex III oxidizes one ubiquinol molecule in two steps, releasing its two electrons along two separate pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)). One electron travels via the Rieske [2Fe–2S] cluster to cytochrome c1 and then to cytochrome c, while the other electron cycles through cytochrome b and a second quinone binding site, resulting in the reduction of another quinone molecule ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)). As a result, **4 protons are released to the intermembrane space** (and 2 protons taken up from the matrix) for each pair of electrons transferred, contributing to the proton gradient ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=ATP%20synthase.%20The%20cytochrome%20b,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,2%7D%20in%20this)). Although cytochrome c1 itself does not directly bind quinone or pump protons, it is an indispensable part of this proton-coupled electron transfer. It **accepts electrons from the Rieske protein’s cluster** (once the Rieske domain moves into proximity) and ensures efficient hand-off to cytochrome c ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)). This coordinated electron transfer is tightly linked to proton movement via conformational changes in the complex, and cytochrome c1’s role is purely **electron transfer between protein carriers**. In summary, **the reaction catalyzed by Complex III**, to which cytochrome c1 contributes, can be written in a simplified form as: 

> QH₂ + 2 cytochrome c (oxidized) → Q + 2 cytochrome c (reduced) + 4 H⁺ (released to intermembrane space) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)).

Notably, cytochrome c1’s heme must cycle between Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ states as it carries electrons. The **substrate specificity** of cytochrome c1 is effectively the protein **cytochrome c** – it binds cytochrome c transiently to reduce it. Structural studies and kinetic experiments have shown that **cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c interact** via complementary charged surfaces to enable rapid electron transfer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3322269/#:~:text=28%3B1817%285%29%3A811%E2%80%93818.%20doi%3A%2010.1016%2Fj.bbabio.2012.01.013%20,1%7D%20Complex%20of%20Rhodobacter%20capsulatus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=protein%E2%80%9D%29%2C%20and%20the%20mono,The%20loop%20motif%20is)). This interaction is highly conserved; for example, bacterial bc₁ complexes use cytochrome c<sub>2</sub> in place of mitochondrial cytochrome c, but the role of the c<sub>1</sub> subunit as the electron donor to cytochrome c<sub>2</sub> is analogous ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3322269/#:~:text=Cytochrome%20c1%20and%20Cytochrome%20c2,1%7D%20Complex%20of%20Rhodobacter%20capsulatus)). The importance of this function is highlighted by mutational analyses: alterations in cytochrome c1 that disrupt binding to cytochrome c or the Rieske protein can abolish electron flow through Complex III ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3322269/#:~:text=Cytochrome%20c1%20and%20Cytochrome%20c2,1%7D%20Complex%20of%20Rhodobacter%20capsulatus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=of%20the%20hyperthermophilic%20bacterium%20Aquifex,represents%20an%20extension%20of%20the)).

## Biological Pathways and Processes

**Oxidative phosphorylation:** Cytochrome c1 operates in the **mitochondrial electron transport chain**, a central component of **oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)**. Electrons from metabolic fuels (via NADH or FADH₂) reach ubiquinol (coenzyme Q), which then delivers electrons to Complex III. As part of Complex III, cytochrome c1 helps transfer these electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,1%7D%20Cytochrome%20c_%7B1%7D%20%28Cyt%20c_%7B1)). Cytochrome c subsequently carries electrons to Complex IV, where oxygen is reduced to water ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=molecules%20are%20oxidized%20to%20Q%2C,electrochemical%20gradient%20across%20the%20IMM)). The overall process establishes an electrochemical proton gradient used by ATP synthase (Complex V) to generate ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=,Fig%C2%A0%207)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=,electron%20transport%20chain%2C%20another%204)). Thus, **CYC1’s gene product is directly involved in cellular energy production**, linking upstream dehydrogenases (Complex I/II) to downstream oxygen reduction (Complex IV). Loss of cytochrome c1 function blocks electron flow at Complex III, collapsing the proton gradient and severely impairing ATP synthesis. Cells compensate by increasing glycolytic ATP production, which is less efficient and can lead to metabolic imbalances. Indeed, patient cells with CYC1 mutations show deficient Complex III activity and must rely on fermentation for energy, explaining clinical manifestations (e.g. exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis) observed in mitochondrial disorders ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYC1#:~:text=hyperglycemia%2C%20usually%20associated%20with%20infection,Note%3DThe%20disease%20is%20caused%20by)).

**Respiratory supercomplexes:** In mitochondria, Complex III often forms higher-order assemblies with other complexes (e.g. I–III–IV supercomplexes, also called **respirasomes**) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,1%7D%20Cytochrome%20c_%7B1%7D%20%28Cyt%20c_%7B1)). Cytochrome c1 is present in these supercomplexes as part of Complex III<sub>2</sub>, and its interactions are thought to be compatible with supercomplex formation. A recent expert review (Köhler *et al.*, 2023) noted that supercomplex organization may enhance electron transfer efficiency under certain conditions, though the degree of advantage is still debated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=can%20operate%20independently%2C%20they%20are,strategies%20to%20overcome%20these%20obstacles)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=3%E2%80%90phosphate%20dehydrogenase%29,2%7D%20in%20this)). In respirasomes, cytochrome c1 would operate similarly, except cytochrome c may transfer electrons preferentially within the supercomplex, potentially minimizing diffusion distance. Some studies propose that the **structural role** of supercomplexes (stabilizing complexes and minimizing reactive oxygen species) might be more important than a direct catalytic enhancement ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=can%20operate%20independently%2C%20they%20are,strategies%20to%20overcome%20these%20obstacles)). Regardless, **the presence of cytochrome c1 in all known supercomplex structures** highlights that its function is requisite in any assembled state of the respiratory chain. The conservation of cytochrome c1 from bacteria to humans – including key residues for heme binding and protein–protein interactions – reflects its fundamental role in **bioenergetics** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20%28the%20%E2%80%9Ccytochrome%20bc_,contains%20a%20loop%20that%20protrudes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=second%20half%20of%20the%20dimeric,stretch%20in%20all%20these%20enzymes)).

**Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation:** While the primary role of cytochrome c1 is benign electron transport, the Complex III Q-cycle can inadvertently produce ROS. During the Q-cycle, a semiquinone intermediate at the *Qi* site of cytochrome b can react with oxygen to form superoxide. As part of Complex III, cytochrome c1 does not directly generate ROS, but **dysfunction or blockage of electron flow at cytochrome c1** can enhance electron leakage to oxygen. Consequently, Complex III (including cytochrome c1) is recognized as one of the main sites of mitochondrial ROS production when electron transfer is impaired or imbalanced ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9976869/#:~:text=Introduction%3A)). This links CYC1 indirectly to oxidative stress: for example, cells overexpressing CYC1 or with hyperactive Complex III might produce more ROS if not properly regulated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9976869/#:~:text=Introduction%3A)). In pathology, excessive ROS from mitochondria can trigger damage and even signal apoptosis, though cytochrome c1 itself is not a signaling molecule. (Notably, it is cytochrome *c* – the downstream partner of c1 – that is released into the cytosol to activate caspases during apoptosis once the mitochondrial membrane is permeabilized.)

## Experimental Evidence and Evolutionary Insights

Multiple lines of **experimental evidence** confirm the function of CYC1 and its gene product’s role in respiration. Biochemical assays have shown that **complex III activity is abolished** if cytochrome c1 is absent or nonfunctional ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=affected%20individuals,stability%20and%20complex%20III%20activity)). In a 2013 study, Gaignard *et al.* demonstrated that patient fibroblasts harboring loss-of-function CYC1 mutations had drastically reduced Complex III enzymatic activity and presented with a respiratory chain deficiency. Importantly, transferring a wild-type CYC1 gene into these mutant cells **restored complex III activity**, proving that the cytochrome c1 defect was causative ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=affected%20individuals,stability%20and%20complex%20III%20activity)). Similarly, studies in model organisms (yeast *CYC1* mutants) show that cytochrome c1 is required for growth on respiratory substrates, and yeast *CYC1* deletions can be rescued by the human gene ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=affected%20individuals,stability%20and%20complex%20III%20activity)). These rescue experiments provide **precise evidence** that CYC1’s role is both necessary and specific: it cannot be compensated by other proteins in the electron transport chain. 

Structurally, cytochrome c1 has been examined through X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM as part of the bc₁ complex. The **X-ray structure of mitochondrial complex III** (e.g. from chicken heart mitochondria, ~2.9 Å resolution) and recent cryo-EM structures of mammalian supercomplexes have visualized cytochrome c1 in situ, confirming its single transmembrane anchor and exposed heme domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20%28the%20%E2%80%9Ccytochrome%20bc_,contains%20a%20loop%20that%20protrudes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=protein%20form%20compact%20molecules%20each,avian%2C%20mammalian%2C%20and%20fungal%20mitochondrial)). These structures also illustrate the proximity of cytochrome c1’s heme to the docking site of cytochrome c, and the mobile interface with the Rieske protein that swings between cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 during catalysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20%28the%20%E2%80%9Ccytochrome%20bc_,contains%20a%20loop%20that%20protrudes)) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)). **Evolutionary analyses** indicate that cytochrome c1 is ancient and conserved across diverse species of bacteria and eukaryotes. Interestingly, research comparing cytochrome c1 to bacterial cytochromes suggests that mitochondrial c1 evolved from a **di-heme cytochrome ancestor** by loss of one heme-binding site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=of%20the%20hyperthermophilic%20bacterium%20Aquifex,represents%20an%20extension%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20%28the%20%E2%80%9Ccytochrome%20bc_,contains%20a%20loop%20that%20protrudes)). The modern cytochrome c1 is a “collapsed” version of a two-heme cytochrome, retaining only one heme *c* and a unique structure that likely optimized it for the dimeric bc₁ complex in mitochondria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=of%20the%20hyperthermophilic%20bacterium%20Aquifex,represents%20an%20extension%20of%20the)). This evolutionary insight highlights how critical the single-heme cytochrome c1 became for efficient electron transport – by streamlining a larger di-heme system into a more compact, specialized electron carrier ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=heme%20cytochrome%20c_,gene%20duplication%20and%20subsequent%20diversification)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC539742/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20%28the%20%E2%80%9Ccytochrome%20bc_,contains%20a%20loop%20that%20protrudes)).

## Clinical and Real-World Significance

Given its essential role in energy metabolism, CYC1 and the cytochrome c1 protein have direct clinical relevance. **Inherited mutations in CYC1** result in **mitochondrial Complex III deficiency**, a rare disorder of the respiratory chain ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYC1#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20subunit,See%20more)). One form, identified as **Complex III deficiency, nuclear type 6 (MC3DN6)**, was reported by Gaignard *et al.* (2013) in patients with **insulin-responsive hyperglycemia** and muscle weakness ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=10,Article)). In these patients, muscle and fibroblast analyses showed isolated Complex III dysfunction (with other complexes intact), linking the disease to CYC1 mutations ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYC1#:~:text=hyperglycemia%2C%20usually%20associated%20with%20infection,Note%3DThe%20disease%20is%20caused%20by)). The unusual hyperglycemia phenotype is thought to arise from an energy deficit in muscle and other tissues: cells cannot utilize glucose efficiently via OXPHOS, leading to secondary metabolic effects ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYC1#:~:text=hyperglycemia%2C%20usually%20associated%20with%20infection,Note%3DThe%20disease%20is%20caused%20by)). This underscores the precise role of cytochrome c1 in normal physiology – when it fails, the result is a systemic energy crisis that can manifest with organ-specific symptoms. Although such genetic disorders are rare, they illustrate that **cytochrome c1 is indispensable for human health**. There is no redundant backup for its function in the electron transport chain, making it a single point of potential failure in metabolism.

Beyond genetic diseases, cytochrome c1 (and Complex III) is of interest in pharmacology and biotech. **Complex III is a known drug target** in pathogens: for example, the antimalarial drug **atovaquone** targets the cytochrome *bc*<sub>1</sub> complex of *Plasmodium falciparum*, inhibiting electron transport at the ubiquinol binding site ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11991887/#:~:text=inhibited%20by%20the%20current%20antimalarial,for%20ETC%20activity%20and%20parasite)). Although atovaquone binds the cytochrome *b* subunit, the downstream effect is to block cytochrome c1 from receiving electrons, thus collapsing the parasite’s mitochondrial membrane potential. Complex III inhibitors (like atovaquone or the fungicide **strobilurin** compounds) demonstrate the critical nature of the bc₁ complex: **blocking cytochrome c1’s function kills the cell by energy starvation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11991887/#:~:text=inhibited%20by%20the%20current%20antimalarial,for%20ETC%20activity%20and%20parasite)). This principle is also exploited experimentally by using **antimycin A**, a classic inhibitor that locks cytochrome b/c<sub>1</sub> in a reduced state, to study respiratory control. In cancer research, shifts in mitochondrial function have been observed involving CYC1: tumors with high oxidative metabolism sometimes upregulate electron transport components. A recent study (Han *et al.*, 2016) found **CYC1 overexpression in breast cancer** correlating with poor prognosis, suggesting that cancer cells modulate mitochondrial Complex III to meet energy demands ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4864557/#:~:text=In%20our%20previous%20report%2C%20CYC1,found%20silencing%20CYC1%20suppressed%20metastasis)). However, targeting cytochrome c1 in human therapy is challenging because of its essential nature in normal cells; thus, current drug strategies aim at pathogen-specific differences in Complex III ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11991887/#:~:text=falciparum%20Mitochondrial%20Complex%20III%2C%20the,Google%20Scholar)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11991887/#:~:text=other%20metazoans%20retain%20a%20single,26%7D%20and%20the)).

In summary, the human CYC1 gene encodes a **pivotal mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c1**, that is central to the life-sustaining process of **aerobic energy production**. Its **primary function** is to mediate electron transfer within Complex III, handing off electrons from the bc₁ complex to cytochrome c, which is a linchpin step in **ATP generation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,proximal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=obligate%20homodimer%20%28CIII_,carrier%2C%20with%20a%20central%2C%20covalently)). Cytochrome c1 is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and structurally tailored for its role, containing a covalently bound heme c and a transmembrane anchor that positions it for efficient electron tunneling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=and%20IV%20,proximal)) ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=across%20the%20membrane%20as%20hydrogens,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)). It operates within the **biochemical pathway of oxidative phosphorylation**, and its activity is coupled to proton pumping that drives ATP synthase ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=ATP%20synthase.%20The%20cytochrome%20b,Rieske%20protein%20to%20cytochrome%20c)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=,electron%20transport%20chain%2C%20another%204)). Decades of research, from early biochemical characterizations ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/polypeptides/P08574#:~:text=1,JL%2C%20Cuomo%20CA%2C%20Dewar%20K)) to modern structural and genetic studies, all converge on the understanding that **without cytochrome c1, Complex III cannot function** – a failure that cells and organisms cannot tolerate. Thus, CYC1 is both **conserved and essential**, a testament to its singular role in biology. Future research continues to explore how this protein and its complex are assembled, regulated, and can be targeted or protected in disease, but its core function in electron transport and energy conversion remains firmly established in the canon of biochemistry ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10626428/#:~:text=The%20mitochondrial%20respiratory%20chain%20,However%2C%20the%20jury%20is%20still)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3738829/#:~:text=Complex%20III%20,proximal)).
