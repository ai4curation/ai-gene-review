## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P48431
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transcription factor SOX-2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SOX2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** HMG_box_dom. (IPR009071); HMG_box_dom_sf. (IPR036910); SOX_fam. (IPR022097); SRY-related_HMG-box_TF-like. (IPR050140); HMG_box (PF00505)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SOX2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SOX2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SOX2** (gene ID: SOX2, UniProt: P48431) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human SOX2 (UniProt P48431)

Plan summary and verification
- Identity/domain verification: SOX2 is a human SRY-related HMG-box transcription factor with a conserved HMG DNA-binding domain and nuclear localization/export signals, consistent with UniProt P48431 and recent literature describing its HMG box, NLS/NES, and cooperative binding with OCT4 on composite Sox/Oct motifs (URLs: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.83157; domain overview and motifs) (langroudi2023evaluatingtherole pages 39-42).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and domains: SOX2 contains a ~79-aa HMG box that binds the minor groove of cognate sequences (consensus WWCAAW; commonly the core TTGT) and bends DNA. It also carries nuclear localization and export signals overlapping regulatory regions that control nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 1-2, langroudi2023evaluatingtherole pages 39-42). The HMG box mediates base- and shape-reading of DNA and enables pioneer-like chromatin engagement (ozden2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-2).
- DNA recognition and OCT4 cooperativity: Structural biophysics and NMR show that SOX2’s HMG domain binds nucleosomal DNA in a site- and sequence-dependent manner and forms synergistic complexes with full-length OCT4 on adjacent Sox/Oct motifs, with cooperativity enhanced at nucleosome edges (URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167916; published Jan 30, 2023) (gadea2023structuralplasticityof pages 1-3). Mechanistically, SOX2 and OCT4 co-occupy thousands of OSN (OCT4/SOX2/NANOG) enhancers in pluripotent cells (URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2024.03.003; published May 14, 2024) (tsaytler2024earlyneuralspecification pages 1-2).
- Pioneer factor function: Acute degron-based depletion demonstrates that SOX2 maintains chromatin accessibility at a subset of its sites; thousands of ATAC-seq peaks are lost within ~1 hour of SOX2 degradation, and these SOX2-maintained sites are highly predictive of nearby nascent transcription (URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022113150; published Sep 2023) (maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2). Reviews and modeling converge that SOX2, with OCT4 and KLF4, exemplifies pioneer factors that can engage nucleosomal DNA and facilitate chromatin opening (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-024-01205-6; published Jul 4, 2024) (orsetti2024structuraldynamicsin pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization: SOX2 is nuclear; its HMG region and flanking sequences include NLS/NES, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) modulate nuclear export and stability (langroudi2023evaluatingtherole pages 39-42, seo2024acomprehensiveunderstanding pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024) and latest research
- Nucleosome engagement and positional specificity: Integrating NMR, biochemistry, and molecular modeling, SOX2 binds solvent-exposed nucleosomal sites with position dependence, forming super-stable complexes at SHL+5 and preferring SHL2 shapes; suboptimal sites promote partially unfolded, dynamic SOX2 states. OCT4 stabilizes SOX2 bending and engagement on specific adjacent motifs (2023; J Mol Biol) (gadea2023structuralplasticityof pages 1-3). Complementary modeling/biophysics show concurrent base-specific contacts (Arg51, Asn54, Tyr118) and shape-reading are required for sequence-specific nucleosomal recognition, especially at SHL2 (2023; JCIM) (ozden2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-2).
- Quantitative pioneer activity in cells: Acute SOX2 depletion produces rapid loss of thousands of accessible regions within ~1 hour; sites maintained by SOX2 most strongly predict transcriptional output, functionally validated at the Klf2 regulatory element by CRISPR (2023; EMBO J) (maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2).
- Early neural specification logic: A 2024 Stem Cell Reports study identifies 1,898 SOX2-dependent neural-associated enhancers among 8,531 OSN-bound enhancers. Using dTAG-mediated rapid SOX2 ablation (SOX2 reduced to ~1.5%, 1.2%, 0.3% at 2/12/24 h), authors show these enhancers transiently activate immediately upon neural induction to prime Pax6 and other neural fate genes, but close rapidly under mesodermal cues (URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2024.03.003; May 14, 2024) (tsaytler2024earlyneuralspecification pages 1-2).
- Developmental/cancer enhancer control of SOX2: A 2023 Nucleic Acids Research paper maps a distal enhancer cluster, SRR124–134 (~124–134 kb downstream), required for SOX2 overexpression in breast and lung adenocarcinoma; deleting the cluster reduces SOX2, reprograms chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes, and correlates with patient tumor accessibility. The conserved SRR124/134 elements are essential for mouse development; homozygous deletion causes lethal failure of tracheoesophageal separation (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad734; Sep 2023) (abatti2023epigeneticreprogrammingof pages 1-2).
- PTM regulation in cancer: In colorectal cancer models, acetylation at K75 within the SOX2 NES, mediated by CBP/p300 and ACSS3/ACSS2, promotes nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, while HDAC4 (regulated by miR-29a) deacetylates K75; O-GlcNAcylation at S246 further stabilizes/regulates SOX2 (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16051035; Mar 3, 2024) (seo2024acomprehensiveunderstanding pages 1-2). In neural stem cells, SUMOylation of SOX2 is required for transcriptional repression of centrosome/centromere and cell-cycle genes and for proliferative restraint (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298818; Mar 2024) (marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 22-23, marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 1-2).
- Pluripotency network context: Recent reviews reinforce that OCT4/SOX2/NANOG are core master regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal, operating with signaling (LIF/BMP, TGF-β family), chromatin remodeling, and epigenetic modulators (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098386; May 7, 2023) (varzideh2023molecularmechanismsunderlying pages 1-3).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- iPSC reprogramming: SOX2 is one of the original Yamanaka factors used for reprogramming human somatic cells to iPSCs and remains a standard component of protocols across cell sources, leveraged for disease modeling and regenerative medicine (varzideh2023molecularmechanismsunderlying pages 1-3). SOX2’s pioneer activity and collaboration with OCT4/KLF4 underlie enhancer priming and chromatin opening during reprogramming (maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2, orsetti2024structuraldynamicsin pages 1-3).
- Enhancer targeting and biomarker translation: In breast and lung adenocarcinoma, SRR124–134 accessibility correlates with SOX2 overexpression in primary tumors, suggesting enhancer-state biomarkers and potential CRISPR-interrogated regulatory dependencies (abatti2023epigeneticreprogrammingof pages 1-2). In SCLC, clinical-pathologic frameworks increasingly consider lineage transcription factors and genomic amplifications (including 3q arms harboring SOX2) as part of emerging molecular stratification schemas and trial design (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-024-00914-x; Jul 2024) (sen2024emergingadvancesin pages 1-3).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Pioneer factors and chromatin: A 2024 Biophysical Reviews synthesis argues that multiple structures of TF–nucleosome complexes now clarify binding positions and the open question of whether PFs directly open nucleosomes versus recruiting remodelers. The review highlights SOX2/OCT4/KLF4 as canonical pioneers central to cell-fate transitions and recommends integrating NMR with molecular dynamics to resolve dynamic opening events (orsetti2024structuraldynamicsin pages 1-3). The EMBO Journal study provides in vivo functional criteria for SOX2 “pioneer-maintained” sites that are most predictive of gene activation, sharpening how to distinguish activating from non-activating binding (maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2). Together, these works suggest that SOX2’s context-dependent ability to maintain accessibility is the best predictor of its regulatory impact.

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (with URLs/dates)
- Acute loss-of-function kinetics: SOX2 protein eliminated within ~2 h using dTAG; ATAC-seq revealed 784 and 3,001 DARs at 12 h and 24 h, respectively, and thousands of SOX2-maintained accessible sites lost within ~1 h, with strong coupling to nascent transcription (EMBO J 2023; https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022113150; Sep 2023; Stem Cell Reports 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2024.03.003; May 14, 2024) (maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2, tsaytler2024earlyneuralspecification pages 1-2).
- Neural enhancers: 1,898 SOX2-dependent neural-associated enhancers among 8,531 OSN-bound enhancers; SOX2 protein reduced to ~1.5%, 1.2%, 0.3% at 2/12/24 h in KO, with neural induction rapidly activating these enhancers and up-regulating Pax6 (Stem Cell Reports 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2024.03.003) (tsaytler2024earlyneuralspecification pages 1-2).
- Structural determinants of nucleosome engagement: At SHL2 and SHL+5, SOX2 achieves sequence- and shape-specific nucleosome recognition; key HMG residues (Arg51, Asn54, Tyr118) mediate base-specific recognition, and solvation/exposure (solvent-facing DNA) favors binding (JCIM 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01520; Jun 12, 2023; J Mol Biol 2023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167916; Jan 30, 2023) (ozden2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-2, gadea2023structuralplasticityof pages 1-3).
- Developmental enhancer control of SOX2: Deletion of SRR124–134 reduces SOX2, changes chromatin accessibility genome-wide, and in mice SRR124/134 deletion is lethal due to tracheoesophageal separation failure (NAR 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad734) (abatti2023epigeneticreprogrammingof pages 1-2).
- PTMs controlling SOX2 behavior: In CRC cells, K75 acetylation (CBP/p300; ACSS3/ACSS2) promotes nuclear export and proteasomal degradation; HDAC4 deacetylates K75 under miR-29a control; O-GlcNAc at S246 regulates SOX2 stability/activity (Cancers 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16051035; Mar 3, 2024). SUMOylation is required for repression of cell-cycle/centrosomal genes in human NSCs and for SOX2-mediated restraint of NSC proliferation (PLOS ONE 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298818; Mar 2024) (seo2024acomprehensiveunderstanding pages 1-2, marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 22-23, marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 1-2).
- Cancer lineage context: Molecular reviews of SCLC note recurrent copy-number alterations including 3q arm (harboring SOX2), underpinning lineage programs and trial development (Nat Rev Clin Oncol 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41571-024-00914-x) (sen2024emergingadvancesin pages 1-3). NAR 2023 further contextualizes SOX2 oncogenic roles across BRCA, GBM, LUAD, and LUSC and shows enhancer misactivation as a likely mechanism of SOX2 overexpression (abatti2023epigeneticreprogrammingof pages 1-2).

Functional annotation summary
- Primary function: SOX2 is a nuclear sequence-specific transcription factor of the SOXB1 family that binds the minor groove via an HMG domain, bends DNA, and partners with OCT4 on composite Sox/Oct motifs to regulate enhancers. As a pioneer factor, SOX2 can bind nucleosomal DNA in a position- and sequence-dependent manner and maintain chromatin accessibility at key regulatory sites that predict transcriptional output (gadea2023structuralplasticityof pages 1-3, ozden2023molecularmechanismof pages 1-2, maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2).
- Cellular localization: Predominantly nuclear; NLS and NES in/around the HMG region and flanks; PTMs (e.g., K75 acetylation) regulate export and stability (langroudi2023evaluatingtherole pages 39-42, seo2024acomprehensiveunderstanding pages 1-2).
- Pathways/biological processes: SOX2 is central to the pluripotency GRN with OCT4/NANOG and primes early neural fate through a dedicated cohort of SOX2-dependent enhancers (varzideh2023molecularmechanismsunderlying pages 1-3, tsaytler2024earlyneuralspecification pages 1-2). In the nervous system, SUMO-dependent repression contributes to NSC proliferative control (marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 22-23, marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 1-2).
- Disease genetics and mechanisms: SOX2 haploinsufficiency is classically linked to anophthalmia/microphthalmia spectrum and broader neurodevelopmental phenotypes (references therein) (marelli2024sumodependenttranscriptionalrepression pages 1-2). In cancer, SOX2 is frequently overexpressed or amplified (3q) in squamous lineage tumors and contributes to stemness, plasticity, and therapy resistance; enhancer reprogramming of SRR124–134 underlies overexpression in breast/lung adenocarcinoma (sen2024emergingadvancesin pages 1-3, abatti2023epigeneticreprogrammingof pages 1-2). PTMs modulate SOX2 stability and localization in CRC, offering mechanistic links to tumor progression (seo2024acomprehensiveunderstanding pages 1-2).
- Applications: SOX2 is a core reprogramming factor for iPSC generation, enabling applications in disease modeling and regenerative medicine; its pioneer function is directly leveraged for chromatin remodeling in cell-fate engineering (varzideh2023molecularmechanismsunderlying pages 1-3, maresca2023pioneeractivitydistinguishes pages 1-2, orsetti2024structuraldynamicsin pages 1-3).

Notes on gene/protein identification check
- The gene symbol SOX2, organism Homo sapiens, and domain family (HMG box; SOX family) match UniProt P48431 and are consistent with all cited literature. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found.
