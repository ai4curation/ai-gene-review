description: 'SOX2 is a SOXB1 family transcription factor containing an HMG-box domain that binds the minor groove of DNA and functions as a pioneer factor. As a core pluripotency factor (one of the Yamanaka factors), SOX2 maintains embryonic stem cell self-renewal and neural stem cell identity. It cooperates with OCT4 on composite Sox/Oct DNA motifs to regulate thousands of enhancers controlling pluripotency and early neural fate specification. SOX2 is essential for maintaining neural progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state and preventing premature neuronal differentiation. Nuclear localization is regulated by NLS/NES sequences and post-translational modifications including methylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination.'

# Biological Process Annotations - Transcriptional Regulation

- term:
    id: GO:0000122
    label: negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SOX2 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor depending on context. SUMOylation of SOX2 enables transcriptional repression of centrosome/centromere and cell-cycle genes in neural stem cells, providing proliferative restraint.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately represents a documented function of SOX2. The deep research shows SUMOylation-dependent repression of cell-cycle genes in neural stem cells. While SOX2 is primarily an activator, its repressor function is well-established and represents a core regulatory mechanism for controlling neural stem cell proliferation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SOX2 plays a complex role in neuron differentiation by maintaining neural progenitors in an undifferentiated state and preventing premature neuronal differentiation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This term is ambiguous for SOX2's actual role. SOX2 does NOT promote neuron differentiation; rather, it prevents premature differentiation by maintaining neural progenitor identity. A more accurate term would be GO:0045665 (negative regulation of neuron differentiation), which is already present in the annotation set. The IBA annotation likely captures involvement in the process broadly, but this could be misleading about SOX2's actual function.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SOX2 plays essential roles in brain development through maintaining neural progenitor populations and regulating neural fate specification.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While SOX2 is indeed involved in brain development, this term is very broad and captures pleiotropy rather than core molecular function. The more specific neural stem cell maintenance and neural specification functions are better representations of SOX2's primary roles. This annotation is not incorrect but represents a higher-level developmental outcome rather than the core cellular function.

- term:
    id: GO:0030900
    label: forebrain development
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SOX2 expression and function in forebrain development is well-documented.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This is a more specific developmental process than general brain development, but still represents a regional/developmental outcome rather than core molecular function. SOX2 functions the same way (maintaining neural progenitors) across brain regions. The forebrain-specific annotation reflects where SOX2 is expressed and important, but the core function is neural progenitor maintenance regardless of brain region.

- term:
    id: GO:0030900
    label: forebrain development
  evidence_type: IEP
  original_reference_id: PMID:18285410
  review:
    summary: Expression pattern evidence showing SOX2 expression during forebrain development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IEP evidence showing expression pattern during forebrain development is valid but does not demonstrate specific function. This is consistent with SOX2's role in maintaining neural progenitors throughout the developing brain including forebrain regions.

- term:
    id: GO:0021781
    label: glial cell fate commitment
  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:17291498
  review:
    summary: NAS evidence for role in glial cell fate commitment.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While SOX2 is expressed in glial progenitors and can influence glial fate, this represents one specific outcome of SOX2's more general role in maintaining progenitor identity. The core function is maintaining undifferentiated stem/progenitor states; glial fate commitment is one context-dependent outcome. This is valid but peripheral to core function.

# Biological Process - Stem Cell Maintenance and Pluripotency

- term:
    id: GO:0035019

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:19736317
  review:

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation represents a core function of SOX2. Multiple independent IMP and IDA studies demonstrate SOX2's essential role in maintaining stem cell populations. This encompasses both embryonic and neural stem cell maintenance and represents a fundamental cellular function of SOX2.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18268498
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 role in cell cycle regulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is supported by direct experimental evidence and is consistent with SOX2's role in maintaining progenitor cells in a self-renewing state. Cell cycle regulation is an integral part of SOX2's function in controlling stem cell proliferation versus differentiation decisions.

- term:
    id: GO:0043410
    label: positive regulation of MAPK cascade
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18187129
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 involvement in MAPK signaling.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While experimentally supported, MAPK cascade regulation represents a context-specific signaling outcome rather than a core molecular function. SOX2's primary function is as a transcription factor; MAPK regulation may be an indirect consequence or occur in specific cellular contexts (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells in this study). This is valid but peripheral to core transcriptional regulatory function.

# Biological Process - Development and Fate Specification

- term:
    id: GO:0048839
    label: inner ear development
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SOX2 expression and function in inner ear development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SOX2 plays roles in sensory organ development including inner ear, but this represents tissue-specific developmental pleiotropy rather than core function. The core function is maintaining progenitor populations; inner ear development is one of many developmental contexts where this occurs.

- term:
    id: GO:0048839
    label: inner ear development
  evidence_type: IEP
  original_reference_id: PMID:18407919
  review:
    summary: Expression pattern evidence during inner ear development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IEP evidence supports expression during inner ear development but does not demonstrate specific function. Consistent with SOX2's broader role in sensory progenitor maintenance.

- term:
    id: GO:0001654
    label: eye development
  evidence_type: IEP
  original_reference_id: PMID:18285410
  review:
    summary: Expression pattern during eye development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SOX2 mutations cause anophthalmia/microphthalmia, demonstrating clear importance in eye development. However, this represents tissue-specific developmental outcome rather than core molecular function. Like inner ear development, eye development is one context where SOX2's progenitor-maintaining function is critical.

  original_reference_id: PMID:18285410
  review:
    summary: Expression pattern during pituitary development.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Another tissue-specific developmental context where SOX2 maintains progenitor populations. Valid annotation but represents developmental pleiotropy rather than core cellular function.

- term:
    id: GO:0001714

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:21245162
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for role in endoderm specification.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: SOX2 with OCT4 regulates germ layer specification including endoderm fate. While experimentally supported, this represents one developmental context among many. SOX2's core function is maintaining pluripotency and regulating lineage choice; endoderm specification is one specific outcome.

- term:
    id: GO:0001649
    label: osteoblast differentiation
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18187129
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 role in osteoblast differentiation when ectopically expressed in mesenchymal stem cells.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This represents an experimental manipulation (forced SOX2 expression in mesenchymal stem cells) rather than SOX2's endogenous core function. While experimentally valid, osteoblast differentiation is not a physiological context where SOX2 normally functions and represents experimental pleiotropy.

# Biological Process - Signaling and Response

- term:
    id: GO:0090090
    label: negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18285410
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 regulation of Wnt signaling.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While experimentally supported, Wnt pathway regulation represents cross-talk between SOX2's transcriptional program and developmental signaling rather than a core molecular function. This is a valid regulatory connection but peripheral to SOX2's primary role as a transcriptional regulator of pluripotency and neural fate.

- term:
    id: GO:0070848
    label: response to growth factor
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18187129
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 response to growth factor stimulation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This represents an upstream regulatory input rather than SOX2's core function. Growth factors can regulate SOX2 expression or activity, but this does not define what SOX2 itself does. This is valid annotation but describes regulation of SOX2 rather than SOX2's function.

- term:
    id: GO:0009611
    label: response to wounding
  evidence_type: IEP
  original_reference_id: PMID:17982423
  review:
    summary: Expression pattern evidence in corneal stem cells after wounding.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: IEP evidence showing SOX2 expression in corneal stem cells during wound healing. This represents SOX2's role in maintaining stem cell populations in a regenerative context, which is consistent with core function but wound response itself is a specific physiological context rather than core cellular function.

# Molecular Function - Protein Binding

  review:
    summary: IPI evidence for protein-protein interaction (OCT4).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The term "protein binding" is uninformative and does not tell us about SOX2's actual function. While SOX2 does bind OCT4 and other proteins, a more specific term like GO:0046982 (protein heterodimerization activity) or annotation of the specific complex (OCT4-SOX2 complex) would be more informative. Per curation guidelines, we should avoid generic "protein binding" annotations in favor of more specific molecular function terms.

  original_reference_id: PMID:18710938
  review:
    summary: IDA evidence for SOX2 binding to miR-302.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While experimentally validated, miRNA binding represents a non-canonical activity that is not part of SOX2's core transcription factor function. The primary function of SOX2 is sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. miRNA interaction may represent regulatory crosstalk but is peripheral to the core molecular function.
