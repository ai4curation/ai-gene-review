description: BOLA3 is a mitochondrial BolA-family protein that functions as a 
  late-acting iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly factor. BOLA3 forms a 
  heterocomplex with the mitochondrial monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5, bridged by 
  a [2Fe-2S] cluster (coordinated by BOLA3 Cys59 and His96, and GLRX5 Cys67 plus
  glutathione). This GLRX5-BOLA3 complex acts as a [2Fe-2S] carrier/chaperone 
  that delivers cluster equivalents to NFU1, where two [2Fe-2S] clusters are 
  converted to a [4Fe-4S] cluster for insertion into downstream client proteins 
  including lipoyl synthase (LIAS), succinate dehydrogenase, and the 
  mitoribosome. BOLA3 deficiency causes Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions 
  Syndrome type 2 (MMDS2), characterized by defective protein lipoylation, 
  impaired respiratory chain complex activities, and attenuated mitochondrial 
  translation.

    review:
      summary: This annotation captures BOLA3's role in facilitating Fe-S 
        cluster insertion into mitochondrial proteins, which is a form of 
        protein maturation. BOLA3 functions in the late ISC pathway to enable 
        [4Fe-4S] protein maturation (PMID:27532772).
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While "protein maturation" is technically accurate, it is too 
        general. BOLA3 specifically functions in iron-sulfur cluster assembly 
        and insertion. More precise terms exist that better describe the 
        molecular function.

        supporting_text: we characterize the BOLA family proteins Bol1 and Bol3 
          as specific mitochondrial ISC assembly factors that facilitate 
          [4Fe-4S] cluster insertion into a subset of mitochondrial proteins 
          such as lipoate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase

proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the relative contribution of BOLA3 vs BOLA1 to different 
      [4Fe-4S] client proteins? Uzarska et al. showed Bol1 and Bol3 have 
      overlapping but distinct client specificities. Understanding this would 
      help interpret MMDS2 pathophysiology.
  - question: Does BOLA3 have functions independent of the GLRX5-BOLA3 
      heterocomplex? Some interactions detected in HTP studies may represent 
      additional BOLA3 functions not yet characterized.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: Systematic identification of all BOLA3-dependent [4Fe-4S] 
      client proteins using proteomics in BOLA3-deficient cells. This would 
      provide comprehensive understanding of BOLA3's role in [4Fe-4S] protein 
      maturation beyond known clients like LIAS and SDH.
    hypothesis: BOLA3 deficiency affects specific subset of mitochondrial 
      [4Fe-4S] enzymes that can be comprehensively identified by proteomics.
  - description: Structure determination of the BOLA3-GLRX5-[2Fe-2S]-NFU1 
      transfer complex. This would reveal mechanism of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer
      from BOLA3-GLRX5 to NFU1 for [4Fe-4S] assembly.
    hypothesis: BOLA3-GLRX5 complex directly interacts with NFU1 during cluster 
      transfer, forming a transient ternary complex.
