description: KCNQ1OT1 is a 91kb paternally-expressed imprinted long non-coding 
  RNA that regulates genomic imprinting at the KCNQ1 locus on chromosome 
  11p15.5. It silences genes in the KCNQ1 imprinted domain by recruiting 
  Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and establishing heterochromatin. Loss of
  imprinting leads to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

    review:
      summary: This is the core function of KCNQ1OT1 - it mediates 
        heterochromatin formation at the KCNQ1 imprinted locus by recruiting 
        Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to silence genes in the imprinted 
        domain. This is consistent with its role in genomic imprinting.

      summary: This annotation is based on KCNQ1OT1 acting as a ceRNA/miRNA 
        sponge in an osteogenic differentiation study using hBMSCs. While the 
        miRNA sponging activity may be real, this represents an over-annotation 
        of KCNQ1OT1 beyond its core genomic imprinting function.
