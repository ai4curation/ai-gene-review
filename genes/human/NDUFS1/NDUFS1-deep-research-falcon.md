## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P28331
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, mitochondrial; EC=7.1.1.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:30879903, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31557978}; AltName: Full=Complex I-75kD; Short=CI-75kD; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NDUFS1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the complex I 75 kDa subunit family.
- **Key Domains:** 2Fe-2S_ferredoxin-like_sf. (IPR036010); 2Fe-2S_ferredoxin-type. (IPR001041); Mopterin_OxRdtase. (IPR006656); Mopterin_OxRdtase_4Fe-4S_dom. (IPR006963); NADH_UbQ_OxRdtase_75kDa_su_CS. (IPR000283)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NDUFS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NDUFS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NDUFS1** (gene ID: NDUFS1, UniProt: P28331) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview: We verified the human target identity (NDUFS1; UniProt P28331), gathered 2023–2024 structural/mechanistic literature on complex I with explicit mentions of NDUFS1’s placement and interactions, collected recent disease and application evidence (including a 2024 urinary extracellular vesicle biomarker study), and synthesized expert reviews on mechanism and inhibitors. We then assembled an artifact table of key facts and sources and composed the research report below.

Gene/protein verification and identity
- Symbol and name: NDUFS1 encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa core subunit of mitochondrial complex I in Homo sapiens (human). It is a core subunit of the hydrophilic N-module of complex I, positioned where NADH oxidation and iron–sulfur (Fe–S) chain electron transfer occur (EMBO Journal, published Jan 2, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: Structural work places multiple Fe–S clusters within NDUFS1 (e.g., clusters denoted N1b/Nx in EPR nomenclature) consistent with ferredoxin-like Fe–S–binding architecture within the N-module’s electron-transfer chain (bioRxiv preprint, posted Jul 25, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-16). Reviews of complex I likewise describe NDUFS1 among the Fe–S–cluster-bearing subunits of the matrix arm (IJMS review, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23). These data align with the UniProt domain annotations provided.
- Organism: All cited primary structural and mechanistic sources concern mammalian/human complex I (and closely conserved models), consistent with Homo sapiens (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Enzymatic context: Complex I (EC 7.1.1.2) catalyzes NADH oxidation coupled to ubiquinone reduction and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Consensus stoichiometry is four protons translocated per two electrons (one NADH) transferred: NADH + Q + 4H+in → NAD+ + QH2 + 4H+out (IJMS review, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).
- NDUFS1’s role: NDUFS1 is a core subunit of the N-module together with NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFA2 and NDUFV3. NADH is oxidized by FMN in NDUFV1 and electrons pass along seven Fe–S clusters, several within NDUFS1, toward the Q-module where ubiquinone is reduced (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). The NDUFS1 subunit lies at the interface with the Q-module (dominated by NDUFS3) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Localization and pathway: NDUFS1 resides in the peripheral (matrix-facing) arm of complex I embedded at the inner mitochondrial membrane; it functions in the respiratory electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; IJMS review, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Cryo-EM structural insights and assembly: High-resolution cryo-EM of a mitochondrial disease model (ndufs4−/− mouse) resolved classes revealing that the N-module association is dynamic when accessory subunits are missing. NDUFS4’s β2–β3 loop runs under NDUFS1 and, together with NDUFA12 (absent in the mutant), helps stabilize the N-module–Q-module junction. Assembly factor NDUFAF2 binds at this interface in intermediates and is replaced by NDUFA12 in the mature enzyme, supporting a model in which NDUFAF2 recruits the NADH-dehydrogenase (N-) module and NDUFS1 is incorporated late (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; bioRxiv preprint, Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 4-6).
- Fe–S chain proximity: Cryo-EM mapping in the ndufs4−/− context placed NDUFS1 near multiple Fe–S clusters (clusters 2–4 within NDUFS1) and highlighted how altered accessory subunit composition perturbs local dynamics near the Q site and the NDUFS1–NDUFA9 region, with reduced NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity but without a marked ROS increase in that system (bioRxiv preprint, Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 14-16).
- Mechanistic updates: Recent reviews synthesize proton-coupling models and hydrated proton pathways based on mammalian cryo-EM, affirming four protons pumped per NADH and delineating candidate proton-transfer networks; these analyses provide authoritative context for NDUFS1’s placement within the N-module relative to long-range coupling (IJMS review, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic/prognostic biomarker: Urinary extracellular vesicle (uEV) NDUFS1 was identified by DIA proteomics in children with unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) as associated with differential renal function (DRF). In a validation cohort (n=20), uEV NDUFS1 was higher in DRF ≥40% than in DRF <40% (mean ± SD: 1.818 ± 0.489 vs. 1.182 ± 0.437; P<0.05) and correlated positively with DRF (r = 0.78, P<0.05), whereas whole-urine NDUFS1 did not correlate (r = 0.28, P = 0.24) (BMC Nephrology, May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-024-03592-0) (bu2024associationbetweenndufs1 pages 3-8).
- Functional assays and models: Complex I activity assays, Seahorse mitochondrial stress tests (OCR), BN-PAGE “complexomics,” and single-particle cryo-EM are routinely used to evaluate NDUFS1-containing assemblies and activities; the ndufs4−/− mouse provides an established model to probe N-module assembly failures that topologically involve NDUFS1 (bioRxiv preprint, Jul 2023; EMBO Journal, Jan 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 4-6).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2024 IJMS review integrates structural, kinetic, and inhibitory analyses, emphasizing complex I’s redox-coupled proton pumping, inhibitor binding sites, and biomedical relevance. It frames NDUFS1 within the N-module’s Fe–S chain and underscores that multiple subunits—including NDUFS1—are implicated in human metabolic disorders when mutated (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).
- EMBO Journal 2024 provides authoritative structural analysis in a disease model, advancing the field’s understanding of N-module recruitment (NDUFAF2→NDUFA12 exchange) and the interfacial role of NDUFS1 at the N/Q-module junction (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Biomarker quantitative data (UPJO): uEV NDUFS1 level vs DRF—group means (1.818 ± 0.489 vs. 1.182 ± 0.437; P<0.05) and correlation (r = 0.78, P<0.05), sample size n=20 (BMC Nephrology, May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-024-03592-0) (bu2024associationbetweenndufs1 pages 3-8).
- Enzymatic stoichiometry: Four protons translocated per NADH oxidized (NADH + Q + 4H+in → NAD+ + QH2 + 4H+out), derived from biochemical and structural consensus summarized in recent reviews (IJMS, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).

Disease relevance and human phenotypes (selected recent evidence)
- Complex I deficiency and Leigh syndrome: Complex I mutations cause severe neuromuscular mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome; structural work places NDUFS1 centrally within the N-module electron-transfer chain and at a critical inter-module junction, explaining how N-module disassembly/assembly defects can impair activity (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). Although variant-level case statistics for NDUFS1 specifically are not detailed in these sources, they situate NDUFS1 mechanistically among subunits in which pathogenic variants cause primary mitochondrial disease.
- Cardiac context: Complex I dysfunction contributes to diverse cardiac phenotypes, including dilated/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease; NDUFS1 is listed among Fe–S–cluster subunits mediating electron transfer within the matrix arm (Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Jul 2025; online 2024 DOI assigned; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-024-05074-1) (rai2025mitochondrialcomplex1as pages 33-38).

Cancer and other pathology links (recent primary studies)
- Colorectal cancer (CRC): PHB2 directly interacts with NDUFS1 in mitochondria, stabilizing complex I activity. PHB2 knockdown reduces complex I activity, basal respiration, and ATP while increasing mtROS; pharmacologic CI inhibition counteracts PHB2-driven proliferation. These data functionally implicate NDUFS1-containing complex I activity in CRC tumorigenesis via PHB2–NDUFS1 interaction (Cell Death & Disease, Jan 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05575-9) (ren2023phb2promotescolorectal pages 6-8).

Structural placement and interactions (concise summary)
- NDUFS1 sits in the N-module, adjacent to the Q-module (NDUFS3-rich), with close inter-subunit contacts involving NDUFA2 and the NDUFS4/NDUFA12 region. During assembly, NDUFAF2 binds at the N/Q interface and is replaced by NDUFA12 in the mature complex; loss of NDUFS4 removes stabilizing contacts beneath NDUFS1 and yields intermediates with NDUFAF2 and variable NDUFS6 presence (EMBO Journal, Jan 2024; bioRxiv, Jul 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.17.549284) (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-4, yin2023structuralinsightsinto pages 4-6).

Primary function, reaction, and substrate specificity
- Biochemical role: NDUFS1 participates in the matrix-arm electron-transfer chain receiving electrons from FMN (NDUFV1) and passing them via multiple Fe–S clusters toward the ubiquinone-binding Q-module; the overall enzyme reduces ubiquinone to ubiquinol while pumping four protons per NADH oxidized (IJMS review, Dec 2024; EMBO Journal, Jan 2024) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421; https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4) (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23, yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).

Limitations and scope
- While authoritative structural and review sources firmly place NDUFS1 in the N-module and document its inter-module contacts and Fe–S roles, variant-specific human case series and prevalence statistics for NDUFS1 were not available within the retrieved 2023–2024 sources used here; thus, disease phenotypes are presented at the complex I level with mechanistic placement of NDUFS1 (yin2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 22-23).
