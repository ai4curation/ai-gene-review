description: >-
  NDUFS1 encodes the 75 kDa subunit of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase,
  EC 7.1.1.2), the largest subunit of the complex and a core component of the N-module in the
  peripheral (matrix-facing) arm. NDUFS1 contains one [2Fe-2S] cluster and two [4Fe-4S] clusters
  that form part of the electron relay chain transferring electrons from FMN (bound to NDUFV1)
  toward the ubiquinone-binding Q-module. NDUFS1 is essential for the assembly and stability
  of both Complex I and the respiratory supercomplexes (respirasomes). Pathogenic mutations in
  NDUFS1 cause mitochondrial Complex I deficiency, nuclear type 5 (MC1DN5), presenting with
  Leigh syndrome and related encephalopathies. During apoptosis, NDUFS1 is a caspase substrate
  whose cleavage disrupts mitochondrial electron transport. MDM2 can bind and sequester NDUFS1
  to modulate respiration and apoptotic signaling.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation with 'contributes_to' qualifier for the complex-level NADH dehydrogenase
      (ubiquinone) activity. GO:0008137 represents the overall reaction of Complex I
      (NADH + ubiquinone + 5H+_in -> NAD+ + ubiquinol + 4H+_out). NDUFS1 is a core subunit
      of the N-module that harbors Fe-S clusters critical for electron relay, but the full
      catalytic cycle of Complex I requires all 45 subunits. The 'contributes_to' qualifier
      is appropriate and phylogenetically sound (PMID:31557978, PMID:30879903).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      NDUFS1 contributes to the NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone activity of Complex I by
      providing key Fe-S clusters in the electron relay chain. The 'contributes_to' qualifier
      is correct because the full catalytic reaction requires multiple subunits. The IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically well-supported. This represents a core function of the
      gene product.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation inferred from GO:0008137 (NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone activity) via
      logical inference. Complex I couples electron transfer to proton translocation, so
      proton transmembrane transport is a logical consequence of the NADH dehydrogenase
      activity. However, the proton-pumping machinery is located in the membrane arm
      (P-module) of Complex I, not in the peripheral arm N-module where NDUFS1 resides.
      NDUFS1 does not directly participate in proton translocation. As an IEA it is acceptable
      as a broader process annotation for a complex subunit, even though the proton pumping
      is mechanistically distant from NDUFS1's specific role.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While proton translocation is mechanistically performed by the membrane arm subunits
      (not by NDUFS1), this is a legitimate broader process annotation for a Complex I
      subunit via logical inference from the complex-level activity. The annotation is
      acceptable as an IEA, albeit not the most informative for NDUFS1 specifically.

  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation from ComplexPortal for proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP
      synthesis. Complex I couples electron transfer to proton pumping, generating part of
      the proton motive force that drives ATP synthase. However, NDUFS1 is in the N-module
      peripheral arm and does not directly participate in proton translocation (which occurs
      in the membrane arm P-module). Nevertheless, Complex I as a whole does contribute to
      the proton motive force, and NDUFS1's electron transfer activity is mechanistically
      coupled to this proton pumping. This is acceptable as a broader process annotation
      for a Complex I subunit, though it is less directly applicable to NDUFS1 than to
      membrane arm subunits.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Complex I does contribute to the proton motive force driving ATP synthesis, but NDUFS1
      is in the N-module and does not directly participate in proton translocation. The
      annotation is not wrong at the complex level but is peripherally related to NDUFS1's
      specific role. Keep as non-core rather than removing (unlike for Complex II subunits
      which truly do not pump protons, Complex I does pump protons as part of its catalytic
      cycle).

      NDUFS1 is located on the matrix side of the inner membrane. This annotation likely
      refers to the detection of NDUFS1 (or its fragments) in the IMS context during
      apoptosis, which is not the normal steady-state localization. The normal localization
      is the matrix face of Complex I.

      NDUFS1 detection in the intermembrane space likely reflects the apoptotic context
      (caspase cleavage releasing fragments). The steady-state localization of functional
      NDUFS1 is the mitochondrial matrix face. This annotation is not wrong but reflects
      a non-standard, apoptosis-specific context.

    NDUFS1 is the largest core subunit (75 kDa) of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone
    oxidoreductase, EC 7.1.1.2), located in the N-module of the peripheral (matrix-facing)
    arm. It contains one [2Fe-2S] cluster and two [4Fe-4S] clusters that form part of the
    electron relay chain from FMN (bound to NDUFV1) toward the ubiquinone-binding Q-module.
    NDUFS1 enables electron transfer activity (GO:0009055) via its Fe-S clusters and
    contributes to the overall NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity (GO:0008137) of the
    45-subunit Complex I holoenzyme. NDUFS1 is essential for N-module stability, Complex I
    assembly, and supercomplex formation. Mutations in NDUFS1 disrupt electron tunneling
    between Fe-S clusters N4 and N5, destabilize the N-module, and cause mitochondrial
    Complex I deficiency (MC1DN5) with Leigh syndrome spectrum phenotypes.
