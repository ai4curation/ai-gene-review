## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q08629
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Testican-1; AltName: Full=Protein SPOCK; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SPOCK1; Synonyms=SPOCK, TIC1, TICN1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** EF-hand-dom_pair. (IPR011992); Kazal_dom. (IPR002350); Kazal_dom_sf. (IPR036058); SPARC/Testican_Ca-bd-dom. (IPR019577); Thyroglobulin_1. (IPR000716)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SPOCK1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SPOCK1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SPOCK1** (gene ID: SPOCK1, UniProt: Q08629) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human SPOCK1 (Testican‑1) – Functional Annotation and Recent Evidence

Gene/protein verification and identity
- Symbol and accession: SPOCK1 encodes Testican‑1, a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan in Homo sapiens. The SPOCK family (SPOCK1–3) are SPARC/osteonectin, CWCV and Kazal‑like domain proteoglycans with conserved modular architecture. SPOCK1 carries Ca2+‑binding EF‑hand motifs, a thyroglobulin type‑I (TY) domain, SPARC/Testican Ca‑binding regions, and C‑terminal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites, matching the UniProt domain description provided (review, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Biochemical class and domains: Testican‑1/SPOCK1 is a secreted matricellular proteoglycan of the ECM bearing heparan/chondroitin sulfate GAG chains. Its domain architecture includes SPARC/osteonectin‑like modules, a thyroglobulin type I (TY) domain (with the characteristic CWCV motif), Kazal‑like region(s), and a Ca2+‑binding segment with EF‑hand motifs; two potential C‑terminal GAG attachment sites are present (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5).
- Core functions: SPOCK1 functions as a matricellular regulator of cell–matrix interactions and ECM remodeling. It modulates adhesion and neurite/axon growth in neural contexts and interacts with proteases; notably, testican‑1 can act as a potent competitive inhibitor of cathepsin L (CTSL) independent of its GAGs, and SPOCK family members regulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), linking SPOCK1 to ECM proteolysis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2).
- Pathways and signaling: SPOCK1 has been repeatedly connected to pro‑tumor signaling programs including PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β‑catenin, and to EMT transcriptional programs; these links underpin invasion, metastasis and therapy response phenotypes in multiple cancers (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; LUAD study, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 10-11, liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- SPOCK1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD): A 2023 multi‑omics and experimental study identified SPOCK1 as upregulated in LUAD, associated with poor prognosis, EMT activation, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. SPOCK1 knockdown reduced invasion and migration in LUAD cells; connectivity‑map screening nominated VER‑155008, which reduced SPOCK1 expression and suppressed xenograft tumor growth, with stronger efficacy in SPOCK1‑high H1975 vs SPOCK1‑low H1299 models (Journal of Translational Medicine, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18, liu2023spock1asa pages 1-2).
- SPOCK1 and cancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs): LUAD cell–derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and TGFβ independently activated fibroblasts; RNA‑seq identified SPOCK1 among the most upregulated ECM/EMT‑related genes across TGFβ and EV treatments. The study emphasized that SPOCK1 protein secretion from EV‑ or TGFβ‑activated CAFs was not demonstrated and warrants further validation (Biomedicines, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523) (vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 65-70, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89).
- SPOCK1 as a blood biomarker in stroke subtyping: A multicenter plasma proteomics study in the hyperacute window (≤6 h) reported that SPOCK1 distinguished intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from ischemic stroke (IS) with AUC ≈ 0.78–0.79, highlighting translational diagnostic potential (Biomarker Research, Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00848-1) (nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 11-14, nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 14-15).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Oncology biomarker applications: In LUAD, high SPOCK1 identifies patients with worse overall survival, EMT activation, and immune suppression. Functionally, SPOCK1 knockdown reduces invasiveness, and small‑molecule modulation (VER‑155008) suppresses tumor growth preclinically, suggesting SPOCK1‑linked signatures as indicators for therapy sensitivity and as potential targets for intervention (J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).
- Tumor microenvironment/CAF biology: SPOCK1 is an EMT/ECM‑associated gene induced in fibroblasts by LUAD EVs and TGFβ, implicating it in CAF activation programs in lung cancer; protein‑level secretion into the milieu remains to be verified prior to clinical translation (Biomedicines, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523) (vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 65-70, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89).
- Neurology diagnostics: Plasma SPOCK1 contributes to differentiating ICH from IS in the emergency setting with promising standalone AUCs, suggesting inclusion in multi‑analyte blood panels under development (Biomarker Research, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00848-1) (nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 11-14, nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 14-15).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural/functional consensus: An expert review in 2024 outlines SPOCK1 as a multi‑domain, ECM‑associated, calcium‑binding proteoglycan whose family regulates MMP activity and EMT, with emerging roles in PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β‑catenin signaling. The review underscores the need for mechanistic dissection and clinical validation to translate SPOCKs into reliable prognostic and therapeutic tools (Molecular Medicine Reports, Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 10-11, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 9-10).
- LUAD translational perspective: Integrative analyses plus cell/xenograft validation position SPOCK1 as a biomarker of EMT and immune evasion and as a candidate therapeutic vulnerability; drug‑screening results offer a pragmatic route for repurposing strategies (Journal of Translational Medicine, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- LUAD prognosis/biology: High SPOCK1 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and lower CD8+ T‑cell infiltration; SPOCK1 knockdown suppresses invasion/migration and EMT markers. VER‑155008 reduced SPOCK1 and inhibited tumor growth with greater efficacy in SPOCK1‑high LUAD models; the study also reported differential chemotherapeutic sensitivity associations by SPOCK1 level (Journal of Translational Medicine, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).
- Stroke diagnostic performance: SPOCK1 showed ICH vs IS discrimination with AUCs ≈ 0.782–0.786 in a multicenter cohort sampled ≤6 h from onset, with reported sensitivity 68.2% and specificity 79.9% in one analysis; authors propose SPOCK1 as a component of blood‑based panels for hyperacute stroke triage (Biomarker Research, Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00848-1) (nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 11-14, nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 14-15).
- CAF activation: SPOCK1 was among the most upregulated EMT/ECM genes in fibroblasts exposed to LUAD EVs or TGFβ across RNA‑seq comparisons; secretion from CAFs was not confirmed and requires further experiments (Biomedicines, Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523) (vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 65-70, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89).
- Therapy resistance mechanics (supplemental, 2025): An Oncogene study identified an RBM15→m6A‑dependent epigenetic silencing of SPOCK1 that contributes to EMT‑associated osimertinib resistance in LUAD. RBM15 knockdown increased SPOCK1 and restored osimertinib sensitivity (IC50 drop from 6.404 μM to 3.439 μM), while concurrent SPOCK1 knockdown reversed this sensitization and EMT marker reversion, positioning the RBM15–SPOCK1 axis as a resistance node (Oncogene, Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-024-03220-z) (li2025rbm15facilitatesosimertinib pages 7-9).

Function, pathways, and localization: consolidated view
- Primary function: SPOCK1/Testican‑1 is a secreted ECM proteoglycan with calcium‑binding and protease‑interacting domains; it modulates ECM remodeling by regulating proteases (e.g., MMP axis contextually; cathepsin L inhibition demonstrated) and functions as a matricellular cue influencing adhesion, neurite outgrowth, EMT and invasion programs (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; LUAD, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).
- Cellular/tissue localization: SPOCK1 is secreted to the ECM, enriched at basement‑membrane‑like structures and neural tissues. The highest physiologic expression is in the human brain, with expression also reported in other organs; tumor contexts show stromal/CAF involvement and cancer‑cell upregulation (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; Biomedicines, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523; J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).
- Pathways: SPOCK1 promotes EMT and invasive phenotypes via PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β‑catenin signaling in cancer models; in LUAD, high SPOCK1 aligns with EMT activation and immune evasion. TGFβ stimulation can induce SPOCK1 expression in tumor contexts and in fibroblasts; LUAD EVs likewise induce SPOCK1 mRNA in fibroblasts, implicating intercellular communication in TME remodeling (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3; Biomedicines, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 10-11, liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 65-70, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89).
- Immune contexture: In LUAD, higher SPOCK1 correlates with a more immunosuppressive TME and reduced CD8+ T‑cell infiltration, consistent with EMT‑linked immune exclusion; these findings support SPOCK1 as a biomarker of immune evasion (J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- The SPOCK1 symbol here refers to human Testican‑1. The organism (Homo sapiens) and the domain architecture we describe align with the UniProt Q08629 entry and with the 2024 SPOCK family review, ensuring we are analyzing the correct gene/protein (review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4).

Evidence gaps and open questions
- Quantitative prognostic statistics (e.g., hazard ratios) for SPOCK1 in LUAD were not reported in the 2023 study excerpts here; however, directional associations (worse survival with higher SPOCK1) are supported alongside functional validations and a drug‑repurposing hit. Additional cohort‑level HRs would further strengthen prognostic claims (J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04616-3) (liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18).
- CAF secretion of SPOCK1 protein following EV/TGFβ activation was not demonstrated in the 2024 LUAD EV study and requires targeted proteomic validation (Biomedicines, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12112523) (vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89).

Conclusion
SPOCK1/Testican‑1 is a multi‑domain, secreted ECM proteoglycan that modulates protease activity and ECM remodeling and engages canonical oncogenic signaling programs (PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β‑catenin) to drive EMT, invasion, and immune evasion in cancer. Recent LUAD studies integrate bioinformatics and experimentation to implicate SPOCK1 as a prognostic/therapeutic biomarker and reveal a drug‑repurposing candidate that suppresses SPOCK1‑linked tumor growth. In the tumor microenvironment, LUAD EVs and TGFβ upregulate SPOCK1 transcripts in fibroblasts, suggesting roles in CAF activation that merit protein‑level validation. Beyond oncology, SPOCK1 shows promise as a plasma biomarker aiding rapid stroke subtype discrimination. These advances support continued mechanistic dissection and translational development of SPOCK1‑centric diagnostics and therapeutics (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 4-5, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 10-11, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, liu2023spock1asa pages 16-18, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 80-85, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 65-70, vazquez2024extracellularvesiclesfrom pages 85-89, nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 11-14, nunezjurado2025plasmaproteomicsuncovers pages 14-15, li2025rbm15facilitatesosimertinib pages 7-9).
