description: 'SPOCK1 encodes testican-1, a secreted multidomain proteoglycan of the
  extracellular matrix. The 439 amino acid protein is modified with chondroitin sulfate
  and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains attached to serine residues in the
  C-terminal region. Testican-1 has a modular architecture containing a follistatin-like
  domain, an acidic region, extracellular calcium-binding domains, Kazal-like protease
  inhibitor domains, and a thyroglobulin type-1 domain. The protein functions as a
  structural ECM component that modulates cell-substrate adhesion and inhibits multiple
  classes of proteases including metalloendopeptidases (via direct binding to MT1-MMP
  and MT3-MMP), cysteine proteases (cathepsin L with Ki=0.7 nM), and serine proteases.
  Testican-1 is highly expressed in brain (particularly cerebellum, with immunolocalization
  to postsynaptic densities), and also found in testis and endothelial cells. The
  protein plays important roles in ECM organization, regulation of neuron attachment
  and neurite outgrowth, and protease regulation in both intracellular and extracellular
  contexts.'

        structural component of the extracellular matrix. Multiple lines of 
        evidence support this core localization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence. UniProt
