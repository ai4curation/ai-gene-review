description: SCG5 (also known as neuroendocrine protein 7B2 or secretogranin V) encodes
  a highly conserved secretory protein selectively expressed in neuroendocrine cells.
  It functions as a specific molecular chaperone for proprotein convertase 2 (PCSK2/PC2),
  binding to inactive proPC2 in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitating its transport
  through the secretory pathway to compartments where PC2 is proteolytically matured
  and activated. Critically, 7B2 is not involved in PC2 folding; rather, it acts after
  PC2 has folded, serving as a transport facilitator and preventing premature activation.
  The C-terminal peptide of 7B2 also functions as an inhibitor of PC2 enzymatic activity
  in vitro. Full-length 7B2 (~27 kDa) is cleaved by the Golgi-resident convertase furin
  to yield a ~21 kDa product; both forms contain a central intrinsically disordered
  region (IDR) that influences client binding and oligomerization behavior
  (DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268). Beyond PC2 regulation, 7B2 acts as a broader secreted
  chaperone that suppresses aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloidogenic peptides
  including beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein, and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)
  (DOI:10.2337/db19-0276, DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268). In human pancreatic islets,
  PC2 localizes primarily to alpha-cells, and 7B2 immunoreactivity is lower in beta-cells
  than alpha-cells, contrasting with mouse islets where both cell types show similar
  expression. Functional pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that PC2 inhibition nearly
  blocks glucagon production but does not significantly impair proinsulin processing in
  human islets, indicating the major physiological PC2/7B2-dependent processing step in
  human islets is proglucagon-to-glucagon in alpha-cells rather than beta-cell proinsulin
  maturation (DOI:10.2337/db19-0276). CSF levels of 7B2 are approximately 3 ng/mL
  (0.14 nM) and decline with age, and SCG5 has been recurrently identified in Alzheimer's
  disease vs. control CSF proteomics studies (DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268). Spatial
  transcriptomics of human pancreas in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) reveals
  SCG5 downregulation in both alpha- and beta-cells, suggesting impaired prohormone
  processing as a contributor to islet dysfunction in CFRD
  (DOI:10.1038/s41598-024-76722-1).

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation to enzyme regulator activity is well supported. SCG5/7B2
      has dual enzyme-regulatory functions towards PCSK2/PC2. The N-terminal domain
      facilitates proPC2 transport and activation (acting as an enzyme activator),
      while the C-terminal peptide acts as a specific inhibitor of PC2 enzymatic
      activity (PMID:9348280, PMID:11439082). GO:0030234 (enzyme regulator activity)
      appropriately captures this dual regulatory role at the right level of specificity
      given that 7B2 both activates and inhibits the same enzyme at different stages.
      The IBA evidence is phylogenetically well-supported.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation to enzyme regulator activity accurately captures the
      core molecular function of SCG5/7B2 as a regulator of PC2. This is the
      appropriate parent term given that 7B2 has both activating and inhibiting
      activities toward the same enzyme.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation to regulation of hormone secretion is supported by
      evidence that 7B2-null mice develop Cushing's disease due to ACTH
      hypersecretion from the neurointermediate lobe (PMID:11439082), indicating
      that 7B2 plays a role in regulating hormone secretion. The UniProt function
      annotation also states that 7B2 plays a role in regulating pituitary hormone
      secretion. However, this is a secondary consequence of 7B2's primary function
      as a PC2 regulator -- loss of 7B2 leads to loss of PC2 activity, which
      disrupts prohormone processing and consequently affects hormone secretion.
      This represents a downstream biological process rather than a direct core
      molecular function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While regulation of hormone secretion is a genuine biological role of
      SCG5/7B2, it is a downstream consequence of its primary function as a PC2
      regulator and transporter. The 7B2-null mouse phenotype (Cushing's disease,
      ACTH hypersecretion) demonstrates this role, but it is indirect -- arising
      from failed PC2 activation and consequent impaired prohormone processing.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation to neuropeptide signaling pathway is based on InterPro
      and UniProtKB keyword mapping. While SCG5/7B2 is classified as a neuropeptide
      (UniProt KW-0527), its primary function is as a regulator of PC2 rather than
      as a signaling neuropeptide per se. 7B2 is processed in the secretory pathway
      and its peptide products are released, but its known biological role is
      regulating PC2 maturation and activity, not acting as a signaling ligand.
      The annotation to neuropeptide signaling pathway overstates the direct role
      of 7B2 in signaling. There is no evidence that 7B2 or its derived peptides
      act as receptor ligands in a neuropeptide signaling pathway.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While SCG5/7B2 is classified as a neuropeptide and is present in
      neuroendocrine cells, there is no evidence that it directly participates
      in neuropeptide signaling as a signaling molecule (i.e., as a ligand for
      a receptor). Its function is as a PC2 chaperone/regulator in the secretory
      pathway. The IEA mapping from the neuropeptide keyword is too liberal.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation to enzyme inhibitor activity transferred from mouse
      ortholog (UniProtKB:P12961) via Ensembl Compara. The C-terminal peptide of
      7B2 is a well-established specific inhibitor of PC2 enzymatic activity
      (PMID:9348280, PMID:11439082). This function has been demonstrated in vitro
      and the CT peptide constitutes a potent and specific inhibitor of PC2.
      The MEROPS database classifies SCG5 as I21.001. The annotation is correct
      but could be made more specific -- the inhibited enzyme (PC2) is a
      serine-type endopeptidase (subtilisin family), so GO:0004867 (serine-type

      directs it to the ER. It is well established as a secretory granule resident
      protein that is ultimately secreted. The UniProt entry does not annotate
      nuclear localization for human SCG5 -- it lists only Secreted as the

      (PMID:7913882, PMID:9348280, PMID:11439082) supporting nuclear localization
      of 7B2. This appears to be an erroneous transfer from the mouse ortholog

    action: REMOVE
    reason: There is no evidence supporting nuclear localization of SCG5/7B2.
      The protein has a signal peptide, is routed through the secretory pathway
      (ER to Golgi to secretory granules), and is ultimately secreted. UniProt

    summary: GO:0051082 is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). The original annotation
      was based on Braks and Martens 1994 (PMID:7913882), which described 7B2 as
      a neuroendocrine chaperone for proPC2. While the paper showed that 7B2 has
      distant sequence similarity to chaperonins and specifically associates with
      proPC2, a follow-up study by Braks and Martens 1997 (PMID:9348280) explicitly
      demonstrated that 7B2 is NOT involved in PC2 folding. That study showed proPC2
      must fold before binding 7B2, and that 7B2 functions as a transport facilitator
      and activation cofactor rather than a folding chaperone. The UniProt function
      annotation for SCG5 (P05408) also states that 7B2 is required for cleavage of
      PCSK2 but does not appear to be involved in its folding. Therefore, the annotation
      to unfolded protein binding is incorrect on two counts -- (1) 7B2 does not bind
      unfolded proteins generally, it specifically binds folded proPC2, and (2) it
      does not assist in protein folding. GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is
      also not appropriate because 7B2 does not assist in the folding process. The
      most accurate replacement term is GO:0140318 (protein transporter activity),
      which describes directly binding to a specific protein and delivering it to a
      specific cellular location, consistent with 7B2 escorting proPC2 from the ER
      to later secretory compartments. The existing annotations to enzyme inhibitor
      activity (GO:0004857) and enzyme regulator activity (GO:0030234) already capture
      the other core molecular functions of 7B2.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation to GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is incorrect for
      SCG5/7B2. The term is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). Furthermore, the
      evidence does not support unfolded protein binding for 7B2. Braks and Martens
      1997 (PMID:9348280) conclusively demonstrated that proPC2 must fold before binding
      7B2, and that 7B2 is involved in proPC2 transport and activation but not folding.
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is also inappropriate because 7B2 does
      not assist in the protein folding process. The best replacement is GO:0140318
      (protein transporter activity), defined as directly binding to a specific protein
      and delivering it to a specific cellular location, which accurately describes
      7B2 escorting folded proPC2 from the ER through the secretory pathway.

  original_reference_id: PMID:3134253
  review:
    summary: TAS annotation to GTP binding based on the original cloning paper by
      Martens 1988 (PMID:3134253). That paper identified three regions in the 7B2
      sequence that were homologous to GTP-binding domains, stating that 7B2 had
      structural characteristics of a GTP-binding protein. However, this was purely
      a sequence analysis observation from the early characterization of 7B2 and
      was never experimentally confirmed. No subsequent study has demonstrated
      that 7B2 actually binds GTP. The comprehensive 2001 review by Mbikay et al.
      (PMID:11439082) does not mention GTP binding as a function of 7B2. All
      subsequent functional characterization has focused on the PC2
      chaperone/regulator role. The initial sequence homology observation was
      likely a spurious match that has not been substantiated.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The GTP binding annotation is based solely on a weak sequence
      homology observation from the 1988 cloning paper (PMID:3134253) that
      identified regions with similarity to GTP-binding domains. This was never
      experimentally validated. No subsequent study over more than 35 years has
      confirmed GTP binding activity for 7B2. The comprehensive review
      (PMID:11439082) does not mention GTP binding. The TAS evidence code is
      inappropriate here as the cited paper only noted sequence similarity, not
      actual GTP binding activity. This annotation should be removed as
      unsupported.

  review:
    summary: 7B2 is required for the productive activation of proPC2 into active
      mature PC2. Muller et al. 1997 (PMID:9348280) demonstrated that in vitro,
      7B2 was required for proPC2 activation at acidic pH, and that without 7B2,
      proPC2 propeptide cleavage results in the formation of inactive enzyme.
      The review by Mbikay et al. 2001 (PMID:11439082) confirms that 7B2
      facilitates proPC2 transport and activation. This enzyme activator function
      is distinct from and complementary to the enzyme inhibitor function of the
      CT peptide. The existing annotation to enzyme regulator activity
      (GO:0030234) covers both roles, but enzyme activator activity (GO:0008047)
      specifically captures the activation function of the N-terminal domain.
    action: NEW
    reason: SCG5/7B2 functions as a specific activator of PC2. It is required
      for the productive activation of proPC2 -- without 7B2, propeptide cleavage
      produces inactive enzyme. This is a core molecular function that should be
      explicitly annotated in addition to the broader enzyme regulator activity
      and the enzyme inhibitor activity of the CT peptide.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    SCG5/7B2 functions as a specific molecular chaperone/transporter for proprotein
    convertase 2 (PCSK2/PC2). The N-terminal domain binds folded proPC2 in the ER
    and facilitates its transport through the secretory pathway to compartments where
    PC2 is proteolytically matured and activated. Without 7B2, proPC2 propeptide
    cleavage produces inactive enzyme. 7B2 is required for productive PC2 activation.
    Full-length 7B2 (~27 kDa) is cleaved by Golgi-resident furin to yield a ~21 kDa
    product, and both forms contain a central intrinsically disordered region (IDR)
    that influences client binding and oligomerization (DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268).
    In human islets, the major physiological PC2/7B2-dependent processing step is
    proglucagon-to-glucagon in alpha-cells rather than beta-cell proinsulin maturation
    (DOI:10.2337/db19-0276). Beyond PC2, 7B2 also suppresses aggregation of amyloidogenic
    peptides including beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein, and IAPP, consistent with a
    broader secreted chaperone role in extracellular proteostasis
    (DOI:10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268, DOI:10.2337/db19-0276).
