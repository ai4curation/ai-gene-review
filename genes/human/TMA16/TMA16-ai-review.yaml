description: 'TMA16 (Translation machinery-associated protein 16) is a conserved nuclear
  assembly factor involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Cryo-EM
  structural studies (PMID:32669547) reveal that TMA16 associates with pre-60S ribosomal
  particles, localizing between the 5S RNA and the P0 stalk. The protein functions
  as a ribosome-associated factor (RAF) in the late stages of pre-60S maturation and
  nuclear export, acting as an adaptor between the preribosome and other assembly
  machinery components. TMA16 belongs to the TMA16 family (PF11176) and is present
  throughout eukaryotes with conserved function in ribosome biogenesis.'

    review:
      summary: TMA16 nuclear localization is well-supported by cryo-EM 
        structural studies showing TMA16 associates with pre-60S ribosomal 
        particles in the nucleus, and by immunofluorescence data from the Human 
        Protein Atlas (HPA). The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference 
        is consistent with experimental evidence.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Nuclear localization is strongly supported by PMID:32669547 which 
        describes TMA16 as a "nuclear assembly factor" and shows its structural 
        association with pre-60S particles. HPA immunofluorescence data 
        (GO_REF:0000052) also confirms nucleoplasm and nucleolus localization. 
        This is a core cellular compartment for TMA16 function.

        This is consistent with experimental evidence from cryo-EM studies and 
        HPA immunofluorescence data confirming nuclear localization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While this is a computationally inferred annotation, it is fully 
        consistent with the experimentally validated nuclear localization of 
        TMA16. The IBA annotation above provides higher-confidence phylogenetic 
        evidence, and IDA evidence from HPA confirms nucleoplasm/nucleolus 
        localization.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
    review:
      summary: IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping. TMA16 is indeed 
        involved in ribosome biogenesis, but more specifically in ribosomal 
        large subunit (60S) biogenesis. The general term is acceptable but a 
        more specific IDA annotation exists (GO:0042273).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation captures the core biological process of TMA16. 
        While GO:0042273 (ribosomal large subunit biogenesis) is more specific 
        and is annotated with IDA evidence, the parent term GO:0042254 remains 
        valid. The annotation correctly reflects TMA16's role in ribosome 
        assembly.

      summary: IDA annotation based on Human Protein Atlas immunofluorescence

        with TMA16's role in pre-60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis in the 
        nucleus.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The nucleoplasm localization is appropriate for TMA16's function 
        in ribosome biogenesis. Pre-60S particles are assembled in the nucleolus
        and then transit through the nucleoplasm for export. TMA16 associates 
        with pre-60S particles at stages before and after nuclear export 
        (PMID:32669547), consistent with nucleoplasm localization.

      summary: IDA annotation based on Human Protein Atlas immunofluorescence

        ribosomal subunit assembly initiates, consistent with TMA16's role as a 
        ribosome assembly factor.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Nucleolar localization is expected for a protein involved in 
        ribosome biogenesis. The nucleolus is the site of rRNA transcription and
        early steps of ribosomal subunit assembly. TMA16 likely associates with 
        pre-60S particles in the nucleolus before they transit to the 
        nucleoplasm for export. Deep research confirms TMA16 is 
        "nuclear/nucleolar and ribosome-associated."

        assembly/export machinery components.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function annotation for TMA16. The 
        cryo-EM structure (PMID:32669547) shows TMA16 positioned between the 5S 
        RNA and P0 stalk on pre-60S particles, consistent with an adaptor 
        function bridging different components of the preribosome. Deep research
        describes TMA16 as an "export adapter" in the pre-60S pathway. This is 
        more informative than generic "protein binding."
