## Question

Research the SCGB1C1 (Q8TD33) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **SCGB1C1 (Q8TD33) gene** encodes the protein Secretoglobin Family 1C Member 1, which is a member of the secretoglobin superfamily in humans[3][5][7]. This protein is primarily predicted to be **secreted into the extracellular region**[3][5], and is associated with several biological processes, molecular functions, and disease associations.

### Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Gene Symbol:** SCGB1C1
- **Protein Name:** Secretoglobin Family 1C Member 1 (SG1C1_HUMAN)
- **HGNC ID:** 18394
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8TD33
- **NCBI Gene ID:** 147199[3][5][7]

---

### Molecular Function

- **Secretoglobins** are small, secreted proteins often involved in immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory responses, and tissue protection[2][5].
- **SCGB1C1** is predicted to have **binding functions** typical of secretoglobins, such as binding to small hydrophobic molecules, though its specific ligands and activities remain less well characterized than other family members[5].
- **Gene Ontology (GO) annotations** suggest involvement in protein binding and possibly in modulating immune responses, but direct experimental evidence for SCGB1C1’s molecular function is limited[10].

---

### Biological Processes

- **SCGB1C1** is implicated in **immune system processes** and may play a role in **inflammatory regulation**[3][4].
- It is associated with **inflammatory spondylopathy**, suggesting a possible role in inflammatory disease mechanisms[3].
- Functional association datasets link SCGB1C1 to over 1,500 biological entities, including disease, phenotype, and chemical associations, indicating broad potential involvement in cellular and organismal processes[4].

---

### Cellular Localization

- **Main localization:** **Extracellular region** (secreted protein)[3][5].
- **Subcellular annotation:** No transmembrane regions; predicted to be secreted based on signal peptide analysis[1][5].
- **Tissue expression:** Expression data indicate presence in various tissues, but with low tissue specificity; detailed single-cell and tissue-level expression profiles are available in the Human Protein Atlas[1][3].

---

### Protein Domains

- **Secretoglobin domain:** Characteristic of the secretoglobin family, typically forming small, compact structures that can bind hydrophobic molecules[5].
- **No transmembrane domains**; contains a signal peptide for secretion[1][5].
- **Structural features:** Predicted structures are available via AlphaFold and Human Protein Atlas, showing the typical secretoglobin fold[1].

---

### Known Interactions

- **Protein-protein interactions:** Specific interaction partners for SCGB1C1 are not well established, but secretoglobins often form homo- or heterodimers[2][5].
- **Functional associations:** Co-expression and functional association data suggest links to immune-related proteins and pathways[4].
- **No direct evidence** for interaction with other secretoglobins or specific receptors in humans as of 2024.

---

### Disease Associations

- **Inflammatory Spondylopathy:** SCGB1C1 is associated with this inflammatory disease, though the mechanistic link is not fully elucidated[3].
- **Potential marker:** Some studies suggest SCGB1C1 expression may serve as a marker for susceptibility to certain conditions, but further validation is needed[6].
- **No strong evidence** for direct involvement in cancer or other major diseases, unlike some other secretoglobins[2][3].

---

### Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)

- **Updated annotations** in GeneCards and UniProt (2024) confirm extracellular localization and disease association with inflammatory spondylopathy[3][5].
- **Human Protein Atlas (2024):** Provides detailed RNA and protein expression data, supporting the secreted nature and broad tissue distribution of SCGB1C1[1].
- **Functional association studies** (Harmonizome, 2024) highlight extensive links to immune and inflammatory processes, but experimental validation remains limited[4].

---

### Expert Opinions and Analysis

- **Secretoglobins** are increasingly recognized for their roles in immune modulation and tissue protection, but SCGB1C1 is less studied than other family members such as SCGB1A1[2].
- **Current consensus** is that SCGB1C1 is a secreted protein with potential immunomodulatory functions, but more research is needed to clarify its specific molecular activities and disease relevance[3][5].

---

### Relevant Statistics and Data

- **GeneCards (2025):** Lists SCGB1C1 as having 1,507 functional associations across 38 datasets[4].
- **Expression data:** SCGB1C1 shows low tissue specificity, with expression detected in multiple tissues but not highly enriched in any particular cell type[1][3].

**In summary:** SCGB1C1 encodes a secreted protein of the secretoglobin family, with predicted roles in immune modulation and inflammation, extracellular localization, and association with inflammatory spondylopathy. Its molecular function and interactions remain incompletely characterized, and further research is needed to clarify its biological significance[3][5][1][4].
