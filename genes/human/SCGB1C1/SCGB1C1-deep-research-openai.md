## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene SCGB1C1 (Q8TD33) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# SCGB1C1 (Q8TD33) – Secretoglobin Family 1C Member 1 in Humans

## Gene and Protein Overview  
**SCGB1C1** (secretoglobin family 1C member 1), also known by the alias **RYD5**, encodes a small secreted protein in the secretoglobin superfamily ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C1#:~:text=Aliases%20for%20SCGB1C1%20Gene)). Secretoglobins are a family of low-molecular-weight secreted proteins (~10 kDa) often forming dimers, known for binding small hydrophobic ligands and modulating inflammation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30768367/#:~:text=Secretoglobins%20%28SCGBs%29%20are%20cytokine,relationships%20among%20the%20SCGBs%2C%20their)). SCGB1C1 was first identified in the early 1990s as a *ligand-binding protein* expressed in the olfactory mucosa ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). It shares the characteristic “uteroglobin fold” structure of secretoglobins, which creates a hydrophobic cavity for ligand binding ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). While genome annotations predict only a generic function, recent research has begun to elucidate SCGB1C1’s specific roles in *olfaction* and *immune regulation*.  

**Synonyms and homologs:** In older literature SCGB1C1 is referred to as **“ligand binding protein RYD5”**, reflecting its discovery as a putative binding protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). It is distinct from the similarly named **SCGB1A1** (uteroglobin/Clara cell protein), though both are secretoglobins. The mouse **Scgb1c1** gene encodes the orthologous protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20mouse%20UGB,is%20orthologous%20to%20human%20SCGB1A1)), suggesting conserved function across species. Notably, rodents have a large expansion of secretoglobin genes (e.g., dozens of androgen-binding proteins in saliva for pheromonal communication) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=Scgb1b%20and%20Scgb2b%3A%20The%20androgen,ABP%29%20family)), whereas humans possess only a few; SCGB1C1 may represent a vestigial component of human chemosensory and immune systems.  

## Expression and Localization  
**Tissue distribution:** SCGB1C1 expression is relatively tissue-restricted. It is *predominantly expressed in the nasal olfactory region*, specifically in **Bowman’s glands** of the olfactory mucosa ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). These glands secrete onto the olfactory epithelium, consistent with SCGB1C1’s role in nasal mucus. Transcriptomic atlases (e.g. Human Protein Atlas) indicate **enhanced mRNA expression** in a few tissues such as the **salivary gland, pancreas,** and **retina** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000188076-SCGB1C1#:~:text=TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Tissue%20specificity,Low%20human%20brain%20regional%20specificity)), although protein-level evidence in those sites is limited. Low expression is observed in most other tissues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=147199#:~:text=Expression%20Low%20expression%20observed%20in,See%20more%20Orthologs%20mouse%20all)), and it is not abundant in blood. Interestingly, single-cell RNA data suggest SCGB1C1 transcripts may be present in some immune cells (e.g. neutrophils, basophils) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000188076-SCGB1C1#:~:text=expression%20cluster%5E%7Bi%7D%20Platelets%20,basophil%2C%20neutrophil%29%20Immune%20cell)), but this requires further validation. Overall, SCGB1C1 appears to be produced mainly by specialized exocrine glands and perhaps certain immune or epithelial cells in mucosal sites.

**Subcellular localization:** The SCGB1C1 protein is **secreted to the extracellular space**. It possesses a signal peptide for secretion and lacks transmembrane regions ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000188076-SCGB1C1#:~:text=PROTEIN%20EXPRESSION%20AND%20LOCALIZATION%20Tissue,i%7D%20Secreted)). Empirical evidence places it in secretory glandular fluids – for example, in the olfactory mucus covering sensory neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). There, SCGB1C1 would carry out its function outside the cell, interacting with external ligands (odorants or signaling molecules) and cell surface receptors. No internal (cytosolic or organelle) localization has been reported, which aligns with its secretory role.  

## Biological Function and Roles  

### Odorant Binding in the Olfactory System  
The **primary function of SCGB1C1** is believed to be as an **odorant-binding protein (OBP)** in the nasal olfactory mucosa. A 2011 genomics review noted that human SCGB1C1 is localized to Bowman’s glands, where it “acts as an odorant-binding protein” ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). Its inferred ligands are *small hydrophobic molecules* – essentially, volatile odorants or other hydrophobic chemicals in inhaled air ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). By binding odorant molecules in the mucus, SCGB1C1 may serve at least two purposes: (1) **Transport/Presentation of odorants** – ferrying hydrophobic odor molecules through the aqueous mucus to olfactory receptors, thereby facilitating smell perception; and (2) **Buffering or inactivation** of odorants – sequestering odor molecules to modulate sensitivity or to clear excess stimulants after receptor activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=bind%20to%20either%20lipopolysaccharides%20,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). This concept is analogous to odorant-binding proteins in other species (often lipocalins), which prolong or dampen odorant signals. In fact, the initial discovery of RYD5 (SCGB1C1) in rodents suggested it is part of a diverse set of OBPs in the olfactory epithelium that bind distinct classes of odorants ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=bind%20to%20either%20lipopolysaccharides%20,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). The SCGB1C1 protein’s hydrophobic binding pocket (characteristic of the uteroglobin fold) is well-suited to encapsulate lipophilic odorant compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons or pheromone-like molecules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). 

**Evidence for odorant binding:** While direct binding assays in humans are not extensively documented, early studies provide clues. The rat homolog of SCGB1C1 (clone RYD5) showed sequence similarity to proteins known to bind polychlorinated biphenyls (highly hydrophobic compounds), hinting at a capacity to bind environmental chemicals ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)). Additionally, SCGB1C1’s specific expression in olfactory **Bowman’s gland cells**, rather than general circulation, strongly supports a role in local odorant handling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). Taken together, the data suggest SCGB1C1 acts as a soluble *odorant carrier* in the perireceptor environment of the nose. This function is analogous to how other secretoglobins (e.g. SCGB1A1/Clara cell protein) bind small lipophilic molecules like steroids or irritants ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC452990/#:~:text=predicted%20proteins%20for%20three%20of,bind%20separate%20classes%20of%20odorants)), reflecting a common theme of the secretoglobin family in chemical binding and detoxification.  

### Immune Regulation and Pathway Involvement  
Beyond chemosensory function, emerging research indicates that SCGB1C1 has an important role in **immunoregulation at mucosal surfaces**. Secretoglobins are often described as “cytokine-like” due to their ability to modulate inflammation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30768367/#:~:text=Secretoglobins%20%28SCGBs%29%20are%20cytokine,relationships%20among%20the%20SCGBs%2C%20their)), and recent studies suggest SCGB1C1 fits this paradigm. Notably, **SCGB1C1 is implicated in controlling airway inflammation and allergic responses**. In 2024, Kim *et al.* demonstrated that administering recombinant SCGB1C1 in a mouse model of allergic asthma caused a significant suppression of Th2-driven inflammation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). Treated mice showed reduced airway hyper-responsiveness and eosinophilic infiltration, along with decreased *IL-4* and *IL-5* (key Th2 cytokines) in lung tissues ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). Strikingly, SCGB1C1 treatment boosted anti-inflammatory mediators *IL-10* and *TGF-β* in bronchoalveolar fluid and expanded the population of **Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T-cells (Tregs)** in lymphoid tissues ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). This shift toward a Treg/IL-10 dominant environment led to lower IgE levels and overall amelioration of allergic airway inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11173076/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,4%20in%20the%20LLN)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11173076/#:~:text=lung%2C%20and%20serum%20total%20and,4%20in%20the%20LLN)). The authors concluded that SCGB1C1 may be a **major endogenous regulator** that helps *suppress excessive immune responses* in the airways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11173076/#:~:text=match%20at%20L49%20induction%20of,for%20suppressing%20allergic%20airway%20inflammation)). In practical terms, SCGB1C1 appears to promote tolerance and resolution of inflammation – a role reminiscent of SCGB1A1 (Clara cell protein), which is known to dampen lung inflammation. However, SCGB1C1’s mechanism is not fully defined; it may interact with specific receptors on immune cells or bind pro-inflammatory ligands (e.g. allergens or lipids) to neutralize them. Further research is ongoing to identify the molecular targets of SCGB1C1 in immune pathways.

**Pathway context:** While SCGB1C1 is not a classic enzyme or receptor in a defined signaling cascade, its activity influences key **cytokine signaling pathways** in mucosal immunity. By increasing IL-10 and TGF-β, SCGB1C1 skews the immune response towards a regulatory (anti-inflammatory) pathway, engaging the **IL-10/TGF-β axis** which is crucial for Treg function and immune tolerance ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). Concurrently, the protein’s suppression of IL-4/IL-5 indicates that it down-regulates the **Th2 (IgE-mediated allergy) pathway** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). These effects position SCGB1C1 as a modulator in the network of cytokines: it indirectly enhances signaling that curbs inflammation (via TGF-β and IL-10 receptors on immune cells) and inhibits signaling that leads to eosinophilia and IgE production (via IL-4/IL-5 pathways). In summary, SCGB1C1 can be seen as a *soluble immune-modulatory factor* integrating into immune signaling circuits to maintain mucosal homeostasis.

**Clinical and experimental evidence:** Observational studies support SCGB1C1’s importance in human inflammatory conditions. For instance, **nasal polyposis**, a chronic inflammatory disease of the sinonasal cavity, has been linked to SCGB1C1 dysregulation. A 2018 study found that *SCGB1C1 mRNA levels are significantly elevated in nasal polyp tissues* compared to normal nasal mucosa (p = 0.003) ([cellmolbiol.org](https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1686#:~:text=polymorphisms%20and%20the%20gene%20expression%2C,found%20between%20a%20high%20level)). The same study identified **promoter polymorphisms** in the SCGB1C1 gene (notably rs113795008 and rs2280540) that were more frequent in patients with nasal polyps (p = 0.005 and 0.045) ([cellmolbiol.org](https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1686#:~:text=expression%20of%20Secretoglobin%201C1%20in,of%20developing%20NP%20in%20the)). The presence of a certain variant genotype was associated with higher SCGB1C1 expression in the polyp tissue ([cellmolbiol.org](https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1686#:~:text=increased%20in%20NP%20%28P%3D%200,the%20gene%20expression%20biology%20in)). These findings suggest that genetic changes affecting SCGB1C1 expression may contribute to susceptibility to chronic sinonasal inflammation ([cellmolbiol.org](https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1686#:~:text=Secretoglobin%201C1%20in%20NP%20,the%20gene%20expression%20biology%20in)). It is intriguing to speculate that SCGB1C1 upregulation in polyps might be a compensatory, anti-inflammatory response (given its known **anti-inflammatory action**), or conversely that dysregulated SCGB1C1 might alter mucosal immunity in a way that predisposes to polyp formation. Additional studies (e.g. on SCGB1C1 levels in airway infections or autoimmune conditions) would further clarify its role, but current evidence consistently points to SCGB1C1 as a **protective immunomodulator** in the respiratory tract.

## Conclusions and Current Understanding  
**SCGB1C1** is a specialized secreted protein with dual roles in chemical sensing and immune homeostasis. **Functionally**, it serves as an odorant-binding protein in the **extracellular nasal mucus**, binding hydrophobic odor molecules to facilitate olfaction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). At the same time, it has emerged as an **anti-inflammatory mediator** in the airway, capable of dampening allergic immune responses by shifting cytokine profiles and expanding regulatory T-cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). These activities suggest SCGB1C1 is part of the body’s frontline defense in the nose and lungs – it can bind inhaled organic molecules (potentially odorants or even pollutants) and influence immune reactions to those stimuli. The protein localizes outside the cell (secreted into glandular fluids), where it can interact with both chemical ligands and cell-surface receptors. 

In terms of **biochemical pathways**, SCGB1C1 is not an enzyme or receptor but functions in a *carrier and signaling capacity*. It likely carries its odorant ligands through mucus to olfactory receptors (contributing to the sensory transduction pathway of smell), and it partakes in **immune signaling pathways** by modulating cytokine levels (thereby integrating into the network that controls inflammation). The precise molecular partners of SCGB1C1 remain to be defined – ongoing research is investigating whether SCGB1C1 binds to specific cell-surface receptors on immune cells or scavenges pro-inflammatory molecules to exert its effects. 

**Expert perspective:** Reviews of the secretoglobin family highlight that many of these proteins (including SCGB1C1) have **“largely unknown” functions and were historically understudied ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30768367/#:~:text=Secretoglobins%20%28SCGBs%29%20are%20cytokine,relationships%20among%20the%20SCGBs%2C%20their))**, yet they often exhibit significant immunomodulatory and ligand-binding properties. The latest findings (2023–2024) mark a step change in our understanding by assigning a clear immunological function to SCGB1C1 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). Researchers are now considering SCGB1C1 as a potential therapeutic target or biomarker in respiratory diseases. For example, its ability to induce Tregs and suppress Th2 cytokines opens the possibility of using SCGB1C1 or its analogs to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38892470/#:~:text=administration%20of%20SCGB1C1%20significantly%20inhibited,of%20lung%20function%20through%20the)). Likewise, genetic studies in chronic rhinosinusitis hint that variations in the SCGB1C1 gene could influence disease risk ([cellmolbiol.org](https://cellmolbiol.org/index.php/CMB/article/view/1686#:~:text=increased%20in%20NP%20%28P%3D%200,the%20gene%20expression%20biology%20in)), making it of interest in precision medicine approaches for sinonasal disorders. 

In summary, **SCGB1C1 (Q8TD33)** encodes a secreted protein that **binds hydrophobic small molecules** in the nasal mucosa and **regulates mucosal immunity**. It performs its function in the **extracellular space** (secretions of olfactory and other glands), where it contributes to **olfactory processes** and helps maintain **immune balance** in the airway. Ongoing research and recent experimental evidence are shedding light on this protein’s precise biochemical role and its significance in human health. The convergence of data from molecular, genetic, and functional studies now solidifies SCGB1C1’s identity as both an odorant transporter and an inflammation modulator – a dual functionality that underscores the complex, context-dependent roles of secretoglobin family proteins in biology.
