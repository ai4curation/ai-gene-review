  label: Homo sapiens
description: Secretoglobin family 1C member 1, small secreted protein (~10 kDa) belonging
  to secretoglobin superfamily characterized by four-helix bundle structure. Secretoglobins
  are secreted homodimeric proteins with conserved disulfide bonds and hydrophobic
  cavity capable of binding small lipophilic ligands (steroids, pheromones, lipids).
  SCGB1C1 likely functions as lipid-binding protein with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory
  roles, consistent with other secretoglobin family members. Expression enriched in
  specific epithelia. Secreted into extracellular space or body fluids where it may
  sequester hydrophobic molecules or modulate immune responses. Specific ligands and
  detailed biological function remain incompletely characterized. May play protective
  role in mucosal tissues.
