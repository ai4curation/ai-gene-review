  label: Homo sapiens
description: Secretoglobin family 1C member 1, small secreted protein (~10 kDa) belonging to secretoglobin
  superfamily characterized by four-helix bundle structure. Secretoglobins are secreted homodimeric proteins
  with conserved disulfide bonds and hydrophobic cavity capable of binding small lipophilic ligands (steroids,
  pheromones, lipids). SCGB1C1 likely functions as lipid-binding protein with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory
  roles, consistent with other secretoglobin family members. Expression enriched in specific epithelia.
  Secreted into extracellular space or body fluids where it may sequester hydrophobic molecules or modulate
  immune responses. Specific ligands and detailed biological function remain incompletely characterized.
  May play protective role in mucosal tissues. In mouse asthma models, intranasal SCGB1C1 suppresses allergic
  airway inflammation and expands regulatory T cells, suggesting an immunomodulatory role that remains to be
  demonstrated in humans.

    label: odorant binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  review:
    summary: SCGB1C1 is reported to localize to Bowman's glands and is thought to act as an odorant-binding protein.
    action: NEW
    reason: Literature describes SCGB1C1 as an odorant-binding protein with small hydrophobic ligands in the olfactory mucosa, but evidence is indirect.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:22155607
      supporting_text: SCGB1C1 has been shown to be localised to Bowman's glands in the olfactory mucosa. Here, it is thought to act as an odorant-binding protein, with ligands appearing to be small, hydrophobic molecules [25].
    - reference_id: PMID:1915264
      supporting_text: The sequence homologies and subanatomical location of expression suggest that these proteins might interact with odorants before or after specific recognition by odorant receptors.
