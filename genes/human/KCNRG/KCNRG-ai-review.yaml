description: >-
  KCNRG (potassium channel regulatory protein) is an ER-associated protein that negatively
  regulates
  voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1 family. It contains an N-terminal T1
  (tetramerization)
  domain homologous to those found in Kv alpha-subunits, which allows KCNRG to interact
  with the
  cytoplasmic N-terminal domains of Kv1 channels (specifically KCNA1/Kv1.1 and KCNA4/Kv1.4).
  By
  associating with these channels in the ER, KCNRG retains a fraction of channels
  in endomembranes,
  thereby reducing their surface expression and attenuating K+ currents. KCNRG forms
  homooligomers
  and is located in the 13q14.3 chromosomal region frequently deleted in B-cell malignancies,
  suggesting a possible tumor suppressor role. KCNRG is also recognized as a pulmonary
  autoantigen
  in APS-1 (autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1).

        KCNRG localization to the endoplasmic reticulum is well-supported by experimental
        data.
        PMID:19968958 demonstrates that "KCNRG is an ER-associated protein" and proposes
        it
        "regulates Kv1 family channel proteins by retaining a fraction of channels
        in endomembranes."
        The phylogenetic inference (IBA) is consistent with the experimental evidence.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        The ER localization is central to KCNRG's mechanism of action. By residing
        in the ER,
        KCNRG can interact with newly synthesized Kv channels during their biosynthetic
        pathway
        and prevent their trafficking to the plasma membrane. This is a core aspect
        of KCNRG function.
