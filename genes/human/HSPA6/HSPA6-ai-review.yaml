  HSPA6 (also known as HSP70B') is a strictly stress-inducible member of the HSP70/HSPA
  molecular chaperone family. Unlike the constitutively expressed HSC70 or the basally
  expressed HSPA1A, HSPA6 shows no basal expression and is induced only at higher
  temperatures or under severe stress conditions (PMID:2327978). HSPA6 has the canonical
  HSP70 architecture: an N-terminal ATPase (nucleotide-binding) domain, a substrate-
  binding domain with a lid, and a C-terminal EEVD motif mediating co-chaperone
  interactions (DOI:10.3390/biom13040604). It functions as an ATP-dependent protein
  folding chaperone, cycling through ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release to assist
  in protein folding and refolding, with J-domain proteins (HSP40/DNAJ) delivering
  clients and stimulating hydrolysis, and nucleotide exchange factors (BAG-family,
  HSPBP1, HSP110) promoting ADP release and client recycling
  (DOI:10.3390/biom13040604). In neuronal heat-stress models, HSPA6 is one of the
  most strongly induced HSP70 paralogs, showing approximately 13-14-fold induction
  under extreme heat vs approximately 2-3-fold under mild heat, with gene expression
  peaking at approximately 1 hour and protein at approximately 5-6 hours post-stress
  (DOI:10.3390/biology12030416). HSPA6 is co-expressed with key co-chaperones DNAJB1
  (J-domain), BAG3 (NEF), and HSPH1/HSP110 (NEF) under stress, forming a coordinated
  inducible chaperone module for protein disaggregation and refolding
  (DOI:10.3390/biology12030416). Notably, HSPA6 displays substrate specificity
  distinct from other HSP70 family members; it cannot refold heat-denatured luciferase
  but can assist in reactivation of heat-unfolded p53, suggesting it has evolved to
  maintain specific critical functions under conditions of severe stress (PMID:21231916).
  HSPA6 has also been implicated in RTP1S-dependent trafficking of olfactory receptors,
  where co-expression of HSPA6 partially enhanced surface expression of an olfactory
  receptor by approximately 50-80%, interacting via its C-terminal domain with the
  RTP1S N-terminus (DOI:10.3390/ijms24097829). The HSPA6/HSP70B' promoter has been
  exploited in synthetic biology as a thermal gene switch for remote control of
  mammalian cells via photothermal activation (DOI:10.1021/acssynbio.7b00455).

      IBA annotation of GO:0005634 (nucleus) based on phylogenetic inference from
      HSP70 family orthologs. Multiple HSP70 family members are known to localize
      to the nucleus, and the phylogenetic evidence is broad, including yeast, worm,
      fly, and mammalian orthologs. CD-CODE database entries for HSPA6 (P17066)
      include nuclear speckle and nucleolus localizations, providing indirect support.
      However, direct experimental evidence for nuclear localization of HSPA6 is
      limited. Khalouei et al. (2014) used YFP-tagged HSPA6 in neuronal cells and
      primarily observed cytoplasmic and centriolar localization after heat stress
      (PMID:24061851). IBA annotations are generally reliable and this is plausible
      for an HSP70 family member.

      Some HSP70 family members have been reported at the plasma membrane,
      particularly HSPA1A in cancer cells. There is no direct experimental evidence
      for HSPA6 at the plasma membrane in available publications. The IBA phylogenetic
      support includes several orthologs. While plasma membrane localization is
      documented for some family members, this may not be a core localization for
      the strictly stress-inducible HSPA6.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Plasma membrane localization is documented for some HSP70 family members (e.g.
      HSPA1A in stressed/cancer cells), making the phylogenetic inference plausible.
      However, there is no direct evidence for HSPA6 at the plasma membrane and this
      is unlikely to be a core localization for this strictly stress-inducible member.
      The IBA is retained as non-core because the phylogenetic inference is reasonable
      but this is not experimentally validated for HSPA6.

      who showed HSPA6 can assist in reactivation (refolding) of heat-unfolded p53
      (PMID:21231916). However, HSPA6 showed notably limited refolding capability
      compared to other HSP70 members -- it could not refold heat-denatured luciferase

      substrate-specific rather than general.

      HSP70 family proteins (including HSC70/HSPA8) are well-established exosome
      markers, so detection of HSPA6 is not surprising. However, this may reflect
      co-purification with other more abundant HSP70 family members, especially since
      HSPA6 has no basal expression and would not be expected in normal parotid
      exosomes unless the cells were stressed.

      HSPA6 detection in exosomes (PMID:19199708) is plausible but raises questions
      given that HSPA6 has no basal expression (PMID:2327978). This may reflect
      cross-identification with other HSP70 family members given high sequence

      indicating HSPA6 was found co-localizing with the COP9 signalosome rather than
      being a core component. HSPA6 was likely identified as one of 52 putative CSN
      interacting proteins. HSP70 proteins are commonly identified in affinity

      TAS annotation of GO:0006986 (response to unfolded protein) from Leung et al.
      (1990), the original paper characterizing HSPA6/HSP70B' (PMID:2327978). The
      paper showed that HSPA6 is a heat-inducible HSP70 family member with no basal
      expression, induced only at higher temperatures. As a stress-inducible molecular
      chaperone of the HSP70 family, HSPA6 participates in the cellular response to
      unfolded/denatured proteins generated by heat stress. The annotation is
      appropriate, though the direct connection to unfolded protein specifically
      (rather than heat stress generally) requires inference from the HSP70 function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      HSPA6 is a heat-inducible HSP70 molecular chaperone (PMID:2327978) that
      functions in refolding denatured proteins (PMID:21231916). The response to
      unfolded protein annotation is appropriate because HSPA6 is induced under
      conditions that generate unfolded proteins (heat stress) and directly participates
      in their refolding. The TAS evidence from the original characterization paper is
      reasonable.

- description: >-
    Strictly stress-inducible ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone with
    substrate selectivity distinct from other HSP70 family members. HSPA6
    shows no basal expression and is induced only under severe thermal stress,
    with approximately 13-14-fold induction under extreme heat vs approximately
    2-3-fold under mild heat in neuronal models (DOI:10.3390/biology12030416).
    It possesses intrinsic ATPase activity comparable to HSPA1A when
    stimulated by J-domain co-chaperones, but displays restricted substrate
    specificity: it can refold heat-unfolded p53 but not heat-denatured
    luciferase, and does not suppress polyQ aggregation or confer
    thermotolerance. Under thermal stress, HSPA6 rapidly localizes to
    centrioles, suggesting a specific stress-protective role at this
    structure. HSPA6 operates as part of a coordinated inducible chaperone
    module with DNAJB1, BAG3, and HSPH1/HSP110 that expands folding and
    disaggregation capacity under proteotoxic stress
    (DOI:10.3390/biology12030416). The HSP70 chaperone cycle involves J-domain
    protein delivery of clients and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, followed by
    nucleotide exchange factor-mediated ADP release and client recycling;
    HSP110 proteins cooperate with HSP70 and HSP40 to disaggregate and refold
    denatured proteins (DOI:10.3390/biom13040604). HSPA6 has also been
    implicated in RTP1S-dependent membrane protein trafficking, partially
    enhancing olfactory receptor surface expression by approximately 50-80%
    (DOI:10.3390/ijms24097829).
