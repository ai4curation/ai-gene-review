description: >-
  DNAJB8 is a class II J-domain protein (Hsp40/DNAJ family, subfamily B) that
  functions as a potent suppressor of polyglutamine protein aggregation. Unlike
  canonical DNAJ co-chaperones that assist Hsp70-mediated protein refolding,
  DNAJB8 acts primarily as a holdase, binding aggregation-prone substrates
  (particularly polyQ-expanded proteins) to prevent their aggregation
  independently of its J-domain/Hsp70-stimulating activity. The anti-aggregation
  activity resides in its C-terminal serine-rich (SSF-SST) region and C-terminal
  tail, and requires histone deacetylase (HDAC4, HDAC6, SIRT2) interactions.
  DNAJB8 is enriched in testis but expressed in multiple tissues, and localizes
  to both cytosol and nucleus.

      direct assay that DNAJB8 localizes to the cytosol (IDA for GO:0005829,
      cytosol). The IBA phylogenetic inference is consistent with experimental
      data for both DNAJB8 and its close paralogue DNAJB6, which is also
      cytoplasmic. Note that cytoplasm (GO:0005737) is broader than cytosol

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein folding (GO:0006457) is broadly acceptable as
      DNAJB8 is a J-domain co-chaperone involved in proteostasis. However,
      DNAJB8 acts primarily as a holdase that suppresses aggregation of
      polyQ-expanded proteins rather than promoting productive protein folding
      (PMID:21231916, PMID:20159555). Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) showed that
      chaperones suppressing polyQ aggregation (like DNAJB8) could not stimulate
      luciferase refolding, distinguishing holdase from foldase activities.
      The term protein folding is therefore somewhat imprecise for DNAJB8, but
      the broader proteostasis role is real. As an IBA annotation it represents a
      reasonable phylogenetic inference at an appropriate level of specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although DNAJB8 is functionally a holdase rather than a canonical foldase,
      it participates in the broader protein folding quality control network as a
      J-domain co-chaperone. The IBA phylogenetic inference is sound for the DNAJB
      subfamily. The qualifier in GOA is 'involved_in' which is appropriate for a
      chaperone that participates in protein folding pathways even if its specific
      role is aggregation suppression rather than productive folding. Experimental
      support comes from PMID:23612975 (IDA for the same term) and PMID:20159555.

      chaperone that binds polyQ-expanded proteins and other aggregation-prone
      substrates to prevent their aggregation, largely independently of Hsp70

      This IDA annotation cites PMID:21231916 (Hageman et al. 2011), which
      demonstrated that different HSP70/DNAJ family members have distinct
      chaperone-like activities. Chaperones that suppressed polyQ aggregation
      (holdase activity) were found not to stimulate luciferase refolding
      (foldase activity), and vice versa (PMID:21231916). DNAJB8 falls in
      the holdase category. The earlier study by the same group (PMID:20159555,
      Hageman et al. 2010) specifically showed DNAJB8 is a superior suppressor
      of polyQ aggregation with activity largely independent of its J-domain.
      Gillis et al. (PMID:23612975) further confirmed that DNAJB8 suppresses
      polyQ protein aggregation by directly binding the polyQ tract. The best
      interim replacement is GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), with the
      caveat that DNAJB8 is a holdase, not a foldase, and no dedicated holdase
      GO term currently exists.

      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. The experimental evidence from Hageman et al.
      (PMID:21231916) demonstrated that DNAJB8 has chaperone-like holdase activity
      rather than mere unfolded protein binding. The study showed that chaperones
      suppressing polyQ aggregation could not stimulate luciferase refolding,
      establishing a functional distinction between holdase and foldase activities.
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is the best available replacement
      term, though it is imprecise for a holdase. DNAJB8 already has GO:0044183
      annotations from IBA and IDA (PMID:23612975) evidence. The IDA evidence

      HDA annotation for nuclear localization from de Mateo et al.

      DNAJB8 was identified among 403 proteins in isolated human sperm nuclei by
      LC-MS/MS. DNAJB8 is enriched in testis (HPA: tissue enriched in testis;
      Bgee: expressed in sperm), so its detection in the sperm nuclear proteome
      is biologically plausible. However, this is a high-throughput proteomics
      study and the nuclear detection could reflect a genuine nuclear pool or
      could be a consequence of the protein being highly abundant in testis.
      The nuclear localization is independently supported by IDA evidence from
      PMID:21231916. DNAJB8 is known to localize to both cytosol and nucleus.
