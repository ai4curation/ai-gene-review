## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8NHS0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 8;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DNAJB8;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** DnaJ_domain. (IPR001623); DnaJ_domain_CS. (IPR018253); DNJB2/6-like. (IPR043183); J_dom_sf. (IPR036869); DnaJ (PF00226)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DNAJB8" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DNAJB8' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DNAJB8** (gene ID: DNAJB8, UniProt: Q8NHS0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation research report for human DNAJB8 (UniProt Q8NHS0)

Publication date of report: 2026-02-20

1. Target verification (gene/protein identity)
DNAJB8 (UniProt Q8NHS0) encodes “DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 8”, a member of the HSP40/J-domain protein (JDP) family in Homo sapiens, studied experimentally as a chaperone/co-chaperone in proteostasis and as a cancer-testis antigen in cancer stem-like cell (CSC/CIC)-directed immunotherapy. Its experimentally described domain architecture (N-terminal J-domain, G/F-rich region, S/T-rich region, C-terminal domain) matches the UniProt/InterPro expectation for a class B DNAJ protein. (ryder2021regulatoryinterdomaininteractions pages 1-2)

2. Key concepts and current mechanistic understanding
2.1 Definitions and conceptual framework
DNAJB8 is a J-domain protein (Hsp40 family) that functions within the Hsp70 chaperone system by regulating client recognition/handling and (in many JDPs) stimulating Hsp70 ATPase activity via the J-domain; however, DNAJB8 also exhibits strong “holdase” anti-aggregation activity that can be partly independent of canonical J-domain/Hsp70 co-chaperone action depending on the client and assay context. (hageman2010adnajbchaperone pages 1-2, mcmahon2021dnajbchaperonessuppress pages 1-2)

2.2 Domain architecture and regulatory model
Structural/biophysical evidence supports that DNAJB8 contains: (i) an N-terminal J-domain (JD), (ii) a G/F-rich region, (iii) an S/T-rich region, and (iv) a C-terminal domain (CTD). A key regulatory mechanism is an intramolecular JD–CTD interaction that can sequester the JD surface, thereby preventing Hsp70 interaction; this has been proposed as a reversible “switch” that controls Hsp70 recruitment. (ryder2021regulatoryinterdomaininteractions pages 1-2)

2.3 Cellular localization and self-assembly
In cells, DNAJB8 can self-assemble/oligomerize and form juxtanuclear puncta. In a quantitative imaging readout, overexpressed DnaJB8–Clover formed juxtanuclear puncta (~1.0 µm) in 39.2 ± 3.1% of cells compared with 0.44 ± 0.50% for Clover control; reduced expression decreased puncta frequency to 16.2 ± 0.08%. (ryder2021regulatoryinterdomaininteractions pages 1-2)

2.4 Anti-aggregation/proteostasis functions and client-handling modes
Multiple studies place DNAJB8 among the most potent anti-aggregation DNAJBs, particularly against polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregation.

• PolyQ and related toxic aggregation suppression: DNAJB8 (with DNAJB6b) was identified as a superior suppressor of aggregation and toxicity of disease-associated polyQ proteins. This activity can be largely independent of the Hsp70-interacting J-domain and instead requires a C-terminal serine-rich region and tail, linking substrate binding/holdase activity to low-complexity C-terminal features. (hageman2010adnajbchaperone pages 1-2)

• Distinct substrate-binding regions for amyloid vs non-amyloid inclusions: Using a destabilized firefly luciferase reporter (FlucDM), DNAJB8 suppresses inclusion formation by promoting Hsp70-dependent proteasomal degradation of the client. For DNAJB6/DNAJB8, a serine-rich stretch needed to prevent fibrillar/amyloid aggregation was not required for FlucDM inclusion suppression; instead, a distinct C-terminal TTK-LKS motif was required to inhibit FlucDM inclusion formation, supporting at least two separable client-interaction modes. (mcmahon2021dnajbchaperonessuppress pages 1-2)

• HDAC-linked regulation: DNAJB8’s polyQ anti-aggregation function was reported to involve a serine-rich region and C-terminal tail, and to be associated with HDAC-dependent activities; DNAJB8 was reported to interact with HDAC4/HDAC6/SIRT2, and its activity was sensitive to pharmacological HDAC4 inhibition. (hageman2010adnajbchaperone pages 1-2)

3. Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
3.1 2024: Oligomerization mechanism resolved at atomic resolution and decoupled from chaperone function
A 2024 Structure paper identified a short aromatic-rich steric-zipper motif within the S/T-rich domain (147AFSSFN152) as a principal determinant of DNAJB8 self-assembly. MicroED at 0.75 Å revealed a class 6 steric zipper stabilized by aromatic interactions (notably F148 and F151) and antiparallel β-strand hydrogen bonding. Mutational analysis indicated F151 is a primary driver of full-length DNAJB8 self-assembly. Importantly, engineered monomeric/non-assembling DNAJB8 variants retained substrate binding and anti-aggregation function, supporting a model in which oligomerization is mechanistically separable from chaperone activity for several tested substrates. (ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 29-36, ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 3-5, ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 1-3)

Quantitative/experimental data highlights from this 2024 work include:
• DLS-derived hydrodynamic radius (Rh) differences across mutants (e.g., DNAJB8WT initial Rh = 7.9 ± 0.2 nm; DNAJB8S3 Rh = 2.4 ± 0.1 nm). (ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 3-5)
• SEC-MALS evidence that a monomeric variant (DNAJB8S3) was predominantly monomeric (99.3% mass) with molar mass 25.45 ± 0.016 kg/mol; similarly the F148S/F151S double mutant yielded 93% as a single peak with molar mass 25.8 ± 0.2 kg/mol. (ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 29-36, ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 3-5)
• In a tau seeding cellular readout, seeded cells expressing mRuby3 alone were 16.5 ± 2.5% tau-positive; DNAJB8WT reduced tau FRET seeding signal by ~2-fold and oligomerization-defective mutants were not significantly different from DNAJB8WT in tau suppression in the tested comparisons. (ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 11-13)

3.2 2023–2024 translational trend: DNAJB8 as a CSC/CIC antigen and cancer-testis antigen target
Although many foundational DNAJB8 cancer-immunology studies are earlier (2012–2020), a notable 2022–2024 theme is positioning DNAJB8 as a candidate target in CSC/CIC-directed immunotherapy and precision targeting via HLA/peptide recognition.

4. Biological roles in disease and cancer (mechanistic evidence)
4.1 Cancer stem-like cells / tumor-initiating capacity
A highly cited Cancer Research study (2012) identified DNAJB8 as preferentially expressed in renal cancer CSC/CIC populations and implicated it functionally in maintaining tumor-initiating ability. Overexpression increased the side population (SP) fraction and tumor-initiating ability, whereas attenuation decreased SP cells and reduced tumor initiation. (nishizawa2012hspdnajb8controls pages 1-2)

A follow-up in colorectal cancer CSC/CIC context showed DNAJB8 preferential expression in CRC CSC/CIC, enhancement of stem-cell marker expression and tumorigenicity when overexpressed, and induction of DNAJB8-specific CTL responses. (nishizawa2012hspdnajb8controls pages 1-2)

4.2 Chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer via TP53/MDR1 and extracellular vesicle transfer
A 2022 Cell Death & Disease study provided mechanistic evidence linking DNAJB8 to oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer. Key claims supported by experimental evidence include:
• DNAJB8 interacts with TP53 and inhibits TP53 ubiquitination, stabilizing TP53 protein and leading to MDR1/P-gp upregulation and increased oxaliplatin resistance. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 5-6, wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 1-2)
• DNAJB8 is enriched in conditioned medium and in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from oxaliplatin-resistant cells, and sEV-mediated transfer of DNAJB8 can transmit resistance to recipient (sensitive) cells; inhibition of EV transfer (e.g., using GW4869) blocked transfer-mediated resistance features. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9, wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 9-10)
• Protein-level changes consistent with this pathway are visualized in Western blots showing multi-fold increases in DNAJB8, TP53, and P-gp in resistant/sEV transfer contexts; an example densitometry indicates TP53 increased up to ~5.4-fold, P-gp up to ~4.1-fold, and DNAJB8 up to ~3.8-fold in the reported conditions. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 10-11, wang2022dnajb8insmall media 4a707267)

Clinical/prognostic modeling reported in this study supports a potential biomarker role:
• DNAJB8 levels were associated with TP53 expression in COAD (P < 0.001). (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9)
• A prognostic nomogram incorporating DNAJB8 and clinicopathologic factors achieved a C-index of 0.841 (95% CI 0.802–0.880), and ROC AUCs reported for survival prediction included 0.848 (2-year), 0.713 (3-year), and 0.776 (4-year). (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9, wang2022dnajb8insmall media 058578fa)
• Kaplan–Meier analysis of a signature stratifying patients into high vs low risk showed significantly worse overall survival in the high-risk group (p < 0.0001). (wang2022dnajb8insmall media 058578fa)

5. Current applications and real-world implementations
5.1 Antigen-specific targeting approaches (HLA/peptide-directed biologics)
A 2020 British Journal of Cancer study developed engineered antibodies recognizing an HLA-A24/DNAJB8-derived peptide complex (DNAJB8_143), demonstrating feasibility of targeting DNAJB8-derived antigen presentation rather than the intracellular chaperone directly. Phage-display isolated scFv clones (A10, B10) were engineered into human IgG1 and CD3-engaging bispecific formats.

Quantitative binding and functional metrics include:
• High-affinity binding to cognate HLA/peptide complex: KD = 2.96 × 10−9 M (A10-hIgG1) and KD = 5.04 × 10−9 M (B10-hIgG1). (tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2)
• Antibody formats mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and CD3-engaging bispecific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (BADCC), with B10-(CD3×JB8) reported as superior to A10-(CD3×JB8) in BADCC. (tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2)

These data support an application path where DNAJB8 serves as a CSC/CIC-associated antigenic source for HLA-restricted targeting modalities. (tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2, nishizawa2012hspdnajb8controls pages 1-2)

5.2 Biomarker potential in liquid biopsy (serum sEVs)
The 2022 colon cancer study specifically argues that DNAJB8 levels in serum sEVs may serve as a biomarker for oxaliplatin-resistant colon cancer and for prognostic stratification, supported by survival separation, a high C-index nomogram, and AUC values for survival prediction. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9, wang2022dnajb8insmall media 058578fa)

6. Expert opinions and integrative analysis from authoritative sources
A 2022 review of DNAJB proteins in cancer emphasizes that DNAJB8 is experimentally implicated in CSC/CIC maintenance in RCC and CRC, can be induced by HSF1 (co-regulated with SOX2), and has been proposed as an immunotherapy target; it also summarizes evidence linking DNAJB8 to TP53 regulation and MDR1-mediated chemoresistance, including transfer via small extracellular vesicles and correlation with poor overall survival in colon cancer contexts. (kim2022multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

7. Relevant statistics and quantitative data (selected)
Chaperone biology / structure:
• JD–CTD regulated Hsp70 recruitment model; puncta formation frequency: 39.2 ± 3.1% of cells (DNAJB8–Clover) vs 0.44 ± 0.50% (Clover), with reduced-expression puncta frequency 16.2 ± 0.08%. (ryder2021regulatoryinterdomaininteractions pages 1-2)
• 2024 steric-zipper assembly motif: 147AFSSFN152; SEC-MALS monomeric variants ~25.45 ± 0.016 kg/mol (99.3% monomeric mass) and 25.8 ± 0.2 kg/mol (93% single peak) for F148S/F151S double mutant; DLS Rh differences including DNAJB8WT initial Rh 7.9 ± 0.2 nm and DNAJB8S3 Rh 2.4 ± 0.1 nm. (ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 29-36, ryder2024dnajb8oligomerizationis pages 3-5)

Cancer immunotherapy / targeting:
• scFv/IgG affinities for HLA-A24/DNAJB8 peptide complex: KD = 2.96 × 10−9 M and 5.04 × 10−9 M. (tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2)

Colon cancer chemoresistance / prognosis:
• Nomogram prognostic performance: C-index 0.841 (95% CI 0.802–0.880); AUCs 0.848 (2-year), 0.713 (3-year), 0.776 (4-year); Kaplan–Meier risk group separation p < 0.0001. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9, wang2022dnajb8insmall media 058578fa)
• Western blot densitometry in EV transfer/resistance context indicates multi-fold increases (e.g., TP53 up to ~5.4-fold, P-gp up to ~4.1-fold, DNAJB8 up to ~3.8-fold). (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 10-11, wang2022dnajb8insmall media 4a707267)

8. Pathways and cellular context summary (functional annotation)
• Core molecular function: DNAJB8 is a molecular chaperone/co-chaperone (J-domain protein) that suppresses aggregation of misfolded proteins and can route destabilized clients toward Hsp70-dependent proteasomal degradation; it also forms oligomeric assemblies/puncta and is regulated by inter-domain interactions that modulate Hsp70 recruitment. (mcmahon2021dnajbchaperonessuppress pages 1-2, ryder2021regulatoryinterdomaininteractions pages 1-2, hageman2010adnajbchaperone pages 1-2)
• Proteostasis network placement: DNAJB8 is part of the Hsp40/Hsp70 system and interfaces with protein quality control; distinct motifs in its low-complexity regions mediate client-type-specific suppression (amyloid vs amorphous inclusion). (mcmahon2021dnajbchaperonessuppress pages 1-2, hageman2010adnajbchaperone pages 1-2)
• Cancer-relevant pathway: DNAJB8 can promote chemoresistance in colon cancer by stabilizing TP53 (inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated degradation) leading to MDR1/P-gp upregulation; sEV transfer propagates this resistance phenotype. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 5-6, wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9)
• CSC/CIC biology: DNAJB8 supports CSC/CIC phenotypes and tumor-initiating capacity in RCC and CRC models and can be exploited as an antigenic target for CTL responses or HLA/peptide-directed antibody strategies. (nishizawa2012hspdnajb8controls pages 1-2, tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2)

9. Limitations and evidence gaps
• Several clinically relevant claims (e.g., hazard ratios, precise IC50 shifts, exact responder/nonresponder serum levels) were referenced qualitatively in available excerpts but not always available as explicit numeric values in the extracted text segments; where possible, quantitative model metrics (C-index/AUC) and figure-based fold-changes were captured. (wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9, wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 10-11)
• The tool-retrieved corpus contained strong mechanistic and translational evidence up to 2024, but did not yield DNAJB8-specific 2023–2024 randomized clinical trial evidence; clinical trial searches returned no clearly relevant registered trials in the retrieved state. (tadano2020developmentofan pages 1-2, wang2022dnajb8insmall pages 7-9)
