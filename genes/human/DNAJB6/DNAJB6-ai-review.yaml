description: >-
  DNAJB6 (also known as MRJ/HSJ-2) is a class B Hsp40/J-domain protein (JDP) co-chaperone that stimulates the ATPase activity
  of Hsp70 family members and acts as a potent suppressor of amyloid-type protein aggregation. Unlike canonical foldase
  chaperones, DNAJB6 does not refold denatured proteins but instead exhibits holdase-like activity, preventing aggregation
  of polyglutamine-expanded proteins, tau, and other aggregation-prone substrates. It functions within the Hsp70 chaperone
  network, requiring its J-domain for anti-aggregation activity. DNAJB6 also plays roles in keratin filament organization
  and nuclear pore complex assembly quality control. Mutations in DNAJB6 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type D1
  (LGMDD1). Two major isoforms exist: DNAJB6a (long, predominantly nuclear) and DNAJB6b (short, largely cytosolic),
  with isoform B being particularly important for suppression of protein aggregation.

      DNAJB6 localizes to the cytoplasm, particularly the DNAJB6b isoform which is predominantly cytosolic.
      This is well supported by multiple lines of evidence including immunostaining in PMID:10954706, subcellular
      fractionation in PMID:21231916, and the observation in PMID:22366786 that LGMD1D mutations exert their
      pathogenic effect specifically through the cytoplasmic isoform DNAJB6b. The IBA annotation is appropriately

    summary: >-
      DNAJB6 is a DnaJ co-chaperone that participates in the Hsp70 chaperone network, which broadly functions
      in protein folding and quality control. However, DNAJB6 specifically acts as a holdase rather than a
      foldase -- it suppresses aggregation but cannot stimulate refolding of denatured substrates (PMID:21231916).
      The IBA annotation to GO:0006457 (protein folding) captures the general chaperone pathway context but
      is somewhat misleading for DNAJB6 specifically, since the protein prevents aggregation rather than
      promoting productive folding. However, protein folding as a GO BP term encompasses the broader
      process including aggregation prevention, so the term is acceptable if understood in this context.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While DNAJB6 is specifically a holdase rather than foldase (PMID:21231916), GO:0006457 (protein folding)
      as a biological process broadly encompasses protein quality control activities including aggregation
      prevention. DNAJB6 participates in the Hsp70-dependent protein folding/quality control pathway via
      its J-domain, and as an IBA annotation this represents a reasonable phylogenetically inferred function
      for the DnaJ family. The term is not wrong, though it should be understood that DNAJB6 contributes
      specifically to the anti-aggregation arm of protein quality control.

      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is an MF term describing proteins that bind other proteins to
      assist the protein folding process. DNAJB6 acts as a co-chaperone within the Hsp70 network, functioning
      specifically as a holdase that prevents aggregation rather than assisting productive folding. The IBA

      suppresses polyQ aggregation but cannot stimulate luciferase refolding, indicating holdase-like rather than
      foldase activity. The IBA annotation propagated from phylogenetic inference is broadly correct in that DNAJB6
      engages unfolded clients, but the term itself is being obsoleted. GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is the
      closest available replacement, though its definition ("Binding to a protein or a protein-containing complex to

      This IEA annotation from Ensembl Compara ortholog transfer suggests DNA binding activity.
      There is no direct experimental evidence for DNAJB6 binding DNA. DNAJB6 is a DnaJ co-chaperone
      with well-characterized protein-binding activities (Hsp70, keratin, aggregation-prone substrates)
      but no known nucleic acid binding activity. The J-domain and G/F-rich regions are protein interaction
      domains. While DNAJB6a localizes to the nucleus, this reflects its role in nuclear proteostasis
      rather than DNA binding. This annotation likely results from incorrect ortholog transfer.

      There is no experimental evidence for DNAJB6 DNA binding activity. DNAJB6 is a protein
      chaperone that interacts with Hsp70, keratins, and aggregation-prone substrates.
      Its nuclear localization (isoform A) relates to proteostasis functions, not DNA binding.
      This IEA annotation likely results from erroneous ortholog transfer and is not supported
      by any published literature or UniProt functional annotation. The UniProt entry describes
      only protein-protein interactions and chaperone activity, with no mention of DNA binding.

      PMID:22366786 (Sarparanta et al. 2012) demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy
      that DNAJB6 localizes primarily to Z-disks in skeletal muscle. Electron microscopy of
      LGMD1D patient muscle revealed Z-disk myofibrillar disintegration, and DNAJB6 was found
      in protein accumulations at these sites. This localization is functionally relevant for
      the CASA complex-mediated Z-disk maintenance function.

      Z disc localization is directly demonstrated by immunofluorescence in PMID:22366786 and
      is functionally significant for DNAJB6's role in muscle sarcomere maintenance via the

      of this localization. This is a core localization in skeletal muscle.

      in K8/18 intermediate filament organization. Microinjection of anti-Mrj antibody resulted
      in disorganization of K8/18 filaments without affecting actin filaments or microtubules.
      DNAJB6 bound to K18 through its C-terminus and functioned as a K18-specific co-chaperone

      Intermediate filament organization is a directly demonstrated function of DNAJB6, supported

    description: >-
      DNAJB6 is a class B J-domain co-chaperone that functions as a potent holdase rather
      than a foldase. It prevents aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded proteins, tau, and
      other aggregation-prone substrates, but cannot stimulate refolding of denatured
      proteins. DNAJB6 functions within the HSP70 chaperone network, requiring its J-domain
      for anti-aggregation activity. The DNAJB6b (short, cytosolic) isoform is particularly
      important for suppression of protein aggregation, while DNAJB6a (long) is
      predominantly nuclear. Mutations in DNAJB6 cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
      type D1 (LGMDD1).
