### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O75190
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 6; AltName: Full=HHDJ1; AltName: Full=Heat shock protein J2; Short=HSJ-2; AltName: Full=MRJ; AltName: Full=MSJ-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DNAJB6; Synonyms=HSJ2, MRJ, MSJ1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** DnaJ_domain. (IPR001623); DnaJ_domain_CS. (IPR018253); DNJB2/6-like. (IPR043183); J_dom_sf. (IPR036869); DnaJ (PF00226)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DNAJB6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DNAJB6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DNAJB6** (gene ID: DNAJB6, UniProt: O75190) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: DNAJB6 (UniProt O75190) in Human

Plan status
- Verified identity and domain/isoform architecture; gathered recent peer-reviewed evidence (priority 2023 sources), complemented by emerging mechanistic preprints (2025) where informative. Drafted a concise synthesis with explicit citations, URLs, and publication months.

1) Gene/protein verification and key definitions
- Identity and nomenclature: DNAJB6 encodes the human J-domain protein (JDP) DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 6, also known as HSJ-2/MRJ/MSJ-1. It is a class B Hsp40 family co-chaperone that partners with Hsp70s to regulate ATPase activity and client handling (Trends in Cell Biology review, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Domain architecture: Canonical N-terminal J-domain (with the invariant HPD motif) followed by a glycine/phenylalanine-rich (G/F) region and a C-terminal client-binding domain; DNAJB-family members often harbor low-complexity, intrinsically disordered segments that regulate autoinhibition and client engagement (Trends in Cell Biology 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Isoforms: Two splice isoforms are commonly distinguished: DNAJB6a (long) and DNAJB6b (short). Literature describes DNAJB6a as predominantly nuclear and DNAJB6b as largely cytosolic with some nuclear presence; both engage proteostasis circuitry as potent anti-aggregation co-chaperones (bioRxiv preprint, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3). Note: 2025 preprint status.

2) Primary molecular function and mechanisms
- Co-chaperone role: DNAJB6 is a JDP that specifies and directs Hsp70 chaperone activity by stimulating Hsp70 ATPase activity via the J-domain, delivering clients, and regulating nucleotide cycling in proteostasis networks (Trends in Cell Biology 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Autoinhibition and regulation: An autoinhibitory element within the G/F region (a helix V) interfaces with the J-domain to limit Hsp70 docking; release of autoinhibition permits productive Hsp70 engagement. Such autoinhibition appears conserved across class B JDPs (Trends in Cell Biology 2023; Jan 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Anti-amyloid/anti-aggregation activity: DNAJB6 is exceptionally potent at suppressing amyloid formation of clients with large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and at preventing the aggregation of disease-associated proteins. In neuronal cells, the DNAJB6b isoform is required and sufficient to reduce tau aggregation; its J-domain is necessary, consistent with Hsp70-dependent anti-aggregation (BMC Biology, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01798-6) (chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2). Broader mechanistic context supports DNAJB-family members binding aberrant assemblies and delivering them to Hsp70-centered disaggregase or clearance pathways (Trends in Cell Biology 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Biocondensate/phase-separation surveillance: DNAJB6 surveils phase transitions of FG-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups) and prevents aberrant condensate states via a highly conserved IDR that forms stable, gel-like assemblies favoring heterotypic chaperone–FG-Nup interactions. This suggests a direct role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly quality control (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3, bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 15-18). Note: 2025 preprint status.
- Hsp70 network dependence: Functional assays in cellular/yeast models indicate class B JDPs including DNAJB6a/b suppress toxicity of aggregation-prone clients (e.g., TDP-43) in an Hsp70-dependent manner; mutation of the J-domain HPD motif abrogates protective activity, consistent with the requirement for Hsp70 ATPase stimulation (bioRxiv, May 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.10.653282) (barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 13-16).

3) Cellular localization and isoform-specific context
- Localization: DNAJB6a is described as predominantly nuclear, while DNAJB6b is primarily cytosolic but can be detected in the nucleus; these distributions align with isoform-specific sequence differences that influence targeting and function (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3). Note: 2025 preprint status.

4) Pathways, partners, and biochemical modules
- Core partners: DNAJB6 functions in the Hsp70-centered proteostasis network, collaborating with Hsp70 (HSPA family) and recruiting nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) such as HSP110, as well as acting in wider chaperone circuits that include disaggregases (e.g., Hsp100 in organisms where present) (Trends in Cell Biology 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Disassembly/clearance modules: A chaperone–proteasome fragmentation machinery involving the DNAJB6–HSP70–HSP110 module and the 19S proteasome regulatory particle is reported as essential for fragmenting protein aggregates prior to aggrephagy, assigning a role to DNAJB6 in preparing aggregates for autophagic clearance (Nature Cell Biology, Aug 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01747-1) (barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 46-49). Note: 2025 report.
- Condensate regulation: JDPs, including DNAJB6, are implicated in the regulation of phase-separated biocondensates during stress, acting as holdases and recruiting ATP-dependent machineries for disassembly and refolding/degradation (review context; 2026 perspective) (blatch2026thecentralrole pages 1-3, blatch2026thecentralrole pages 4-5).

5) Disease associations and mechanistic links (focus on precise roles)
- Neurodegeneration: In neuronal cells, DNAJB6b knockdown increases insoluble tau and overexpression reduces tau aggregation; DNAJB6b directly associates with tau and requires its J-domain to prevent aggregation, positioning DNAJB6 as a client sensor and Hsp70-delivery co-chaperone in tau proteostasis (BMC Biology, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01798-6) (chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2). Broader network analyses further support DNAJB6 contributions to buffering aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins (e.g., TDP-43), in ways dependent on Hsp70 cooperation (bioRxiv, May 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.10.653282) (barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 13-16).
- Protein conformational disease circuits: Expert synthesis indicates JDP circuits (including DNAJB6) are central to proteostasis and disease, with conserved mechanisms of autoinhibition, client engagement, and Hsp70 docking that shape disaggregation and anti-aggregation capacities (Trends in Cell Biology 2023; Jan 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).

6) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023)
- 2023 mechanistic review: JDP autoinhibition (including DNAJB6 G/F-region helix V), scaffolding, and inter-JDP cooperation were consolidated, highlighting how JDP features tune Hsp70 engagement and client outcomes (Trends in Cell Biology, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- 2023 neuronal study: DNAJB6b is a direct tau client sensor in human neuronal cells; its expression declines with age in a mouse tauopathy model in parallel with increased tau aggregation, underscoring physiological relevance (BMC Biology, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01798-6) (chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2).
- 2025 emergent directions (context): Preprint data propose DNAJB6 IDR-encoded assemblies surveil FG-Nup condensates during NPC assembly (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3, bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 15-18), and a Nature Cell Biology study implicates the DNAJB6–HSP70–HSP110 module with 19S proteasome in aggrephagy-priming fragmentation (Aug 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01747-1) (barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 46-49). Note: 2025 timing beyond the 2023–2024 window but mechanistically notable.

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic angle in neurodegeneration: The identification of DNAJB6b as a tau-directed JDP in neurons supports strategies to boost JDP–Hsp70 pathways for tauopathies (BMC Biology 2023; Dec 2023) (chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2). Broader chaperone circuit views suggest that enhancing JDP–Hsp70 function (e.g., de-repressing autoinhibition, stabilizing productive JDP–Hsp70–client complexes) could be a tractable route for proteinopathies (Trends in Cell Biology 2023) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9). Additional network-level findings in models propose that fortifying Hsp70/JDP activity guards against TDP-43 toxicity, pointing to potential translational directions, although these remain preclinical (bioRxiv 2025; May 2025) (barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 13-16).

8) Quantitative data and statistics from recent studies
- Tau aggregation modulation in neuronal cells: In SH-SY5Y screens, DNAJB6 knockdown increased tau aggregation and overexpression of DNAJB6b reduced aggregation, supported by filter retardation and tau BiFC assays; immunohistochemistry in a mouse tauopathy model showed age-dependent decrease of DNAJB6 with concomitant increase in tau aggregation in hippocampus (BMC Biology, Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01798-6). The study reports dependence on an intact J-domain for the anti-aggregation effect (chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2).
- Mechanism-level statistics/analyses: IDR mapping and conservation analyses (including MobiDB, AlphaFold pLDDT thresholds for IDR detection, and NARDINI z-scores) quantified DNAJB6 disordered regions and compositional features linked to its condensate surveillance function (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 15-18, bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3). Note: 2025 preprint status.

9) Expert opinions and synthesis
- Authoritative 2023 review perspective: JDP circuits orchestrate client selection and Hsp70 activation with layers of autoinhibition and scaffolding. DNAJB6’s G/F-region autoinhibition and conserved regulatory features illustrate how JDPs fine-tune anti-aggregation and disaggregation in health and disease (Trends in Cell Biology, Jan 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004) (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9).
- Emerging view on condensate surveillance and clearance: DNAJB6’s conserved IDR and its cooperation with Hsp70/NEFs likely support surveillance of IDP-rich condensates and interface with proteasome-primed aggrephagy, integrating phase behavior control with degradative pathways (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.20.683411; Nature Cell Biology, Aug 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01747-1) (bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3, barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 46-49).

10) Limitations and open questions
- High-resolution structural determinants of isoform-specific localization and client selection remain partially defined in human cells. The precise interfaces through which DNAJB6 coordinates with NEFs (e.g., HSP110) and E3s (e.g., CHIP) on specific clients in vivo require further elucidation. Some cited advances (condensate surveillance; aggrephagy-priming roles) are 2025 publications/preprints and warrant confirmation in peer-reviewed 2024 or earlier studies.

Summary
DNAJB6 is a human class B Hsp40/JDP co-chaperone that deploys an autoinhibited, J-domain–controlled mechanism to engage Hsp70 and prevent pathological protein aggregation. It potently suppresses aggregation of IDR-rich clients and acts as a direct sensor for tau in neuronal cells, where its expression inversely tracks with tau aggregation. Emerging work places DNAJB6 in condensate surveillance at NPCs via conserved IDR-driven assemblies and in an Hsp70–HSP110–proteasome module that fragments aggregates to enable aggrephagy. Together, these functions position DNAJB6 as a central node in proteostasis with direct disease relevance and growing translational interest (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9, chang2023thehsp40family pages 1-2, bergsma2025conservedintrinsicallydisordered pages 1-3, barbieri2025scouringthehuman pages 46-49).
