# TRAF6: Comprehensive Gene Report

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
**Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)** is an adapter protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates signal transduction from various receptors in the immune and developmental systems ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=The%20protein%20encoded%20by%20this,with%20various%20protein%20kinases%20including)). At the molecular level, TRAF6 functions as a **ubiquitin-protein transferase (E3 ubiquitin ligase)** **(GO:0004842)**, assembling Lysine-63–linked polyubiquitin chains on target proteins (including itself) in cooperation with the E2 enzyme complex Ubc13–Uev1A ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=oligomerization%20and%20sequence,1%2C%20lipopolysaccharide%2C%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2203345/#:~:text=A%20key%20step%20in%20the,TRAF6%2C%20and%20the%20interaction%20between)). Unlike K48-linked ubiquitin, these **K63-linked chains** (GO:0070534) do not mark proteins for degradation but instead serve as scaffolds to recruit and activate downstream kinases in signaling pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=N,4%20are%20dispensable%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=have%20first%20indicated%20that%20the,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). Through this mechanism, TRAF6 is a pivotal **signal transducer** that links receptor-proximal events to activation of key transcription factors. For example, upon receptor stimulation, TRAF6 autoubiquitination and K63-ubiquitin conjugation create docking sites for the TAK1 kinase complex, leading to activation of **IκB kinase (IKK)** and MAP kinases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=N,4%20are%20dispensable%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=have%20first%20indicated%20that%20the,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). This results in induction of NF-κB and AP-1–dependent gene expression programs critical for immune and inflammatory responses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=events%20initiated%20by%20cytokines%20of,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)).  

As an adaptor, TRAF6 directly interacts with a variety of upstream receptors and signaling proteins. It was originally identified as a TRAF protein that, unlike TRAF2/5, can mediate signals not only from the **TNF receptor superfamily** but also from the **Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) family** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=events%20initiated%20by%20cytokines%20of,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)). TRAF6 binds to cytoplasmic motifs (typically **PxQxT** sequences) on receptors or adaptors such as CD40, RANK (TNFRSF11A), IL-1R, and Toll-like receptors, bridging these to downstream enzymes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=receptor%20superfamily%20as%20well%20as,This%20protein)). In **Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1R signaling** (e.g. TLR4 or IL-1β receptor pathways), TRAF6 is recruited via the MyD88–IRAK kinase complex, and its ubiquitin ligase activity is required to activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=receptor%20superfamily%20as%20well%20as,This%20protein)). Similarly, in the **TNF receptor superfamily** pathways, TRAF6 associates with receptors like **CD40** and **RANK** to propagate signals leading to NF-κB activation and cell survival ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=receptor%20superfamily%20as%20well%20as,This%20protein)). Notably, TRAF6 also links to the **RIG-I/MAVS antiviral pathway** and other cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor pathways, functioning as a key molecule in antiviral innate signaling ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=also%20interacts%20with%20the%20transforming,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Nov%202021)). In these contexts, TRAF6 helps activate not only NF-κB but also interferon-regulatory factors; for instance, it can activate IRF7 in response to cytosolic viral DNA/RNA detection ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682567/#:~:text=TRAF6%20Establishes%20Innate%20Immune%20Responses,Cytosolic%20Viral%20RNA%20and%20DNA)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682567/#:~:text=Abstract)). Thus, TRAF6 is a central mediator of **innate immune response** (GO:0045087), enabling pathogen-sensing receptors to induce inflammatory cytokines and interferons. 

Beyond NF-κB, TRAF6 signaling branches into other pathways. It is involved in the **AP-1 (c-Jun/Fos)** pathway via activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=recognized%20by%20the%20Toll,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)). TRAF6 also interfaces with the **transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor** complex to mediate **Smad-independent** signaling: upon TGF-β binding, TRAF6 is recruited and required for activating the JNK/p38 cascade (through TAK1) independent of the Smad pathway ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=ubiquitin%20conjugating%20enzymes%20catalyzing%20the,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Nov%202021)). This illustrates that TRAF6 serves as a point of crosstalk between TNF/TLR pathways and other signaling networks. In summary, TRAF6’s molecular functions include **ubiquitin ligase activity** (GO:0061630) and **adapter activity** that together facilitate the assembly of higher-order signaling complexes, leading to activation of transcriptional programs in immunity, inflammation, and development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=events%20initiated%20by%20cytokines%20of,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=protein,The)). Key enzymatic and binding functions of TRAF6 are reflected in its Gene Ontology annotations, such as **tumor necrosis factor receptor binding** (GO:0005164), **CD40 receptor binding** (GO:0005174), and **protein K63-linked ubiquitination** (GO:0070534) among others, consistent with its role as an E3 ligase and adaptor in multiple signaling pathways ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,ion%20binding%20GO%3A0016874%20ligase%20activity)) ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=DNA%20binding%20transcription%20factor%20activity,GO%3A0090073%20positive%20regulation%20of%20protein)).

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
TRAF6 is primarily a **cytosolic** protein (GO:0005737) found in the cytoplasm under basal conditions ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Cellular%20Component%20%20,protein%20complex%20GO%3A0045121%20membrane%20raft)). It often localizes to the **cytoplasmic side of membranes** upon receptor engagement, as it interacts with membrane-bound receptor complexes. For example, during CD40 or TLR signaling, TRAF6 is recruited to receptor cytosolic tails at the plasma membrane or endosomal membrane, placing it at the **plasma membrane’s cytoplasmic face** (GO:0009898) as part of the activated receptor complex ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Cellular%20Component%20%20,protein%20complex%20GO%3A0045121%20membrane%20raft)). It has been detected in **raft-like membrane microdomains** (GO:0045121) in TLR signaling, suggesting that receptor clustering in lipid rafts may concentrate TRAF6 and other signaling molecules ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Cellular%20Component%20%20,protein%20complex%20GO%3A0045121%20membrane%20raft)). Additionally, TRAF6 is a component of several **protein complexes** (GO:0043234) in the cytoplasm, such as the Myddosome (MyD88–IRAK4–IRAK1 complex) in TLR/IL-1R pathways and the signalsome formed at activated CD40 or RANK receptors. These multimeric complexes enable oligomerized TRAF6 to catalyze ubiquitin chain formation and recruit kinases in the cytosol ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=protein,The)). 

While predominantly cytosolic, TRAF6 can also localize to the **nucleus** under certain conditions. In general, unstimulated cells show little nuclear TRAF6, but upon specific signaling events TRAF6 has been observed to translocate into the nucleus. A striking example is in osteoclast differentiation: **RANKL** (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) stimulation not only activates cytosolic TRAF6 signaling for NF-κB, but also increases TRAF6 accumulation in the nuclei of osteoclasts ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18768464/#:~:text=transcriptional%20regulator%20in%20the%20nucleus,RUNX1%20response%20element%20in%20the)). In osteoclast nuclei, TRAF6 was found to act as a co-regulator of transcription, in complex with nuclear adaptor protein FHL2 and transcription factor **RUNX1** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18768464/#:~:text=transcriptional%20regulator%20in%20the%20nucleus,RUNX1%20response%20element%20in%20the)). The formation of a TRAF6–FHL2–RUNX1 complex in the nucleus enables binding to specific gene promoter elements and modulation of gene expression important for osteoclast function ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18768464/#:~:text=that%20osteoclast%20intranuclear%20abundance%20is,These%20observations)). This suggests TRAF6 has a dual localization: it shuttles to the nucleus in certain cell types or conditions to directly influence transcription, while it mainly resides in the cytoplasm to mediate signal transduction. Nuclear localization of TRAF6 appears to be signal-dependent and possibly cell-type–specific (e.g., prominent in differentiated osteoclasts but not in their monocyte precursors) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18768464/#:~:text=transcriptional%20regulator%20in%20the%20nucleus,RUNX1%20response%20element%20in%20the)). Thus, TRAF6 is associated with multiple subcellular components: **cytosol** (GO:0005829) and **cytoplasmic complexes** at rest, with inducible presence in the **nucleoplasm** and in membrane-proximal complexes upon activation.

## Biological Processes Involvement  
TRAF6 plays an essential role in numerous biological processes, particularly those related to immune system function and development. A major process controlled by TRAF6 is the **innate immune response** (GO:0045087). As an adaptor in TLR and IL-1R signaling pathways, TRAF6 is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, TNF-α) in response to pathogenic stimuli ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=events%20initiated%20by%20cytokines%20of,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). Mice lacking TRAF6 cannot mount effective innate immune signaling: for instance, **TRAF6-deficient cells fail to activate NF-κB and MAP kinases** in response to lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 ligand) or IL-1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=events%20initiated%20by%20cytokines%20of,result%2C%20these%20ligands%20induce%20numerous)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1895566/#:~:text=,Genes)). Consequently, **TRAF6^–/–** mice have profoundly impaired **Toll-like receptor signaling** and **IL-1 signaling**, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. TRAF6 also mediates signaling downstream of the **adaptive immune receptors**: it is involved in **T-cell activation** and **B-cell activation** processes. Via CD40 in B cells, TRAF6 helps induce immunoglobulin production, and in T cells it contributes to cytokine gene activation (e.g. positive regulation of IL-2 production **(GO:0032743)**) ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,activity%20GO%3A0030163%20protein%20catabolic%20process)). Indeed, gene ontology annotations implicate TRAF6 in **positive regulation of T cell cytokine production** (GO:0002726) and regulation of immunoglobulin secretion ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,activity%20GO%3A0030163%20protein%20catabolic%20process)), reflecting its role in co-stimulatory signaling (CD40, TCR, etc.).  

Another critical biological process involving TRAF6 is **osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption**. TRAF6 is the key signaling adaptor for **RANK** (TNFRSF11A) in osteoclast precursors; upon RANKL binding, TRAF6 triggers NF-κB and JNK pathways that drive the gene expression program for osteoclastogenesis. In line with this, TRAF6-deficient mice exhibit severe **osteopetrosis** (excess bone density) due to a complete failure of osteoclast development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1895566/#:~:text=,Genes)). Thus, **bone remodeling** is profoundly dependent on TRAF6-mediated signaling. Likewise, TRAF6 is required for **lymph node organogenesis** during embryonic development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). Lymph nodes fail to form in TRAF6 knockout mice, indicating TRAF6 transduces signals (likely from lymphotoxin or other TNF-family instructions) necessary for secondary lymphoid organ development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). Additionally, TRAF6 has an indispensable role in **ectodermal organ development**: it is involved in the formation of skin appendages such as hair follicles, teeth, and sweat glands. TRAF6^–/– mice display features of **hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED)**, including missing or malformed hair and sweat glands ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). This developmental phenotype arises from failure of **EDAR (Ectodysplasin A receptor)** signaling, a TNF-family receptor required for skin appendage formation, which uses TRAF6 in its downstream NF-κB activation cascade. Indeed, the broad biological roles of TRAF6 – from **immune response** to **bone metabolism** to **skin and neural development** – were illuminated by phenotypes of TRAF6 knockout models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). These varied functions underscore TRAF6’s participation in processes such as **inflammatory signaling**, **apoptosis regulation** (it contributes to survival signals downstream of CD40, RANK, etc.), **developmental morphogenesis**, and more. 

TRAF6 is also involved in pathways like **tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling** (GO:0033209) and **regulation of programmed cell death**. For example, through its interaction with pro-apoptotic adapters (like TRADD) and E3 ubiquitin ligases (cIAPs), TRAF6 can influence apoptotic signaling from TNFR family members, though this is more prominently a function of TRAF2 – nonetheless, TRAF6’s ubiquitination activity has been linked to downstream survival pathways ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=protein,The)). Furthermore, emerging research implicates TRAF6 in **autophagy** and cell metabolism. TRAF6 has been shown to interact with autophagy regulators (such as Beclin-1 and AMBRA1) and can promote autophagic degradation of certain substrates. For instance, in colorectal cancer cells TRAF6 activity leads to autophagic degradation of β-catenin, thereby suppressing metastasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6693460/#:~:text=TRAF6%20interacts%20with%20LC3B%20Recent,Figure)). In muscle, TRAF6 contributes to **muscle atrophy processes** via ubiquitination of muscle proteins during starvation-induced catabolism ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302447/#:~:text=The%20E3%20Ubiquitin%20Ligase%20TRAF6,The%20E3%20Ubiquitin)). In summary, TRAF6 is a multifaceted regulator of biological processes: it is best known for **activating NF-κB (GO:0051092)** and MAPK pathways in immunity, but it also intersects with pathways controlling development (bone and ectoderm), cell survival, differentiation, and homeostasis. This widespread involvement is reflected in numerous GO biological process terms associated with TRAF6, including **signal transduction** (GO:0007165), **positive regulation of NF-κB transcription factor activity** (GO:0051092), **toll-like receptor signaling pathway** (GO:0002224), **osteoclast differentiation** (GO:0030316; inferred from phenotype), and **innate immune response** (GO:0045087) ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=GO%3A0045087%20innate%20immune%20response%20,protein%20heterooligomerization%20GO%3A0051865%20protein%20autoubiquitination)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)).

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Given its central role in immune and developmental pathways, dysregulation or mutation of TRAF6 can lead to various diseases and phenotypic abnormalities. **Loss-of-function of TRAF6** has been most clearly studied in mice, where **TRAF6-null mutants are perinatal lethal** with a complex phenotype. Key features in **TRAF6^–/–** mice include **osteopetrosis** (due to absent osteoclasts) and severe immunodeficiency; these mice fail to transmit signals from IL-1, TLRs, and CD40, resulting in impaired innate and adaptive immune responses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1895566/#:~:text=,Genes)). They also lack certain lymph nodes and exhibit **hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED)**-like traits (sparse hair, defective sweat glands and teeth) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). This constellation of phenotypes (immunodeficiency, osteopetrosis, and ectodermal dysplasia) is reminiscent of human syndromes caused by impaired NF-κB signaling (such as NEMO/IKKγ deficiency). In fact, **human TRAF6 mutations** have been reported to cause a similar condition. A de novo heterozygous missense mutation in **TRAF6** was identified in a patient with Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia, who presented with the characteristic features of **hypotrichosis** (sparse hair), **anhidrosis** (inability to sweat), and **hypodontia** (missing teeth) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22924441/#:~:text=Background%3A%20Hypohidrotic%20ectodermal%20dysplasia%20,from%20the%20mutation%20remained%20unknown)). Functional studies of this mutant TRAF6 protein showed that it lost the ability to bind the adaptor **EDARADD** (an adaptor for the Ectodysplasin receptor), thereby blocking NF-κB signaling in the **EDAR pathway** and explaining the HED phenotype ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22924441/#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20mutant%20TRAF6%20protein,the%20mutant%20TRAF6%20inhibited%20the)). This human case confirms the crucial role of TRAF6 in ectodermal appendage development, aligning with the mouse knockout phenotype. Interestingly, the patient’s mutation was heterozygous, suggesting a dominant-negative effect or haploinsufficiency (since complete absence of TRAF6 is likely embryonically lethal in humans, as it is in mice). Some level of immune dysfunction might accompany such a mutation, though the primary presentation was ectodermal dysplasia; further evaluation of immune function in these patients is warranted given TRAF6’s known role in host defense.

Beyond developmental disorders, TRAF6 has been implicated in **autoimmune and inflammatory diseases**. Genetic association studies have identified polymorphisms in the TRAF6 gene linked to susceptibility to conditions like **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**, **systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**, and others. For example, a single-nucleotide polymorphism **rs540386** in an intronic region of TRAF6 was reported as a risk factor for RA and SLE in certain populations ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589256/#:~:text=Objective%3A%20We%20evaluated%20whether%20a,GCA)). Although not a coding change, this variant may affect TRAF6 expression or splicing, thereby altering immune signaling thresholds. (Subsequent studies on this SNP’s role in diseases like systemic sclerosis and giant cell arteritis yielded negative results ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589256/#:~:text=Objective%3A%20We%20evaluated%20whether%20a,GCA)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589256/#:~:text=Results%3A%20No%20significant%20associations%20of,were%20assessed)), indicating that the influence of TRAF6 variants can be disease-specific or ethnicity-specific.) Nevertheless, the association with RA/SLE suggests that **TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation in immune cells** is a contributing factor in autoimmunity. Overactivation of TRAF6 can lead to excessive inflammation, so polymorphisms enhancing TRAF6 expression or function might predispose to autoimmune pathology. In support of this, mice with TRAF6 overexpression in certain cells show hyperactive NF-κB and inflammatory phenotypes, whereas TRAF6 haploinsufficiency can ameliorate autoimmune disease models (as seen in some arthritis models where reducing TRAF6 dampens joint inflammation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589256/#:~:text=Cite%20Display%20options%20,lupus%20erythematosus%20and%20rheumatoid%20arthritis))). 

TRAF6 has also been linked to **cancer and other pathologies**. Its constant activation of NF-κB can contribute to oncogenesis by promoting survival, proliferation, and metastasis of cancer cells. Elevated TRAF6 expression or activity has been observed in multiple cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, breast and prostate cancers, and others ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11073974/#:~:text=progression%20,expression%20and%20compared%20the%20gene)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6693460/#:~:text=autophagic%20CTNNB1%2F%CE%B2,Figure)). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), higher TRAF6 levels correlate with gene expression changes that favor tumor cell survival and metabolic adaptation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11073974/#:~:text=progression%20,expression%20and%20compared%20the%20gene)). Functional studies in cell lines have shown that knocking down TRAF6 can reduce NF-κB signaling and slow tumor growth, suggesting TRAF6 might act as an oncogenic driver in certain contexts. Conversely, TRAF6 also has context-dependent tumor suppressor functions, as indicated by the finding that **TRAF6 can limit colorectal cancer metastasis by promoting autophagic degradation of β-catenin**, an oncogenic protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6693460/#:~:text=autophagic%20CTNNB1%2F%CE%B2,Figure)). Thus, TRAF6’s role in cancer appears complex: it may contribute to tumor-promoting inflammation in some cases while helping restrain oncogenic substrates in others. Finally, aberrations in TRAF6 signaling are implicated in other diseases such as **sepsis-induced tissue injury** (one study found a TRAF6 variant associated with acute lung injury in sepsis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3478205/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20J,Jun%20Yin)), and **neurodegenerative diseases** (via neuroinflammatory pathways, although this is an emerging area). In summary, TRAF6 is associated with a wide spectrum of diseases: **primary immunodeficiencies/developmental disorders** when its function is lost (e.g. HED with immunodeficiency), **autoimmune diseases** when its signaling is hyperactive or dysregulated, and **cancers** where it can modulate tumor survival and metastasis. These associations highlight TRAF6 as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory and osteolytic diseases – for instance, inhibitors of the TRAF6–Ubc13 interaction are being explored to dampen overactive NF-κB in autoimmunity and cancer.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The human TRAF6 protein consists of 522 amino acids and contains several well-defined domains that underlie its function ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=The%20protein%20encoded%20by%20this,with%20various%20protein%20kinases%20including)). The **N-terminus** of TRAF6 (approximately residues 50–80) harbors a **RING finger domain** (C3HC4-type), a cysteine/histidine-rich motif that coordinates zinc and is characteristic of many E3 ubiquitin ligases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=The%20protein%20encoded%20by%20this,with%20various%20protein%20kinases%20including)). This RING domain (**Really Interesting New Gene** domain) is crucial for TRAF6’s ubiquitin ligase activity: it provides the binding interface for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In particular, the TRAF6 RING domain binds the Ubc13–Uev1A heterodimer, positioning Ubc13 to catalyze Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2203345/#:~:text=A%20key%20step%20in%20the,TRAF6%2C%20and%20the%20interaction%20between)). Mutations in the RING (such as a Cys → Ala at a zinc-coordinating residue) abolish TRAF6’s ability to autoubiquitinate and activate downstream signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=specific%20modification%20on%20TRAF6%20triggers%2C,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). **Zinc coordination** is essential to RING structure, and indeed TRAF6’s RING (and other domains) confer **zinc ion binding** (GO:0008270). Immediately following the RING, TRAF6 contains a series of **four Zinc finger motifs** in tandem ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=Lys,of%20TRAF6%20is%20essential%20for)). These zinc fingers (C2H2 or similar motifs) span the mid portion of the protein (roughly residues ~80–140 for ZF1, and additional fingers up to ~250). The exact function of all four zinc fingers is not fully defined, but they serve as a bridge between the RING and the coiled-coil region ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=Lys,of%20TRAF6%20is%20essential%20for)). Notably, experimental mutagenesis has shown that the **first zinc finger (ZF1)** is especially important; ZF1, together with the RING, is required for TRAF6’s E3 ligase activity and signaling, whereas zinc fingers 2–4 are dispensable for some signaling outputs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=kinase%20pathways.%20Connecting%20the%20N,and%20an%20intact%20RING%20domain)). These internal ZFs likely contribute to the structural integrity of TRAF6 or positioning of the RING for optimal E2 interaction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=kinase%20pathways.%20Connecting%20the%20N,and%20an%20intact%20RING%20domain)). 

Following the zinc fingers, TRAF6 has a predicted **coiled-coil region** (also called the “TRAF-N” region in some literature) that mediates oligomerization ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=signal%20transduction%20from%2C%20members%20of,kappaB%20pathway)). This coiled-coil (around residues ~289–350) enables TRAF6 molecules to self-associate. In solution, TRAF6 can form **homodimers and homotrimers**, and evidence suggests that the N-terminal region dimerizes, while the C-terminal region trimerizes ([rloopbase.nju.edu.cn](https://rloopbase.nju.edu.cn/browser/cgi-bin/hgGene?db=hg38&hgg_chrom=chr11&hgg_end=36510272&hgg_gene=ENST00000526995.6&hgg_start=36483768&hgg_type=knownGene#:~:text=PATHWAY%3A%20Protein%20modification%3B%20protein%20ubiquitination,IRAK4%2C%20RIPK2%2C%20MAP3K1%2C%20MAP3K5%2C%20MAP3K14)). Oligomerization is functionally important because TRAF proteins typically act as trimers when bound to receptor tails. The coiled-coil region contributes to this trimeric assembly by bringing multiple TRAF6 molecules together, which can enhance the avidity for multivalent receptor sites and promote ubiquitin chain synthesis (since two RING domains in proximity can work in tandem with the Ubc13 dimer). Indeed, **protein homotrimerization** is noted as a property of TRAF6 (GO:0070207, GO:0051865) and is required for efficient signaling complex formation ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=transcription%20factor%20activity%20GO%3A0051291%20protein,GO%3A0097300%20programmed%20necrotic%20cell%20death)). 

The **C-terminus** of TRAF6 (approximately residues 350–522) is occupied by the **TRAF domain**, a conserved region also found in other TRAF family members. The TRAF domain is subdivided into two subdomains: a coiled-coil segment (TRAF-N, as mentioned) and a **globular TRAF-C domain** at the very end. The **TRAF-C domain** (~residues 400–522 in TRAF6) is a highly conserved **β-sandwich** fold that directly mediates protein–protein interactions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=signal%20transduction%20from%2C%20members%20of,kappaB%20pathway)). This domain is responsible for recognizing and binding specific peptide motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of receptors or adaptor proteins. For example, TRAF6’s TRAF-C domain binds the peptide motif PxQx(T/S) (found in CD40, RANK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), etc.), although the binding specificity of TRAF6 is somewhat broader than that of TRAF2/3 which prefer PxQxD motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6%2C%20a%20member%20of%20the,IKK%29%20and%20the%20mitogen)). Through the TRAF-C domain, TRAF6 engages adapters like **IRAK1/IRAK4** (in TLR/IL-1R signaling), **TRADD** (in TNFR signaling), and **EDARADD** (in EDA receptor signaling), as well as the cytosolic domains of **CD40, TNFRSF19 (TROY), and p75^NTR** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=receptor%20superfamily%20as%20well%20as,This%20protein)). The TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 typically forms a trimeric structure (as observed in crystal structures of other TRAFs), providing three equivalent binding surfaces per trimer for recruiting three receptor tail peptides – this multivalent binding is key for cluster formation at receptors. In summary, the domain architecture of TRAF6 is: **RING finger (E3 ligase activity)** – **Zinc fingers 1–4 (structural/regulatory)** – **Coiled-coil (oligomerization)** – **TRAF-C domain (protein binding)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=The%20protein%20encoded%20by%20this,a%20link%20between%20distinct%20signaling)). This structure enables TRAF6 to act as a hub: the N-terminal half performs ubiquitination, while the C-terminal half brings TRAF6 to the correct location by binding upstream partners. Each domain is crucial: the loss of the TRAF-C domain abolishes receptor interactions, whereas loss of the RING finger abrogates downstream signal propagation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6%2C%20a%20crucial%20adaptor%20molecule,regions%2C%20the%20four%20internal%20zinc)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=specific%20modification%20on%20TRAF6%20triggers%2C,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). Consistent with these features, TRAF6 is annotated with multiple **molecular function GO terms**: e.g. **tumor necrosis factor receptor binding** (GO:0005164), **protein complex binding** (GO:0032403), **identical protein binding** (GO:0042802, reflecting oligomerization), **ubiquitin protein ligase activity** (GO:0061630), and **zinc ion binding** (GO:0008270) ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=Molecular%20Function%20%20,ion%20binding%20GO%3A0016874%20ligase%20activity)) ([www.innatedb.org](https://www.innatedb.org/getGeneCard.do?id=146254#:~:text=GO%3A0019903%20protein%20phosphatase%20binding%20GO%3A0031435,protein%20binding%20GO%3A0046625%20sphingolipid%20binding)).

Structurally, TRAF6 shares the typical fold of TRAF family proteins in its C-terminus, but its N-terminus (RING and ZFs) confers a unique function (ubiquitin ligation) not all TRAFs have (TRAF2 and 3 also have RINGs, but TRAF6’s role in ubiquitination is especially prominent). High-resolution structures of the TRAF6 RING domain have been solved by NMR, revealing a compact domain that interacts with Ubc13 on a specific surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2203345/#:~:text=A%20key%20step%20in%20the,TRAF6%2C%20and%20the%20interaction%20between)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2203345/#:~:text=catalytically%20competent%20E2%20enzyme%2C%20and,dynamics%20data%20indicates%20that%20residues)). Crystal structures of related TRAF domains (e.g., TRAF2, TRAF5) show trimers; by homology, TRAF6 is expected to trimerize similarly via its TRAF-C domain. Indeed, a crystal structure of a TRAF6 TRAF-C peptide complex (by Ye et al., 2002) confirmed a trimeric TRAF6 bound to peptide from CD40 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=%5BPubMed%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar%5D%20,103%20Google)). These structural insights have informed mutational analyses; for instance, mutations in the TRAF-C domain that disrupt trimerization or binding (like WTrp**^** at certain conserved positions) impair TRAF6 function in assays ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18617513/#:~:text=The%20RING%20domain%20and%20first,Uev1A)). In summary, the protein domains of TRAF6 provide the **scaffolding and catalytic features** that allow it to assemble signaling complexes and modify proteins with ubiquitin, thereby executing its role in cell signaling.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
**Expression patterns:** The TRAF6 gene is **widely expressed** in human tissues, consistent with its involvement in fundamental cellular processes. According to RNA profiling data, TRAF6 mRNA is **ubiquitously expressed**, with notable levels in immune organs. For example, TRAF6 shows substantial expression in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and also in non-immune tissues like thyroid, lung, and others ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=7189#:~:text=Expression%20Ubiquitous%20expression%20in%20bone,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). NCBI’s expression atlas reports an RPKM of ~5.9 in bone marrow and moderate levels (~3.6 RPKM) in thyroid, with expression detected in at least 25 different tissues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=7189#:~:text=Expression%20Ubiquitous%20expression%20in%20bone,25%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). This broad expression pattern reflects the fact that many cell types (immune cells, osteoclasts, epithelial cells, etc.) utilize TRAF6 for signaling. Protein-level studies (e.g., by Western blot or immunohistochemistry) similarly show that TRAF6 is present in a variety of cell types. Immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes) express robust levels of TRAF6, which can further increase upon activation. Developmentally, TRAF6 is expressed from early stages; mouse embryos show TRAF6 transcripts in mesenchymal tissues and epithelial appendages, aligning with its role in skeletal and skin development ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=TRAF6,14)). There is some evidence that TRAF6 expression may be higher in certain activated or differentiated states (for instance, mature osteoclasts express more TRAF6 protein than undifferentiated precursors, to meet the demand for RANK signaling ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18768464/#:~:text=transcriptional%20regulator%20in%20the%20nucleus,RUNX1%20response%20element%20in%20the))). In pathology, aberrant TRAF6 expression has been noted: some tumors or leukemic cells overexpress TRAF6, and conversely, certain immunodeficient conditions might have reduced TRAF6. Overall, the baseline expression of TRAF6 is constitutive in most tissues, implying it is a ready component of signaling cascades across cell types.

**Regulation:** TRAF6 activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels to prevent excessive or improper signaling. One key level of regulation is **post-transcriptional**, via microRNAs. **miR-146a**, a microRNA induced by NF-κB during inflammatory responses, directly targets the mRNA of TRAF6 (and IRAK1) to negatively regulate the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway. This was demonstrated in human cells where increased miR-146a levels (for instance after LPS or viral infection) led to reduced TRAF6 protein and consequently dampened NF-κB activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6913124/#:~:text=cardiomyopathy.%20Toll,146a%20may%20be%20a%20negative)). miR-146a binds to the 3’ UTR of TRAF6 mRNA causing translational repression or mRNA degradation. This forms part of a feedback loop: TLR engagement causes NF-κB to induce miR-146a, which then limits TRAF6/IRAK1, preventing overactivation of the inflammatory response ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6913124/#:~:text=through%20NF,146a%20may%20be%20a%20negative)). Perturbation of this regulation (e.g., miR-146a deficiency in mice) results in hyper-inflammatory phenotypes due to unchecked TRAF6 signaling. In addition to miR-146a, other microRNAs (such as miR-146b, miR-150, miR-125b, etc.) have been reported to target TRAF6 in various contexts (viral infections, cancer cells, etc.), highlighting a common strategy of the cell to fine-tune TRAF6 levels.

Another level of regulation is **post-translational** modification of TRAF6 itself. TRAF6 activity requires its ubiquitination, but it’s also regulated by **deubiquitinases (DUBs)** and proteolysis. Several DUBs can remove ubiquitin chains from TRAF6, thereby turning off the signal. Notably, the enzyme **A20 (TNFAIP3)**, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme induced by NF-κB, can interact with TRAF6 and cleave K63 chains or add K48 chains to terminate signaling from TLRs. Similarly, the **Zinc finger CCCH-type protein 12A (ZC3H12A, also known as MCPIP1)** has been identified as a negative regulator of TRAF6. ZC3H12A was shown to function as a deubiquitinase for TRAF family proteins; in Zc3h12a knockout mice, TRAF6 remained aberrantly ubiquitinated and active after LPS stimulation, leading to prolonged NF-κB activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066222/#:~:text=inflammatory%20cytokines%2C%20and%20induces%20their,This%20translated%20into%20premature)). Thus, **ZC3H12A removes ubiquitin chains from TRAF6**, limiting the duration of TLR signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066222/#:~:text=inflammatory%20cytokines%2C%20and%20induces%20their,This%20translated%20into%20premature)). Another mechanism is via **proteasomal degradation**: while K63-linked chains on TRAF6 are signaling scaffolds, if TRAF6 becomes tagged with K48-linked ubiquitin (for example by the action of certain E3s like cIAP1 or via A20’s E3 activity), it can be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, there is evidence that in the absence of ongoing signaling, TRAF6 levels can be down-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathways to prevent spontaneous activation. Some viral proteins also induce TRAF6 degradation as an immune evasion tactic.

Regulation of TRAF6 can also occur at the transcriptional level. Certain stimuli can induce **TRAF6 gene transcription**; for example, NF-κB and AP-1 have binding sites in the TRAF6 promoter in some species, suggesting a possible positive feedback where strong immune stimuli upregulate TRAF6 mRNA. Conversely, **negative regulation** of transcription can occur in specific differentiation states; a noted example is in dendritic cells, where tolerogenic signals can decrease TRAF6 expression as part of inducing immune tolerance. Furthermore, cytokines like TGF-β have been reported to down-modulate TRAF6 expression in some contexts, aligning with TGF-β’s anti-inflammatory role. 

In summary, TRAF6 is expressed in almost all tissues (housekeeping level expression in most cells, higher in immune and skeletal systems) and is subject to elaborate regulation. **MicroRNAs (e.g. miR-146a)** and **deubiquitinating enzymes (e.g. A20, ZC3H12A)** provide crucial negative feedback to restrain TRAF6-mediated signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6913124/#:~:text=cardiomyopathy.%20Toll,146a%20may%20be%20a%20negative)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066222/#:~:text=inflammatory%20cytokines%2C%20and%20induces%20their,This%20translated%20into%20premature)). This ensures that signals like NF-κB are activated transiently and appropriately. Dysregulation of these controls – for instance, loss of miR-146a or A20 – leads to hyperactivation of TRAF6 and has been linked to autoimmune inflammation and lymphoma, illustrating the importance of proper TRAF6 regulation in health.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
TRAF6 is a member of the TRAF family, which is conserved throughout metazoan evolution. Orthologs of human TRAF6 can be found in a wide range of species, indicating that its function in immune signaling arose early and has been maintained. All **vertebrate** groups examined (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish) possess a TRAF6 gene that is highly similar in sequence and domain structure to human TRAF6 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7179693/#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Evolutionary%20Analysis%20of%20Lamprey,Characterization%20of%20TRAF3%2F6%20and%20RIPK1)). For instance, mouse **Traf6** is ~87% identical in amino acid sequence to human TRAF6, and the two proteins are functionally interchangeable in many experimental systems (human TRAF6 can rescue Traf6^–/– mouse cells) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=examined%20the%20role%20of%20the,stimulated)). Organisms as evolutionarily distant as **chicken (Gallus gallus)** and **zebrafish** have clear TRAF6 orthologs with the same domain architecture (RING, Zn fingers, TRAF domain) and known involvement in NF-κB signaling during immune responses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491236/#:~:text=the%20King%20pigeon%20,and%20identified%20the%20TRAF6%20gene)). 

Importantly, TRAF6 is also present in **invertebrates**, notably in insects. **Drosophila melanogaster** (fruit fly) encodes a TRAF6 ortholog (sometimes referred to as dTRAF6 or Traf6), which plays a critical role in the fly’s immune defense. Drosophila TRAF6 participates in the **Toll pathway** and the **Imd pathway**, the fly analogs of NF-κB activation routes, serving as a positive regulator of these innate immune signaling cascades ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0265464.html#:~:text=FlyBase%20Gene%20Report%3A%20Dmel,Eiger%20Signaling%20Pathway)). It has been shown to mediate signaling downstream of the Drosophila Toll receptor (which fights fungal infections) and the Imd pathway (activated by gram-negative bacteria), mirroring the role of mammalian TRAF6 in TLR/IL-1R pathways. Additionally, Drosophila TRAF6 has been implicated in **Notch signaling regulation** and the TNF-like Eiger pathway ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0265464.html#:~:text=FlyBase%20Gene%20Report%3A%20Dmel,Eiger%20Signaling%20Pathway)), suggesting that even in flies TRAF6 connects multiple developmental and immune signals. The presence of TRAF6 in insects indicates that TRAF6 predates the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates, and that the **innate immune NF-κB pathways** in both lineages use this conserved adaptor. Simpler organisms like **Caenorhabditis elegans** (nematode) do not have a clear TRAF6 ortholog (worms lack many components of the TNF/Toll pathways), highlighting that TRAF6 is tied to the evolution of those specific signaling systems present in arthropods and vertebrates.

From an evolutionary perspective, TRAF6 appears to be more **ancient** than some other TRAFs that are restricted to vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses (including studies in jawless fish like lamprey) suggest that TRAF6 and TRAF3 represent earlier-arising TRAF subfamilies, whereas TRAF2/5 might have arisen later by duplication ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7179693/#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Evolutionary%20Analysis%20of%20Lamprey,Characterization%20of%20TRAF3%2F6%20and%20RIPK1)). Lampreys (which are jawless vertebrates) possess genes that cluster with TRAF3/6, supporting the idea that a common ancestor of these existed in early vertebrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7179693/#:~:text=Comprehensive%20Evolutionary%20Analysis%20of%20Lamprey,Characterization%20of%20TRAF3%2F6%20and%20RIPK1)). In evolutionary terms, TRAF6 is unique among TRAFs because it combines the TRAF domain with a potent RING E3 ligase domain – this combination endowed early immune systems with a direct means to invoke ubiquitin signaling. The **functional conservation** is exemplified by cross-species experiments: human TRAF6 can restore TLR signaling in TRAF6-deficient mouse cells, and conversely, overexpression of Drosophila TRAF6 in human cells can activate NF-κB, indicating conserved mechanism of action. Even specific interactions are conserved; for example, the interaction between TRAF6 and the E2 enzyme Ubc13 is found in mammals, birds, and probably insects (in Drosophila, dTRAF6 works with Bendless, the fly Ubc13). The **TRAF-C domain binding specificity** (to PxQxT motifs) is also conserved – the fly TRAF6 binds the Toll receptor adaptor dMyD88 which has a matching motif. 

Overall, TRAF6’s presence in such diverse taxa underscores its importance: it is a **conserved signaling node** in the immune system of animals. The evolutionary conservation extends to the amino acid sequence (especially in the TRAF-C domain, which in human TRAF6 shares ~40-50% identity with insect TRAF6, and higher with other vertebrates), and to biological function (activation of NF-κB and regulation of development). This deep conservation suggests strong selective pressure to maintain TRAF6’s role; mutations disrupting TRAF6 generally have severe fitness costs (as seen by lethal phenotypes). In the context of Gene Ontology, the evolutionary conservation of TRAF6 is captured by its **InParanoid orthologs and Panther families**, aligning TRAF6 across taxa in databases, and by the conserved GO annotations (e.g., innate immune response) assigned to TRAF6 orthologs in model organisms ([flybase.org](https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0265464.html#:~:text=FlyBase%20Gene%20Report%3A%20Dmel,Eiger%20Signaling%20Pathway)).  

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
The understanding of TRAF6’s function and importance comes from a body of research spanning over two decades. Some **key experimental milestones** and literature include:

- **Identification of TRAF6 (mid-1990s):** TRAF6 was first described in 1995-1996 when several TRAF proteins were discovered. Unlike TRAF1-5, TRAF6 was noted to associate not only with TNF receptor family members but also with the IL-1/Toll pathway. Early biochemical studies (e.g., by Darnay et al. 1998, 1999) showed TRAF6 binding to CD40 and presence in signaling complexes upon IL-1 stimulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=,113%20Google)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=,3928)). These studies established TRAF6 as a unique adapter bridging **TNF and IL-1 receptor families**.

- **TRAF6 knockout mouse studies (1999):** Two independent groups (Lomaga et al., *Genes & Development*, 1999 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=,362%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPubMed)), and Naito et al., *Genes to Cells*, 1999 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=%5BPubMed%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar%5D%20,Google%20Scholar))) generated **TRAF6-deficient mice**. They reported that TRAF6^–/– mice had **osteopetrosis and severe combined immune defects**, including defective IL-1, TLR, and CD40 signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1895566/#:~:text=,Genes)). The Lomaga paper’s title, *“TRAF6 deficiency results in osteopetrosis and defective IL-1, CD40, and LPS signaling,”* succinctly highlights these findings ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1895566/#:~:text=,Genes)). These landmark studies provided genetic proof of TRAF6’s essential role in both **bone metabolism and immunity**. 

- **Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia link (2001-2002):** Subsequent work connected TRAF6 to ectodermal development. In 2001, Kobayashi et al. (*EMBO J.* 2001) observed that TRAF6^–/– mice lacked certain skin appendages, and in 2002 Naito et al. published *PNAS* findings that **“TRAF6-deficient mice display hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia”** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=%5BGoogle%20Scholar%5D%20,Google%20Scholar)). This extended TRAF6’s importance to developmental biology. Much later (2012), a human case (as cited above by Fulton et al.) solidified this connection by identifying a TRAF6 mutation in a HED patient.

- **Discovery of K63 ubiquitination mechanism (2000):** A breakthrough in understanding TRAF6 signaling was the discovery that TRAF6 activates NF-κB through a novel ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. **Deng et al., Cell 2000** and **Wang et al., Nature 2001** demonstrated that TRAF6, together with Ubc13–Uev1A, catalyzes **K63-linked polyubiquitin chains** on itself or associated proteins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=have%20first%20indicated%20that%20the,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). These non-degradative chains were shown to recruit and activate the **TAK1 kinase complex**, which then activates IKKβ, leading to NF-κB activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=have%20first%20indicated%20that%20the,1%20or%20RANKL%20%28receptor)). This was a paradigm-shifting discovery, revealing ubiquitination as a signaling event (not just a degradation signal). Those studies identified **TAK1 (MAP3K7)** and its partner TAB2 as key targets of TRAF6’s ubiquitin scaffold ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7189/ortholog/#:~:text=pathways,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Nov%202021)). The **Nature 2001 paper by Wang et al.** and **Cell 2000 paper by Deng et al.** are heavily cited as foundational mechanistic work in NF-κB signaling.

- **Structural studies (2002–2008):** Several structural biology studies provided insight into TRAF6. For example, **Ye et al., Nature 2002** solved the crystal structure of the TRAF6–TRAF-C domain in complex with a peptide from CD40, illuminating how TRAF6 recognizes its binding motifs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=,447%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPubMed%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar)). **Mercier et al., Protein Sci. 2007** determined the NMR structure of the TRAF6 RING domain and mapped its interaction with Ubc13 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2203345/#:~:text=A%20key%20step%20in%20the,TRAF6%2C%20and%20the%20interaction%20between)). These works clarified the **interfaces for E2 enzyme binding** and for receptor/adaptor binding, respectively. Furthermore, **Lamothe et al., JBC 2008** performed mutational analysis of TRAF6’s zinc fingers and RING ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=N,4%20are%20dispensable%20for)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=kinase%20pathways.%20Connecting%20the%20N,and%20an%20intact%20RING%20domain)), showing ZF1’s importance – this indicated specific intra-molecular cooperation between domains for activity.

- **TRAF6 in T cell tolerance and autoimmunity (2003–2008):** A series of immunology studies (e.g., by King, Choi, Kobayashi et al.) explored TRAF6 in adaptive immunity. Notably, **Kobayashi et al., Immunity 2003** showed TRAF6 in dendritic cells is needed for **Th priming** and that lack of TRAF6 can lead to defective T-cell activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=,1024%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPMC%20free%20article)). Conversely, **King et al., Nat. Med. 2006** found that TRAF6 in T cells regulates **peripheral tolerance** – T cell–specific TRAF6 deletion led to autoimmune inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2529010/#:~:text=%5BGoogle%20Scholar%5D%20,363%20%5BDOI%5D%20%5BPubMed%5D%20%5BGoogle%20Scholar)). These studies indicated TRAF6’s nuanced roles in immunity beyond just initial signaling: it’s involved in maintaining immune homeostasis.

- **Human disease associations (2010s):** More recent clinical and genetic studies have implicated TRAF6 in human diseases. For instance, **Bluml et al., Nat. Genet. 2010** identified TRAF6 polymorphisms associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and others linked it to lupus. The **human HED case (PMID 22917955, 2013)** gave direct evidence of a pathogenic TRAF6 mutation in humans. Additionally, research into **cancer** uncovered that TRAF6 is overexpressed in some tumors (e.g., **Starczynowski et al., Cancer Cell 2011** linked TRAF6 overactivity to myelodysplastic syndrome/AML). These findings are expanding TRAF6’s relevance to oncology and genetic disease.

- **TRAF6 and autophagy/metabolism (2010s):** Emerging experiments show TRAF6 in non-canonical roles. **Ni et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 2013** reported TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of Beclin-1 to activate autophagy in TLR signaling. **Sun et al., MCB 2012** showed TRAF6 in muscle atrophy pathways ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302447/#:~:text=The%20E3%20Ubiquitin%20Ligase%20TRAF6,The%20E3%20Ubiquitin)). Such studies highlight TRAF6’s involvement beyond classical inflammatory signaling, in processes like **metabolic reprogramming in cancer** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11073974/#:~:text=progression%20,expression%20and%20compared%20the%20gene)) and cell stress responses.

In sum, the literature on TRAF6 is extensive. Key evidence from knockout models, biochemical reconstitution, and structural analysis has firmly established TRAF6 as a **critical adaptor and ubiquitin ligase in NF-κB signaling**. These findings have been captured in Gene Ontology annotations (with evidence codes from mutant phenotype experiments (IMP) to direct assays (IDA) for binding and activity, etc.) supporting numerous GO terms for TRAF6. Curators rely on these seminal studies – for example, Lomaga 1999 for GO:0045087 (innate immune response, IMP evidence), Deng 2000 for GO:0004842 (ubiquitin ligase activity, IDA evidence), and Naito 2002 for GO:0009887 (organ development, IMP) – to annotate TRAF6’s functions, processes, and locations. As research continues, TRAF6 remains a focus due to its central role in **translating external signals into cellular responses**, and it stands as a prime example of how a scaffold protein with enzymatic activity can orchestrate complex biological outcomes.
