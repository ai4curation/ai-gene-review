description: TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) is a critical E3 ubiquitin ligase
  and signal transduction adaptor that synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
  for non-degradative signaling. It serves as a central hub in multiple immune signaling
  pathways including TLR/IL-1R, TNF receptor superfamily (CD40, RANK), and cytosolic
  pattern recognition receptors, mediating activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
  Beyond immunity, TRAF6 is essential for osteoclast differentiation, ectodermal development
  (hair, teeth, sweat glands), and has emerging roles in autophagy regulation. The
  protein contains an N-terminal RING domain for E3 ligase activity, zinc fingers,
  and a C-terminal TRAF domain for protein-protein interactions, enabling both enzymatic
  and scaffolding functions in signal transduction.

  review:
    summary: TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination,
      which is essential for its signal transduction role. This activity is well-established
      through multiple experimental studies showing TRAF6 works with the Ubc13-Uev1A
      E2 complex to synthesize K63-linked chains on target proteins including itself.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of TRAF6 that is extensively validated
      experimentally. The IEA annotation from sequence similarity is strongly supported
      by multiple experimental evidence entries (EXP, IDA) in the same dataset and
      extensive literature.
