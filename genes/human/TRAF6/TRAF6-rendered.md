|description[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/description)|TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) is a critical E3 ubiquitin ligase and signal transduction adaptor that synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains for non-degradative signaling. It serves as a central hub in multiple immune signaling pathways including TLR/IL-1R, TNF receptor superfamily (CD40, RANK), and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, mediating activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Beyond immunity, TRAF6 is essential for osteoclast differentiation, ectodermal development (hair, teeth, sweat glands), and has emerging roles in autophagy regulation. The protein contains an N-terminal RING domain for E3 ligase activity, zinc fingers, and a C-terminal TRAF domain for protein-protein interactions, enabling both enzymatic and scaffolding functions in signal transduction.|

|summary[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/summary)|TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is essential for its signal transduction role. This activity is well-established through multiple experimental studies showing TRAF6 works with the Ubc13-Uev1A E2 complex to synthesize K63-linked chains on target proteins including itself.|
|action[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/action)|ACCEPT|
|reason[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/reason)|This is a core molecular function of TRAF6 that is extensively validated experimentally. The IEA annotation from sequence similarity is strongly supported by multiple experimental evidence entries (EXP, IDA) in the same dataset and extensive literature.|

## suggested_questions


|question|
|---|
|How does the RING domain of TRAF6 selectively coordinate with different E2 enzymes to determine the specificity and topology of K63-linked ubiquitin chains on diverse substrates?|
|What molecular mechanisms allow TRAF6 to discriminate between canonical NF-κB activation versus non-canonical pathway engagement in different cellular contexts?|
|How do post-translational modifications of TRAF6 itself regulate its E3 ligase activity and alter its protein-protein interaction network during different signaling states?|
|What determines the cellular localization of TRAF6 between cytoplasmic signaling complexes and nuclear transcriptional co-regulatory functions?|

## suggested_experiments


|description|
|---|
|Cryo-EM structural determination of TRAF6 in complex with different E2 enzymes and substrate proteins to understand substrate specificity mechanisms|
|Single-molecule FRET imaging to track TRAF6 conformational changes during signal transduction and correlate with downstream pathway activation|
|Mass spectrometry-based ubiquitinomics to map the complete landscape of TRAF6 substrates and their ubiquitination sites across different stimulation conditions|
|Live-cell proximity labeling proteomics using TRAF6-miniTurbo to identify context-specific interactors in different immune cell types and activation states|
