description: >-
  OLIG2 (Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2) is a Class B/E basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
  transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of oligodendrocyte and motor neuron
  lineage specification in the central nervous system. OLIG2 binds E-box DNA motifs (CANNTG)
  as homo- or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, regulating transcription of genes essential
  for neural cell fate determination. The protein is induced by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling
  and cooperates with transcription factors NKX2-2, OLIG1, SOX10, and ASCL1 to establish the
  pMN (motor neuron progenitor) domain of the ventral neural tube, promoting oligodendrocyte
  precursor cell (OPC) specification and oligodendrocyte differentiation while antagonizing
  V2/V3 interneuron fates. OLIG2 also functions in cell cycle regulation by repressing p21
  and antagonizing p53 acetylation. The protein localizes primarily to the nucleus where it
  associates with chromatin, though cytoplasmic localization can occur when the nuclear
  localization signal in the bHLH domain is masked. OLIG2 is a diagnostic marker for diffuse
  gliomas, where it maintains OPC-like/proneural tumor states.

      OLIG2 is a well-established bHLH transcription factor that regulates gene
      expression during neural development. UniProt confirms OLIG2 is "required for
      oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification" and functions as a transcriptional
      regulator. The bHLH domain (residues 108-162) is essential for DNA binding.
      This is a core function of OLIG2.

      OLIG2 is specifically involved in oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification
      in the CNS (brain and spinal cord). There is no evidence that OLIG2 functions
      in sensory organ (eye, ear, nose) development. This IBA annotation appears
      to be an over-propagation from other bHLH family members that do function
      in sensory organs.
    action: REMOVE

      OLIG2's documented functions are restricted to oligodendrocyte differentiation
      and motor neuron specification in the neural tube and CNS. UniProt describes
      its function as "Required for oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification
      in the spinal cord, as well as for the development of somatic motor neurons
      in the hindbrain." There is no mention of sensory organ development. The
      IBA propagation from other bHLH family members is inappropriate here as
      OLIG2 has specialized neural tube functions distinct from sensory organ
      development. This is likely phylogenetic over-propagation from other family
      members like ATOH1 or NEUROD1 which do function in sensory development.

  review:
    summary: >-
      OLIG2's primary functions are in oligodendrocyte and motor neuron cell fate
      specification. While oligodendrocytes myelinate axons, OLIG2 itself does not
      directly regulate axon development processes. Motor neurons do extend axons,
      but OLIG2's role is in specifying motor neuron identity, not in axon growth
      or guidance per se.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Axon development is an indirect downstream consequence of OLIG2's role in
      motor neuron specification. OLIG2 specifies motor neuron identity; the
      resulting motor neurons then extend axons. However, OLIG2 is not known to
      directly regulate axon development genes or processes. This is a secondary
      effect rather than a core function. The annotation is not wrong but
      represents a downstream phenotypic effect.

    summary: >-
      OLIG2 is essential for oligodendrocyte cell fate specification. This is a core function.
      Note on specification vs commitment distinction: "Specification" is the appropriate term
      because early OLIG2+ cells in the pMN domain can give rise to EITHER motor neurons OR
      oligodendrocytes depending on developmental timing and signals - the fate is reversible
      and context-dependent, which is the definition of specification per Slack (2011).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core function of OLIG2. UniProt explicitly states OLIG2 is "Required for
      oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification." The protein establishes the pMN domain
      which gives rise to both motor neurons (early) and oligodendrocytes (later). The term
      "specification" (not "commitment") is appropriate because OLIG2+ cells retain plasticity
      to become either cell type depending on developmental context.

      progress to the OPC stage, OLIG2 (together with factors like SOX10 and NKX2.2) maintains
      commitment to the oligodendrocyte lineage. This annotation complements the specification

  review:
    summary: >-
      OLIG2 functions as a chromatin pre-patterning factor that recruits the SWI/SNF
      chromatin remodeler BRG1/SMARCA4 to oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers before
      differentiation begins. This OLIG2-BRG1 axis is required for initiating
      oligodendrocyte lineage progression. OLIG2 also recruits SETDB1 for H3K9me3
      repressive modification.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This function is documented in Yu et al. 2013 (Cell) and represents a key
      mechanistic insight into how OLIG2 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation
      at the chromatin level. The chromatin pre-patterning function is distinct from
      OLIG2's direct transcriptional regulation and is not currently annotated in GO.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      OLIG2 acts as a DNA-binding transcription factor that binds E-box motifs to activate
      transcription of oligodendrocyte lineage genes, driving oligodendrocyte precursor cell
      (OPC) specification and oligodendrocyte differentiation. This represents the primary
      core function of OLIG2 as a master regulator of oligodendrogenesis.

      OLIG2 forms homo- and heterodimers through its bHLH domain, which is essential
      for DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at Serine 147
      regulates dimerization preference: phosphorylated OLIG2 forms homodimers that
      function as transcriptional repressors and promote motor neuron fate, while
      dephosphorylated OLIG2 forms heterodimers with NGN2 and E47, sequestering NGN2
      from pro-neural functions and promoting oligodendrocyte fate (PMID:21382552).
      OLIG2 also heterodimerizes with NKX2-2 and ZNF488 to regulate distinct aspects
      of neural development.
