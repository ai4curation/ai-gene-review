description: >-
  MED13L encodes Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 13-like, a non-enzymatic
  subunit of the Mediator complex's CDK8 kinase module (CKM). The protein functions as a
  structural tether linking the CKM to core Mediator (cMED), regulating Pol II engagement
  and transcriptional programs. MED13L contains an Ago-like domain architecture with
  intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that can restrict or allow cMED interaction with
  Pol II/MED26, thereby modulating promoter-proximal events including initiation and
  pause-release. The protein localizes primarily to the nucleus and is required for Rb/E2F
  control of cell growth and neuronal dendritic development. Pathogenic variants cause
  MED13L syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech
  impairment, and congenital heart defects.

    summary: >-
      MED13L is a non-enzymatic subunit of the Mediator complex's CDK8 kinase module (CKM)
      that functions as a coregulator of transcription by RNA polymerase II. It modulates
      transcription through its structural/tethering role in the CKM. Deep research confirms
      MED13L has an Ago-like domain architecture with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
      that regulate Pol II access to the core Mediator.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core molecular function of MED13L. The protein is part of the Mediator complex
      and directly regulates transcription as a coregulator. PMID:22249253 demonstrates that
      MED13L is required for Rb/E2F transcriptional control. Deep research provides
      structural basis for the coregulatory mechanism.

    summary: >-
      MED13L localizes primarily to the nucleus, consistent with its role as a Mediator
      complex subunit involved in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II.

      Nuclear localization is the primary subcellular location for MED13L, consistent with
      its function in the Mediator complex which operates in the nucleus to regulate
      transcription. Deep research confirms primarily nuclear localization with additional
      neuronal synapse localization reported.

  review:
    summary: >-
      MED13L is definitionally a component of the Mediator complex, specifically the CDK8
      kinase module (CKM) which associates with the core Mediator. The IEA annotation to
      the broader mediator complex term is appropriate as a general annotation. More
      specifically, MED13L resides in the CKM complex (GO:1990508) which reversibly
      associates with the core Mediator.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a valid cellular component annotation for MED13L. The gene encodes Mediator
      of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 13-like, and MED13L is a bona fide subunit
      of the Mediator complex. Deep research confirms MED13L as a CKM tether that links
      the CKM to core Mediator. While a more specific annotation to CKM complex
      (GO:1990508) could be added, this general annotation remains correct.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PMID:22249253 demonstrated through a genome-wide shRNA screen that MED13L is required
      for Rb/E2F-mediated transcriptional control. The study showed that MED13L is essential
      for both transcriptional activation and repression of cell cycle target genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is supported by direct experimental evidence from PMID:22249253. While the Mediator
      complex can function in both activation and repression, the coactivator function is a
      well-established aspect of Mediator biology.
