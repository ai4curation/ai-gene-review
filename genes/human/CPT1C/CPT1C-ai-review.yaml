description: >-
  Palmitoyl thioesterase (EC 3.1.2.22) specifically expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum
  of neurons. Unlike its paralogs CPT1A and CPT1B, CPT1C does NOT have carnitine
  O-palmitoyltransferase activity (EC 2.3.1.21) and is not involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation.
  CPT1C functions as a depalmitoylating enzyme that modulates AMPA receptor (AMPAR)
  trafficking to the plasma membrane through depalmitoylation of GRIA1. The catalytic
  activity depends on the Ser-252, His-470, Asp-474 triad. Also regulates AMPAR
  trafficking through regulation of SACM1L phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatase activity.
  Mutations cause SPG73 spastic paraplegia.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from CPT1 family. However, CPT1C
      has evolved a distinct function from its paralogs CPT1A and CPT1B. Recent reviews
      emphasize that CPT1C has markedly reduced canonical CPT1 enzymatic activity and
      functions primarily as a malonyl-CoA/nutrient sensor rather than a fatty acid
      metabolic enzyme (CPT1C-deep-research-falcon.md). The negated ISS annotation
      for this same term correctly reflects that CPT1C is NOT involved in fatty acid
      metabolism.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      CPT1C has neofunctionalized as a palmitoyl thioesterase rather than a fatty acid
      metabolic enzyme. While phylogenetically related to CPT1A/B which function in
      fatty acid metabolism, experimental evidence demonstrates CPT1C lacks the canonical
      CPT1 transferase activity. The IBA annotation incorrectly propagates ancestral
      function that CPT1C does not retain. Note: The negated ISS annotation for this
      term states the opposite (NOT fatty acid metabolic process) and is ACCEPTED.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. However, CPT1C does not function

      CPT1C has lost the carnitine-dependent transferase activity of the ancestral CPT1.
      It functions instead as a palmitoyl thioesterase. The IBA incorrectly infers

      CPT1C is not involved in carnitine-dependent acyl transfer. Note: The negated

  review:

      IEA based on UniProt keyword mapping. CPT1C is involved in lipid metabolism
      in a limited sense - it depalmitoylates protein substrates (removing palmitate,
      a lipid). However, this term implies involvement in general lipid metabolism
      pathways, which is misleading given CPT1C's specific role in protein
      depalmitoylation rather than lipid biosynthesis/degradation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While CPT1C does act on palmitate (a fatty acid/lipid), its function is
      protein depalmitoylation for receptor trafficking regulation, not classical

    label: carnitine metabolic process
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  negated: true
  review:
    summary: >-
      Negated (NOT) annotation correctly stating CPT1C is NOT involved in
      carnitine metabolic process. CPT1C binds malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA
      but does not catalyze carnitine-dependent acyl transfer.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This NOT annotation is accurate and important. CPT1C lacks the carnitine
      palmitoyltransferase activity that would involve it in carnitine metabolism.
      It functions as a thioesterase independent of carnitine. Note: The positive
      IBA annotation for this term is REMOVED as it incorrectly states CPT1C IS
      involved in carnitine metabolism.

# IPI annotation

    label: protein binding
  evidence_type: IPI
  original_reference_id: PMID:25751282
  review:
    summary: >-
      IPI annotation for protein binding based on interaction with ATL1
      (atlastin-1). PMID:25751282 demonstrated CPT1C interacts with atlastin-1,
      an endoplasmic reticulum protein encoded by the ATL1 gene.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While the protein interaction is valid, GO:0005515 "protein binding"
      is too general to be informative. CPT1C interacts with ATL1 (PMID:25751282)
      and with GRIA1 substrate (PMID:30135643). The annotation is not wrong
      but provides minimal functional insight.

# Suggested new annotations

    label: protein depalmitoylation
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:30135643
  review:
    summary: >-
      NEW annotation suggestion. CPT1C depalmitoylates GRIA1, which is the
      mechanism by which it regulates AMPAR trafficking. This biological
      process annotation captures the core function of CPT1C.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This process annotation directly describes CPT1C's demonstrated
      biological activity - removing palmitate from GRIA1 protein. The
      GO:0098734 "macromolecule depalmitoylation" is present as IEA, but
      GO:0002084 "protein depalmitoylation" is more specific and should
      have IDA support from PMID:30135643.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:30135643
  review:
    summary: >-
      NEW annotation suggestion. CPT1C positively regulates AMPAR surface
      expression and clustering. Knockout of CPT1C reduces AMPAR surface
      levels as shown in PMID:30135643.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      CPT1C increases AMPAR surface expression through depalmitoylation
      of GluA1. This represents positive regulation of AMPAR clustering
      at the plasma membrane.
