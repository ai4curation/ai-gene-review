description: Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP/thrombospondin-5) is a pentameric extracellular
  matrix glycoprotein of the thrombospondin family that functions primarily as a structural constituent
  organizing ECM components in load-bearing tissues. The mature protein consists of an N-terminal oligomerization
  domain, four EGF-like repeats (two Ca2+-binding), eight TSP type-3 repeats that each bind two calcium
  ions, and a C-terminal globular domain that binds collagen and aggrecan. COMP forms homopentamers via
  disulfide-linked N-terminal coiled-coil regions, creating a multivalent scaffold that bridges collagens
  (types I, II, IX), matrilins (MATN1, MATN3, MATN4), fibronectin, aggrecan, and integrins (alpha5beta1,
  alphaVbeta3). It promotes collagen fibrillogenesis, supports cartilage ECM integrity, mediates chondrocyte
  attachment through integrin receptors, and suppresses apoptosis via induction of IAP family survival
  proteins. Expressed abundantly in cartilage, tendon, ligament, and synovium, with additional expression
  in blood vessels and adipose tissue. Mutations cause pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal
  dysplasia type 1 (EDM1) through ER retention of misfolded protein and activation of the unfolded protein
  response. Also implicated as a biomarker in osteoarthritis and as a prognostic factor in certain cancers.

  review:
    summary: COMP is a major extracellular matrix component in cartilage, tendon, ligament, and other
      load-bearing tissues. IBA annotations represent phylogenetically-informed annotations that have
      undergone extensive review. This annotation correctly captures COMP's primary cellular compartment
      where it functions as a structural organizer.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core localization for COMP's primary function as an ECM structural constituent.
      Supported by extensive literature showing COMP expression and function in the ECM of multiple tissues.
      IBA evidence is robust and this matches experimental evidence.

  review:
    summary: COMP is a calcium-binding protein, with 11-14 calcium ions bound per subunit. The eight TSP
      type-3 repeats each bind two calcium ions, and the C-terminal domain binds three additional calcium
      ions. Calcium binding is essential for COMP conformation and collagen-binding activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported by multiple experimental studies demonstrating calcium binding
      by COMP. The InterPro EGF-Ca-binding domains (IPR001881) correctly predict this function, validated
