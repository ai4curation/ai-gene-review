## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P49747
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein {ECO:0000305}; Short=COMP; AltName: Full=Thrombospondin-5; Short=TSP5; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=COMP {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:2227};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thrombospondin family. .
- **Key Domains:** ConA-like_dom_sf. (IPR013320); EGF-like_Ca-bd_dom. (IPR001881); EGF-like_dom. (IPR000742); EGF_Ca-bd_CS. (IPR018097); Growth_fac_rcpt_cys_sf. (IPR009030)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "COMP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'COMP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **COMP** (gene ID: COMP, UniProt: P49747) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research report: Human COMP (thrombospondin‑5; UniProt P49747)

Identity verification and structural features
- Gene/protein identity: The human COMP gene (HGNC:2227) encodes cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), also known as thrombospondin‑5, a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein in the thrombospondin family. Recent reviews describe COMP as a pentameric complex of five ~100 kDa subunits disulfide‑linked into a ~520 kDa assembly and localized predominantly to cartilage, tendon/ligament, synovium, with expression also noted in cardiovascular and adipose tissues, consistent with UniProt’s human entry. Domain features include an N‑terminal coiled/helical oligomerization region, four EGF‑like repeats including Ca2+‑binding EGF motifs, eight type III Ca2+‑binding repeats, and a C‑terminal globular domain; the EGF/type III repeats are Ca2+‑dependent and are targets for MMP/ADAMTS proteolysis. These sources align with the thrombospondin family membership and domain architecture provided in the query (EGF‑like Ca2+‑binding repeats; ConA‑like/GF receptor cystine‑knot superfamilies) and confirm Homo sapiens as the organism of focus (Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2025, URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1529384; IJMS, May 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105263). (li2025immunogenicityofchondrocyte pages 6-7, lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)

- Oligomeric state and assembly: COMP forms a homopentamer via its N‑terminal oligomerization domain; each arm presents EGF‑like and type III repeats terminating in a C‑terminal globular domain that mediates ligand binding. This arrangement underlies its multivalent ECM‑bridging function and susceptibility to proteolytic generation of bioactive fragments. (li2025immunogenicityofchondrocyte pages 6-7)

Core functions, binding partners, localization
- Primary function: COMP is a non‑collagenous ECM organizer that catalyzes collagen fibrillogenesis and stabilizes ECM networks. It promotes secretion/assembly of collagens and supports the mechanical properties of load‑bearing tissues. (lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- Binding partners: COMP binds collagens I/II/IX and matrilins and supports cell adhesion via integrins; it also associates with granulin‑epithelin precursor to potentiate chondrocyte proliferation. These interactions position COMP at the interface of matrix assembly and cell–matrix signaling. (hecht2024lossofchop pages 13-15, li2025immunogenicityofchondrocyte pages 6-7)
- Cellular and tissue localization: COMP is secreted and deposited in the pericellular/interterritorial ECM of articular cartilage, meniscus, tendons/ligaments and synovium; it is detectable at higher concentrations in synovial fluid than in serum and is released following joint injury. (lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2, hecht2024lossofchop pages 13-15)

Pathways and receptor/signaling contexts
- Integrin/ECM signaling: Through integrin‑mediated adhesion and ECM scaffolding, COMP influences chondrocyte attachment and matrix homeostasis, and its fragments may act as DAMPs in arthropathies. (hecht2024lossofchop pages 13-15)
- Notch3/EMT in cancer stroma: In ovarian cancer, stromal COMP secreted by carcinoma‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs) enhances the Notch3–Jagged1 interaction, increases active β‑catenin, and induces epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting migration/invasion; Notch inhibition abrogates these effects (J Transl Med, Apr 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-024-05083-0). (gorjibahri2024stromalcartilageoligomeric pages 17-18)
- ER/Ca2+ and apoptosis signaling in cancer cells: In breast cancer cells, intracellular/ER‑localized COMP interacts with calpain to blunt calpain activation and downstream caspase‑9/‑7/‑3 cleavage under chemotherapy, perturbing ER/cytosolic/mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and conferring chemoresistance (Cell Death & Disease, Jul 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-024-06872-7). (hanitrarimalala2024intracellularcartilageoligomeric pages 13-13)

Disease mechanisms: genetic and acquired
- Skeletal dysplasias (COMPopathies): Heterozygous COMP mutations cause pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and autosomal dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). Mutant COMP misfolds, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of growth plate chondrocytes, and activates the PERK–eIF2α–CHOP arm of the unfolded protein response; CHOP and TNF‑α–driven mTORC1 activation suppress autophagy, exacerbating mutant COMP retention. In the MT‑COMP (D469del) mouse model, genetic CHOP ablation preserves joint health and reduces pain/inflammation but does not normalize limb length; antisense CHOP knockdown reduces CHOP mRNA ~60% without improving limb length (IJMS, Dec 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26010016). (hecht2024lossofchop pages 13-15)
- Osteoarthritis and joint pathology: COMP is released into joint fluid and circulation with cartilage matrix turnover and synovial inflammation; TNF‑α upregulates COMP in OA fibroblast‑like synoviocytes. Clinical data indicate elevated COMP in OA serum/synovial fluid overall, though cohort‑specific differences exist. (udomsinprasert2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2, lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)

Biomarker applications and performance (recent clinical data)
- Knee OA diagnostic performance: In a 270 OA vs 93 control cohort, serum COMP yielded an AUC of 1.00 at a 41.64 ng/mL cutoff, with sensitivity 99.6% and specificity 100.0%. Serum COMP correlated with radiographic severity and with body composition, physical performance, knee pain and disability; synovial COMP mRNA was upregulated and correlated with serum/synovial protein levels (Bone & Joint Research, Jun 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.1302/2046-3758.136.bjr-2023-0180.r1). (udomsinprasert2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- OA/obesity relationships and cohort contrasts: In an independent cross‑sectional study, mean serum COMP was higher in controls than knee OA patients (1518.69 ± 232.76 vs 1294.58 ± 360.77 ng/mL; p=0.0012), negatively correlated with disease duration (p=0.04), and was higher in overweight/obese controls (BMI ≥25) vs normal‑weight controls (p=0.0092), highlighting population/phenotype and compartment differences (IJMS, 12 May 2024, URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25105263). The authors concluded COMP’s current clinical use is mainly research‑oriented with contradictory literature, underscoring the need for standardized assays and phenotyping. (lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)

Oncology: prognostic and mechanistic roles
- Ovarian cancer (stroma): High stromal COMP is associated with worse overall survival; CAF‑derived COMP drives tumor growth/metastasis via Notch3‑dependent EMT. Mechanistic inhibition of Notch abrogates COMP‑driven migration and tumorsphere formation (J Transl Med, Apr 2024, URL above). (gorjibahri2024stromalcartilageoligomeric pages 17-18)
- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA): In a retrospective iCCA cohort (n=182) with GEO validation (GSE26566, n=104), COMP overexpression predicted poor outcomes: disease‑free survival HR 3.651 (p=0.001), overall survival HR 1.827 (p=0.023), local recurrence‑free survival HR 4.077 (p<0.001), metastasis‑free survival HR 3.718 (p<0.001). COMP co‑expression patterns implicated PDGF/CAF‑ECM programs and EMT (Sci Reports, Oct 2023, URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43006-z). (ong2023cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 8-9)
- Breast cancer (chemoresistance): ER‑localized COMP confers resistance to chemotherapy, anti‑HER2 therapy, and endocrine therapy across subtypes; calpain activation and caspase activation are suppressed in COMP‑expressing cells, and patient tumors with high COMP show reduced overall survival under therapy (Cell Death & Disease, Jul 2024, URL above). (hanitrarimalala2024intracellularcartilageoligomeric pages 13-13)

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Musculoskeletal disease: COMP is measured by ELISA in serum and synovial fluid in research and translational settings to monitor joint tissue turnover in OA and injury. Elevated synovial levels relative to serum and cytokine‑responsive expression in synovium support its use as a disease activity marker; however, standardization and phenotypic context (e.g., metabolic OA, adiposity) are critical, as illustrated by divergent cohort findings in 2024 studies. (udomsinprasert2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2, lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- Oncology: COMP immunohistochemistry and transcript quantification in tumor and stromal compartments are being evaluated as prognostic markers and potential stratifiers for pathway‑directed therapies (e.g., Notch inhibition in COMP‑high ovarian tumors). (gorjibahri2024stromalcartilageoligomeric pages 17-18, ong2023cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 8-9)

Key statistics and quantitative data (recent)
- OA biomarker performance: AUC 1.00; sensitivity 99.6%; specificity 100.0% at 41.64 ng/mL serum COMP cutoff (N=270 OA, 93 controls). (udomsinprasert2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- OA cohort contrasts: Controls vs OA mean serum COMP 1518.69 ± 232.76 vs 1294.58 ± 360.77 ng/mL (p=0.0012); negative correlation with disease duration (p=0.04); overweight/obese controls show higher COMP vs normal‑weight controls (p=0.0092). (lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- iCCA prognosis: DFS HR 3.651 (p=0.001); OS HR 1.827 (p=0.023); LRFS HR 4.077 (p<0.001); MFS HR 3.718 (p<0.001) for COMP‑high tumors (n=182 cohort; GSE26566 n=104). (ong2023cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 8-9)

Expert perspectives and recent reviews (2023–2024)
- ECM/thrombospondin family and COMP in joint disease: Contemporary reviews emphasize COMP’s matricellular role in collagen fibrillogenesis, its regulated expression in synovium, and its promise and limitations as a biomarker in OA, with calls for harmonized assays and phenotypic stratification (IJMS, May 2024, URL above; Bone & Joint Research, Jun 2024, URL above). (lambova2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2, udomsinprasert2024cartilageoligomericmatrix pages 1-2)
- Structural identity and proteolysis: Updated summaries detail COMP’s domain architecture, pentameric assembly, and protease‑sensitive regions generating fragments with immunogenic and functional activity—important for interpreting biomarker assays detecting intact protein vs fragments (Frontiers in Immunology, Mar 2025, URL above). (li2025immunogenicityofchondrocyte pages 6-7)
- Cancer mechanisms: Emerging 2024 studies define stromal COMP as a driver of Notch3‑dependent EMT in ovarian cancer and intracellular COMP as a modulator of ER/Ca2+‑calpain‑caspase signaling and therapy resistance in breast cancer, consolidating COMP as both ECM organizer and context‑dependent signaling modulator in malignancy (J Transl Med, 2024; Cell Death & Disease, 2024). (gorjibahri2024stromalcartilageoligomeric pages 17-18, hanitrarimalala2024intracellularcartilageoligomeric pages 13-13)

Conclusion and outlook
Human COMP (thrombospondin‑5; UniProt P49747) is a secreted, pentameric thrombospondin‑family ECM organizer that scaffolds collagen networks, binds matrilins and integrins, and supports cartilage and tendon matrix integrity. Its dysfunction via missense mutations drives ER‑stress‑mediated chondrocyte pathology in PSACH/MED, with CHOP as a key effector in vivo. As a translational biomarker, COMP shows strong associations with OA severity in some cohorts (AUC ~1.0 in one 2024 study) but also reveals phenotype‑dependent behavior, underscoring the need for assay/phenotype standardization. In cancer, COMP emerges as a stromal/tumor factor linked to EMT, Notch3 signaling, therapy resistance, and poor prognosis in specific entities (ovarian cancer, iCCA, breast cancer). Together, these advances refine the functional annotation of COMP as both a structural ECM hub and a context‑dependent modulator of cell signaling, with actionable implications for musculoskeletal and oncologic disease monitoring and therapy development.
