description: >-
  ASAH2 encodes human neutral ceramidase (N-CDase, EC 3.5.1.23), a Zn2+-dependent
  type II membrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide to
  sphingosine and free fatty acid at neutral pH. The enzyme is highly expressed
  at the intestinal brush border where it plays an essential role in digesting
  dietary sphingolipids. ASAH2 also catalyzes the reverse reaction, allowing
  synthesis of ceramides from fatty acids and sphingosine. The enzyme contains
  a ~20 Angstrom deep hydrophobic active site pocket that specifically recognizes
  ceramide's small hydroxyl headgroup while sterically excluding sphingolipids
  with bulky headgroups. While ASAH2's ceramide-degrading activity can shift
  the ceramide/S1P rheostat toward pro-survival signaling, this represents a
  downstream metabolic consequence rather than its evolved primary function.

        The hydrolysis of ceramide by ASAH2 releases a free fatty acid as one of

        This annotation is well-supported. ASAH2 catalyzes ceramide + H2O -> sphingosine
        + fatty acid.
        The released fatty acid is a direct enzymatic product. This is a core metabolic
        outcome of the ceramidase reaction, not a downstream pleiotropic effect.

      reason: >-
        This annotation represents the "causal downstream effect" pattern of
        over-annotation. ASAH2's core function is ceramide hydrolysis for
        sphingolipid metabolism (especially dietary sphingolipid digestion in
        intestine). Ceramide happens to be a pro-apoptotic lipid, and by reducing
        ceramide levels while increasing sphingosine/S1P (pro-survival), ASAH2
        can shift the balance away from apoptosis. However, ASAH2 did not evolve
        TO regulate apoptosis - it evolved to metabolize ceramides. The enzyme
        has no direct role in apoptotic machinery (caspases, Bcl-2 family, death
        receptors, etc.). The keyword "Apoptosis" in UniProt leads to this
