## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Neutral ceramidase {ECO:0000305}; Short=N-CDase; Short=NCDase; EC=3.5.1.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JHE3}; EC=3.5.1.23 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10781606, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278489, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15946935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16061940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19345744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26190575}; AltName: Full=Acylsphingosine deacylase 2; AltName: Full=BCDase; AltName: Full=LCDase; Short=hCD; AltName: Full=N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2; AltName: Full=Non-lysosomal ceramidase; Contains: RecName: Full=Neutral ceramidase soluble form {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q91XT9};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ASAH2; Synonyms=HNAC1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the neutral ceramidase family. .
- **Key Domains:** Ceramidase_alk. (IPR006823); NCDase_C_sf. (IPR038445); NEUT/ALK_ceramidase_C. (IPR031331); NEUT/ALK_ceramidase_N. (IPR031329); Ceramidase_alk (PF04734)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ASAH2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ASAH2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ASAH2** (gene ID: ASAH2, UniProt: Q9NR71) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human ASAH2 (Neutral Ceramidase; UniProt Q9NR71)

Executive verification and identity
- Target verified: ASAH2 encodes human neutral ceramidase (N‑CDase), EC 3.5.1.23, a single‑pass type II membrane glycoprotein in the neutral/alkaline ceramidase family (PF04734/InterPro IPR006823). Distinct from acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and alkaline ceramidases (ACER1‑3). Organism: Homo sapiens. Literature aligns with the UniProt description and domain family annotations (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary enzymatic function: ASAH2 catalyzes the Zn2+‑dependent hydrolysis of ceramide to yield sphingosine and a free fatty acid, thereby connecting ceramide to the sphingosine–sphingosine‑1‑phosphate (S1P) signaling axis (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).
- Substrate selectivity: Structural analyses demonstrate a narrow, ≈20 Å hydrophobic pocket that specifically recognizes the small 1‑hydroxyl “headgroup” of ceramide and sterically excludes bulkier sphingolipids (e.g., those with polar headgroups), explaining preference for ceramide over complex sphingolipids (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).
- Molecular architecture: The crystallized human nCDase extracellular construct comprises a catalytic domain (~residues 99–626), a short linker, and an immunoglobulin‑like domain (~642–780). The active site features a catalytic Zn2+ coordinated deep within the pocket; key residues include His194, His196, His303, Glu540, Tyr579, and Tyr591 that organize metal coordination and transition‑state stabilization (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).
- Topology and processing: ASAH2 is a type II membrane protein; retention at the plasma membrane involves O‑glycosylation in a mucin‑like region and C‑terminal sequences are necessary for ER exit. Multiple N‑linked glycosylation sites have been reported in the lumenal/extracellular region (parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9).

2) Recent developments and latest research
- Refined structure–function insights and catalytic mechanism: The 2.6 Å human nCDase structure (Structure, Aug 2015) revealed a eukaryote‑specific subdomain that stabilizes the active site and a Zn2+‑based amidase strategy distinct from bacterial homologs; docking and mutational analyses clarified determinants for ceramide recognition and catalysis (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3). Subsequent focused reviews summarized the catalytic residues, catalytic pocket architecture, and provided kinetic parameters and glycosylation/processing details (Advances in Biological Regulation, 2017; Cells, 2019) (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9).
- Cancer signaling and pathway crosstalk: In colon cancer models, nCDase activity supports Akt phosphorylation; its inhibition leads to Akt dephosphorylation, GSK3β activation, reduced β‑catenin, and growth suppression, consistent with a role upstream of Wnt/β‑catenin signaling; constitutively active AKT rescues growth in xenografts, underscoring therapeutic promise (summarized in 2019 review) (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6).
- Subcellular compartmentation in colorectal cancer cells: Functional nCDase pools at plasma membrane and Golgi metabolize ceramide locally; Golgi‑restricted activity reduces C6‑ceramide‑induced cell death, highlighting compartment‑specific control of sphingolipid signaling (summarized from primary work in J Lipid Research and reviews) (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4).
- Kinetic characterization and modulation: Reported Km values for short‑chain C12 ceramide analogs are in the low tens of µM (≈33–60 µM) with kcat ≈ 62 min−1 and near‑neutral pH optima, placing human nCDase in a physiologically plausible activity range at the extracellular/lumenal face of membranes (parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting in colorectal cancer: Inhibition or genetic reduction of nCDase elevates ceramide, suppresses Akt/β‑catenin signaling, and inhibits tumor growth in preclinical settings, motivating drug discovery efforts (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4).
- Inhibitor discovery platforms: High‑throughput enzymology and fluorogenic substrates (e.g., FRET/umbelliferone‑releasing assays) have been developed and applied to screen for nCDase inhibitors, aiding lead identification for oncology applications (as summarized in reviews) (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6).
- Intestinal physiology and nutrition: A core physiological role for nCDase in digestion of dietary sphingolipids at the intestinal brush border underlies interest in modulating gut sphingolipid fluxes to influence local immune/metabolic signaling (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).

4) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Structural and mechanistic authority: Airola et al. provided the definitive human nCDase structure and mechanistic rationale for ceramide selectivity and catalysis, positioning ASAH2 as a tractable enzyme target with a well‑defined active site (Structure, 2015) (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).
- Field reviews by Hannun/Obeid and colleagues: Reviews synthesize ASAH2’s roles in intestinal biology, cell survival/proliferation signaling, and cancer, emphasizing compartmentalization (Golgi versus plasma membrane) and the enzyme’s centrality in ceramide–sphingosine–S1P rheostat control (Advances in Biological Regulation, 2017/2019) (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4).
- Broader ceramidase landscape: Comparative analyses outline distinct pH optima, subcellular locations, and physiological roles separating neutral ceramidase (ASAH2) from acid (ASAH1) and alkaline (ACER) ceramidases, reinforcing the need to avoid conflation (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Kinetic parameters: Representative human nCDase kinetic values from recombinant extracellular domain preparations: Km ≈ 33.41 µM and kcat ≈ 61.93 min−1 for short‑chain ceramide analogs; additional measurements with C12 NBD‑ceramide analogs give Km ≈ 60.1 µM; optimal pH is near neutral (~7.0–7.5) (parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).
- Structural metrics: Crystal structure resolved at 2.6 Å with a ≈20 Å‑deep hydrophobic pocket; Zn2+ at the catalytic base with coordinating residues (His194/His196/His303/Glu540/Yr579/Yr591) identified; phosphate observed as a transition‑state mimic (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6).

Functional biology and pathways
- Intestinal digestion: ASAH2/nCDase is highly expressed along the apical brush border of small intestine and colon, where it deacylates ceramides produced from dietary sphingolipids, generating sphingosine for absorption or conversion to S1P in mucosa. Genetic ablation in mice disrupts intestinal ceramide degradation, underscoring essential function in dietary sphingolipid catabolism (summarized in mechanistic reviews) (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4, airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization: Beyond the apical surface in enterocytes, ASAH2 has been detected at the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus in cell models; earlier overexpression studies also reported mitochondrial localization. Localization is influenced by glycosylation and C‑terminal motifs that control ER exit and membrane retention (coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4).
- Signaling roles and cancer: By reducing ceramide and increasing sphingosine (and potentially S1P), ASAH2 promotes pro‑survival signaling. In colon cancer models, nCDase inhibition decreases Akt phosphorylation, activates GSK3β, reduces β‑catenin, and suppresses growth; constitutively active Akt can rescue these effects in xenografts, linking ASAH2 to the Akt–GSK3β–β‑catenin axis (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6).

Mechanism and structure details
- Reaction: Ceramide + H2O → sphingosine + fatty acid. Zn2+‑assisted hydrolysis in a deeply buried hydrophobic pocket; small headgroup recognition explains exclusion of complex sphingolipids with bulky polar moieties (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).
- Active‑site residues and metal: Zn2+ coordinated by histidines and glutamate; Tyr residues aid substrate positioning and transition‑state stabilization; a bound phosphate mimics the tetrahedral intermediate in the crystal (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6).
- Isoforms and PTMs: Two human isoforms (length difference by alternative splicing) and extensive N‑ and O‑glycosylation affect trafficking and membrane residence; O‑glycosylated forms are membrane‑associated, while other processed forms can be more soluble, depending on tissue (parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9).

Clinical and translational perspectives
- Oncology: ASAH2 is an emerging target in colorectal cancer; preclinical evidence indicates that lowering nCDase activity can restore ceramide signaling and blunt tumor growth, in part by down‑modulating Akt/β‑catenin signaling (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4).
- Inhibitor discovery: Fluorogenic assays and high‑throughput screening campaigns have enabled discovery of small‑molecule nCDase inhibitors and chemical series for optimization, supported by structural insights for rational design (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3).
- Broader disease biology: Reviews note ASAH2’s involvement in intestinal inflammation and injury responses, with context‑dependent effects on autophagy/mitophagy and cell death pathways through ceramide–sphingosine–S1P rheostat shifts (coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6).

Limitations and open areas
- Recency of literature: ASAH2‑specific primary advances post‑2020 remain comparatively sparse in the retrieved evidence set; however, the structural and mechanistic foundation and oncologic implications are well supported by peer‑reviewed sources through 2019. Where possible, this report cites authoritative reviews and the definitive 2015 structural paper (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).

Conclusions
ASAH2 encodes human neutral ceramidase, a Zn2+‑dependent, type II membrane amidase that hydrolyzes ceramide to sphingosine at neutral pH. Its structural design confers strict recognition of ceramide’s minimal headgroup, rationalizing substrate preference. In vivo, ASAH2 is highly expressed at the intestinal brush border and is essential for dietary sphingolipid catabolism. In epithelial and cancer cell contexts, ASAH2/nCDase at the plasma membrane and Golgi modulates the ceramide–sphingosine–S1P rheostat and engages Akt–GSK3β–β‑catenin signaling, supporting proliferation and survival. These mechanistic anchors have stimulated inhibitor discovery and evaluation of ASAH2 as a therapeutic target, particularly in colorectal cancer (airola2015structuralbasisfor pages 1-3, coant2017ceramidasesrolesin pages 5-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 4-6, coant2019neutralceramidaseadvances pages 3-4, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 3-6, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 6-9, parveen2019roleofceramidases pages 1-3).
