description: 'Alpha-S1-casein (CSN1S1, 214 AA, ~27 kDa), member of casein family of
  milk proteins. Phosphoprotein that forms calcium-phosphate-rich micelles in milk
  enabling efficient delivery of minerals and protein to nursing infant. Intrinsically
  disordered protein with multiple phosphoserine clusters that bind calcium ions and
  sequester calcium phosphate nanoclusters in colloidal micelles. Self-associates
  and interacts with other caseins (alpha-S2, beta, kappa) via hydrophobic/electrostatic
  interactions forming large micellar aggregates. Plays important role in capacity
  of milk to transport calcium phosphate. Expression tightly linked to lactation cycle
  - minimally expressed in non-lactating conditions but robustly induced during late
  pregnancy/lactation by prolactin via JAK2-STAT5 pathway in mammary alveolar epithelial
  cells. Synthesized in rough ER, phosphorylated in Golgi, packaged into secretory
  vesicles and secreted into mammary gland alveoli lumen. Present at very low levels
  in human milk (trace amounts, <1% of milk protein) compared to cow''s milk. Beyond
  nutrition, generates bioactive peptides upon proteolysis - casoxin D (opioid receptor
  antagonist with vasorelaxant activity). Recent research reveals immunomodulatory
  role: unphosphorylated alpha-S1-casein adopts helical conformation enabling TLR4
  binding on immune cells, triggering pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Phosphorylation
  acts as molecular toggle shifting from immune-stimulatory form (less phosphorylated,
  α-helical) to nutritional form (phosphorylated, disordered). Most milk alpha-S1-casein
  highly phosphorylated (optimized for calcium transport). Can influence monocyte
  differentiation toward macrophage phenotype and suppress dendritic cell differentiation.
  Major allergen in cow''s milk allergy. Ectopic expression outside mammary gland
  observed in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and some cancers.'
