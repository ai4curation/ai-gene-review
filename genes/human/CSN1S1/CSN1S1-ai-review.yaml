description: 'Alpha-S1-casein (CSN1S1, 214 AA, ~27 kDa), member of casein family of
  milk proteins. Phosphoprotein that forms calcium-phosphate-rich micelles in milk
  enabling efficient delivery of minerals and protein to nursing infant. Intrinsically
  disordered protein with multiple phosphoserine clusters that bind calcium ions and
  sequester calcium phosphate nanoclusters in colloidal micelles. Self-associates
  and interacts with other caseins (alpha-S2, beta, kappa) via hydrophobic/electrostatic
  interactions forming large micellar aggregates. Plays important role in capacity
  of milk to transport calcium phosphate. Expression tightly linked to lactation cycle
  - minimally expressed in non-lactating conditions but robustly induced during late
  pregnancy/lactation by prolactin via JAK2-STAT5 pathway in mammary alveolar epithelial
  cells. Synthesized in rough ER, phosphorylated in Golgi, packaged into secretory
  vesicles and secreted into mammary gland alveoli lumen. Present at very low levels
  in human milk (trace amounts, <1% of milk protein) compared to cow''s milk. Beyond
  nutrition, generates bioactive peptides upon proteolysis - casoxin D (opioid receptor
  antagonist with vasorelaxant activity). Recent research reveals immunomodulatory
  role: unphosphorylated alpha-S1-casein adopts helical conformation enabling TLR4
  binding on immune cells, triggering pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Phosphorylation
  acts as molecular toggle shifting from immune-stimulatory form (less phosphorylated,
  α-helical) to nutritional form (phosphorylated, disordered). Most milk alpha-S1-casein
  highly phosphorylated (optimized for calcium transport). Can influence monocyte
  differentiation toward macrophage phenotype and suppress dendritic cell differentiation.
  Major allergen in cow''s milk allergy. Ectopic expression outside mammary gland
  observed in autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and some cancers.'

    label: response to estradiol
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CSN1S1 gene expression is regulated by estradiol during mammary 
      gland development and lactation. Estrogen is critical for mammary 
      epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Reflects transcriptional regulation of CSN1S1 during mammary 
      development rather than a direct molecular function of the protein itself.
      Hormone response at gene expression level is upstream of protein function.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CSN1S1 gene expression is regulated by progesterone during mammary 
      gland development. Progesterone prepares mammary tissue for milk 
      production during pregnancy.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Reflects transcriptional regulation during mammary development 
      rather than direct protein function. Appropriate IBA annotation but not a 
      core molecular activity.

  review:
    summary: DHEA is an androgen precursor with potential effects on mammary 
      tissue. Less direct connection to CSN1S1 than estrogen/progesterone.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Phylogenetically inferred annotation. May reflect species-specific 
      hormonal regulation of milk protein genes. Not a core function of the 
      mature CSN1S1 protein.

  review:
    summary: 11-deoxycorticosterone is a glucocorticoid precursor. 
      Glucocorticoids do participate in regulation of milk protein gene 
      expression during lactation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Phylogenetically inferred annotation reflecting hormonal regulation 
      of milk protein genes. Glucocorticoids modulate lactation but this is 
      upstream transcriptional regulation, not protein function.

  review:
    summary: Generic protein binding from HuRI interactome study. CSN1S1 
      self-associates and interacts with other caseins to form micelles.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Uninformative generic term per curation guidelines. The biologically
      relevant interactions are casein self-association and inter-casein binding
      to form micellar structures, but "protein binding" does not capture this 
      specificity. The HuRI study is a high-throughput screen without functional
      context.
