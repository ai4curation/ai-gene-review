id: Q32NC0
gene_symbol: C18orf21
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: 'An uncharacterized protein of the UPF0711 family containing a DUF4674 domain. Originally identified as upregulated by Hepatitis B virus X protein (hence alias XTP13), this 220 amino acid protein is ubiquitously expressed and conserved in vertebrates. Despite appearing in hundreds of CRISPR screens affecting cell fitness and having numerous potential protein interactions, its molecular function remains unknown.'
