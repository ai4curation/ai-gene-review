description: An uncharacterized protein of the UPF0711 family containing a DUF4674 domain. Originally
  identified as upregulated by Hepatitis B virus X protein (hence alias XTP13), this 220 amino acid protein
  is ubiquitously expressed and conserved in vertebrates. Despite appearing in hundreds of CRISPR screens
  affecting cell fitness and having numerous potential protein interactions, its molecular function remains
  unknown.

  review:
    summary: Nuclear localization predicted based on subcellular distribution studies but requires experimental
      validation
    action: NEW
    reason: C18orf21 shows predicted nuclear localization based on computational analyses and subcellular
      distribution studies, potentially concentrating in nucleolar substructures. While this is an uncharacterized
      protein, the nuclear localization prediction is more specific than generic cellular component annotations
      and may reflect its actual subcellular distribution. However, this annotation should be considered
      preliminary pending experimental validation.

      supporting_text: C18orf21 is predicted to function intracellularly with localization in both cytoplasm
        and nucleus, potentially concentrating in nucleolar substructures.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization predicted based on subcellular distribution studies but requires
      experimental validation
    action: NEW
    reason: C18orf21 shows predicted cytoplasmic localization based on computational analyses and subcellular
      distribution studies, indicating a dual nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution pattern. While this is
      an uncharacterized protein with unknown function, the cytoplasmic localization prediction is supported
      by subcellular distribution analyses. This annotation should be considered preliminary pending experimental
      validation of the actual subcellular localization.
