gene_symbol: C18orf21
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: An uncharacterized protein of the UPF0711 family containing a DUF4674
  domain. Originally identified as upregulated by Hepatitis B virus X protein (hence
  alias XTP13), this 220 amino acid protein is ubiquitously expressed and conserved
  in vertebrates. Despite appearing in hundreds of CRISPR screens affecting cell fitness
  and having numerous potential protein interactions, its molecular function remains
  unknown.

  review:
    summary: Nuclear localization predicted based on subcellular distribution studies but requires experimental validation
    action: NEW
    reason: C18orf21 shows predicted nuclear localization based on computational analyses and subcellular distribution studies, potentially concentrating in nucleolar substructures. While this is an uncharacterized protein, the nuclear localization prediction is more specific than generic cellular component annotations and may reflect its actual subcellular distribution. However, this annotation should be considered preliminary pending experimental validation.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization predicted based on subcellular distribution studies but requires experimental validation
    action: NEW
    reason: C18orf21 shows predicted cytoplasmic localization based on computational analyses and subcellular distribution studies, indicating a dual nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution pattern. While this is an uncharacterized protein with unknown function, the cytoplasmic localization prediction is supported by subcellular distribution analyses. This annotation should be considered preliminary pending experimental validation of the actual subcellular localization.
