# C18orf21 (Homo sapiens) – Chromosome 18 Open Reading Frame 21

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
C18orf21 encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein of 220 amino acids with no well-characterized biochemical function ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W513.html#:~:text=XTP13%20%28HBV%20XAg,23%20pairs%20of%20chromosomes%20in)). It belongs to the uncharacterized protein family UPF0711 and contains a Domain of Unknown Function (DUF4674, Pfam PF15719) ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W513.html#:~:text=XTP13%20%28HBV%20XAg,23%20pairs%20of%20chromosomes%20in)) ([genome.bio.fsu.edu](https://genome.bio.fsu.edu/cgi-bin/hgGene?db=hg19&hgg_chrom=chr18&hgg_end=33559250&hgg_gene=uc002kzc.3&hgg_prot=uc002kzc.3&hgg_start=33552587&hgg_type=knownGene&hgsid=276829_AgLhBsRel8nfe2xiJTuISnqK2g3X#:~:text=Human%20Gene%20C18orf21%20%28uc002kzc,Side%20The%20pictures%20above%20may)). No enzymatic motifs or active sites have been identified, and current databases report no defined Gene Ontology molecular function for this gene ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=No%20data%20available%20for%20Molecular,HOMER%20Transcription%20for%20C18orf21%20Gene)). The protein is sometimes referred to as “HBV XAg-transactivated protein 13” (XTP13) due to its initial identification as a gene upregulated by the Hepatitis B virus X protein ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=%2A%20HBV%20X,4)). This suggests a potential role in viral response or cell signaling under HBV infection, but the exact molecular mechanism remains unknown. High-throughput functional genomics screens have flagged C18orf21 in numerous contexts (e.g. hundreds of CRISPR knockout screens) ([orcs.thebiogrid.org](https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/83608#:~:text=CRISPR%20Screen%20Summary%20,Results%20Filter%20Reset%20Advanced%20Filters)), implying it may play a broadly important cellular role; however, no direct mechanistic studies have yet confirmed a specific biological activity for the protein.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
C18orf21 is a **predicted intracellular protein**, with no signal peptide or transmembrane regions, and it is not secreted ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/summary/gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20HsT3108%2C%20PNAS,i%7D%206)). Immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas indicate that C18orf21 is present in both the **cytoplasm and nucleus** of cells in multiple tissues ([v16.proteinatlas.org](https://v16.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/tissue#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20Evidence%20at%20protein,Uncertain%20based%20on%202%20antibodies)). Notably, antibody-based staining showed enrichment in the **nucleolus** of certain cell types ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=Human%20Protein%20Atlas%20)), though these observations are of uncertain reliability due to potential off-target effects of the antibodies ([v16.proteinatlas.org](https://v16.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/tissue#:~:text=DATA%20RELIABILITY%20Data%20reliability%20description,Uncertain%20based%20on%202%20antibodies)). **Computational localization predictions** (COMPARTMENTS database) also weakly suggest nuclear and mitochondrial presence ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=Compartment%20%20,0)). Overall, the protein appears to reside in the intracellular compartment (consistent with **GO:0005622** “intracellular”), potentially concentrating in nuclear substructures like the nucleolus. No Gene Ontology Cellular Component terms have been experimentally assigned yet for C18orf21 ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=Human%20Protein%20Atlas%20)).

## Biological Processes Involvement  
No specific biological processes have been definitively linked to C18orf21. Gene Ontology currently lists **no annotated biological process** terms for this gene ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=Gene%20Ontology%20%28GO%29%20,Process%20for%20C18orf21%20Gene)), reflecting its status as an uncharacterized open reading frame. The broad and ubiquitous expression (see below) hints that it could be involved in fundamental cellular processes, but experimental evidence is lacking. Some clues have emerged indirectly: the gene’s upregulation by HBV X protein hints at a possible role in virus-related cellular pathways or stress responses ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=%2A%20HBV%20X,4)). Additionally, large-scale interaction data (protein–protein interactions and CRISPR screens) imply C18orf21 might partake in basic cellular networks (e.g. protein complexes or pathways essential for cell viability) ([orcs.thebiogrid.org](https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/83608#:~:text=CRISPR%20Screen%20Summary%20,Results%20Filter%20Reset%20Advanced%20Filters)) ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/123699/summary/homo-sapiens/c18orf21.html#:~:text=,PTM%20Sites%2013)). Nonetheless, **no defined pathway** or process (e.g. metabolic or signaling pathway) has been confirmed for C18orf21 in the literature to date.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
C18orf21 has not been conclusively linked to any Mendelian disease, but some database entries note weak associations with certain conditions. GeneCards/MalaCards lists C18orf21 in connection with *Craniofacial Dysmorphism, Skeletal Anomalies, and Impaired Intellectual Development Syndrome 1 (CFSMR1)* and *Spinocerebellar Ataxia 36 (SCA36)* ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=C18orf21%20,1%20and%20Spinocerebellar%20Ataxia%2036)). These associations are based on genomic proximity or data mining and **do not imply a direct causal role**; for example, CFSMR1 is known to be caused by **TMCO1 mutations** rather than C18orf21 ([rarediseases.info.nih.gov](https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1210/craniofacial-dysmorphism-skeletal-anomalies-and-impaired-intellectual-development-1#:~:text=development%201%20,Any%20craniofacial%20dysmorphism%2C%20skeletal%20anomalies)), and SCA36 is caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the *NOP56* gene. To date, there are no reported pathogenic variants in C18orf21 causing human disease, and it is not listed in clinical variant databases as a disease gene. In functional studies, **no overt phenotype** has been published for C18orf21 knockdown or knockout in model organisms. However, the gene’s alias (HBV X-transactivated protein 13) indicates a potential connection to **viral pathology**: its expression is induced in HBV-infected cells ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=%2A%20HBV%20X,4)), which has prompted interest in whether C18orf21 might contribute to HBV-related conditions such as liver cancer. Overall, disease relevance remains speculative, with **no confirmed phenotypes** tied to C18orf21 dysfunction.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The C18orf21 protein is 220 amino acids in length and is categorized in UniProt as “**UPF0711 protein C18orf21**,” reflecting its membership in an uncharacterized protein family ([www.cloud-clone.com](https://www.cloud-clone.com/items/W513.html#:~:text=XTP13%20%28HBV%20XAg,23%20pairs%20of%20chromosomes%20in)). It contains a single recognizable domain, **DUF4674 (Domain of Unknown Function 4674)**, which spans most of the protein ([genome.bio.fsu.edu](https://genome.bio.fsu.edu/cgi-bin/hgGene?db=hg19&hgg_chrom=chr18&hgg_end=33559250&hgg_gene=uc002kzc.3&hgg_prot=uc002kzc.3&hgg_start=33552587&hgg_type=knownGene&hgsid=276829_AgLhBsRel8nfe2xiJTuISnqK2g3X#:~:text=Human%20Gene%20C18orf21%20%28uc002kzc,Side%20The%20pictures%20above%20may)). Beyond this DUF, no well-known protein motifs (enzymatic active sites, DNA-binding domains, etc.) have been identified. The protein is **hydrophilic and lacks transmembrane segments or signal peptides**, consistent with a non-secretory, intracellular role ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/summary/gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20HsT3108%2C%20PNAS,i%7D%206)). Prediction algorithms do not indicate any coiled-coil or globular domains of known function, classifying C18orf21 as structurally novel. Large-scale proteomic studies have detected C18orf21 and even catalogued several **post-translational modification sites** (e.g. potential phosphorylation sites), suggesting it is expressed and potentially regulated by common cellular kinases ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/summary/gene#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20,205)). In the absence of a solved 3D structure, **homology modeling** has limited value due to no close homologs with known structure. Thus, the protein’s structural features are mostly limited to the DUF4674 domain hallmark of the UPF0711 family, leaving the **biochemical function of this domain unknown**.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
**RNA expression** of C18orf21 is *broad and ubiquitous*. According to the Human Protein Atlas and GTEx data, the transcript is **expressed in all examined tissues** (RNA tissue category: “Expressed in all”) ([v16.proteinatlas.org](https://v16.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/tissue#:~:text=OrganExpressionAlphabetical%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20OVERVIEW%20HPA,HGNC%20Symbol)). This indicates C18orf21 is a housekeeping gene, expressed at baseline levels across diverse tissue types. Certain tissues or cell types may exhibit modestly higher expression – for example, RNA-seq data show measurable expression in brain regions (e.g. cerebellum) and other organs ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/brain/cerebellum#:~:text=,CE6SH)) – but no extreme tissue-specific enrichment has been reported. **Protein expression** data (immunohistochemistry) likewise show C18orf21 in many tissues, with a moderate, ubiquitous pattern: generally a mix of cytosolic and nuclear staining in cell types such as glandular cells and neurons ([v16.proteinatlas.org](https://v16.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/tissue#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20Evidence%20at%20protein,Uncertain%20based%20on%202%20antibodies)). It is not a secreted protein, and there is no evidence of it being restricted to any specialized cell type or developmental stage. Regulation of C18orf21 expression under specific conditions is not well-characterized. The gene was originally discovered due to **upregulation by HBV X protein** in hepatoma cells ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=%2A%20HBV%20X,4)), hinting that its promoter can respond to viral or transcription factor stimuli. Apart from the HBx context, C18orf21 does not appear among the most strongly inducible genes in common stress or signaling pathway datasets. Its promoter region has not been extensively studied, so the transcriptional regulation remains largely uncharted. In summary, C18orf21 is **constitutively expressed at low-to-moderate levels in most human tissues**, with any condition-specific regulation still to be determined.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
C18orf21 is conserved in vertebrates, indicating it performs a biologically important function maintained through evolution. Orthologs have been identified in mammals and other vertebrate classes – for instance, a clear homolog exists in **chicken (Gallus gallus)** ([ctdbase.org](https://ctdbase.org/detail.go?acc=83608&type=gene#:~:text=Synonyms%20%20,XTP13)), and sequence-similar genes are present in mouse and other species (often annotated as “C18orf21 homolog”). The human protein shares significant sequence identity with these orthologs, especially within the DUF4674 domain, suggesting evolutionary pressure to preserve its structure. Conservation appears strongest among **jawed vertebrates**, while more distant homologs in invertebrates are not evident, implying the UPF0711 family may be unique to higher eukaryotes. No close paralogs of C18orf21 are present in the human genome – it seems to be a singleton gene rather than part of a larger gene family. This one-to-one orthologous conservation pattern (human C18orf21 corresponding to a single ortholog in other species) is typical of genes encoding fundamental cellular proteins. Cross-species comparisons (e.g., in mouse or zebrafish databases) show that the gene’s exon-intron structure and coding sequence are retained, further supporting its functional importance. In functional genomics, **model organism data are sparse** for this gene, as knockouts have not been specifically reported. Nonetheless, the evolutionary retention of C18orf21 across diverse vertebrates implies it has a conserved role, even if that role is not yet understood.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
Experimental evidence for C18orf21 comes mainly from high-throughput studies and database annotations, as no dedicated research paper has fully characterized the gene. **Proteomic evidence** confirms that the C18orf21 protein is indeed expressed: peptides matching C18orf21 have been detected in mass-spectrometry studies ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/summary/gene#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20,205)), and the Human Protein Atlas classifies its evidence level as “protein level” (supported by Ezkurdia et al. 2014) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/summary/gene#:~:text=match%20at%20L94%20Protein%20evidence,8%20kDa%20No%200)). Two independent antibodies have been used to probe C18orf21 in tissues, showing intracellular localization (though with some staining inconsistencies) ([v16.proteinatlas.org](https://v16.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141428-C18orf21/tissue#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20Evidence%20at%20protein,Uncertain%20based%20on%202%20antibodies)). **Protein–protein interaction data** provide clues to function: BioGRID reports ~180 candidate interactors of C18orf21 identified by affinity purification-mass spectrometry experiments ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/123699/summary/homo-sapiens/c18orf21.html#:~:text=,PTM%20Sites%2013)). These interacting partners include various cellular proteins (one example is TMEM40, a transmembrane protein, captured in a proteomic pulldown ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/interaction/3144809#:~:text=Affinity%20Capture))), suggesting C18orf21 might reside in a multi-protein complex or network. While the significance of these interactions is not yet validated, such data hint that C18orf21 could interface with proteins involved in processes like membrane biology or chromatin regulation (given some interactors are nuclear proteins). On the genetic side, **CRISPR knockout screens** (e.g. from BioGRID ORCS) have repeatedly identified C18orf21 as a hit influencing cell survival or other phenotypes ([orcs.thebiogrid.org](https://orcs.thebiogrid.org/Gene/83608#:~:text=CRISPR%20Screen%20Summary%20,Results%20Filter%20Reset%20Advanced%20Filters)). This recurrent appearance implies that loss of C18orf21 can impact cellular fitness under various experimental conditions, although the specific phenotypic outcomes remain unreported. 

To date, there are no published studies focusing exclusively on C18orf21’s function. The gene is often mentioned in the context of broader datasets: for instance, it was noted as *HBV X-Transactivated Gene 13* in studies of Hepatitis B viral protein effects ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C18orf21#:~:text=%2A%20HBV%20X,4)). No Gene Ontology annotations for Biological Process or Molecular Function have been curated yet, reflecting the lack of direct experimentation. Curators and researchers rely on the **convergent evidence from omics data** to infer that C18orf21 is a real protein-coding gene with a likely housekeeping role. Ongoing large-scale projects, such as interactome mapping and knockout phenotyping, continue to shed light on this gene. As such data accumulate, they will inform initial GO annotations – for example, provisional assignments to broad terms like “protein binding” or cellular component terms like “nucleolus” may become justified by evidence. In summary, C18orf21 remains **poorly characterized in the literature**, with knowledge drawn from genomic and proteomic evidence. Further targeted experiments are needed to confirm its molecular function, the pathways it influences, and its potential relevance to human health.
