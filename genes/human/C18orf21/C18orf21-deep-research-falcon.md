## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q32NC0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=UPF0711 protein C18orf21; AltName: Full=HBV X-transactivated gene 13 protein; AltName: Full=HBV XAg-transactivated protein 13;
- **Gene Information:** Name=C18orf21; Synonyms=XTP13; ORFNames=PNAS-124, PNAS-131;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the UPF0711 family. .
- **Key Domains:** DUF4674. (IPR029779); DUF4674 (PF15719)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "C18orf21" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'C18orf21' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **C18orf21** (gene ID: C18orf21, UniProt: Q32NC0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

1. Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Format as a comprehensive research report with proper citations. Include URLs and publication dates where available.
Always prioritize recent, authoritative sources and provide specific citations for all major claims.

Research plan and verification steps
Objective 1: Verify target identity, organism, family/domains. The target is human C18orf21 (UniProt Q32NC0), also known as XTP13/HBV XAg-transactivated protein 13. It is annotated to the UPF0711 family and contains DUF4674 (PF15719). Recent functional studies consistently refer to human C18orf21 in Homo sapiens and converge on a role in the RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein complex, matching the UniProt metadata and ensuring we are analyzing the correct gene/protein. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)

Objective 2: Collect recent primary literature. Two independent 2025 bioRxiv preprints identify C18orf21 as a metazoan RNase MRP-specific protein (variously termed RMRPP1) based on multiple orthogonal lines of evidence. Although these are preprints, they currently provide the most detailed, convergent data on molecular function, localization, and interactions for human C18orf21. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4, liu2025compositionandrna pages 9-11, liu2025compositionandrna pages 6-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 28-32)

Objective 3–5: Synthesize function/localization/pathway roles; emphasize recent developments and data; draft comprehensive report with citations.

Comprehensive research report: C18orf21 (Q32NC0)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity: C18orf21 encodes an uncharacterized human protein historically annotated as “HBV X-transactivated gene 13” (XTP13). It belongs to the UPF0711 family and contains domain DUF4674 (PF15719). (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5)
- Primary molecular role: Multiple independent studies now identify C18orf21 as a specific, constitutive protein subunit of the metazoan RNase MRP ribonucleoprotein complex, not RNase P. Authors rename it RMRPP1 in one study. RNase MRP is an essential RNP enzyme that cleaves preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) during ribosome biogenesis. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, posted Jan 28, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5)
- Complex membership and distinction from RNase P: C18orf21 is reported as RNase MRP-specific and mutually exclusive with the RNase P-specific protein RPP21; C18orf21 IPs co-purify the nine protein subunits shared by RNase P and RNase MRP, while RPP21 IPs do not co-purify C18orf21. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 42-43)

2) Current understanding and mechanistic detail
- Structural relationships and placement in RNase MRP: Comparative structural analyses indicate similarity between human C18orf21 and yeast RNase MRP subunits (e.g., Snm1), and modeling places C18orf21 in proximity to RPP29 and RPP38 with predicted contacts to the RMRP catalytic RNA. A bacterial co-expression experiment yielded a stable C18orf21–RPP29 complex, supporting direct interaction. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9)
- RNase MRP composition in metazoans: An independent study identifies NEPRO and C18orf21 as the two metazoan-specific, constitutive RNase MRP subunits that distinguish it from RNase P; both are required to stabilize the catalytic RMRP RNA and for pre‑rRNA maturation and cell proliferation. (Liu et al., bioRxiv, posted Feb 23, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568) (liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4, liu2025compositionandrna pages 9-11)
- RNA binding and substrate specificity evidence: RNA immunoprecipitation shows that C18orf21 strongly enriches RNase MRP RNA (RMRP) but not RNase P RNA (RPPH1), congruent with an MRP-specific role. iCLIP mapping in the companion study supports RNase MRP cleavage activity at ITS1, and depletion of C18orf21 leads to compromised cleavage at an RNase MRP site and accumulation of early pre‑rRNA species. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; Liu et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 6-9)
- Subcellular localization: C18orf21 localizes to the nucleolus, consistent with a role in ribosomal RNA processing, as shown by C‑terminal GFP fusion imaging. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9)

3) Experimental evidence and statistics
- Physical interaction networks: Affinity purification–mass spectrometry (and comparative IPs versus RPP21) show that C18orf21 co-purifies the shared RNase P/MRP subunits while excluding RPP21, supporting complex specificity. RIP/RNA‑seq confirms RNA association specificity for RMRP. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 42-43, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 28-32)
- Genetic dependency and functional genomics: Co‑dependency analyses across large CRISPR datasets show that C18orf21 clusters with known RNase MRP/P components (e.g., RPP14) and with rRNA production genes; Perturb‑seq links C18orf21 perturbation to rRNA biogenesis phenotypes. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5)
- Depletion/KO phenotypes: C18orf21 depletion reduces RMRP catalytic RNA levels, compromises RNase MRP cleavage (including ITS1), causes accumulation of 47S/45S pre‑rRNA, and leads to proliferative arrest. These phenotypes are consistent with defective 40S ribosome biogenesis. (Liu et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568; Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360) (liu2025compositionandrna pages 6-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 9-11, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9)

4) Pathway and biochemical context
- Pathway placement: RNase MRP is central to pre‑rRNA processing and 40S ribosome biogenesis. C18orf21, as an MRP-specific protein, appears to stabilize the RMRP RNA and facilitate assembly/activity of the RNase MRP complex. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360; Liu et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)

5) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Functional annotation of previously uncharacterized proteins: These studies exemplify integrative approaches combining proteomics, structural predictions, RNA interactome mapping, and genetic co‑dependency to assign functions to uncharacterized human genes such as C18orf21. The immediate application is improved annotation of RNase MRP composition for cell biology and disease mechanism studies involving ribosome biogenesis. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; Liu et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)

6) Expert opinions and analysis
- Convergent conclusions from independent groups: Two independent research teams reach concordant conclusions that C18orf21 is an RNase MRP-specific subunit required for proper pre‑rRNA processing and cell proliferation, increasing confidence despite preprint status. Both report nucleolar localization and selective association with RMRP. (Smith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; Liu et al., bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.28.635360; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.21.639568) (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)
- Caveat: As of now, the most detailed sources are 2025 preprints. Peer‑reviewed confirmations will further solidify these assignments; nonetheless, the breadth of orthogonal evidence is notable. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)

7) Relevant statistics and data points
- Evidence modalities include: AP‑MS/IP specificity for shared RNase P/MRP subunits; reciprocal exclusion with RNase P‑specific RPP21; RIP‑seq enrichment of RMRP over RPPH1; co‑dependency with RPP14 and other shared subunits; nucleolar localization via GFP-tagged constructs; depletion phenotypes including reduced RMRP RNA levels, impaired ITS1 cleavage, accumulation of 47S/45S precursors, and proliferative arrest. Exact numeric values are not provided in the excerpts but the qualitative findings are consistent across studies. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 42-43, liu2025compositionandrna pages 6-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 28-32)

8) Disease associations
- Direct clinical associations for C18orf21 were not detailed in the retrieved excerpts. Given RNase MRP’s established essential role in rRNA processing, disruptions in its components can impact ribosome biogenesis; future peer‑reviewed studies may clarify disease links for C18orf21 specifically. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5)

9) Summary of function, localization, interactions
- Function: Non‑catalytic, MRP‑specific RNP subunit stabilizing RMRP RNA and enabling RNase MRP–mediated pre‑rRNA cleavage for 40S ribosome biogenesis. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)
- Complex membership: RNase MRP, not RNase P; mutually exclusive with RPP21. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 42-43)
- Localization: Nucleolar. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9)
- Interactions: Associates with the nine shared RNase P/MRP protein subunits; predicted and experimentally supported interaction with RPP29; forms complexes with NEPRO; binds RMRP RNA preferentially over RPPH1. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, liu2025compositionandrna pages 1-4)
- Domains/Family/Aliases: UPF0711 family; contains DUF4674; aliases XTP13/HBV XAg‑transactivated gene 13. (smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 5-9, smith2025moleculardeterminantsof pages 1-5)
