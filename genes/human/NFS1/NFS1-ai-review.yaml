description: NFS1 is the essential human cysteine desulfurase that serves as the central
  sulfur donor for iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis. This PLP-dependent enzyme
  catalyzes the desulfuration of L-cysteine to L-alanine, generating a protein-bound
  persulfide intermediate on the active-site cysteine (Cys381). The mitochondrial
  isoform functions as the catalytic heart of the core ISC (iron-sulfur cluster) assembly
  complex, forming a functional dimer that associates with LYRM4/ISD11 (for stabilization),
  acyl carrier protein NDUFAB1/ACP1 (regulatory), the scaffold protein ISCU2, frataxin
  (FXN, allosteric activator), and ferredoxin FDX2 (electron donor) to assemble [2Fe-2S]
  clusters de novo on ISCU2. These clusters are then transferred to recipient apoproteins
  via chaperones HSPA9/HSC20 and GLRX5. A cytoplasmic isoform (lacking the N-terminal
  60 residues) serves as sulfur donor for molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis
  via interaction with MOCS3 and may contribute to cytosolic tRNA thiolation. NFS1
  also localizes to the nucleus and has been detected at centrosomes.
