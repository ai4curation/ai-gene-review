### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9Y697
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cysteine desulfurase {ECO:0000305}; EC=2.8.1.7 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16527810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650437, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29097656}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NFS1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:18650437, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:15910}; Synonyms=NIFS {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9885568}; ORFNames=HUSSY-08;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the class-V pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent
- **Key Domains:** Aminotrans_V_dom. (IPR000192); Aminotrans_V_PyrdxlP_BS. (IPR020578); Cys_deSase_IscS. (IPR010240); Cysteine_dSase. (IPR016454); PyrdxlP-dep_Trfase. (IPR015424)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NFS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NFS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NFS1** (gene ID: NFS1, UniProt: Q9Y697) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human NFS1 (UniProt Q9Y697), a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent cysteine desulfurase that operates in the mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis machinery. Contemporary structural and mechanistic studies in human systems describe NFS1 as the catalytic heart of the core ISC complex that includes ISD11/LYRM4, the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP/NDUFAB1), the scaffold ISCU, and modulators/frataxin (FXN) and ferredoxin-2 (FDX2), consistent with the requested identity and domains for a class-V PLP enzyme (Homo sapiens) (https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8, Apr 2024; https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54585-4, Dec 2024; https: //doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1, Jan 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024twostagebindingof pages 1-2, heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).

Key concepts and definitions
- Primary biochemical function and substrate specificity: NFS1 catalyzes PLP-dependent desulfurization of L-cysteine to L-alanine, generating a protein-bound persulfide (-SSH) on its active-site cysteine (Cys381NFS1). The persulfide is transferred to Cys138ISCU during de novo [2Fe–2S] cluster assembly (https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8, Apr 2024; https: //doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1, Jan 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).
- Core ISC complex composition and roles: The mitochondrial core ISC complex contains NFS1–ISD11–ACP (often dimeric), the scaffold ISCU2, FXN, and the electron donor FDX2. ISD11 stabilizes NFS1; ACP stabilizes ISD11 and links ISC to mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis; FXN allosterically enhances sulfur transfer to ISCU; FDX2 provides electrons for persulfide reduction and cluster formation (https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8; https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54585-4) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024twostagebindingof pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: NFS1 operates in the mitochondrial matrix as part of the early (de novo) ISC machinery that initiates [2Fe–2S] cluster formation on ISCU; HSPA9/HSC20 chaperones then hand clusters to GLRX5 for downstream delivery (https: //doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1, Jan 2024) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Persulfide transfer mechanism resolved in human ISC: Cryo-EM snapshots and Mössbauer spectroscopy captured Fe-loaded intermediates showing sulfur transfer from Cys381NFS1 to Cys138ISCU, and defined FXN’s role in positioning assembly residues and shifting Fe coordination equilibria to accelerate transfer (Nature Communications, Apr 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 3-4).
- FDX2’s two-stage binding and competition with FXN: Human cryo-EM revealed FDX2 binds the core ISC complex in “distal” and “proximal” conformations and competes with FXN for overlapping interfaces; proximal FDX2 positions its [2Fe–2S] for rapid electron transfer to the ISCU site (Nature Communications, Dec 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54585-4) (steinhilper2024twostagebindingof pages 1-2).
- METTL17 as an Fe–S checkpoint for mitochondrial translation: Molecular Cell (Jan 2024) identified METTL17 as a mitoribosome-associated factor bearing a [4Fe–4S] cluster that serves as a checkpoint for mitochondrial small-subunit assembly and translation initiation; METTL17 abundance and function fall when Fe–S biogenesis (e.g., FXN) is perturbed, and cryo-EM visualized the [4Fe–4S] density on the SSU. The study reports extensive editing/perturbation of FXN and other genes; proteomics showed ISCU/NFS1/LYRM4 levels largely unchanged while METTL17 was depleted upon FXN loss (https: //doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.12.016, Jan 2024) (ast2024mettl17isan pages 3-5, ast2024mettl17isan pages 8-10, ast2024mettl17isan pages 6-8, ast2024mettl17isan pages 5-6).
- Mitoribosome Fe–S clusters and delivery nodes: Nucleic Acids Research (Oct 2023) demonstrated that the human mitoribosome contains [2Fe–2S] clusters and that the mtSSU assembly factor METTL17 receives a [4Fe–4S] via the ISCA1–NFU1 node; GLRX5–BOLA3 supplies [2Fe–2S] clusters. Loss of NFU1/BOLA3 or METTL17 attenuates mitochondrial protein synthesis (https: //doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842, Oct 2023) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 11-13, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2).
- Cysteine starvation and mitochondrial ISC resilience: In NSCLC, despite rapid cytosolic cysteine depletion, mitochondrial Fe–S synthesis and respiration persist via CHAC1-driven glutathione catabolism; perturbing Fe–S synthesis (including loss of NFS1) changes ferroptosis sensitivity under starvation (Nature Communications, May 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48695-2) (ward2024mitochondrialrespiratoryfunction pages 1-2, schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 3-4).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Disease genetics and diagnostics: The CIA targeting complex is essential for nucleocytoplasmic Fe–S metallation. Biallelic CIAO1 loss-of-function causes a neuromuscular disorder with compromised nuclear/cytosolic Fe–S enzyme activities, reversible by CIAO1 complementation—connecting mitochondrial ISC output to nuclear/cytosolic enzyme maturation in patients (JCI, Jun 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1172/jci179559) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).
- Clinical-pathway integration in mitochondriopathies: The BOLA3–NFU1 and GLRX5 nodes that bridge mitochondrial ISC to mitoribosome assembly and translation illuminate the molecular basis of multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes (MMDS) and enable mechanistic interpretation of patient fibroblast phenotypes (Nucleic Acids Research, Oct 2023, https: //doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 11-13, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2).
- Sulfur trafficking beyond Fe–S clusters: Human TUM1/MPST interacts with NFS1 and MOCS3; TUM1 knockout reduces Moco-dependent sulfite oxidase activity and cytosolic tRNA 2-thiolation, with combinatorial NFS1–TUM1–MOCS3 enhancing Moco compared to NFS1–MOCS3 alone (Biomolecules, Jan 2023, https: //doi.org/10.3390/biom13010144) (ogunkola2023thehumanmercaptopyruvate pages 16-17).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- ISC and ferroptosis in cancer: A 2023 review synthesizes evidence that NFS1 supports tumor survival by maintaining ISC homeostasis; its inhibition (genetic or pharmacologic) induces iron-starvation responses and sensitizes cancers to ferroptosis, particularly under cystine limitation and in hypoxic/oxygenated microenvironments (Cancers, May 2023, https: //doi.org/10.3390/cancers15102694) (lee2023targetingironsulfurclusters pages 5-6).
- Early ISC machinery architecture and handoff: Reviews summarize NFS1 stabilization by ISD11, coupling to ACP, and downstream HSPA9/HSC20 chaperone-mediated transfer to GLRX5 and recipients (Inorganics, Jan 2024, https: //doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Enzymatic and structural kinetics: Direct visualization of sulfur transfer and Fe coordination equilibria in human ISC now underpins rates and sequence of persulfide movement (Nature Communications, Apr 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 3-4).
- FDX2–FXN competition and conformational states: Two-state FDX2 binding (distal/proximal) with overlap to FXN sites explains regulation of electron delivery; structural validation through mutagenesis strengthens the model (Nature Communications, Dec 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54585-4) (steinhilper2024twostagebindingof pages 1-2).
- Proteomic impact of Fe–S impairment: In FXN-edited human cells, 33 of 34 detected Fe–S proteins were downregulated, while NFS1/ISCU/LYRM4 protein levels were relatively stable; METTL17 was strongly depleted, linking Fe–S status to mitoribosome assembly (Molecular Cell, Jan 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.12.016) (ast2024mettl17isan pages 3-5, ast2024mettl17isan pages 8-10).
- Cancer-targeting pharmacology: A first-in-class selective human NFS1 inhibitor (Compound 53) reduced A549 lung cancer cell proliferation with IC50 ≈ 16.3 ± 1.92 µM, disrupted Fe–S biogenesis, raised cellular iron, and synergized with a glutathione reductase inhibitor to induce ferroptosis (IJMS, Mar 2025, https: //doi.org/10.3390/ijms26062782) (zhu2025identificationofa pages 1-2).

Pathway integration and cellular context
- Early de novo assembly: NFS1’s Cys381 persulfide is transferred to Cys138ISCU; FDX2 reduces the ISCU persulfide; dimerization of ISCU2 enables [2Fe–2S] formation; HSPA9/HSC20 and GLRX5 manage client transfer (Nature Communications 2024; Inorganics 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).
- Late mitochondrial steps and delivery: [2Fe–2S] clusters are converted/delivered to [4Fe–4S] clients through ISCA1/2, NFU1, and BOLA3 nodes; these steps connect directly to mitoribosomal assembly (Nucleic Acids Research 2023) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 11-13, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2).
- Cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S maturation: The CIA targeting complex (CIAO1–MMS19–FAM96B) docks [4Fe–4S] targets; patient genetics demonstrate human disease upon CIA disruption (JCI 2024) (heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4).

Cellular physiology and stress integration
- Cysteine limitation: Under extracellular cystine deprivation, mitochondria preserve Fe–S-dependent respiration via glutathione catabolism; disrupting the early ISC (including NFS1) reprograms sensitivity to ferroptosis in this context (Nat Commun, May 2024, https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48695-2) (ward2024mitochondrialrespiratoryfunction pages 1-2, schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 3-4).
- Oxidative/redox checkpoints at the ribosome: Redox-sensitive Fe–S clusters on the mitoribosome and in METTL17 likely attenuate mitochondrial translation under oxidative stress, providing a feedback checkpoint linking Fe–S and ROS to protein synthesis (Nucleic Acids Research 2023; Molecular Cell 2024) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 11-13, zhong2023bola3andnfu1 pages 1-2, ast2024mettl17isan pages 8-10).

Expert synthesis: NFS1’s role, localization, and partners
- NFS1 is the human mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase at the core of de novo ISC biogenesis; it forms a functional assembly with ISD11/LYRM4 and ACP (stabilization), binds ISCU (scaffold), and is regulated through FXN (allosteric activation) and FDX2 (electron supply). Its catalytic cycle involves PLP chemistry on L-cysteine and mobile-loop delivery of a persulfide to ISCU. These features integrate NFS1 into mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitoribosome assembly, and broader cellular sulfur metabolism, including links to tRNA thiolation via sulfurtransferases (https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8; https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54585-4; https: //doi.org/10.20944/preprints202312.1414.v1; https: //doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad842; https: //doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.12.016) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024twostagebindingof pages 1-2, heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4, dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, ast2024mettl17isan pages 3-5).

Open translational directions and implementations
- Oncology: NFS1 is an anti-ferroptosis factor in several tumors; suppression or inhibition may synergize with cyst(e)ine restriction or redox stress to induce ferroptosis. The first selective small-molecule NFS1 inhibitor (2025) provides a starting chemical tool; preclinical strategies combining NFS1 inhibition with agents that elevate ROS or impede cystine import warrant evaluation (Cancers 2023; IJMS 2025) (lee2023targetingironsulfurclusters pages 5-6, zhu2025identificationofa pages 1-2).
- Diagnostics/biomarkers: Defects across ISC–CIA axes (e.g., GLRX5, BOLA3, NFU1, CIAO1) have characteristic biochemical signatures; mechanistic mapping from recent work on METTL17 and mitoribosome Fe–S centers suggests measurable translational deficits and may guide biomarker development (Nucleic Acids Research 2023; JCI 2024; Molecular Cell 2024) (dohnalek2025evolucemitochondriálníbiogeneze. pages 24-27, heffner2024tipofthe pages 2-4, ast2024mettl17isan pages 8-10).
