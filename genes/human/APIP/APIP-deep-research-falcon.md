## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q96GX9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03116}; Short=MTRu-1-P dehydratase {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03116}; EC=4.2.1.109 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03116, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24367089}; AltName: Full=APAF1-interacting protein {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03116}; Short=hAPIP;
- **Gene Information:** Name=APIP {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03116}; ORFNames=CGI-29;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the aldolase class II family. MtnB subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Aldolase_II/adducin_N. (IPR001303); Aldolase_II/adducin_N_sf. (IPR036409); MethylthioRu-1-P_deHdtase_MtnB. (IPR017714); Salvage_MtnB_euk. (IPR027514); Aldolase_II (PF00596)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "APIP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'APIP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **APIP** (gene ID: APIP, UniProt: Q96GX9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Gene/protein identity verification
APIP (UniProt Q96GX9) encodes the human 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase (MtnB; EC 4.2.1.109), historically identified as “Apaf-1–interacting protein.” Foundational and structural studies conclusively assign APIP to the eukaryotic MtnB subfamily of aldolase class II enzymes with a zinc-dependent active site, in Homo sapiens. No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified within the retrieved evidence (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary biochemical function and reaction: APIP catalyzes the dehydration of 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate (MTRu-1-P) to the 2,3-diketo intermediate (commonly detected via formation of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate equivalents through coupled assays), constituting the MtnB step of the methionine salvage (MTA) pathway that recycles 5′-methylthioadenosine sulfur to methionine (EC 4.2.1.109). Knockdown of APIP impairs growth when methionine is replaced by MTA and lowers cellular methionine, demonstrating requirement for methionine recycling from MTA in human cells (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052877; published 28 Dec 2012) (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 5-5, camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3, camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 3-4).
- Structural class and domains: APIP adopts a class II aldolase-like fold and assembles as a tetramer. A 2.0-Å crystal structure (PDB 4M6R) reveals an active-site zinc coordinated by histidines and substrate oxygens; Glu139 functions as a catalytic acid/base, with additional important residues Cys97 and His115. Kinetic parameters measured in vitro are Km ≈ 9.32 μM and Vmax ≈ 1.39 μmol·min−1·mg−1 for the MtnB reaction (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; online 23 Dec 2013; print 2014) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 1-2, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6).
- Cellular localization and isoforms: Immunofluorescence showed predominant cytosolic staining in HeLa cells. Two APIP transcript isoforms (long 729 bp and short 628 bp) were cloned; the short isoform lacks N-terminal residues required for enzymatic activity (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052877; 28 Dec 2012) (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Apoptosome regulation context: A 2024 expert review synthesizes regulators of apoptotic decision making, including modulators of Apaf-1 and apoptosome activity, and situates APIP among Apaf-1–interacting proteins of relevance in oncology. While not an APIP-specific primary study, it provides updated expert analysis connecting apoptosome modulation to disease (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14010136; Jan 2024) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8).
- Note on scarcity of 2023–2024 APIP-specific primary data: Within the retrieved evidence, no new peer-reviewed primary articles from 2023–2024 directly revising APIP’s enzymology or human functional assignment were identified. The field continues to reference the 2012–2014 primary studies for APIP’s enzymatic identity and structure (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Pathway and metabolic context: APIP’s MtnB step is essential for efficient methionine salvage from MTA, relevant to cell proliferation in methionine-limited or MTA-rich contexts and to host–pathogen interactions where host methionine availability constrains intracellular bacterial growth (Shigella methionine auxotroph proliferation is impeded in APIP-knockdown host cells) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052877; 28 Dec 2012) (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 5-5, camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3).
- Cell-death modulation: APIP competes with procaspase-9 for Apaf-1 binding, inhibiting apoptosome-driven caspase-9 activation and offering cytoprotection in hypoxia/ischemia models; APIP’s enzymatic activity is dispensable for anti-apoptotic effects under hypoxia/etoposide, but required for suppression of caspase‑1–dependent pyroptosis, linking sulfur metabolic flux to inflammasome outputs (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 23 Dec 2013/2014; URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m405747200; Sep 2004) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6, cho2004inducedinhibitionof pages 1-1).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural biochemistry and apoptosis/pyroptosis linkage: Kang et al. provide authoritative structural and mechanistic analysis demonstrating the active-site organization, mutational effects (Q96A ~36% activity; C97A/E139A/H115A <6%), and the differential requirement of enzymatic activity for pyroptosis vs apoptosis inhibition—an observation shaping how APIP is interpreted as both a metabolic enzyme and a signaling modulator (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 2013/2014) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3).
- Apoptosome modulation landscape (2024 review): The Biomolecules review integrates Apaf‑1 regulators, with APIP included among proteins that can influence apoptosome assembly/activity, underscoring disease relevance in cancer and therapy resistance contexts (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14010136; Jan 2024) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Enzyme kinetics: Km ≈ 9.32 μM; Vmax ≈ 1.39 μmol·min−1·mg−1 for the MTRu‑1‑P dehydratase reaction; tetrameric assembly validated by crystallography and solution studies (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 2013/2014) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 1-2, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3).
- Mutational impacts on catalysis: Q96A retains ~36.2% activity; C97A, E139A, H115A each <6% residual activity, supporting roles in substrate positioning and acid/base catalysis (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 2013/2014) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6).
- Localization and isoform dependence: Cytosolic localization; short N-terminally truncated isoform inactive in assays, indicating N-terminus importance for function (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052877; 28 Dec 2012) (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3).
- Disease associations (expression): Down-regulation of APIP reported in non-small cell lung carcinoma tissue cohorts (URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2012.1397; Mar 2012) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3). Additional tumor types with altered APIP expression are noted in structural/biochemical context discussions (e.g., squamous carcinomas), though cohort-level quantitation resides in cited datasets within those studies (URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 2013/2014) (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3).

Mechanistic summary of signaling and biochemical pathways
- Methionine salvage pathway (MTA cycle): APIP (MtnB) converts MTRu‑1‑P to the 2,3‑diketo‑5‑methylthiopentyl‑1‑phosphate intermediate, enabling subsequent steps that regenerate methionine from MTA. Loss of APIP curtails methionine recycling and cell growth under methionine replacement by MTA (URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052877; 2012) (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 5-5, camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3, camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 3-4).
- Apoptosome/caspase pathway: APIP binds Apaf‑1 and competes with procaspase‑9 to attenuate apoptosome activation, protecting cells from mitochondrial pathway apoptosis under hypoxia/ischemia and genotoxic stress; in parallel, APIP’s enzymatic role modulates caspase‑1–dependent pyroptosis, making APIP a dual-function node at the metabolism–cell death interface (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m405747200; 2004 and https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1308768111; 2013/2014) (cho2004inducedinhibitionof pages 1-1, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6).

Limitations and open questions
- 2023–2024 primary updates on APIP’s human enzymology, structure, or new interactors are limited within available evidence. The 2024 review supports continuing relevance of apoptosome modulators but does not overturn earlier APIP findings. Further population-level genomics and disease association studies focused specifically on APIP remain needed (kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8).

*Table: Concise summary table of foundational and recent sources for human APIP (Q96GX9), showing main findings, topics, journals, and DOIs to support functional annotation and literature citations.*

Conclusion
Human APIP (Q96GX9) is a zinc-dependent class II aldolase family enzyme that executes the MtnB step of the methionine salvage pathway and, through interaction with Apaf‑1, modulates apoptosome activity and apoptosis. Structural, biochemical, and cellular evidence converge to define its catalytic mechanism, cellular localization, and dual roles in apoptosis and pyroptosis. Recent expert reviews (2024) reaffirm the importance of apoptosome regulators, including APIP, in disease, while primary APIP-specific advances since 2014 were not identified within the retrieved sources (camille2012functionalidentificationof pages 1-3, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 1-2, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 4-6, cho2004inducedinhibitionof pages 1-1, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 2-3, kang2014structuralandbiochemical pages 8-8).
