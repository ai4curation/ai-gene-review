description: >-
  APIP (also known as MtnB) is a zinc-dependent methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase
  that catalyzes the dehydration of MTRu-1-P to 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate
  in the methionine salvage pathway. This is its primary evolved enzymatic function.
  The
  protein also has a moonlighting function as an inhibitor of apoptosis through competitive
  binding to Apaf-1, which is independent of its enzymatic activity. Additionally,
  APIP
  inhibits caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in an enzyme-activity-dependent manner.
  The
  protein exists as a homotetramer and is localized in the cytoplasm.

        APIP functions as MtnB in the methionine salvage pathway. This is its primary
        enzymatic function. Knockdown studies showed that "APIP depletion specifically
        impaired the capacity of cells to grow" when methionine was replaced by MTA
        (PMID:23285211). Ko et al. (2012) confirmed "The role of APIP in methionine

        it INHIBITS apoptosis as a moonlighting function separate from its enzymatic

        death inhibitor independently of its MtnB enzyme activity for apoptosis induced
        by either hypoxia or etoposide" (PMID:24367089). The gene was named "APAF1-interacting
        protein" because it binds Apaf-1 CARD and competes with procaspase-9, thereby
        inhibiting apoptosome formation. GO:0006915 (apoptotic process) implies direct
        participation in apoptosis, which is inappropriate for an inhibitor.

      APIP is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of
      5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate (MTRu-1-P) to 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate
      in the methionine salvage pathway. This is the primary evolved function of APIP,
      supported by structural data (PDB 4M6R), enzyme kinetics (Km = 9.32 uM), and
      functional studies demonstrating that APIP knockdown impairs methionine recycling
      from MTA.
