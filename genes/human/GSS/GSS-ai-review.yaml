description: Glutathione synthetase (GSS) is an ATP-dependent ligase that 
  catalyzes the second and final step of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, joining
  glycine to gamma-glutamyl-cysteine to form the tripeptide glutathione. GSS 
  functions as a homodimer and requires magnesium as a cofactor. The enzyme 
  belongs to the ATP-grasp superfamily and contains the glutathione synthase 
  domain characteristic of the eukaryotic GSH synthase family. GSS operates in 
  the cytosol where de novo GSH synthesis occurs. Glutathione is the most 
  abundant intracellular thiol antioxidant and is essential for protection 
  against oxidative damage, amino acid transport, detoxification of xenobiotics,
  and maintenance of protein sulfhydryl groups. GSS can also utilize 
  2-aminobutyrate as an alternative substrate to produce ophthalmate. Deficiency
  in GSS causes glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSSD), an autosomal recessive
  disorder characterized by 5-oxoprolinuria, metabolic acidosis, hemolytic 
  anemia, and in severe cases, neurological dysfunction.

      summary: IBA annotation for glutathione binding supported by phylogenetic 
        analysis. Crystal structure of human GSS (PMID:10369661) demonstrates 
        direct binding of glutathione as a product of the reaction, confirming 
        this molecular function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Glutathione binding is a core function of GSS as the enzyme binds 
        its product glutathione. The crystal structure at 2.1 A resolution shows
        GSS in complex with ADP, magnesium ions, and glutathione 
        (PMID:10369661). This IBA annotation is consistent with experimental IDA
        evidence.

        biosynthetic enzymes GCL and GSS operate.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Cytosolic localization is the established site of de novo GSH 
        synthesis. Multiple lines of evidence including Reactome pathway data 
        and biochemical studies confirm that GSS functions in the cytosol. This 
        is consistent with the known pathway where GSH is synthesized in the 
        cytosol and then distributed to other organelles.

      action: ACCEPT

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core biological process for GSS. The enzyme is part of 
        the two-step GSH biosynthesis pathway where GCL catalyzes step 1 
        (formation of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine) and GSS catalyzes step 2

        screen for telomere signaling regulators.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: This annotation to the generic term 'protein binding' provides 
        little functional insight. The interaction with TERF1 (telomeric repeat 
        binding factor 1) detected in a high-throughput screen is not validated 
        by targeted experiments and has unclear biological significance. GSS is 
        a metabolic enzyme with no established role in telomere biology. The 
        UniProt interaction database lists this with only 2 experiments. This 
        likely represents a non-specific or artifactual interaction.

    review:
      summary: TAS annotation for amino acid metabolic process. GSS participates
        in glutathione metabolism which involves amino acid substrates glycine, 
        cysteine, and glutamate.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While technically accurate as GSH biosynthesis involves amino acid
        metabolism, this is an overly broad annotation. The more specific term 
        GO:0006750 (glutathione biosynthetic process) better captures the 
        biological process in which GSS participates. The amino acid metabolic 
        process annotation does not add information beyond what is captured by 
        the more specific term.

    review:
      summary: TAS annotation for response to oxidative stress based on a study 
        of oxidative damage in neutrophils from GSS-deficient patients.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The referenced study (PMID:465367) examines the consequences of 
        GSS deficiency on neutrophil function under oxidative stress. The study 
        shows that GSH-deficient cells have impaired protection against peroxide
        generated during phagocytosis. However, this reflects the downstream 
        consequence of GSH deficiency rather than a direct role of GSS in stress
        response signaling. GSS produces GSH which then provides antioxidant 
        protection, but GSS itself does not directly respond to or sense 
        oxidative stress. This annotation is not wrong but represents an 
        indirect relationship.

    review:
      summary: TAS annotation for nervous system development based on 
        neurological dysfunction observed in severe GSS deficiency patients.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The referenced study describes neurological dysfunction in severe 
        GSS deficiency cases, indicating the importance of adequate GSH for 
        nervous system development/function. However, this reflects the 
        phenotypic consequences of GSS deficiency rather than a direct molecular
        role in nervous system development. GSS produces GSH which is required 
        for general cellular antioxidant protection including in neurons, but 
        GSS is not a specific developmental regulator. This is an indirect 
        annotation based on disease phenotype rather than direct molecular 
        function.

      label: glutathione synthase activity
    description: GSS catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of glycine to 
      gamma-glutamyl-cysteine to form glutathione 
      (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine), completing the second and final step 
      of de novo glutathione biosynthesis. This is the defining enzymatic 
      activity of the protein, supported by biochemical characterization 
      (PMID:7646467), structural analysis (PMID:10369661), and phylogenetic 
      conservation (IBA). The enzyme has a specific activity of 1.73 
      micromol/min per mg protein and can also utilize 2-aminobutyrate as an 
      alternative acceptor to produce ophthalmate.
