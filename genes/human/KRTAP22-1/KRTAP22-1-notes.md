# KRTAP22-1 notes

## Session 2026-10-24 (family-batched KRTAP review)

- No OpenScientist or other deep-research report exists for this gene; deep research was not run (per batch instructions). Literature found by PubMed search and cached with `just fetch-pmid`.

- Family context: KAPs are hair-fibre matrix proteins cross-linked to hair keratin IFs [PMID:18721477 "are essential for the formation of rigid and resistant hair shafts through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with the abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins or hydrophobic interactions with keratins"]; [PMID:16382671 "play crucial roles in forming a strong hair shaft through a cross-linked network with keratin intermediate filaments (KIF)"].

- Description used: KRTAP22-1 (keratin-associated protein 22-1, KAP22.1) is a very small (48 aa) high glycine-tyrosine (HGT) hair keratin-associated protein of the KAP22 family, encoded in the chromosome 21q22.1 KAP gene domain. HGT KAPs are matrix proteins of the hair fibre cortex that associate with hair keratin intermediate filaments. In sheep the orthologous KRTAP22-1 is polymorphic and its variants are associated with wool yield and fibre curvature.

- Decisions (family-consistent): bare GO:0005515 rows REMOVE (HuRI/Y2H promiscuous preys); cytosol (ARBA IEA, Reactome TAS) KEEP_AS_NON_CORE; keratin filament ACCEPT or NEW; structural molecule activity MODIFY (or NEW) to GO:0030281 structural constituent of cutaneous appendage (verified in OLS; is_a GO:0005198; definition covers hairs). Hair keratins are conventionally IBA-annotated to GO:0030280 skin epidermis instead; flagged as a consistency question.

- NEW BP GO:0031424 keratinization (participation as structural/scaffold constituent of the cornified hair shaft [Reactome:R-HSA-6809663 "involved in the formation of cornified, resilient hair shafts"]; comparator check: KRT81/KRT85/KRT86 carry it by IBA (QuickGO), KRTAP6-3 and sheep KRTAP6-1 by IEA). Hair cycle / hair follicle development deliberately not used. Kept consistent with the sibling KRTAP batches.
