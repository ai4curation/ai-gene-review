description: LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2) is a large multi-domain ROCO family protein with dual enzymatic activities - a serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) and a GTPase (EC 3.6.5.-). The protein contains ARM/ANK/LRR repeats, ROC (Ras of complex proteins) GTPase domain, COR (C-terminal of ROC) domain, kinase domain, and WD40 repeats. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases (primarily Rab8A, Rab10, Rab12, Rab29) at their switch II regions, regulating endolysosomal trafficking and ciliogenesis. It is predominantly cytosolic but dynamically recruited to Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes where its Rab substrates reside. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PARK8).

    label: intracellular signal transduction
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: LRRK2 is a multi-domain ROCO protein kinase that phosphorylates Rab GTPases (Rab8, Rab10, Rab12, Rab29) to regulate endolysosomal trafficking and ciliogenesis. This broad BP term accurately captures its signaling role.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: LRRK2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase that transduces signals by phosphorylating Rab GTPases, thereby regulating downstream cellular processes. The IBA annotation is appropriate as LRRK2 is clearly involved in intracellular signal transduction via its kinase and GTPase activities.
