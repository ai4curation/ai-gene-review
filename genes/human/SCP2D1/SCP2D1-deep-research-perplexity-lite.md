### Comprehensive Research Report: SCP2D1 (Q9UJQ7) Gene in Human

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

#### 1. **Gene and Protein Overview**

**Gene Name:** SCP2D1 (SCP2 Sterol Binding Domain Containing 1)  
**Gene ID:** 6342 (NCBI Gene)  
**UniProt Accession:** Q9UJQ7  
**Protein Name:** SCP2 sterol-binding domain-containing protein 1  
**Aliases:** SCP2D1, SCP2 sterol-binding domain-containing protein 1  
**Species:** Homo sapiens (human)  

SCP2D1 is a protein-coding gene that encodes a protein containing a sterol-binding domain, structurally and functionally related to the sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) family. The gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p32.3) and is distinct from the SCP2 gene, which encodes both SCP2 and SCPx proteins through alternative transcription initiation sites [6, 14].

---

#### 2. **Molecular Function**

SCP2D1 is characterized by the presence of a **sterol-binding domain**, which is a hallmark of proteins involved in lipid transport and metabolism. The sterol-binding domain is responsible for the interaction with various lipids, including cholesterol, fatty acids, and phospholipids [7, 13].

- **Lipid Binding:** SCP2D1 binds sterols and other lipids, facilitating their intracellular transport and distribution. The sterol-binding domain is structurally similar to that of SCP2, suggesting overlapping functions in lipid trafficking [7, 13].
- **Protein–Protein Interactions:** SCP2D1 interacts with other proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. For example, it has been shown to interact with caveolin-1, a protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis and signaling pathways [1]. The interaction between SCP2D1 and caveolin-1 is mediated by the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 (aa 34–40), which is distinct from the classic scaffolding domain [1].

---

#### 3. **Biological Processes**

SCP2D1 is involved in several key biological processes related to lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis:

- **Lipid Transport:** SCP2D1 facilitates the intracellular transport of sterols and other lipids, contributing to cholesterol retention and the regulation of signaling lipids such as phosphoinositides and sphingolipids [1, 2].
- **Cholesterol Homeostasis:** By interacting with caveolin-1 and other lipid-binding proteins, SCP2D1 plays a role in maintaining cholesterol levels within the cell, particularly in plasma membrane domains like caveolae [1].
- **Metabolic Regulation:** SCP2D1 is implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways, including those involved in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Recent studies have shown that SCP2D1 promotes the development of atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism in vascular cells [2].

---

#### 4. **Cellular Localization**

SCP2D1 is primarily localized in the **cytoplasm**, but it can also be found in other organelles such as the **endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria** [2, 4]. The differential localization of SCP2D1 is due to the exposure of its C-terminal peroxisome targeting sequence (AKL), which is more accessible in the 15-kDa pro-SCP2 form but less so in the mature 13-kDa SCP2 form [2, 4]. This suggests that SCP2D1 may have a broad-scale lipid trafficking activity, similar to other members of the SCP2 family.

---

#### 5. **Protein Domains**

- **Sterol-Binding Domain:** The primary functional domain of SCP2D1 is the sterol-binding domain, which is responsible for lipid binding and transport [7, 13].
- **N-Terminal Domain:** The N-terminal region of SCP2D1 contains an amphipathic α-helix, which is involved in membrane interaction and lipid transfer [3]. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to bind to membranes rich in anionic phospholipids and cholesterol [3].

---

#### 6. **Known Interactions**

- **Caveolin-1:** SCP2D1 interacts with caveolin-1 through a novel N-terminal recognition domain (aa 34–40), which is distinct from the classic scaffolding domain. This interaction is important for cholesterol retention and the regulation of signaling lipids at plasma membrane caveolae [1].
- **Other Lipid-Binding Proteins:** SCP2D1 may interact with other proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) and sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) [6, 14].

---

#### 7. **Disease Associations**

- **Corneal Dystrophy, Posterior Polymorphous, 1:** SCP2D1 has been associated with corneal dystrophy, posterior polymorphous, 1, a rare genetic disorder affecting the cornea [9].
- **Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases:** SCP2D1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including atherosclerosis. Recent studies have shown that SCP2D1 promotes the development of atherosclerosis by regulating lipid metabolism in vascular cells [2].

---

#### 8. **Recent Developments and Expert Opinions**

- **2023–2024 Research:** Recent studies have highlighted the role of SCP2D1 in lipid metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The interaction between SCP2D1 and caveolin-1 has been further characterized, providing new insights into the mechanisms of cholesterol retention and signaling lipid regulation [1, 2].
- **Expert Opinions:** Experts in the field of lipid metabolism and cellular signaling emphasize the importance of SCP2D1 in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in diseases related to lipid metabolism [2, 4].

---

#### 9. **Relevant Statistics and Data**

- **Tissue Distribution:** SCP2D1 is ubiquitously present in almost all mammalian tissues, with the highest abundance in tissues involved in cholesterol transport and oxidation, such as the liver, intestine, heart, testis, ovary, and adrenal [2].
- **Intracellular Localization:** Overexpression of SCP2D1 leads to a marked localization in peroxisomes, but nearly half of the protein is localized in extraperoxisomal sites, including the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and mitochondria [2, 4].
