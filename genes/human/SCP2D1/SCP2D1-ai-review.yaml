description: SCP2 sterol-binding domain-containing protein 1 is a poorly characterized intracellular lipid
  carrier protein containing a sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) domain. The protein is predicted to function
  as a non-specific lipid transfer protein that binds cholesterol, fatty acids, and fatty acyl-CoA in
  a large hydrophobic cavity and shuttles these lipids through the cytosol between cellular membranes.
  Unlike its paralog SCP2 which localizes to peroxisomes, SCP2D1 lacks a peroxisomal targeting sequence
  and is predicted to function exclusively in the cytosol. Expression is highly restricted to testis tissue
  (~53-fold enrichment over other tissues), suggesting a specialized role in male reproduction, potentially
  in spermatogenesis or testicular steroidogenesis. No direct experimental characterization of SCP2D1
  exists; all functional annotations are inferred from domain homology to the well-studied SCP2 protein.
  The protein has not been detected by proteomics (evidence at transcript level only).

  review:
    summary: Phylogenetic inference predicts SCP2D1 localizes to cytosol. Consistent with lack of peroxisomal
      targeting sequence and predictions from subcellular localization tools. Unlike paralog SCP2 which
      has peroxisomal localization, SCP2D1 is predicted to function exclusively in the cytoplasmic compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Appropriate cellular compartment annotation supported by phylogenetic inference, domain analysis,
      and absence of targeting sequences for other organelles.
