description: >-
  HSPA1B (Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B, also known as HSP72/HSP70-2) encodes
  a stress-inducible member of the HSP70 molecular chaperone family. The protein
  encoded by HSPA1B is >99% identical to HSPA1A (HSP70-1) and functions as an
  ATP-dependent foldase chaperone. It plays a pivotal role in the protein quality
  control system, assisting in the correct folding of newly synthesized
  polypeptides, refolding of misfolded proteins, prevention of protein
  aggregation, and targeting of terminally misfolded proteins for proteasomal
  degradation. Its chaperone cycle is regulated by co-chaperones including
  J-domain proteins (HSP40s/DNAJs), nucleotide exchange factors (BAG1/2/3,
  HSPH1), and TPR domain co-chaperones (HOPX, STUB1/CHIP). HSPA1B also
  participates in centrosome function during mitosis, regulation of apoptosis,
  and various signaling pathways including NF-kappaB and NOD2 signaling.
