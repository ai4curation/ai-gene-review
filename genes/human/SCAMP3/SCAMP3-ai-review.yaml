description: SCAMP3 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 3) is a tetraspanning integral membrane
  protein that functions as a key regulator of endosomal trafficking and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis.
  The protein contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain with functionally critical motifs including a
  PPAY motif that binds WW-domain E3 ubiquitin ligases (NEDD4 family) and a PSAP motif that mediates interaction
  with the ESCRT-I component TSG101. SCAMP3 localizes to the Golgi apparatus, early endosomes, and a subset
  of late endosomes. It plays a central role in regulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking
  fate, balancing receptor recycling versus lysosomal degradation through ESCRT-dependent sorting into
  intralumenal vesicles. SCAMP3 is multi-monoubiquitinated and is itself phosphorylated by EGFR at Tyr86,
  which promotes EGFR-SCAMP3 interaction and EGFR degradation. SCAMP3 is essential for WW domain-activated
  extracellular vesicle (WAEV) budding, positioning it as a critical factor in exosome/EV biogenesis.

    label: exocytosis
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation derives from phylogenetic inference across the SCAMP family. While SCAMP3
      is involved in vesicular trafficking pathways, the primary experimental evidence supports its role
      in endosomal sorting and MVB biogenesis rather than classical exocytosis. The original SCAMP1/2
      literature focused on post-Golgi recycling carriers, but SCAMP3-specific studies emphasize EGFR
      trafficking and intralumenal vesicle formation (PMID:19158374).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term 'exocytosis' is too general and does not capture the specific role of SCAMP3. The
      deep research indicates SCAMP3 functions primarily in endosomal sorting, MVB biogenesis, and regulation
      of receptor recycling vs degradation rather than classical exocytosis. A more appropriate term would
      be 'post-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport' (which already exists as another annotation) or 'endosomal
      transport'.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation is consistent with experimental findings. The deep research indicates
      SCAMP3 localizes to the Golgi apparatus, and the original 1997 paper (PMID:9378760) showed SCAMPs
      have similar subcellular distributions including Golgi-associated compartments. The 2012 Traffic
      paper confirmed SCAMP3 localization to Golgi and endosomal compartments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation accurately reflects SCAMP3 localization. Literature demonstrates SCAMP3 presence
      at Golgi and trans-Golgi network membranes consistent with its role in post-Golgi trafficking.

  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence. SCAMP3 promotes receptor
      recycling and localizes to endosomal compartments including recycling endosomes. The 2009 Mol Biol
      Cell paper demonstrated that SCAMP3 promotes EGFR recycling rather than degradation (PMID:19158374).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation accurately reflects SCAMP3 localization and function. SCAMP3 functions as a
      recycling carrier and promotes receptor recycling from endosomal compartments back to the plasma
      membrane.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation inferred from InterPro domain and UniProtKB keywords is accurate but
      very general. SCAMP3 is indeed involved in protein transport through its role in vesicular trafficking,
      EGFR sorting, and MVB pathway regulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is correct but represents a high-level term. More specific annotations like
      post-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and endosomal transport better capture SCAMP3 function. However,
      this IEA annotation is not incorrect and provides appropriate coverage.

      four transmembrane helices (residues 171-191, 197-217, 247-267, 277-297) according to UniProt annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is accurate. SCAMP3 is clearly a membrane protein with four transmembrane domains.

  review:
    summary: This IPI annotation is well-supported. SCAMP3 contains a PPAY motif that binds WW-domain
      E3 ubiquitin ligases including NEDD4 and NEDD4L. The UniProt entry confirms interactions with NEDD4,
      NEDD4L, TSG101, and RNF126. The cited paper (PMID:23418353) demonstrates SCAMP3 interaction with
      RNF126 E3 ubiquitin ligase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation accurately reflects SCAMP3's molecular function. The PPAY motif mediates binding
      to WW-domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligases. This interaction is functionally important for SCAMP3's
      role in endosomal sorting and receptor trafficking.

  evidence_type: HDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:20458337
  review:
    summary: This HDA annotation from high-throughput proteomics is strongly supported by recent functional
      studies. The 2023 Science Advances paper demonstrated that SCAMP3 is essential for WW domain-activated
      extracellular vesicle (WAEV) budding. SCAMP3 knockout nearly abolishes EV production measured by
      NanoSight, and only wild-type (not PPAY mutant) SCAMP3 can rescue this phenotype.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is experimentally validated by multiple studies. SCAMP3 was identified in B-cell
      exosome proteomics and later shown to be functionally required for extracellular vesicle biogenesis
      through its PPAY-WW domain interactions.
