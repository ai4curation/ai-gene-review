## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O14828
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 3; Short=Secretory carrier membrane protein 3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SCAMP3; Synonyms=C1orf3, PROPIN1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SCAMP family. .
- **Key Domains:** SCAMP. (IPR007273); SCAMP (PF04144)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SCAMP3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SCAMP3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SCAMP3** (gene ID: SCAMP3, UniProt: O14828) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: SCAMP3 (Human; UniProt O14828)

1) Identity verification and core concepts
- Identity and organism: SCAMP3 (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 3) is a human integral membrane protein in the SCAMP family (SCAMP1–5), with a characteristic tetraspanning topology and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Homo sapiens). Traffic-focused cell biology places SCAMP3 at the Golgi, early endosomes, and a subset of late endosomes; quantification indicates roughly 30% of late endosomes contain SCAMP3 (image analysis) (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 1-2).
- Domain/motif architecture and ubiquitin linkage: SCAMP3 contains an N‑terminal proline-rich region with a PPAY motif (PY) that binds WW-domain E3 ligases (e.g., NEDD4-family) and a PSAP motif that binds ESCRT‑I subunit TSG101. SCAMP3 is multi‑monoubiquitylated. These features underlie its functional interactions in endosomal sorting and EGFR trafficking (2009-03; Mol Biol Cell; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-09-0894) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, radic2016anovelrolea pages 44-49).
- Functional theme: SCAMP3 is a trafficking regulator at early-to-late endosomes/MVBs that tunes the balance of receptor recycling versus degradation and participates in intralumenal vesicle (ILV) formation via ESCRT-associated mechanisms (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 10-11, falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9).

2) Molecular function, mechanisms, and localization
- Subcellular localization: SCAMP3 localizes to Golgi and early endosomes (coincident with Rab5/EEA1) and to a subset of late endosomes/lysosomes; limited surface presence has been detected. Approximately 30% of late endosomes are SCAMP3-positive (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 1-2).
- ESCRT-coupled sorting and motifs: The PSAP motif in SCAMP3 mediates binding to TSG101 (ESCRT‑I), and the PPAY motif engages WW-domain E3 ligases (e.g., NEDD4 family), with SCAMP3 itself being multi‑monoubiquitylated. SCAMP3 depletion accelerated EGFR/EGF degradation and impaired recycling, while overexpression enhanced recycling; these effects required SCAMP3 lysines and intact PSAP/PY motifs (2009-03; Mol Biol Cell; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-09-0894) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2).
- Role in MVB/ILV biogenesis: SCAMP3 is required for cargo sorting into ILVs and for EGF‑driven multivesicular endosome biogenesis; its knockdown reduces ILV formation (stereology over ~3000 μm² cytoplasm, p<0.0001), reduces cargo incorporation (HPTS/nanogold), and delays EGFR degradation (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9).
- EGFR trafficking and resolution of apparent discrepancies: Early work showed SCAMP3 promotes EGFR recycling and limits degradation (2009). Later work emphasized SCAMP3’s necessity for ILV formation and lysosomal targeting of EGFR (2012). A 2016 synthesis suggested that differential SCAMP3 ubiquitination state or regulatory context could reconcile these findings (2016; preprint/unknown venue) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9, radic2016anovelrolea pages 44-49).

3) Post-translational modifications and regulatory switches
- Ubiquitination: SCAMP3 undergoes multiple monoubiquitinations; modulation of ubiquitylation likely toggles functions (e.g., ESCRT engagement vs recycling roles) (2009-03; Mol Biol Cell; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-09-0894) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2).
- Tyrosine phosphorylation by EGFR: Quantitative phosphoproteomics in lung adenocarcinoma identified SCAMP3 Tyr86 (and Tyr35) phosphorylation downstream of activated or mutant EGFR (L858R/T790M). Y86 phosphorylation enhances SCAMP3–EGFR interaction and is required for SCAMP3-driven EGFR degradation and tumor-suppressive phenotypes; Y86F fails to rescue degradation defects and growth phenotypes (2021-04; Oncogene; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01764-y) (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 1-2).

4) Interactors and pathway placement
- EGFR axis: SCAMP3 physically associates with EGFR upon activation and co-localizes in early endosomes/perinuclear compartments; phosphorylation at Y86 promotes this association (2021-04; Oncogene; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01764-y; 2022-06; Cancers; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14112807) (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 9-13).
- ESCRT machinery: SCAMP3 engages TSG101 (ESCRT‑I) via PSAP and associates with HRS (ESCRT‑0), functionally linking to receptor sorting into ILVs (2009-03; Mol Biol Cell; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-09-0894; 2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9).
- WW-domain proteins and EV budding: SCAMP3’s PPAY motif binds WW domains to drive “WW domain–activated extracellular vesicles” (WAEVs); SCAMP3 knockout nearly abolishes WAEV budding, and re-expression of WT but not PPAY→PPAA mutant restores EV budding (2023-01; Sci Adv; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade2708) (choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).
- Antiviral innate immunity: SCAMP3 stabilizes IFITM3 by decreasing its lysosomal degradation and alters endosome→Golgi retrograde transport; it physically interacts with IFITM3. Notably, SCAMP3 did not change IFITM3 ubiquitination pattern (2016; preprint/unknown venue) (radic2016anovelrolea pages 88-97, radic2016anovelrole pages 88-97).
- Viral replication complexes: SCAMP3 interacts with enterovirus 3A and co-assembles with PI4KIIIβ/PI4P at replication sites; SCAMP3 depletion decreases viral RNA/protein synthesis and viral growth (EV‑A71, CVB3) (2021-09; Microbiol Spectrum; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00475-21) (lu2021secretorycarriermembrane pages 10-11).

5) Recent developments (priority 2023–2024) and applications
- EV technology and vaccine design (2023): A WW-domain–activated EV platform requires SCAMP3; WW–PPAY interactions on SCAMP3 recruit cargo to EVs and drive budding. SCAMP3 knockout drastically reduces EV number (NanoSight) and eliminates WAEV budding; WT rescue restores budding, PPAY-mutant fails. This establishes SCAMP3 as an actionable EV-budding factor for membrane antigen vaccine delivery (2023-01; Sci Adv; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade2708) (choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).
- Cancer signaling and trafficking control (2021–2022): In lung adenocarcinoma, SCAMP3 is a mutant EGFR phosphorylation target; Y86 phosphorylation is required for tumor-suppressive control of EGFR degradation and for preventing multinucleation and hyperproliferation (2021-04; Oncogene; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01764-y) (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10). In TNBC, SCAMP3 controls EGFR trafficking and modulates AKT/ERK/STAT3 pathways; knockout reduces proliferation, migration, invasion, and delays early tumor growth in xenografts; high SCAMP3 associates with poorer outcomes in patient datasets (2022-06; Cancers; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14112807) (acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 7-9, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 1-2, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 19-21, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 9-13).
- Infection biology (2021): SCAMP3’s role in enterovirus replication complexes supports broader functions in virus-driven membrane remodeling and lipid kinase recruitment (PI4KIIIβ/PI4P) (2021-09; Microbiol Spectrum; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00475-21) (lu2021secretorycarriermembrane pages 10-11).

6) Quantitative data and phenotypes
- Localization prevalence: ~30% of late endosomes are SCAMP3-positive (image analysis), with colocalization to early endosome markers (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 1-2).
- ILV/MVB formation: SCAMP3 knockdown significantly reduces ILV formation (stereological analysis across ~3000 μm² cytoplasm, p<0.0001); EGFR degradation is delayed (2012-01; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01291.x) (falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9).
- EGFR degradation kinetics and tumor phenotypes: In lung adenocarcinoma models, control cells show substantial EGFR degradation by ~30 min; SCAMP3-depleted cells exhibit delayed degradation (comparable only by ~2 h). SCAMP3 depletion increases pERK/pAKT, proliferation, colony formation, multinucleation; rescue by WT but not Y86F SCAMP3. Multinucleation assay counts: control n=1576; SCAMP3‑KD n=1132; rescue n=1283; Y86F n=1041 (2021-04; Oncogene; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01764-y) (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10).
- EV production: SCAMP3-KO cells show a significant reduction in EV counts (NanoSight), with near-complete loss of WAEV budding; re-expressing WT but not PPAY-mutant (PPAA) restores budding (2023-01; Sci Adv; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade2708) (choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).
- TNBC functional readouts: SCAMP3 knockout decreases proliferation at 72 h with EGF stimulation; reduces colony and tumorsphere formation, migration and invasion. Early in vivo xenograft growth is delayed; high SCAMP3 associates with reduced RFS/DMFS in TCGA analyses (2022-06; Cancers; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14112807) (acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 7-9, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 1-2, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 19-21, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 9-13).
- IFITM3 regulation: SCAMP3 stabilizes IFITM3 without altering its ubiquitination, with statistically supported effects (n=3; P<0.05) and altered endosome→Golgi transport measured by CTXB uptake and flow cytometry (2016; preprint/unknown venue) (radic2016anovelrolea pages 88-97, radic2016anovelrole pages 88-97).
- Enterovirus replication: SCAMP3 KD/KO decreases EV-A71 RNA synthesis, viral proteins, and viral growth; reduces colocalization of PI4KIIIβ and PI4P with 3A (2021-09; Microbiol Spectrum; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00475-21) (lu2021secretorycarriermembrane pages 10-11).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- EV vaccine platform: SCAMP3 is required for budding of WW domain–activated EVs that present viral membrane antigens; immunization using WAEVs displaying influenza or HIV membrane proteins elicited neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection in mice (platform concept and mechanism; SCAMP3 requirement demonstrated in cells) (2023-01; Sci Adv; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade2708) (choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).
- Oncology: SCAMP3’s modulation of EGFR fate and signaling positions it as a potential biomarker and functional target in EGFR‑driven tumors; in lung adenocarcinoma, SCAMP3 acts as a tumor suppressor via promoting EGFR degradation (2021-04; Oncogene; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-021-01764-y) and in TNBC, its expression correlates with aggressive phenotypes and worse outcomes (2022-06; Cancers; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14112807) (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 7-9, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 19-21, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 9-13).
- Antiviral strategies: SCAMP3’s roles in IFITM3 stabilization and enterovirus replication complexes suggest it as a node for modulating host–virus interactions (2016; 2021-09; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00475-21) (radic2016anovelrolea pages 88-97, radic2016anovelrole pages 88-97, lu2021secretorycarriermembrane pages 10-11).

8) Expert perspective and synthesis
- The preponderance of mechanistic data supports SCAMP3 as a multi-modal endosomal membrane organizer that bridges ESCRT entry points (via PSAP–TSG101 and HRS) with receptor fate decisions and vesicle biogenesis. PTMs act as switches: ubiquitylation state and EGFR‑driven phosphorylation at Y86 appear to bias SCAMP3 toward ILV sorting and degradation of EGFR, thereby constraining signaling. Conversely, under some conditions SCAMP3 can promote recycling; differences likely reflect cell type, ligand dose/time, and SCAMP3 modification status (2009 vs 2012 findings; inferential reconciliation) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9, radic2016anovelrolea pages 44-49). The 2023 EV study elevates SCAMP3 from a trafficking regulator to an indispensable biogenesis factor for a designer EV platform, showcasing translational relevance (choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3). In cancer, the strongest experimental evidence indicates a tumor-suppressive role in EGFR‑mutant lung adenocarcinoma via Y86‑dependent degradation of EGFR, while in TNBC SCAMP3 aligns with aggressive traits; these contrasts emphasize context-specific signaling ecosystems (venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 7-10, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 7-9, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 19-21, acevedodiaz2022scamp3regulatesegfr pages 9-13).

Compliance with identity checks
- Gene symbol and UniProt accession match the requested target: SCAMP3, UniProt O14828, human. Multiple sources explicitly refer to human SCAMP3 and its roles in human cells (Mol Biol Cell 2009; Traffic 2012; Oncogene 2021; Sci Adv 2023) (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, falguieres2012regulationofthe pages 7-9, venugopalan2021scamp3isa pages 10-12, choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).
- Protein family/domains: Findings align with SCAMP family membership and tetraspanning topology; functional motifs (PPAY, PSAP) and ESCRT/WW-domain interactions are supported (aoh2009scamp3negativelyregulates pages 1-2, choi2023displayinganddelivering pages 2-3).

Limitations
- Some innate immunity data derive from a dissertation/unknown journal; mechanistic claims are supported by experimental assays but warrant independent primary validation (radic2016anovelrolea pages 88-97, radic2016anovelrole pages 88-97).
