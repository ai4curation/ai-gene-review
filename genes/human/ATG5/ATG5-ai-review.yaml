description: >-
  ATG5 is a core autophagy protein that functions as part of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1
  complex,
  which acts as an E3-like ligase for LC3/ATG8 lipidation during autophagosome biogenesis.
  ATG5 is covalently conjugated to ATG12 via an isopeptide bond at Lys-130, catalyzed
  by ATG7 (E1)
  and ATG10 (E2). The ATG12-ATG5 conjugate with ATG16L1 allosterically activates ATG3
  to transfer
  LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on nascent autophagosomal membranes. The complex
  localizes
  preferentially to the convex surface of the growing phagophore and dissociates upon
  autophagosome
  completion. While ATG5 has an alternative name "Apoptosis-specific protein" (ASP),
  this reflects
  early nomenclature; its evolved core function is autophagosome biogenesis, not apoptosis.
  Apoptotic
  roles are secondary, mediated through calpain-cleavage products rather than full-length
  ATG5.

        before
        ATG5's core autophagy function was understood. The apoptotic role is primarily
        through
        calpain-cleavage of ATG5 generating a pro-apoptotic N-terminal fragment that
        translocates

        The UniProt alias Apoptosis-specific protein is historical nomenclature. While
        calpain-
        cleaved ATG5 can promote apoptosis, full-length ATG5 functions in autophagy.
        The deep
        research clearly states apoptosis crosstalk is secondary: calpain-mediated
        cleavage of
        ATG5 produces an N-terminal fragment that translocates to mitochondria and
        promotes
        apoptosis. This is a cleavage product, not the primary protein function.

        The referenced paper (PMID:19273585) focuses on BNIP3/BNIP3L and Beclin1 rather

        but

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      ATG5, as part of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex, functions as an E3-like enzyme
      that
      promotes the covalent conjugation of LC3/ATG8 family proteins to phosphatidylethanolamine
      (PE)
      on autophagosomal membranes. This lipidation is essential for autophagosome
      formation and maturation.
