## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9H1Y0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Autophagy protein 5 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=APG5-like; AltName: Full=Apoptosis-specific protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATG5 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:589}; Synonyms=APG5L, ASP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATG5 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Atg5. (IPR007239); ATG5_HBR. (IPR048940); Atg5_HR. (IPR042526); ATG5_UblA. (IPR048939); Atg5_UblA_dom_sf. (IPR042527)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATG5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATG5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATG5** (gene ID: ATG5, UniProt: Q9H1Y0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human ATG5 (UniProt Q9H1Y0)

Identity, protein family, and key concepts
ATG5 (UniProt Q9H1Y0) is a core human autophagy protein in the ATG5 family, bearing ubiquitin-like folds that enable conjugation with ATG12 and assembly of the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex, which functions as an E3-like ligase for LC3/ATG8 lipidation during autophagosome biogenesis (identity and mechanism summarized in structural/biochemical reviews) (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 1-2). Canonical conjugation proceeds via the E1-like ATG7 and E2-like ATG10 (for ATG12) and ATG3 (for LC3/ATG8), culminating in covalent LC3–phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3–PE) on autophagic membranes (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4). In current understanding, ATG5’s essential molecular role is to form the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate, which associates with ATG16L1 to create an E3-like platform that allosterically activates ATG3 for LC3 transfer to PE (rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2, noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4).

Primary molecular function and substrate specificity
- Reaction/system: ATG12 is covalently conjugated to ATG5 (Lys acceptor on ATG5) via ATG7 (E1) and ATG10 (E2), forming ATG12–ATG5; this adduct with ATG16L1 scaffolds the E3-like activity that catalyzes LC3/ATG8 lipidation to phosphatidylethanolamine (substrate) on the phagophore (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 1-2).
- Catalytic mechanism: Recent experiments resolve a three-step docking sequence that positions LC3 for lipidation: (i) WIPI2 recruits the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1–ATG3 machinery to PI3P-enriched membranes, (ii) helix α2 of ATG16L1 enhances membrane engagement, and (iii) a membrane-interacting surface of ATG3 aligns the LC3~ATG3 thioester for transfer to PE; ATG12–ATG5 allosterically activates ATG3 (rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2). These data refine how ATG5 within the E3-like complex promotes efficient LC3–PE formation.

Cellular localization and dynamics
The ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex preferentially associates with the convex surface of the growing isolation membrane (phagophore) and detaches/recycles once autophagosome closure is achieved, whereas LC3-PE remains on autophagosomal membranes and marks autophagy structures (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4). Reconstitution and cellular imaging show that ATG16L1 and LC3, together with ATG12–ATG5, can assemble a membrane coat that remodels flat membranes into cup-shaped phagophores, demonstrating an architectural role for the complex during autophagosome formation (mohan2024atg16l1inducesthe pages 33-36). Recruitment is driven by WIPI2 at omegasomes and depends on upstream ULK1–PI3KC3-C1 signaling; mechanistically, ULK1 phosphorylation of WIPI2b modulates its phagophore binding and interaction with ATG16L1, controlling conjugation machinery localization (lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13).

Pathways and recruitment axes
- Canonical autophagy: ULK1 complex initiation and PI3KC3-C1 (VPS34) generate PI3P, recruiting WIPI2 and the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1–ATG3 module to catalyze LC3 lipidation at the phagophore (cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2, rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2).
- WIPI2 axis: WIPI2 directly recruits ATG16L1 (via W2IR), positioning ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 at PI3P-rich membranes, consistent with the three-step docking model that integrates WIPI2 → ATG16L1 → ATG3 delivery of LC3 (rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2).
- V-ATPase–ATG16L1 axis and CASM/LAP: In noncanonical contexts, V-ATPase recruits ATG16L1, enabling LC3 conjugation to single-membrane compartments (e.g., phagosomes, Golgi) via CASM/LAP pathways; Golgi-localized LC3 lipidation under Golgi stress is explicitly ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1-dependent and requires V-ATPase–ATG16L1 (kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2, lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and structural/mechanistic advances
- Three-step docking: High-resolution integrative work (MD + reconstitution) established WIPI2 → ATG16L1 helix α2 → ATG3 membrane-docking to deliver LC3 for lipidation, with ATG12–ATG5 allosterically activating ATG3 and local PE enrichment near the thioester to promote catalysis (Science Advances, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adj8027) (rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2).
- ATG16L1-induced phagophore cups: ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 with LC3 forms a membrane coat that induces cup-like phagophores, revealing a structural role in phagophore morphogenesis (Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01300-y) (mohan2024atg16l1inducesthe pages 33-36).
- ULK1 control of WIPI2b: ULK1 phosphorylation sites on WIPI2b (including S284) tune WIPI2b’s membrane binding and ATG16L1 association, regulating site-specific LC3 lipidation (EMBO Reports, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00215-5) (lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13).
- ATG16L1 S-palmitoylation: ZDHHC7-mediated S-palmitoylation at Cys153 enhances ATG16L1’s interactions with WIPI2B and RAB33B on phagophores, promoting LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation (Autophagy, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2386915) (wei2024zdhhc7mediatedspalmitoylation pages 1-2, wei2024zdhhc7mediatedspalmitoylation pages 18-19).
- Golgi LC3 lipidation: Under Golgi stress, LC3 is lipidated directly on Golgi membranes in an ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1- and V-ATPase–ATG16L1-dependent manner, enabling a TFE3-driven Golgi stress response (EMBO Journal, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00233-y) (kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2).

Noncanonical and autophagy-independent functions of ATG5
- LAP/CASM: ATG5 participates in LC3 conjugation to single membranes during LC3-associated phagocytosis and related CASM pathways, recruited via V-ATPase–ATG16L1 rather than WIPI2; these processes support phagosome maturation and stress responses (lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13, kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2).
- Endosomal sorting/retromer: Beyond canonical autophagy, ATG5 and membrane atg8ylation interact with retromer (VPS26/29/35) to regulate GLUT1 trafficking; ATG5 knockout disrupts retromer-dependent cargo sorting independently of canonical autophagy (eLife, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.100928.3) (paddar2025noncanonicalrolesof pages 1-2).
- Apoptosis linkage: Calpain-mediated cleavage of ATG5 yields a pro-apoptotic fragment that migrates to mitochondria and promotes apoptosis, highlighting crosstalk between autophagy machinery and cell death programs as summarized in expert reviews (cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2, noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4).

Current applications and translational links
- Biomarkers: In a 180-patient stroke cohort (plus 50 healthy controls), serum ATG5 levels were significantly elevated in stroke, positively correlated with Th2 and Th17 cells and the Th17/Treg ratio, and inversely correlated with MMSE scores at baseline and at 1–3 years; serum ATG5 also associated with 2- and 3-year MMSE decline, suggesting potential prognostic/monitoring utility (Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1590/1414-431x2024e13019) (cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2).
- Disease mechanisms: Authoritative overviews emphasize ATG5’s central role in autophagosome formation and selective autophagy, and delineate noncanonical LC3 conjugation during immune responses and organelle stress; these mechanistic insights inform therapeutic strategies that modulate LC3 lipidation via ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 recruitment (cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2, lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13, kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and synthesis
- Structural and biochemical experts underscore that the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex is the autophagic E3-like engine: it localizes to the convex side of the phagophore, activates ATG3, and defines the spatial pattern of LC3 lipidation; dynamic recruitment via WIPI2 (canonical) or V-ATPase (noncanonical) provides context-specific control (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4, rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2, lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13, kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2). The discovery of ATG16L1 S-palmitoylation and ULK1-dependent control of WIPI2b adds regulatory layers that could be druggable, while the demonstration of coat-like assembly and cup formation clarifies how the conjugation machinery shapes membranes (wei2024zdhhc7mediatedspalmitoylation pages 1-2, lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13, mohan2024atg16l1inducesthe pages 33-36). Experts further highlight autophagy-independent functions (retromer/GLUT1) as emerging areas where ATG5 may influence membrane trafficking beyond degradation (paddar2025noncanonicalrolesof pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Serum ATG5 in stroke: n=180 patients vs 50 controls; ATG5 elevated (P<0.001) and correlated with Th2 (P=0.022), Th17 (P<0.001), Th17/Treg (P<0.001); ATG5 inversely correlated with MMSE at enrollment (P=0.004), Y1 (P=0.002), Y2 (P=0.014), Y3 (P=0.001); ATG5 positively associated with 2-year (P=0.024) and 3-year (P=0.012) MMSE decline (cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2).

Conclusions
Human ATG5 is a ubiquitin-like conjugation factor that, as the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate within the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex, serves as the E3-like center for LC3 lipidation, dictating where and when autophagosomes form. Recent advances defined a three-step WIPI2→ATG16L1→ATG3 docking mechanism; revealed ATG16L1 post-translational control (palmitoylation) and ULK1-driven WIPI2 regulation; and showed that the conjugation machinery can assemble a membrane coat that imposes phagophore cup architecture. Noncanonical axes, particularly V-ATPase–ATG16L1, position ATG5 for LC3 conjugation on single membranes (Golgi, phagosomes) to support stress and immune functions. Translationally, serum ATG5 correlates with immune skewing and cognitive decline after stroke, supporting its potential as a clinical biomarker pending validation. Together, these findings refine ATG5’s mechanistic role, localization dynamics, and regulatory inputs and point to therapeutic avenues that modulate recruitment and activity of the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 complex (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4, rao2024threestepdockingby pages 1-2, mohan2024atg16l1inducesthe pages 33-36, lee2025mechanismsandroles pages 13-13, wei2024zdhhc7mediatedspalmitoylation pages 1-2, kang2024nonautophagicgolgilc3lipidation pages 1-2, paddar2025noncanonicalrolesof pages 1-2, cadwell2025autophagyandbacterial pages 1-2).

Note on verification: We verified gene symbol and organism (ATG5, Homo sapiens), and the protein’s family/domains and core function align with the cited literature on the ATG12–ATG5 conjugation system and the ATG12–ATG5–ATG16L1 E3-like ligase (noda2023structuralbiologyof pages 1-4, matoba2021structuralcatalogof pages 1-2).
