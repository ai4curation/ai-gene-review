description: ELAVL3 (HuC) is a neuron-specific RNA-binding protein with three 
  RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'-UTRs of
  target mRNAs to regulate mRNA stability, alternative splicing, and transcript 
  abundance. It plays essential roles in neuronal differentiation, maintenance, 
  and synaptic integrity, particularly in the cerebellum and hippocampus.

    label: protein-RNA adaptor activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for protein-RNA adaptor activity based on 
      phylogenetic inference. ELAVL3 functions as an RNA-binding protein that 
      binds AU-rich elements in 3'-UTRs and regulates mRNA stability and 
      processing, consistent with adaptor activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This term accurately captures ELAVL3's core molecular function as a 
      protein that mediates interactions between RNA molecules and other 
      cellular components through its RNA-binding activity. The deep research 
      confirms ELAVL3 "binds preferentially to GU-rich and AU-rich sequences in 
      intronic regions and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target 
      pre-mRNAs" and "regulates alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and 
      transcript abundance". UniProt confirms it "binds to AU-rich element (ARE)
      sequences of target mRNAs" [PMID:10710437]. IBA annotations are typically 
      well-curated and phylogenetically sound.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct (ELAVL3 does bind nucleic acids), this 
      term is too broad and uninformative. ELAVL3 specifically binds RNA, not 
      DNA, through its three RRM domains. The more specific term GO:0003723 (RNA
      binding) is already annotated and better represents the actual molecular 
      function.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This term accurately describes ELAVL3's core molecular function. 
      ELAVL3 contains three RRM domains that bind RNA, specifically to AU-rich 
      and GU-rich sequences in mRNA 3'-UTRs. While more specific terms exist 
      (mRNA 3'-UTR AU-rich region binding), this general RNA binding term is

    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct (ELAVL3 is involved in neuronal 
      differentiation), this term is too broad and non-specific. The more 
      precise term would be neuronal differentiation or neuron differentiation, 
      which better captures ELAVL3's tissue-specific role. Given that ELAVL3 is

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an appropriate cellular component annotation. ELAVL3 is an 
      RNA-binding protein with RRM domains that forms ribonucleoprotein 
      complexes with its target mRNAs. The deep research notes ELAVL3 binds over
      1,100 transcripts in certain contexts, indicating it forms functional RNP 
      complexes. While more specific localization terms could be added (nucleus,
      cytoplasm), this general RNP complex annotation is correct.

      Compara orthology transfer. This is the most specific and accurate 
      molecular function term for ELAVL3.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most precise molecular function annotation for ELAVL3 
      and represents its core biochemical activity. ELAVL3 specifically binds to
      AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-UTRs of target mRNAs. PMID:10710437 
      experimentally demonstrates HuC binding to AU-rich regions in VEGF and 
      c-myc 3'-UTRs. The deep research confirms binding to "GU-rich and AU-rich 
      sequences" in 3'-UTRs. This annotation captures the key sequence 
      specificity that distinguishes ELAVL3 from general RNA-binding proteins.

  review:
    summary: IPI annotation for protein binding based on physical interaction 
      evidence from a large-scale proteomics study on autism spectrum disorders.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: While ELAVL3 does interact with proteins (UniProt mentions MAP1B 
      light chain LC1, and IntAct shows interactions with DYRK1A, SCN2A, 
      SYNGAP1), the generic "protein binding" term is uninformative and does not
      describe a molecular function. This term should not be used unless 
      referring to a specific functional role (e.g., as an adapter or scaffold).
      The reference PMID:36950384 is a large-scale protein interaction study 
      where ELAVL3 may have been detected as an interactor, but this does not 
      constitute evidence for "protein binding" as a molecular function. 
      ELAVL3's primary molecular function is RNA binding, not protein binding.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: Same rationale as for PMID:36950384. The generic "protein binding" 
      term is uninformative and should be avoided in GO curation. While ELAVL3 
      does engage in protein-protein interactions, this is not its primary 
      molecular function, and the term does not provide useful functional 
      information. ELAVL3 is fundamentally an RNA-binding protein. Large-scale 
      proteomics studies detect many interactions, but these do not necessarily 
      represent the core molecular function of the protein.

    reason: This is the gold standard annotation for ELAVL3 - direct 
      experimental evidence (IDA) for its most specific and important molecular 
      function. PMID:10710437 directly demonstrates using an ELISA-based assay 
      that HuC (ELAVL3) binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'-UTRs of VEGF and
