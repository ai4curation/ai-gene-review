description: >-
  HMGB1 is a 215-amino acid non-histone chromatin protein containing two HMG-box DNA-binding
  domains (A-box and B-box) and an acidic C-terminal tail. It has dual functions: (1) Nuclear -
  binds and bends DNA, modulates chromatin architecture, regulates transcription, and participates
  in DNA repair (BER, MMR, NER) and V(D)J recombination; (2) Extracellular - acts as a
  danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)/alarmin released from necrotic or activated cells,
  signaling through TLR4, TLR2, RAGE, and CXCR4 (via CXCL12 heterocomplex). Its activity is
  redox-regulated: all-thiol HMGB1 is chemotactic, disulfide HMGB1 (C23-C45 bond) induces
  cytokine production, and fully oxidized HMGB1 is inactive.
