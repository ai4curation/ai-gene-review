## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P09429
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=High mobility group protein B1; AltName: Full=High mobility group protein 1; Short=HMG-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HMGB1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:4983}; Synonyms=HMG1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HMGB family. .
- **Key Domains:** HMG_box_dom. (IPR009071); HMG_box_dom_sf. (IPR036910); HMG_boxA_CS. (IPR017967); HMGB. (IPR050342); HMG_box (PF00505)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HMGB1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HMGB1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HMGB1** (gene ID: HMGB1, UniProt: P09429) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report on HMGB1 (Human; UniProt P09429)

Identity verification and core definitions
- Gene/protein identity: HMGB1 (HGNC:4983), UniProt P09429, Homo sapiens. A 215–amino-acid, non-histone chromatin protein of the HMGB family with two HMG-box DNA-binding domains (A-box ~aa9–79, B-box ~aa95–163) and an acidic C-terminal tail. Contains nuclear localization signals NLS1 (aa28–44) and NLS2 (aa179–185). Functions as an architectural chromatin factor in the nucleus and a prototypical alarmin/DAMP extracellularly (structure-function and domain mapping supported in 2024–2020 sources) (yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, lv2024multiplefunctionsof pages 1-2, datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 1-2, starkova2023structureandfunctions pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1384109; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098334.

Primary functions and localization
- Nuclear: Binds and bends DNA, modulates nucleosome structure, assists transcription, replication, and DNA damage repair; interacts with histones (including H1) and can facilitate nucleosome sliding and access (datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 1-2, starkova2023structureandfunctions pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098334.
- Cytoplasmic/organelle: Shuttles to cytoplasm (regulated by PTMs), localizes to mitochondria/lysosomes; interacts with Beclin-1 to promote autophagy; participates in inflammasome/pyroptosis pathways (datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 1-2, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392.
- Extracellular: Released passively by necrotic cells or actively via non-classical secretion; acts as a DAMP/alarmin engaging TLR2/4, RAGE, or forms a chemotactic heterocomplex with CXCL12 to signal via CXCR4 (passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4, yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191.

Redox isoforms and receptor/pathway specificity
- All-thiol (fully reduced) HMGB1: Does not activate TLR4/MD-2 by itself; forms CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex that potentiates CXCR4 signaling and chemotaxis/tissue repair. Human tumor cells maintain red-HMGB1 and release thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase to sustain CXCR4-mediated migration (mass-spec confirmed discrimination of red vs oxidized isoforms in cell lysates) (yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1358800.
- Disulfide HMGB1 (C23–C45 disulfide; C106 reduced): Binds TLR4/MD-2 and induces proinflammatory cytokines via MyD88–NF-κB and MAPKs (yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392.
- Fully oxidized/sulfonyl HMGB1: Lacks chemokine/cytokine-inducing activity (yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392.
- RAGE engagement: Extracellular HMGB1 (and HMGB1–ligand complexes) bind RAGE to activate NF-κB, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 pathways, promoting proliferation, migration, angiogenesis; RAGE also mediates endocytosis of HMGB1 complexes (fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392.

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) and secretion
- PTMs: Acetylation of NLS lysines promotes nucleocytoplasmic translocation and active secretion; phosphorylation, methylation, and poly-ADP-ribosylation further modulate DNA binding and trafficking. Oxidation controls extracellular activity; redox maintained by thioredoxin systems (passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4, yuan2024hmgb1asan pages 1-3, pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2, datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 11-13). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10565-024-09893-2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1358800; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946.
- Secretion: Non-classical/lysosomal exocytosis from activated immune/structural cells vs passive release during necrosis/pyroptosis (passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392.

Signaling and regulated cell death
- Pathways: TLR4–MyD88/TRIF→NF-κB and MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38); RAGE→NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, ERK, STAT3; HMGB1–DNA complexes→TLR9 via RAGE-mediated endocytosis; CXCL12/HMGB1→CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis (fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4, bosakhar2025investigatingtheinflammatory pages 57-61). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392; —.
- Cell death: HMGB1 primes inflammasomes (NLRP3) via TLR4; contributes to pyroptosis; is implicated in ferroptosis; cytoplasmic HMGB1 promotes autophagy through Beclin‑1 interaction (datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 1-2, passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4, bosakhar2025investigatingtheinflammatory pages 57-61). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392; —.

Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Complement C1s cleavage: C1s cleaves HMGB1 to generate fragments; a defined N-terminal fragment (F3) binds TLR4 without signaling, acting as a potent endogenous antagonist that can dampen inflammation. Mass spectrometry mapped cleavage sites; proposes stepwise A- then B-box engagement of TLR4/MD-2 and shows how fragments modulate this (lorvellec2023hmgb1cleavageby pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1151731.
- Chromatin architecture: Cryo-EM and biophysical work show HMGB1 deforms nucleosomal DNA and counteracts linker histone H1 suppression of DNA accessibility without displacing H1, supporting its role as a chromatin “enabler” that increases dynamics (preprint 2024) (palone2016fecalhmgb1reveals pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.23.609244.
- Redox isoform quantitation in cancer: A mass spectrometry protocol discriminated reduced vs oxidized HMGB1 in cancer cells; tumors maintain red-HMGB1 and an active thioredoxin system to potentiate CXCL12/HMGB1–CXCR4 migration, nominating disruption of this heterocomplex as a target (pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1358800.

Applications and real-world implementations
- Sepsis biomarker (serum): In a retrospective single-center cohort of 86 sepsis patients (60 survivors/26 deaths), serum HMGB1 correlated with severity (APACHE II r=0.709; P<0.001) and predicted prognosis: AUC 0.781 (95% CI 0.674–0.888), optimal cutoff 395.80 ng/mL (sensitivity 57.7%, specificity 91.7%); combining H-FABP, sTREM-1, HMGB1 improved AUC to 0.834 (95% CI 0.739–0.930) (jiang2024correlationofserum pages 2-4, jiang2024correlationofserum pages 4-7, jiang2024correlationofserum pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.62347/kelz4296.
- Trauma AKI/MOF prediction (translational swine): 39 swine model of smoke inhalation + burns: 12-hour HMGB1 predicted AKI and MOF before creatinine rise; AUROC 0.81 (AKI) and 0.89 (MOF), optimal cutoff 36.41 ng/mL at 12 h; AKI group HMGB1 73.07±18.66 ng/mL vs 31.64±4.15 ng/mL in non-AKI (p<0.01) (yang2024anearlyhmgb1 pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1447597.
- IBD fecal HMGB1: In pediatric (n=85) and adult (n=119) cohorts, fecal HMGB1 was elevated and correlated with fecal calprotectin (r=0.60 peds; r=0.72 adult; P<0.001). Crucially, in patients in clinical and endoscopic remission, fecal HMGB1 aligned with histological inflammation (Geboes≥3.1; CGHAS/IGHAS>4), indicating utility for detecting microscopic inflammation/mucosal healing (palone2016fecalhmgb1reveals pages 1-2, palone2016fecalhmgb1reveals pages 7-8). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1097/mib.0000000000000938.

Therapeutic targeting and implementations
- Direct HMGB1 inhibitors: Glycyrrhizin and related compounds bind HMGB1 and can suppress HMGB1–TLR4/RAGE-driven inflammation (mechanistic and preclinical evidence across organ injury contexts) (datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 11-13, fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191.
- Antagonist domains/fragments: The HMGB1 A-box and the complement C1s-derived F3 fragment act as antagonists of TLR4/MD-2 engagement, reducing inflammatory signaling in preclinical models (lorvellec2023hmgb1cleavageby pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1151731.
- Axis disruption: In cancer, targeting the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex (to reduce CXCR4-mediated migration) and RAGE inhibition are rational strategies; tumors maintain red-HMGB1 to promote migration (pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2, fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1358800; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191.

Expert perspectives and interpretations
- Consensus across recent reviews: HMGB1’s biological activity is governed by redox state, PTMs, and macromolecular complex formation, which together dictate receptor usage and context (repair vs inflammation). Therapeutic success likely requires isoform- and context-aware interventions (passali2025hmgb1asa pages 2-4, datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 1-2, fan2024hmgb1rageaxisin pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14155392; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13231946; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2024.1336191.

Limitations and open questions
- Standardization: Clinical HMGB1 assays vary (ELISA kits, sample handling), and few studies report isoform-specific measurements in patients. Redox/isoform-resolved quantitation (as shown in 2024 cancer MS work) is needed clinically to refine biomarker and therapeutic strategies (pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2, datta2024highmobilitygroup pages 11-13).

Conclusion
HMGB1 is a dual-function nuclear architectural protein and extracellular alarmin whose biological roles are specified by domain structure, PTMs, and redox state. Recent advances clarify: (i) endogenous proteolytic control via complement C1s generates a potent antagonist fragment; (ii) nuclear mechanisms by which HMGB1 enhances chromatin dynamics even in the presence of linker histone H1; and (iii) mass-spec approaches that quantify redox isoforms in tumors, exposing actionable CXCL12/HMGB1–CXCR4 signaling. Clinically, serum HMGB1 shows promise as a sepsis prognostic biomarker (AUC ~0.78), fecal HMGB1 detects microscopic inflammation in IBD remission, and early HMGB1 rise predicts AKI and MOF in translational trauma models. Therapeutically, direct HMGB1 inhibition (e.g., glycyrrhizin), use of antagonist fragments (A‑box/F3), RAGE inhibition, and disruption of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex represent leading strategies, with further work needed to standardize isoform-specific assays and validate interventions in clinical trials (lorvellec2023hmgb1cleavageby pages 13-14, palone2016fecalhmgb1reveals pages 1-2, pirani2024tumorcellsexpress pages 1-2, jiang2024correlationofserum pages 2-4, yang2024anearlyhmgb1 pages 1-2).
