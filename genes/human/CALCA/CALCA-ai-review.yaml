description: >
  CALCA encodes the calcitonin precursor protein, a secreted peptide hormone precursor that is
  proteolytically processed to yield calcitonin (CT) and katacalcin. Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid
  peptide hormone secreted primarily by thyroid parafollicular (C) cells that functions as a
  calciotropic hormone regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Its primary molecular function
  is binding to the calcitonin receptor (CALCR), a class B GPCR, to activate Gs-coupled adenylate
  cyclase signaling. The principal physiological effect is rapid inhibition of osteoclast-mediated
  bone resorption. Through alternative splicing, the CALCA gene also produces alpha-CGRP
  (calcitonin gene-related peptide, UniProtKB:P06881), a potent vasodilatory neuropeptide expressed
  in sensory neurons. Katacalcin, the C-terminal flanking peptide of calcitonin, also possesses
  plasma calcium-lowering activity.

          We determined the structure and dynamics of active AMYRs with amylin, AMY1R with
          salmon CT (sCT), AMY2R with sCT or human CT (hCT), and CTR with amylin, sCT, or hCT.

          Like the endogenous T47D receptor, the recombinant receptor has an equally high
          affinity for salmon and porcine calcitonin but a 3-4-fold lower affinity for human
          calcitonin.

    description: >
      Calcitonin is a peptide hormone secreted by thyroid parafollicular C cells. It acts as a
      classical hormone, traveling through the bloodstream to target tissues (primarily bone)
      where it binds its receptor to exert calciotropic effects. Calcitonin causes a rapid
      drop in blood calcium by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

          The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the adult C(T) reference values
          determined by five different immunoassays and by introducing criteria for selecting
          control subjects.
