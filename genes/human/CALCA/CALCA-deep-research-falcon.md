## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P01258
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Calcitonin {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6546550}; Contains: RecName: Full=Calcitonin {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6546550}; Short=CT {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6546550}; Contains: RecName: Full=Katacalcin {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6132180}; AltName: Full=Calcitonin carboxyl-terminal peptide; Short=CCP; AltName: Full=PDN-21; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CALCA {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:1437}; Synonyms=CALC1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the calcitonin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Calcitonin. (IPR021118); Calcitonin-like. (IPR021117); Calcitonin/adrenomedullin. (IPR021116); Calcitonin_CS. (IPR018360); Calcitonin_peptide-like. (IPR001693)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CALCA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CALCA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CALCA** (gene ID: CALCA, UniProt: P01258) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity confirmed: CALCA (HGNC:1437) encodes a secreted prepropeptide that yields calcitonin (CT) in thyroidal C cells and, via alternative splicing in neurons, α-calcitonin gene-related peptide (αCGRP). Procalcitonin (PCT) is an intermediate in CT biosynthesis and is markedly induced in systemic bacterial infection (sepsis) (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20). The organism is human, and functions align with the calcitonin/CGRP peptide family and their class B GPCR receptors modulated by RAMPs (garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 1-3, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 4-6).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Gene products and alternative splicing: CALCA produces two principal bioactive peptides: CT (thyroidal) and αCGRP (neuronal) via alternative transcription/splicing; PCT is the CT prohormone and a systemic inflammation biomarker with low basal levels that rise strongly during sepsis (publication notes <0.1 ng/mL baseline) (Jiang 2024; Canadian musculoskeletal review excerpts) (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20). In bone and marrow contexts, CT inhibits osteoclast motility and resorption in vitro, while genetic studies suggest αCGRP promotes bone formation; CALCA or CTR deficiency paradoxically increases bone formation via altered osteoclast–osteoblast crosstalk, underscoring distinct physiological roles of CT versus αCGRP (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20, jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 20-24).
- Receptors and complexes: The canonical CGRP receptor is a heterodimer of CALCRL (also called CLR) with RAMP1; CTR (CALCR) forms functional amylin receptors with RAMPs (e.g., AMY1 = CTR+RAMP1). Some CGRP pathway therapeutics (erenumab, gepants) can also engage AMY1 pharmacology, illustrating cross-reactivity within the calcitonin family receptor network (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 1-3, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 4-6).
- Primary signaling: CGRP receptors primarily couple to Gs to raise cAMP/PKA; β-arrestin recruitment, receptor phosphorylation and internalization occur after activation. Additional signaling via Ca2+/MAPK and, context-dependently, other cascades have been reported for calcitonin-family receptors (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 7-9).
- Localization and secretion: CT is secreted from thyroid C cells into circulation; αCGRP is abundantly expressed in sensory neurons (e.g., trigeminovascular and dorsal root ganglia) and acts as a potent vasodilatory neuropeptide in pain/nociception circuits (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20, bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Clinical practice guidelines advancing CGRP-targeting as first-line for migraine prevention:
  - American Headache Society (AHS) 2024 position statement (Headache, March 2024): Concludes that CGRP-targeting therapies are a first-line option for prevention of migraine, removing prior requirements to fail multiple legacy preventives (https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14692; Mar 2024) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2).
  - Updated Canadian Headache Society Guideline 2024 (Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, November 2024): Systematic review (61 studies) and recommendations include anti-CGRP agents as options for episodic and chronic migraine prevention in Canada; the update also reappraises legacy preventives (e.g., topiramate downgraded to weak recommendation for episodic migraine; weak recommendation against gabapentin; weak recommendations for memantine/levetiracetam/enalapril/melatonin) (https://doi.org/10.1017/cjn.2024.285; Nov 2024) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2, medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 9-10).
- Real-world uptake and utilization (United States claims data): In a 2024 Frontiers in Neurology cohort (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus), 22,584 chronic migraine (CM) and 216,807 non-chronic migraine (non-CM) patients were analyzed. Over follow-up, anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies were dispensed to 28.9% of CM patients and to 6.9%, 4.1%, and 2.9% of non-CM patients in the highest, middle, and lowest tertiles of acute medication use, respectively (published Aug 6, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1433423) (khodavirdi2024treatmentpatternsof pages 1-2).
- Receptor pharmacology nuances of approved therapies: Comparative mechanistic work shows that the CGRP receptor antibody erenumab and small-molecule antagonists inhibit CGRP signaling at CLR/RAMP1 and also antagonize amylin signaling at AMY1 (CTR/RAMP1), whereas a CGRP-ligand antibody (fremanezumab) selectively blocks CGRP signaling without affecting AMY1, indicating clinically relevant target selectivity differences (Cephalalgia, Feb 2021; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102420983282; mechanistic principles informing 2023–2024 practice) (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2).
- Structure–mechanism insights: Recent computational/biophysical analyses integrate cryo-EM and ectodomain binding kinetics to elaborate the “two-domain” binding mechanism for CGRP at CLR/RAMP1 and peptide- and G protein–state–dependent affinities, relevant to designing long-acting peptides/gepants (bioRxiv, Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.13.659569; supports the mechanistic framework used in 2023–2024 drug development) (kilinc2025determinantsofimproved pages 18-20).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Migraine prevention and acute treatment: Multiple anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab) and a receptor-targeting mAb (erenumab), as well as small-molecule receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant), are in routine clinical use. Guideline-level endorsements (AHS 2024; Canadian 2024) position these as first-line (AHS) or recommended options (Canada) for prevention, reflecting robust RCT and real-world evidence (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2, medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 9-10, bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2, khodavirdi2024treatmentpatternsof pages 1-2).
- Biomarker utility: Procalcitonin, a CALCA gene product intermediate, is a widely used clinical biomarker for bacterial infection/sepsis due to its marked systemic induction during infection; its basal concentrations are low in health, and pathophysiologic roles include modulation of inflammatory mediators (Jiang 2024 review excerpts) (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20).
- Skeletal/bone biology: CT has long-standing anti-resorptive pharmacology on osteoclasts; however, genetic evidence indicates αCGRP favors bone formation, while loss of CT signaling via CTR can increase bone formation by altering osteoclast-derived S1P and osteoblast stimulation—nuances that inform modern interpretations of calcitonin-family roles in bone turnover (Jiang 2024 review excerpts; additional family-level background in IUPHAR-linked summaries) (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20, jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 20-24, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- AHS Position Statement Update (2024): Concludes CGRP-targeting therapies are appropriate first-line options for preventive treatment, based on safety/efficacy evidence and clinical experience, moving away from step-therapy with legacy agents (Headache; https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14692; Mar 2024) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2).
- Canadian Headache Society (2024): Recommends anti-CGRP agents among preventive options and updates the evidence grading across preventives. The guideline emphasizes both episodic and chronic migraine contexts and integrates systematic review/meta-analysis to inform clinical decision-making (https://doi.org/10.1017/cjn.2024.285; Nov 2024) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2, medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 9-10).

Relevant statistics and recent data points
- 22,584 CM and 216,807 non-CM patients analyzed in US claims; anti-CGRP mAb dispensing during follow-up: 28.9% (CM), and 6.9%/4.1%/2.9% across descending tertiles of acute-medicine use in non-CM (Frontiers in Neurology; Aug 6, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2024.1433423) (khodavirdi2024treatmentpatternsof pages 1-2).
- Guideline evidence synthesis: 61 studies included; 16 therapies focused; explicit inclusion and approvals of anti-CGRP agents in Canada between 2018 and 2024; multiple recommendation adjustments (Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences; Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.1017/cjn.2024.285) (medrea2024updatedcanadianheadache pages 1-2).

Mechanisms, pathways, and structural biology (precise functional roles)
- αCGRP signaling: Endogenous ligand for CLR/RAMP1 CGRP receptor. Activates Gs→cAMP/PKA and engages β-arrestin–dependent receptor internalization; distribution in the trigeminovascular system substantiates its central role in migraine pathophysiology (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2).
- Target selectivity and receptor crosstalk: Anti-CGRP receptor agents (e.g., erenumab) and some gepants also antagonize AMY1 (CTR/RAMP1), whereas anti-ligand antibodies (e.g., fremanezumab) are selective for CGRP—important for interpreting clinical response and adverse event profiles (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2).
- CT signaling: Acts via CTR (CALCR), a class B GPCR, to suppress osteoclast activity; CTR plus RAMPs define amylin receptors (AMY1–3), contributing to complex pharmacology among calcitonin-family peptides (garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 1-3, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 4-6).
- Two-domain binding model and RAMP1 role: Structural and kinetic studies support a two-domain peptide–GPCR interaction for CGRP at CLR/RAMP1, with peptide C-terminal anchoring in the receptor ectodomain and N-terminal engagement of the transmembrane core; RAMP1 is essential for ligand selectivity and receptor pharmacology (bioRxiv 2025 mechanistic synthesis; links to cryo-EM literature) (kilinc2025determinantsofimproved pages 18-20). Broader receptor/RAMP biology and accessory proteins (e.g., CGRP-RCP) shape trafficking and coupling efficiency across the calcitonin/adrenomedullin/amylin receptor families (garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 4-6, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 7-9).

Cellular compartments and tissue context
- CT: Secreted endocrine hormone from thyroid C cells; targets osteoclasts in bone (inhibitory) and contributes to systemic calcium homeostasis. Genetic and cell-biology studies reveal CT can reduce osteoclast lamellipodial dynamics and motility (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20).
- αCGRP: Secreted neuropeptide from sensory neurons; acts in the peripheral and central nervous systems and vasculature to mediate vasodilation and nociception; robustly present in trigeminovascular afferents (bhakta2021migrainetherapeuticsdifferentially pages 1-2).
- PCT: Circulating prohormone that serves as a sepsis biomarker; can influence inflammatory mediator profiles and has reported effects on osteoclastogenesis (jiang2024rolesofcalcitonin pages 17-20).

Limitations and open questions
- Sex hormone regulation of the CGRP system is an active research area (e.g., trigeminal ganglion expression dynamics), but our current evidence set does not include primary 2023–2024 human-focused mechanistic studies to cite; dedicated hormone–RAMP–CGRP regulatory interactions require further targeted sourcing (garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 7-9, garelja2025calcitoninreceptorsin pages 1-3).
