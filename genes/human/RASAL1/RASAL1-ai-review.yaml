description: 'RAS protein activator like 1, calcium-regulated GTPase-activating protein
  for RAS and RAP1 small GTPases. Member of GAP1 family characterized by two N-terminal
  C2 domains (Ca2+ and phospholipid binding), pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and
  C-terminal RasGAP catalytic domain. Functions as dual-specificity GAP: catalyzes
  GTP hydrolysis on both Ras proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, R-Ras) and Rap1 GTPase
  using arginine-finger mechanism. C2 domains mediate Ca2+-dependent membrane translocation
  - protein cycles between cytosolic inactive state and membrane-bound active state
  upon Ca2+ bursts. PH domain binds membrane phosphoinositides. Cytosolic protein
  (~804 AA) that transiently associates with inner plasma membrane upon calcium elevation
  to access membrane-anchored Ras. Major tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in
  cancers - promoter hypermethylation found in ~32% follicular thyroid carcinoma,
  ~33% anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and other cancers (colon, gastric, bladder).
  RASAL1 mutations largely mutually exclusive with RAS/BRAF mutations, indicating
  loss of RASAL1 provides alternative mechanism for Ras hyperactivation in tumors.
  Germline RASAL1 mutations identified in Cowden syndrome patients with thyroid cancers.
  Critical role in organ fibrosis - epigenetic silencing by TGF-β-induced promoter
  hypermethylation drives persistent fibroblast activation in kidney fibrosis. Demethylating
  agents (5-azacytidine, hydralazine) can restore RASAL1 expression and reduce fibrosis
  in animal models. In neurons, regulates dendritic branching and synaptic plasticity
  by interacting with tubulin, PKC, and CaMKII. Links calcium oscillations to Ras/MAPK
  pathway amplitude control.'
