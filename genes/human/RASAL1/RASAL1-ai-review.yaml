description: RASAL1 (RAS protein activator like 1) is a calcium-regulated GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
  of the GAP1 family that negatively regulates RAS signaling. The 804 amino acid protein contains two
  N-terminal C2 domains (C2A and C2B) that mediate Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, a central RasGAP
  catalytic domain with an essential arginine finger (Arg342), a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for phosphoinositide
  binding, and a C-terminal Btk-type zinc finger domain. RASAL1 accelerates GTP hydrolysis on RAS proteins
  (including H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras), converting them from the active GTP-bound state to inactive GDP-bound
  form, thereby constraining RAF-MEK-ERK signaling. The protein cycles between cytosolic and plasma membrane-associated
  states in response to intracellular calcium oscillations - upon Ca2+ elevation, the C2 domains bind
  phosphatidylserine and the protein translocates to the membrane where it can access membrane-anchored
  RAS. Unlike the related CAPRI protein which shows sustained membrane association, RASAL1 tracks Ca2+
  oscillations with rapid in-phase membrane translocations (half-maximal dissociation ~17 seconds). RASAL1
  functions as a tumor suppressor frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in cancers including
  thyroid carcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. The protein also plays critical roles in organ
  fibrosis - TGF-beta-induced DNMT1-mediated promoter hypermethylation leads to persistent fibroblast
  activation in kidney fibrosis. RASAL1 is highly expressed in thyroid and adrenal medulla, with lower
  expression in brain, spinal cord, and trachea. Recent studies have identified neuronal functions including
  regulation of dendrite formation and microtubule dynamics through interactions with PKC, tubulin, and
  CaMKII.

  review:
    summary: RASAL1 is a member of the GAP1 family of RasGAP proteins that accelerates GTP hydrolysis
      on RAS proteins. The protein contains a conserved GAP-related domain (GRD) with an arginine finger
      essential for catalysis [PMID:9751798]. Live-cell imaging confirms Ca2+-triggered GAP activity that
      correlates with membrane translocation [PMID:16009725].

    id: GO:0005096
    label: GTPase activator activity
  description: RASAL1 is a calcium-regulated GTPase-activating protein that accelerates the intrinsic
    GTP hydrolysis rate of RAS proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras), converting them from the active GTP-bound
    state to the inactive GDP-bound form. The RasGAP domain contains an essential arginine finger (Arg342)
    that stabilizes the transition state during GTP hydrolysis. This function serves to negatively regulate
    the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases.

- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0005509
    label: calcium ion binding
  description: The tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B) of RASAL1 bind calcium ions, which triggers conformational
    changes enabling phospholipid binding and membrane translocation. This Ca2+-sensing function allows
    RASAL1 to transduce intracellular calcium oscillations into regulation of Ras activity. Unlike the
    related protein CAPRI, RASAL1 closely tracks calcium oscillations with rapid membrane association/dissociation
    cycles.

    label: phospholipid binding
  description: The C2 domains of RASAL1 bind phospholipids (particularly phosphatidylserine via C2A and
    phosphoinositides via C2B) in a calcium-dependent manner. The PH domain also contributes to membrane
    binding through phosphoinositide interactions. This phospholipid binding enables the protein to translocate
    from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it can access membrane-anchored Ras substrates.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does RASAL1 have GAP activity toward Rap1 GTPase in addition to Ras proteins, as suggested
    for some GAP1 family members?
- question: What is the relative contribution of the PH domain versus C2 domains for membrane targeting
    specificity?
- question: Are there tissue-specific functions of RASAL1 in thyroid and adrenal medulla where it is most
    highly expressed?
- question: What is the mechanistic relationship between RASAL1 and tubulin/microtubule dynamics identified
    in neuronal studies?

    substrate specificity
  hypothesis: RASAL1 may have broader substrate specificity including Rap1 GTPase
