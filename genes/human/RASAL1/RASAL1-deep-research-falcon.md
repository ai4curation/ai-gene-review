## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O95294
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=RasGAP-activating-like protein 1 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=RAS protein activator like 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:9873}; AltName: Full=Ras GTPase-activating-like protein {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9751798};
- **Gene Information:** Name=RASAL1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:9873}; Synonyms=RASAL {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9751798};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C2_dom. (IPR000008); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849); Ras_GTPase. (IPR039360)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RASAL1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RASAL1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RASAL1** (gene ID: RASAL1, UniProt: O95294) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- We verified the target identity (human RASAL1; UniProt O95294) and domain architecture across recent primary literature, then gathered 2023–2024 sources on function, regulation, disease roles, and applications. We next synthesized mechanistic details and compiled a compact artifact of key facts, followed by a comprehensive narrative with citations and URLs.

Human RASAL1 (O95294): comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and domains: RASAL1 (RAS protein activator like 1) is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that contains N‑terminal C2A/C2B domains, a central RasGAP domain, and a C‑terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This architecture supports Ca2+ and phospholipid-sensing and membrane recruitment that position the RasGAP catalytic module to its substrates at membranes (Cell & Bioscience, Jan 2024: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-024-01193-w). The same source and recent reviews classify RASAL1 among tumor‑suppressive RasGAPs (Frontiers in Genetics, Mar 2023: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1124330) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2, lyu2023roleandmechanism pages 3-5).
- Biochemical function and substrate specificity: RASAL1 accelerates the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of RAS, converting RAS‑GTP to inactive RAS‑GDP, thereby constraining downstream RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Its activity is enhanced when associated with the plasma membrane, consistent with the requirement to encounter membrane‑anchored RAS (Cell & Bioscience, 2024; Frontiers in Genetics, 2023) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2, lyu2023roleandmechanism pages 3-5).
- Subcellular localization: In neurons, Rasal1 is diffusely cytosolic in soma/dendrites/axon but translocates to the plasma membrane in response to intracellular Ca2+ elevations; the C2A domain binds phosphatidylserine and C2B binds phosphoinositides, supporting Ca2+‑dependent membrane association via C2/PH modules (Cell & Bioscience, 2024: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-024-01193-w) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Neuronal mechanisms (2024 primary research): Deurloo et al. showed that neuronal Rasal1 directly interacts with PKC, tubulin, and CaMKII; stabilizes microtubules via tubulin modifications; inhibits dendritic outgrowth/branching; and promotes NMDA receptor–mediated synaptic activity and CaMKII phosphorylation. Live imaging confirmed Ca2+‑dependent membrane recruitment via C2/PH flanking the RasGAP domain (Cell & Bioscience, Jan 2024: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-024-01193-w) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).
- Fibrosis and epigenetic regulation—kidney focus (2023 review): A state‑of‑the‑art review in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (Mar 2023) synthesized evidence that TGF‑β drives DNMT1‑dependent promoter hypermethylation of RASAL1 in renal fibroblasts, leading to sustained myofibroblast activation and kidney fibrosis; hypermethylated RASAL1 is observed in biopsies from severely fibrotic human kidneys. The review highlights BMP7 as an antagonist capable of reversing RASAL1 hypermethylation and restoring anti‑fibrotic gene expression (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, Mar 2023: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01379-7) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9).
- Fibrosis and epigenetic regulation—liver and cross‑organ context (2023 review): In hepatic fibrosis, DNA methylation is a central mechanism; RASAL1 is noted as a RasGAP tumor suppressor commonly downregulated by hypermethylation across fibrotic contexts, reinforcing the generalizability of epigenetic silencing of RASAL1 in fibrosis biology (Frontiers in Genetics, Mar 2023: https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2023.1124330) (lyu2023roleandmechanism pages 3-5).
- Demethylation pathways and reversal (2025 review with mechanistic synthesis): A comprehensive nephrology review (2025) reiterates that DNMT1‑mediated promoter methylation of Rasal1 activates renal fibroblasts and promotes renal fibrosis; conversely, BMP7 induces demethylation via TET3 to suppress fibrosis, aligning with earlier preclinical evidence and the 2023 review’s conclusions (Clinical and Experimental Nephrology, Apr 2025: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-025-02668-x) (sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).
- Circulating biomarker proposals (2024): A 2024 dissertation‑level analysis proposes methylated circulating RASAL1 DNA as a biomarker of cardiac fibrosis progression and mortality in aortic stenosis, and compiles supporting mechanistic links (e.g., TGFβ/SMAD‑driven or phosphate/HDAC2‑DNMT1‑linked RASAL1 methylation promoting EndMT and fibrosis) (Göttingen repository 2024: https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-10612) (kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Biomarker direction of travel: While large clinical validations remain limited, multiple reviews suggest that DNA methylation of anti‑fibrotic genes (including RASAL1) in blood may mirror disease‑relevant tissue methylation status. In kidney disease, whole‑blood methylation profiles may reflect renal methylation, supporting development of circulating methylated RASAL1 assays as noninvasive fibrosis biomarkers (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01379-7; dissertation proposing cardiac application, 2024: https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-10612) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18).
- Therapeutic concepts: Reviews converge on epigenetic reversal as a therapeutic strategy—DNMT inhibitors (e.g., 5‑azacytidine) and BMP7‑TET demethylation axes to restore RASAL1 and dampen pro‑fibrotic signaling. Preclinical studies summarized in these reviews support feasibility, but clinical translation remains to be established (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023; Clinical and Experimental Nephrology, 2025: URLs above) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic consensus: Authoritative reviews integrate RASAL1 as an anti‑fibrotic RasGAP frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation downstream of TGF‑β/DNMT1, enabling persistent RAS–ERK activity and myofibroblast/EndMT programs in kidney (and by extension other fibrotic organs). The reversibility by BMP7 and demethylating agents positions RASAL1 methylation as both a disease driver and a tractable target (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023; Clinical and Experimental Nephrology, 2025) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).
- Neuronal perspective: The 2024 primary study extends RASAL1 biology into neurodevelopment, revealing Ca2+‑regulated membrane cycling and cytoskeletal control through tubulin interactions—features consistent with a Ca2+‑sensitive RasGAP integrating synaptic signaling with structural maturation (Cell & Bioscience, 2024) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data (from recent studies/reviews)
- Kidney fibrosis review reach: The 2023 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy review compiling RASAL1 methylation/fibrosis mechanisms has already accrued extensive citations in the field, reflecting broad consensus and adoption (Mar 2023: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01379-7) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9).
- Neuronal study dataset: Deurloo et al. provided multi‑modal evidence (imaging, co‑IP, electrophysiology) that Rasal1 modulates dendritic morphology and synaptic function, with Western blot detection in mouse hippocampus and cortex and dynamic Ca2+‑dependent membrane localization (Jan 2024: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-024-01193-w) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).
- Biomarker concept evidence: The 2024 dissertation reports associations between methylated cfDNA and fibrosis progression/mortality in aortic stenosis patients as an exploratory framework, highlighting potential clinical utility pending peer‑reviewed validation (2024: https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-10612) (kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18).

Functional annotation summary
- Primary function: Ras GTPase‑activating protein that promotes GTP hydrolysis on RAS, restraining RAF–MEK–ERK signaling. Activity aligns with membrane association via Ca2+‑regulated C2/PH modules (Cell & Bioscience, 2024; Frontiers in Genetics, 2023) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2, lyu2023roleandmechanism pages 3-5).
- Localization: Cytosolic with Ca2+‑dependent translocation to the plasma membrane; C2A binds phosphatidylserine and C2B binds phosphoinositides, supporting a Ca2+‑sensing membrane recruitment mechanism (Cell & Bioscience, 2024) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).
- Pathways: Negative regulator of RAS→RAF–MEK–ERK; epigenetic silencing (DNMT1‑mediated RASAL1 promoter hypermethylation) elevates RAS signaling and fosters fibrogenic programs including myofibroblast activation and EndMT in kidney; BMP7/TET demethylation can reverse these states in preclinical synthesis (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023; Clinical and Experimental Nephrology, 2025) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).
- Disease roles: Anti‑fibrotic RasGAP frequently downregulated by promoter hypermethylation across fibrotic contexts (kidney, with cross‑organ generalization to liver and heart in reviews/dissertation); potential tumor‑suppressive role inferred from RasGAP function and literature synthesis (Frontiers in Genetics, 2023; Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023; dissertation, 2024) (lyu2023roleandmechanism pages 3-5, huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18).
- Applications: Early evidence supports methylated RASAL1 as a circulating biomarker of fibrotic burden/prognosis (cardiac aortic stenosis), with kidney-directed noninvasive methylation profiling proposed; therapeutic reversal via demethylating strategies remains preclinical/early translational (Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, 2023; dissertation, 2024; Clinical and Experimental Nephrology, 2025) (huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18, sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).

Verification of the requested identity and scope
- The gene symbol RASAL1 and the human protein reviewed here match the UniProt O95294 identity and domain arrangement (C2/C2, RasGAP, PH) reflected in the 2024 primary study, ensuring the correct human target was investigated (Cell & Bioscience, 2024: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-024-01193-w) (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2).

Limitations and open questions
- Most biomarker evidence for methylated RASAL1 is still exploratory; large independent clinical validations are needed. Therapeutic demethylation strategies targeting RASAL1 (e.g., DNMT inhibitors/BMP7) remain at a preclinical/early translational stage and will require trials for safety/efficacy. Neuronal roles require in vivo validation and dissection of Ras‑dependent versus cytoskeletal interaction‑dependent mechanisms (deurloo2024rasal1regulatescalcium pages 1-2, huang2023kidneyfibrosisfrom pages 8-9, kanwischer2024methylatedcirculatingdna pages 15-18, sasaki2025epigenetichistonemodifications pages 3-4).
