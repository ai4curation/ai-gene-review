description: >-
  TMEM67 (meckelin) is a transmembrane protein that localizes to the ciliary
  transition zone and is a component of the MKS complex (Meckel syndrome complex).
  It is essential for primary cilium formation and structure, acting in centrosome
  migration to the apical cell surface during early ciliogenesis. TMEM67 functions
  as a receptor or co-receptor in non-canonical Wnt signaling (interacting with
  WNT5A and ROR2), and plays a role in epithelial branching morphogenesis. It also
  participates in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded
  surfactant protein C (SFTPC), where it acts as an adaptor linking the ER lumenal
  quality control machinery with the cytosolic degradation apparatus. Mutations in
  TMEM67 cause a spectrum of ciliopathies including Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS3),
  Joubert syndrome (JBTS6), COACH syndrome, nephronophthisis (NPHP11), Bardet-Biedl
  syndrome (BBS14), and RHYNS syndrome.

      confirm this localization. PMID:22121117 states that meckelin "Localizes at
      the transition zone, a region between the basal body and the ciliary axoneme."

      This study was a large-scale screen focused on neurodegenerative disease

      IDA annotation for ciliary transition zone localization from PMID:26595381
      (Lambacher et al. 2016). This study used super-resolution microscopy in
      C. elegans and mammalian cells to characterize MKS module protein
      localizations within transition zone subdomains. The study showed that
      "MKS module membrane proteins are immobile and super-resolution microscopy

      This provides direct evidence for TMEM67 localization at the transition zone.

      This annotation to GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is based on
      PMID:19815549 (Wang et al. 2009), which studied the role of MKS3/TMEM67
      in ERAD of misfolded surfactant protein C (SP-C). The WITH/FROM field
      indicates UniProtKB:P11686 (SFTPC). The paper demonstrated that the ER
      lumenal domain of MKS3 interacted with a complex that included mutant
      SP-C and associated chaperones (ERdj4/DNAJB9 and ERdj5/DNAJC10), and
      that the transmembrane domains of MKS3 interacted with cytosolic p97.
      However, MKS3 is not a chaperone. The authors concluded that MKS3
      functions as an adaptor that links the ER lumenal quality control
      machinery with the cytosolic degradation apparatus, rather than directly
      binding unfolded protein in a chaperone-like manner. The interaction
      with misfolded SP-C appears to be indirect, mediated through association
      with the chaperone complex. TMEM67 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein
      of the ciliary transition zone with no known chaperone domains. The term
      GO:0051082 is also being obsoleted (go-ontology issue 30962) because it
      conflates passive binding with active chaperone functions. This annotation
      represents an over-annotation where an adaptor role in ERAD was
      inappropriately classified as unfolded protein binding.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      TMEM67/MKS3 is not a chaperone and does not possess intrinsic unfolded
      protein binding activity. The evidence in PMID:19815549 shows that MKS3
      interacts with a complex containing misfolded SP-C and bona fide ER
      chaperones, but functions as an adaptor linking the ER lumenal quality
      control machinery with the cytosolic degradation apparatus (p97), not
      as a chaperone itself. The annotation to GO:0036503 (ERAD pathway)
      already appropriately captures the biological process role. The molecular
      function of TMEM67 in this context is better described as an adaptor or
      scaffold linking chaperone-substrate complexes to the retrotranslocation

          Analysis of the wpk rat model of MKS3 revealed functional defects of the
          connecting cilium in the eye that resulted in lack of formation of the
          outer segment, whereas infertile wpk males developed spermatids with very
          short flagella that did not extend beyond the cell body.

  review:
    summary: >-
      NEW annotation. PMID:26035863 demonstrated that the extracellular N-terminal
      domain of TMEM67 preferentially binds to Wnt5a in an in vitro binding assay.
      PMID:34731008 confirmed this interaction structurally. The existing protein
      binding annotations with WNT5A (PMID:34731008) and ROR2 (PMID:26035863)
      should be replaced by this more specific term.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      TMEM67 directly binds WNT5A via its extracellular cysteine-rich domain, a
      core molecular function for this protein. The Wnt-protein binding term is
      significantly more informative than generic protein binding and captures a
      key functional attribute of TMEM67 as a non-canonical Wnt receptor.

          Recently, it has been suggested that Meckelin can function as a receptor
          of β-catenin–independent signaling that binds to Wnt5a and mediates
          downstream signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan
          receptor 2 as a coreceptor, thereby controlling basal body positioning
          and epithelial branching morphogenesis (12).

    TMEM67 (meckelin) acts as a receptor for non-canonical Wnt signaling by directly
    binding WNT5A through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). It cooperates
    with ROR2 as a co-receptor to mediate non-canonical Wnt signaling that controls
    basal body positioning and epithelial branching morphogenesis. TMEM67 is essential
    for phosphorylation of ROR2 upon WNT5A stimulation.

        We propose that TMEM67 is a receptor that has a main role in non-canonical Wnt
        signalling, mediated by Wnt5a and ROR2, and normally represses Shh signalling.

  description: >-
    The cytoplasmic domain of TMEM67 directly interacts with filamin A (FLNA) at the
    apical cell surface associated with the basal body. This interaction mediates
    ciliogenesis and basal body positioning. Loss of filamin A phenocopies meckelin loss,
    causing basal body positioning and ciliogenesis defects.
