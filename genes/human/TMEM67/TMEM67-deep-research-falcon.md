## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q5HYA8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Meckelin; AltName: Full=Meckel syndrome type 3 protein; AltName: Full=Transmembrane protein 67; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=TMEM67; Synonyms=MKS3;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Growth_fac_rcpt_cys_sf. (IPR009030); Meckelin. (IPR019170); Meckelin (PF09773)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TMEM67" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TMEM67' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TMEM67** (gene ID: TMEM67, UniProt: Q5HYA8) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Report—Human TMEM67 (Meckelin/MKS3; UniProt Q5HYA8)

Publication date: 2026-02-20

1. Target identity verification (gene/protein disambiguation)
TMEM67 (UniProt Q5HYA8) encodes Meckelin (also called Meckel syndrome type 3 protein; MKS3), a single-pass transmembrane ciliary protein implicated in Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS), Joubert syndrome, nephronophthisis, and related ciliopathies. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
2.1 Primary cilium and transition zone (TZ)
The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle nucleated at the basal body and enclosed by a specialized membrane enriched for receptors/channels; it functions as a “cellular antenna” for transducing extracellular signals that regulate development and tissue homeostasis. (kalot2024primaryciliaand pages 2-3)
The transition zone (TZ) is a specialized ciliary base region often described as a diffusion/trafficking barrier (“gate”) regulating the protein/lipid composition of the ciliary membrane and axoneme; disruption of TZ modules is a central mechanism in many ciliopathies. In the MKS spectrum, proteins including TMEM67 localize to ciliary base subcompartments such as transitional fibers and the TZ. (stayner2017anovinehepatorenal pages 2-4)

2.2 TMEM67/Meckelin as a TZ scaffold and signaling co-receptor
Current evidence supports TMEM67 as a dual-function protein: (i) a structural/scaffolding role at the ciliary transition zone that supports TZ assembly and ciliogenesis, and (ii) a cell-surface role in non-canonical Wnt signaling mediated by its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5)

3. Protein architecture, domains, and topology
3.1 Domain architecture/topology
TMEM67 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with an N-terminal extracellular region containing a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) homologous to Frizzled/ROR receptors (a Wnt-binding module), followed by additional extracellular structure, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with predicted coiled-coil features relevant to protein–protein interactions. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 1b585f6a)
A 2024 mechanistic study further maps ADAMTS9 cleavage sites within an extracellular linker region between the CRD and a β-sheet-rich domain, supporting modular separation between the Wnt-related ectodomain and the TZ-related C-terminal portion. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 26-30, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 1b585f6a)

3.2 Proteolytic processing as a functional switch (recent development)
Recent work identifies TMEM67 as a proteolytic substrate of the extracellular metalloproteinase ADAMTS9, generating two functional forms: a released N-terminal ectodomain fragment (proposed to modulate Wnt signaling) and a C-terminal fragment (Δ342) that localizes to the TZ and supports ciliogenesis/TZ assembly. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 26-30, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 5-8)
Cleavage products were detected experimentally, including a ~34 kDa fragment in conditioned medium for wild-type cells that is absent when ADAMTS9 is knocked out or when TMEM67 cleavage is disrupted. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23)

4. Subcellular localization
4.1 Transition zone localization
In serum-starved human RPE-1 cells, the TMEM67 C-terminus colocalizes with the basal body/TZ marker CEP170 in wild-type conditions, while this TZ localization is lost in ADAMTS9 knockout cells, linking cleavage to correct subcellular targeting. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 26-30, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 5bdc045d)
The cleaved/trimmed C-terminal product (Δ342) is sufficient for TZ localization and can restore aspects of ciliogenesis in TMEM67 knockout cells, consistent with a TZ-scaffold role for the C-terminal region. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 26-30)

4.2 Broader ciliary-base compartment localization context
Background from a large-animal TMEM67 ciliopathy model notes that MKS proteins (including TMEM67) can localize to centrosome/basal body, pericentriolar region, transitional fibers, the TZ, or the cilium, supporting a ciliary-base compartment role as a general principle across models. (stayner2017anovinehepatorenal pages 2-4)

5. Molecular functions and pathways
5.1 Transition zone assembly, ciliogenesis, and ciliary “gate” integrity
Functional disruption of TMEM67 (or its cleavage) produces defects in ciliogenesis and TZ ultrastructure, including loss of the TZ “necklace” formation in a cleavage-deficient mouse model, supporting the concept that TMEM67 contributes to the architecture required for a functional TZ barrier. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 33-37)
In human cell models, loss of TMEM67 or ADAMTS9 causes reduced recruitment/localization of multiple MKS/B9 module proteins (e.g., TCTN1/2/3, TMEM237, CC2D2A, B9D2) to mature basal bodies/TZ, indicating that TMEM67 is positioned as a central organizer within MKS-related TZ assemblies. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 30-33)

5.2 Wnt signaling (non-canonical and canonical)
Non-canonical Wnt5a signaling: TMEM67’s extracellular CRD participates in a complex with Wnt5a and ROR2 and is required for ROR2 phosphorylation, consistent with TMEM67 functioning as a co-receptor (or co-receptor-like component) in non-canonical Wnt signaling. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5)
Canonical Wnt modulation: Tmem67 knockout mouse brains show elevated active β-catenin (canonical Wnt readout), whereas cleavage-deficient (non-cleavable) TMEM67 mice retain apparently normal canonical/non-canonical Wnt signaling while showing severe ciliogenesis/TZ phenotypes, supporting mechanistic separability of Wnt-related and TZ-related TMEM67 functions. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 33-37)
Expert interpretation (from the 2024 mechanistic study): proteolytic processing is proposed to generate distinct functional pools—one operating as a TZ scaffold (cleaved C-terminal product) and another mediating Wnt signaling (non-cleaved/full-length form or released ectodomain), potentially helping explain phenotypic heterogeneity across the TMEM67 ciliopathy spectrum. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 26-30)

6. Disease associations and genotype–phenotype (human-focused)
6.1 Core TMEM67-associated disorders
TMEM67 is repeatedly associated with Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS), Joubert syndrome (including Joubert syndrome 6/COACH spectrum), nephronophthisis, and related ciliopathies such as RHYNS. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5)
A recent mechanistic report states TMEM67 is the most commonly mutated gene in MKS and estimates TMEM67 accounts for ~16–20% of MKS cases (review/summary claim within that study). (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5)
Epidemiologic context: MKS incidence has been reported to vary across populations (e.g., ~1:1300 in Gujarati Indians; ~1:3500 in North Africa; ~1:9000 in Finland, as summarized in a TMEM67 model paper), underscoring the clinical relevance of TMEM67 in high-incidence settings. (stayner2017anovinehepatorenal pages 2-4)

6.2 TMEM67 variants affecting the cleavage motif and renal phenotypes (recent development)
Patient variants near the TMEM67 cleavage motif (e.g., p.K329T, p.F342V, p.L349S) fail to rescue ciliogenesis/TZ localization in TMEM67 knockout cells and produce strong loss-of-function phenotypes in C. elegans MKS-3 assays, supporting clinical significance of this specific extracellular region for ciliopathy mechanisms. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 30-33, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 17-20)

6.3 Joubert syndrome with liver involvement
A 2024 clinical genetics report emphasizes that TMEM67 variants are strongly associated with JS-related disorders featuring liver involvement, stating that TMEM67 pathogenic variants “contribute to around 80%” of JS-related disorders characterized by liver involvement (summary statement) and highlighting mutational hotspots with exon 8 frequently mutated. (neissi2024joubertsyndromecaused pages 4-6)

7. Quantitative data and statistics from recent studies
7.1 Quantitative cilia phenotype linked to TMEM67 dysfunction
In a large-animal (ovine) TMEM67-associated Meckel-like hepatorenal model, cultured kidney interstitial fibroblasts showed significantly increased primary cilium length in affected animals versus controls (15.1 ± 1.8 µm vs 8.3 ± 1.0 µm; p < 0.01), while ciliation incidence was similar (unaffected 45% ± 7% vs affected 49% ± 3%). (stayner2017anovinehepatorenal pages 10-11)

7.2 Expanded carrier screening implementation (2023)
A 2023 European Journal of Human Genetics study evaluating NGS-based expanded carrier screening across 118 ciliopathy genes performed WES in 395 healthy individuals (176 couples plus 43 single parents) and validated patterns in a UK1958 cohort. (ella2023challengesforthe pages 2-3)
Key implementation-relevant numbers reported include:
• “48 pathogenic variants were found in 43 individuals,” corresponding to ~11% (43/395) carrying a pathogenic variant under the authors’ criteria. (ella2023challengesforthe pages 3-4)
• 197/395 (50%) individuals carried 1–5 “strong” VUS. (ella2023challengesforthe pages 3-4)
• Couples at risk: 2/177 (1%) couples had reportable pathogenic variants indicating elevated reproductive risk; considering strong VUS increased this to 7/177 (4%). (ella2023challengesforthe pages 3-4)
The same study discusses that panels could be complemented by adding genes including TMEM67 in certain screening strategies, reflecting practical considerations for carrier screening design and counseling. (ella2023challengesforthe pages 7-8)

7.3 Prenatal diagnosis yields in fetal posterior fossa malformations (2024)
A 2024 retrospective prenatal cohort study (51 pregnancies with fetal posterior fossa malformations, 2017–2022) compared karyotyping, CNV testing, and trio WES yields. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2)
Key diagnostic yield statistics include:
• Isolated posterior fossa malformations: pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs in 4/11 (36.36%); karyotype and WES negative in those cases. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2)
• Non-isolated posterior fossa malformations: sequential testing detection rate 19/40 (47.5%); karyotype 5/30 (16.67%), CNV testing 5/31 (16.13%), trio WES 9/22 (40.91%), with WES-positive genes including TMEM67. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2)
• Joubert syndrome subset: WES positive in 5/6 (83.33%), leading the authors to recommend WES as a first-line tool for prenatal Joubert evaluation. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2)

8. Current applications and real-world implementations
8.1 Molecular diagnostics and variant interpretation
TMEM67 is implemented clinically through gene panels and WES/WGS for ciliopathies (e.g., suspected MKS/JBTS/COACH/nephronophthisis), including prenatal testing workflows in fetal brain malformations where TMEM67 can be among detected causal genes. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2)
Carrier screening: implementation studies highlight high VUS rates and the need for gene- and protein-structure-informed prioritization of candidate missense variants for functional follow-up, with ciliopathies (including TMEM67-related disorders) serving as a case study for counseling and reporting policies. (ella2023challengesforthe pages 3-4, ella2023challengesforthe pages 7-8)

8.2 Functional assays and model systems
Recent TMEM67 functional annotation increasingly uses multi-system approaches: CRISPR knockouts in human RPE-1 cells, patient-variant complementation assays, C. elegans sensory readouts, and mouse allelic series (including cleavage-deficient alleles) to dissect the separation of TZ structural roles from Wnt signaling roles. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 30-33, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 33-37)
Large-animal models (ovine) provide quantitative cellular phenotypes (e.g., ciliary length dysregulation) and organ-level pathology relevant to hepatorenal fibrocystic disease. (stayner2017anovinehepatorenal pages 10-11)

8.3 Therapeutics and clinical trials
A clinical trials search identified ciliopathy-related observational and interventional studies in general, but no TMEM67-targeted interventional therapy trials were evident from retrieved trial metadata; thus, current “real-world” translation for TMEM67 remains predominantly genetic diagnosis, prognostic surveillance, and supportive management rather than gene-targeted pharmacotherapy. (juan2024optimalprenatalgenetic pages 1-2, ella2023challengesforthe pages 3-4)

9. Authoritative expert opinions and analysis (synthesis)
Mechanistic consensus is converging on TMEM67 as a transition-zone organizer within MKS/B9-related assemblies, where disruption destabilizes the TZ architecture and compromises ciliogenesis and cilium-dependent tissue patterning, producing multi-organ ciliopathy phenotypes. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 30-33, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 33-37)
A major 2024 conceptual advance is the cleavage-based “functional partitioning” model: ADAMTS9 processing yields a TZ-localized C-terminal TMEM67 form essential for ciliogenesis while leaving Wnt signaling capacity largely intact in cleavage-deficient settings, implying that different alleles (e.g., cleavage-motif variants vs null alleles) may differentially affect ciliary gating versus signaling outputs and contribute to variable expressivity across TMEM67-related disorders. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 20-23, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 1-5, ahmed2024twofunctionalforms pages 17-20)

10. Key figures supporting major claims (visual evidence)
• TMEM67 domain architecture and cleavage mapping (schematic with CRD, TM domain, and marked cleavage site). (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 1b585f6a)
• TMEM67 C-terminus colocalization with CEP170 at the transition zone and loss of this localization in ADAMTS9 knockout cells. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 5bdc045d)
• Quantification of % ciliated cells and cilium length in rescue experiments comparing full-length TMEM67, cleavage products, and cleavage-site mutants. (ahmed2024twofunctionalforms media 380ad8ce)

Limitations of this report
Some canonical TMEM67 annotations (e.g., detailed Hedgehog signaling mechanisms) are not directly evidenced in the retrieved full-text excerpts; the strongest mechanistic support in the current evidence set centers on TZ assembly/gating and Wnt5a–ROR2/non-canonical Wnt signaling.
