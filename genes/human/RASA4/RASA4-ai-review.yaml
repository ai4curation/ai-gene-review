description: 'RAS p21 protein activator 4 (CAPRI - Calcium-Promoted Ras Inactivator),
  calcium-regulated GTPase-activating protein for RAS and RAP1 small GTPases. Member
  of GAP1 family with two tandem C2 domains (Ca2+ and phospholipid binding), central
  GAP-related domain (GRD) for catalytic activity, and C-terminal pleckstrin homology
  (PH) domain with Bruton''s tyrosine kinase (Btk) motif. Unique calcium sensor that
  links intracellular Ca2+ signals to Ras inactivation. Cytosolic protein at rest
  that rapidly translocates to inner plasma membrane upon Ca2+ elevation via C2 domain
  binding to anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylserine). PH domain atypical - does
  not bind phosphoinositides due to Leu→Arg substitution. Dual substrate specificity:
  catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on Ras family GTPases (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras) and Rap1 via
  arginine-finger mechanism. Oligomerization state regulates substrate preference
  - monomeric form predominantly RasGAP, while Ca2+-induced homodimers exhibit enhanced
  Rap1GAP activity. Functions as negative regulator of Ras-MAPK and Rap1-integrin
  signaling pathways. Critical for immune cell function: in neutrophils, enables chemotaxis
  through high-concentration gradients by mediating GPCR-induced Ras adaptation -
  loss causes hyperactive Ras-GTP, excessive F-actin polymerization, and defective
  directional migration. In macrophages, essential for Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis
  - CAPRI acts as adaptor linking FcγR calcium signals to coordinated regulation of
  Ras (inactivation) and Cdc42/Rac1 (activation) for phagosome formation. CAPRI-knockout
  mice show ~80% lethality to Salmonella infection due to impaired bacterial clearance.
  Tumor suppressor-like function - loss leads to prolonged Ras-MAPK signaling. Downregulated
  in cervical cancer (~AUC 0.986 diagnostic value); forced expression suppresses proliferation
  by inactivating HIF-1α/survivin pathway. Somatic mutations (e.g. D111N in DLBCL)
  associated with enhanced ERK/MAPK activation and cancer progression. Broadly expressed
  with high levels in immune organs (spleen, lymph nodes). Acts as amplitude sensor
  for Ca2+ bursts, translating calcium signal intensity into proportional Ras inactivation.
  Provides negative feedback loop preventing overactivation of growth and immune signaling
  pathways.'
