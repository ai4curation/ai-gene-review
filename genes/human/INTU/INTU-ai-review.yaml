description: INTU (Inturned) is a scaffold protein that functions as a core component of the CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector) complex at basal bodies, where it recruits intraflagellar transport machinery, specifically IFT-A proteins. INTU also serves as an adaptor linking ciliary proteins (NPHP4) to actin-modifying proteins (DAAM1) to control the subapical actin network required for basal body docking and ciliary orientation. Essential for primary cilia assembly and Hedgehog signaling, INTU is mutated in ciliopathies including Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome XVII and Short-Rib Thoracic Dysplasia 20.

  review:
    summary: 'IBA annotation for cytoplasmic localization is supported by experimental evidence. INTU has cytosolic fractions when not assembled at cilia and likely shuttles between cytosol and ciliary base. The deep research confirms cytosolic localization (GO_REF:0000052).'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GO_REF:0000052 provides direct immunofluorescence evidence for cytoplasmic localization, and PMID:27158779 shows INTU can exist in cytosolic pools when not assembled at ciliary structures.

    summary: 'Core function strongly supported by multiple experimental studies. INTU is essential for ciliogenesis through its role in the CPLANE complex recruiting IFT-A machinery to basal bodies (PMID:27158779). Mouse knockouts lack primary cilia, and human mutations cause ciliopathies.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:27158779 demonstrated INTU is a core component of the CPLANE complex that recruits IFT-A proteins to basal bodies, with knockout mice showing complete absence of primary cilia and human mutations causing OFD syndrome XVII.

  review:
    summary: 'While INTU localizes primarily at the basal body/ciliary base rather than within the cilium proper, this broader cellular component term is acceptable as INTU is functionally associated with ciliary structures. More specific localization would be ciliary basal body (GO:0036064).'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:26644512 and PMID:27158779 demonstrate that INTU specifically localizes to ciliary basal bodies rather than within the cilium itself. GO:0036064 more accurately captures this specific localization.
