description: >-
  ATG4D is a cysteine protease of the peptidase C54 family that plays a key role in
  autophagy
  by mediating both proteolytic activation (priming) and delipidation of ATG8-family
  proteins
  (LC3/GABARAP). While ATG4D shows weak priming activity compared to ATG4B, it constitutes
  the major protein for delipidation activity in cells, particularly for LC3B. ATG4D
  can
  remove ATG8 from both PE and PS conjugates, functioning in both canonical macroautophagy
  and noncanonical single-membrane ATG8 conjugation (CASM). The protein contains a
  cryptic
  mitochondrial targeting sequence that is exposed upon caspase-3 cleavage at DEVD63,
  leading to mitochondrial import and roles in mitophagy/mitochondrial quality control.
  Human biallelic ATG4D variants are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders with
  cerebellar involvement.

            All human ATG4 isoforms contribute to the priming of LC3/GABARAP isoforms,
            because complete loss of LC3/GABARAP priming and lipidation in cells could
            only be achieved upon loss of all ATG4 isoforms

    review:

        ATG4D promotes protein localization to the phagophore assembly site by regulating
        ATG9A vesicle trafficking. This is a protease-independent function.

        Experimentally demonstrated function. ATG4D has a non-canonical role in promoting
        ATG9A trafficking to the phagophore assembly site, independent of its protease
        activity (PMID:33773106).

    review:
      summary: >-
        ATG4D catalyzes protein delipidation, removing ATG8-family proteins from membrane
        lipids. In reconstituted delipidation assays, all four ATG4 proteases can
        be
        activated to similar activities on lipid-attached substrates.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        Core molecular function. ATG4D is the predominant delipidating enzyme for
        LC3B
        in cells, more important for delipidation than for priming (PMID:29458288).

            In a fully reconstituted delipidation assay, we establish that the physical
            anchoring of mammalian Atg8-family proteins in the membrane dramatically
            shifts
            the way ATG4 proteases recognize these substrates

    review:
      summary: >-
        ATG4D performs proteolysis of ATG8 substrates. Kinetic analysis demonstrated
        proteolytic activity against LC3B and GABARAPL2, though with lower activity
        than ATG4B.

        Core function directly demonstrated. ATG4D cleaves ATG8 substrates, with Km

        ATG4D has cysteine-type peptidase activity demonstrated by kinetic analysis.

      ATG4D's primary molecular function is delipidation of ATG8-PE conjugates. While
      it has weak priming activity compared to ATG4B, ATG4D is the major delipidating
      enzyme in mammalian cells, particularly for LC3B.
