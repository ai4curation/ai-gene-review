## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q86TL0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cysteine protease ATG4D {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.4.22.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177865}; AltName: Full=AUT-like 4 cysteine endopeptidase; AltName: Full=Autophagy-related cysteine endopeptidase 4 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12446702}; Short=Autophagin-4 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12446702}; AltName: Full=Autophagy-related protein 4 homolog D {ECO:0000305}; Short=HsAPG4D {ECO:0000303|PubMed:29458288}; Contains: RecName: Full=Cysteine protease ATG4D, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATG4D {ECO:0000303|PubMed:19549685, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:20789}; Synonyms=APG4D {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:20789}, AUTL4 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:20789};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase C54 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Papain-like_cys_pep_sf. (IPR038765); Peptidase_C54. (IPR005078); Peptidase_C54_cat. (IPR046792); Peptidase_C54 (PF03416)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATG4D" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATG4D' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATG4D** (gene ID: ATG4D, UniProt: Q86TL0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human ATG4D (UniProt Q86TL0)

Verification of target identity and context
- Gene/protein identity: ATG4D is one of four mammalian ATG4 cysteine proteases (ATG4A–D) that process ATG8-family proteins; it belongs to the peptidase C54 family, consistent with UniProt Q86TL0 (human) annotation (review context on ATG4 proteases and their roles in the ATG8 conjugation system) (fernandez2015thefunctionaland pages 1-2, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2). 
- Organism: Homo sapiens. The cited review specifically focuses on the mammalian/human ATG4D paralog (Autophagy, 2024-07; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2369436) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Core biochemical role of ATG4 family: ATG4 proteases catalyze two reactions on ATG8-family proteins (human LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies): (i) priming—C‑terminal proteolysis to expose the invariant glycine for conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and (ii) delipidation—hydrolysis to remove ATG8 from membranes when remodeling autophagosomes or other ATG8-decorated membranes (JCI review; 2015-01; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci73940) (fernandez2015thefunctionaland pages 1-2). 
- ATG4D’s relative activities: In soluble in vitro priming assays, ATG4D is the least active of the paralogs (ATG4B>ATG4A>ATG4C>ATG4D). However, post-translational processing (caspase‑3 cleavage) markedly increases its activity; cellular and animal data identify ATG4D as a principal delipidating enzyme in vivo, particularly for LC3B (Autophagy, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2369436) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2).

| Aspect | Summary | Key evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Human ATG4D (UniProt Q86TL0), member of ATG4/peptidase C54 family (four mammalian paralogs ATG4A–D). | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2, fernandez2015thefunctionaland pages 1-2) |
| Enzymatic functions | Weak C-terminal priming activity relative to ATG4B but a primary delipidating protease in cells; delipidates ATG8/LC3 and GABARAP paralogs (notably LC3B); can remove ATG8 from both PE and PS conjugates. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5) |
| Substrate specificity (LC3/GABARAP) | Prefers delipidation of LC3B in vivo; shows limited soluble priming for many GABARAPs but can prime GABARAPL1 in some assays/cell contexts. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5) |
| Localization | Localizes to autophagosomal/autolysosomal membranes under basal conditions; caspase-cleaved fragment (ΔN63) translocates to mitochondria (outer membrane and matrix) and associates with cardiolipin. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8) |
| Regulation & post‑translational control | Cleaved by caspase‑3 at DEVD63 → ΔN63 fragment with enhanced delipidation/priming and mitochondrial targeting; cryptic mitochondrial targeting motif and a BH3-like region modulate mitochondrial association and cytotoxicity. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5) |
| Pathway roles | Acts in canonical macroautophagy (delipidation of ATG8s from autophagosomes) and in noncanonical single-membrane ATG8 conjugation/CASM (delipidation of ATG8‑PS); implicated in mitophagy/mitochondrial quality control. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8) |
| Disease links & model phenotypes | Human biallelic variants linked to neurodevelopmental disorder with motor/cerebellar involvement; canine recessive ATG4D variant causes vacuolar storage disease/cerebellar ataxia; atg4d−/− mice show Purkinje cell loss, progressive cerebellar ataxia; zebrafish knockdown yields CNS defects. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6) |
| Recent developments (2023–2024) | 2024 review consolidates genetic disease links, clarifies dominant role in delipidation (vs priming), highlights caspase‑3 cleavage → mitochondrial targeting, and raises open questions about ATG8‑PS vs ATG8‑PE specificity and roles in EV biology/CASM. | (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 8-9, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8) |

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Consolidated 2024 synthesis: A 2024 Autophagy review highlights emerging roles for ATG4D as the main cellular ATG8 delipidating enzyme, with disease genetics, mitochondrial targeting after caspase‑3 cleavage, and functions in canonical and noncanonical ATG8 cycles (Autophagy, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2369436) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 8-9, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 1-2). 
- Delipidation and ATG8-PS vs ATG8-PE: ATG4D can remove LC3B conjugated to either PE or PS on single membranes, and ATG4D knockout causes accumulation of LC3B–PS, clarifying a role in noncanonical ATG8 cycles at single membranes (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Mitochondrial biology and targeting: Caspase‑3 cleavage at DEVD63 generates ΔN63 ATG4D exposing a mitochondrial targeting sequence; ΔN63 localizes to mitochondrial surfaces and matrix, displays cardiolipin affinity, and influences mitochondrial ultrastructure—linking ATG4D to mitophagy/mitochondrial quality control (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6). 
- Genetic disease links: Recent human reports (summarized in 2024 review) associate biallelic ATG4D variants with neurodevelopmental syndromes; complementary canine and mouse data strengthen neuroprotective roles (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8). 

3) Primary function, substrates, and pathway positioning
- Catalytic class and reaction: ATG4D is a papain-like cysteine endopeptidase (peptidase C54 family) acting on ATG8s; it performs (i) priming of pro-ATG8s (weak relative to ATG4B) and (ii) delipidation of membrane-conjugated ATG8s, with a predominant in vivo role in delipidating lipidated LC3, notably LC3B (JCI 2015; Autophagy 2024) (fernandez2015thefunctionaland pages 1-2, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11). 
- Substrate specificity: Biochemical and cellular evidence indicate ATG4D displays limited soluble priming for GABARAP family members but can prime GABARAPL1 in some contexts; delipidation appears to favor LC3B in cells (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Noncanonical role (CASM context): ATG4D delipidates ATG8 from single-membrane organelles, including LC3B–PS, situating it as a regulator of noncanonical ATG8 conjugation systems in addition to canonical macroautophagy (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11).

4) Cellular localization and site of action
- Basal localization: ATG4D is implicated in delipidating ATG8 on outer autophagosomal membranes and on autolysosomes; atg4d−/− cells accumulate LC3B on the cytosolic leaflet of autolysosomes, despite fusion competence (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Mitochondria: Caspase‑3 cleavage creates ΔN63 ATG4D with mitochondrial targeting; ΔN63 localizes to the outer membrane and matrix and interacts with cardiolipin, supporting a role at mitochondria consistent with observed mitophagy phenotypes (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6). 

5) Regulation and interaction themes
- Proteolytic regulation: Caspase‑3 cleavage at a DEVD motif near the N-terminus (DEVD63) increases catalytic activity (priming and especially delipidation) and redirects localization toward mitochondria via an exposed targeting sequence; a BH3-like region modulates mitochondrial association and cytotoxicity (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Interaction with ATG8s: ATG4D contains a C‑terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR), akin to ATG4B, consistent with regulated docking on ATG8-decorated membranes prior to catalysis (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3). 
- System-level modulation: Screening evidence (kinases/phosphatases; small-molecule/siRNA regulators) impacting ATG4 activity has been reported, underscoring the potential to modulate ATG4D function pharmacologically (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11).

6) Roles in macroautophagy, mitophagy, and noncanonical ATG8 conjugation
- Macroautophagy: Genetic loss of ATG4D increases cellular pools of lipidated Atg8 family proteins (notably LC3B), consistent with a key role in delipidating outer autophagosomal membranes to complete cycles of LC3/GABARAP recycling (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11). 
- Mitophagy: ATG4D re-expression restores mitophagy more effectively than ATG4B in ATG4‑quadruple knockout cells; ΔN63 ATG4D’s mitochondrial targeting, cardiolipin affinity, and effects on cristae support function in mitochondrial quality control (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Noncanonical conjugation/CASM: ATG4D delipidates LC3B–PS from single membranes, a hallmark of CASM-like contexts, indicating a role in surveilling and resolving noncanonical ATG8 conjugation (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11).

7) Disease associations and model evidence
- Human genetics: Biallelic ATG4D variants are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders with motor/cerebellar involvement; several disease-associated variants reduce GABARAPL1 priming in vitro and show partial rescue of ATG8 accumulation, indicating hypomorphic effects (summarized in 2024 review; Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8). 
- Canine pathology: A recessive missense variant (ATG4D A430T) causes a neurodegenerative vacuolar storage disease with progressive cerebellar ataxia; fibroblasts show basal LC3 accumulation and altered extracellular vesicle biology (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6). 
- Mouse phenotypes: atg4d−/− mice develop Purkinje cell loss, progressive cerebellar ataxia, accumulation of autophagosomes and membrane-bound LC3 (e.g., GFP-LC3B puncta) and SQSTM1; ultrastructural “dark cell degeneration” features implicate mitochondrial dysfunction (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8). 
- Zebrafish: Knockdown leads to CNS malformations and cerebellar neuronal deficits, supporting conserved nervous system vulnerability to ATG4D loss (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8). 

8) Current applications and implementations
- Research biomarkers and assays: Accumulation of lipidated LC3/GABARAP (notably LC3B) upon ATG4D loss is used as a functional readout of impaired delipidation in cells and mice; rescue assays with wild-type or variant ATG4D measure functional competence (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8). 
- Comparative functional complementation: In ATG4‑quadruple knockout cells, ATG4D reconstitution is employed to benchmark mitophagy restoration relative to other paralogs (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6). 

9) Expert opinions and analysis
- Paradigm shift toward delipidation: While ATG4B is the canonical priming protease, the emerging consensus is that ATG4D plays a predominant role in cellular delipidation, including noncanonical single-membrane contexts. The 2024 review underscores isoform specialization and context-dependent regulation (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 8-9, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5). 
- Mitochondrial linkages: Caspase‑3 activation of ATG4D integrates stress signals with mitochondrial targeting, aligning delipidation capacity with mitochondrial quality control, which may underlie the strong cerebellar sensitivity observed in multiple species (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 5-6, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8).

10) Quantitative/genetic data highlights
- Relative activity ranking in priming assays: ATG4B>ATG4A>ATG4C>ATG4D (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 2-3). 
- Genetic loss phenotypes: atg4d−/− mice exhibit progressive motor deficits and Purkinje cell loss with accumulated LC3 puncta and SQSTM1; human variants often show reduced GABARAPL1 priming and incomplete rescue in cellular assays (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 6-8, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11). 

11) Gaps and open questions
- Substrate and membrane specificity: Precise breadth of ATG8-PS versus ATG8-PE selectivity across tissues, and the contribution to extracellular vesicle biology/LDELS, remain open lines of investigation (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 3-5, mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 8-9). 
- Pharmacology: While screens identify potential regulators of ATG4 activity, dedicated, selective ATG4D modulators with in vivo validation are not yet established in the 2024 synthesis (Autophagy, 2024-07) (mcmann2024lastbutnot pages 10-11).
