description: X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a master regulatory long non-coding
  RNA that orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation in female mammalian cells. XIST
  coats the inactive X chromosome and recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to establish
  and maintain transcriptional silencing.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on a study of XIST function in gastric cancer
      cells, not its canonical X-inactivation role. The paper shows XIST acting as
      a ceRNA to sponge miR-185. While potentially real in cancer contexts, this represents
      a non-physiological over-annotation of XIST's core function.
