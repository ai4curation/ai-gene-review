gene_symbol: XIST
product_type: LNCRNA
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a master regulatory long non-coding RNA that orchestrates X-chromosome inactivation in female mammalian cells. XIST coats the inactive X chromosome and recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to establish and maintain transcriptional silencing.
