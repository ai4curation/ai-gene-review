description: >-
  IL2RA (CD25, p55, TAC antigen) encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor.
  IL2RA is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing two Sushi/CCP (complement control protein)
  domains in its extracellular region. It binds IL-2 with low affinity (Kd ~10 nM) on its own, but
  its primary role is to capture IL-2 and present it to the signaling-competent IL-2Rbeta/gammac
  heterodimer, thereby forming the high-affinity trimeric receptor complex (Kd ~10 pM).
  IL2RA itself has a very short cytoplasmic tail (13 residues) and does not directly transduce signals.
  It is constitutively expressed on FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and is induced on
  activated conventional T cells. By enabling Tregs to respond to very low concentrations of IL-2,
  IL2RA is critical for immune tolerance and T cell homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations cause
  immunodeficiency with lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity (IMD41), and common variants at the
  IL2RA locus are associated with type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis susceptibility.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation to inflammatory response based on phylogenetic inference.
      IL2RA is part of the IL-2 signaling axis that regulates immune responses, and
      loss of CD25 leads to autoimmune inflammatory disease (PMID:23416241, PMID:9096364).
      However, IL2RA itself is a receptor subunit rather than a direct inflammatory mediator.
      The inflammatory phenotype arises indirectly from loss of immune tolerance.
      The IBA annotation is at an appropriate level of generality given that IL-2 signaling
      through this receptor modulates inflammatory processes.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

      IL2RA participates in inflammatory response indirectly by controlling IL-2 signaling

      function of IL2RA; it is a downstream consequence of its receptor role. The IBA

      IMP annotation with contributes_to qualifier for IL-2 receptor activity, based on
      Tsudo et al. 1989 (PMID:2467293). This paper characterizes the IL-2 receptor beta
      chain and demonstrates that the alpha chain (p55/IL2RA) contributes to high-affinity
      IL-2 binding. Blocking the beta chain with Mik-beta 1 antibody completely abolished
      high-affinity IL-2 binding, showing both chains are required.

          The human high-affinity receptor for interleukin 2 (IL-2) has been proposed as
          being a membrane complex composed of at least two distinct polypeptide chains:
          p55 (alpha chain), recognized by the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody (mAb), and p75
          (beta chain), both of which are capable of binding IL-2. Whereas the alpha chain
          itself has been shown to be nonfunctional, the beta chain appears to be pivotal
          in the IL-2 signal transduction, although the beta chain is otherwise poorly
          characterized.

      IL2RA directly binds IL-2 with low affinity (~10 nM Kd) through its extracellular
      Sushi/CCP domains. This is the primary molecular function that enables all downstream
      effects. The crystal structure (PMID:16477002) shows IL2RA forms the largest interface
      with IL-2 among the three receptor chains. IL2RA captures IL-2 and presents it to
      IL2RB, converting the intermediate-affinity beta/gamma receptor (Kd ~1 nM) into the
      high-affinity trimeric receptor (Kd ~10 pM).

          IL-2R alpha makes no contacts with IL-2R beta or gamma(c), and only minor changes
          are observed in the IL-2 structure in response to receptor binding. These findings
          support the principal role of IL-2R alpha to deliver IL-2 to the signaling complex.

      IL2RA on Tregs enables preferential IL-2 consumption and STAT5 signaling at low
      IL-2 concentrations, maintaining Treg homeostasis and immune tolerance. Its expression
      determines which cells respond to low IL-2 concentrations (constitutively expressed
      on Tregs, induced on activated T cells), thereby gating access to the IL-2 signaling
      pathway. Loss of IL2RA leads to autoimmunity (PMID:23416241).

          we show that CD25 expression is required to maintain immune homeostasis, and CD25
          deficiency is a distinct immunological disease that leads to both an autoimmune and
          immunodeficiency syndrome that clinically resembles IPEX syndrome.

          Naive T cells express only a low density of IL-2Rbeta and IL-2Rgamma, and are
          therefore relatively insensitive to IL-2, but acquire sensitivity after CD25
          expression, which captures the cytokine and presents it to IL-2Rbeta and IL-2Rgamma.
