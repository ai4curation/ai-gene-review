## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P01589
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha; Short=IL-2 receptor subunit alpha; Short=IL-2-RA; Short=IL-2R subunit alpha; Short=IL2-RA; AltName: Full=TAC antigen; AltName: Full=p55; AltName: CD_antigen=CD25; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL2RA;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** IL-2_rcpt_alpha. (IPR015486); Sushi/SCR/CCP_sf. (IPR035976); Sushi_SCR_CCP_dom. (IPR000436); Sushi (PF00084)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL2RA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL2RA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL2RA** (gene ID: IL2RA, UniProt: P01589) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- Verified target identity and scope: IL2RA encodes the human interleukin‑2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), component of the IL‑2 receptor; organism is Homo sapiens. Literature on CD25/IL‑2Rα in human aligns with a glycosylated ectodomain that captures IL‑2 to assemble the high‑affinity IL‑2R with IL‑2Rβ and γc; no conflicting gene symbol usage was found. (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- Collected and synthesized recent evidence (2023–2025) on receptor assembly/affinity, expression/localization, downstream signaling, soluble CD25, and clinical/therapeutic directions (low‑dose IL‑2 and engineered IL‑2 agonists). (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2, slivkova2025theroleof pages 12-15, seddu2025interleukin2drivenmodulationof pages 19-24, lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2, slivkova2025theroleof pages 41-43)

Comprehensive research report

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and primary function: IL2RA (CD25) encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin‑2 receptor (IL‑2Rα). CD25 by itself binds IL‑2 with low affinity and primarily functions to capture and present IL‑2 in cis to IL‑2Rβ (CD122) and the common γ chain (γc, CD132) to form the high‑affinity signaling receptor on lymphocytes. (Immunity, 2024; doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2024.02.001, published March 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- IL‑2 receptor assembly and affinities: The high‑affinity IL‑2R is a heterotrimer of IL‑2Rα/β/γc with an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of about 10 pM, whereas the intermediate‑affinity β/γc dimer binds IL‑2 at ~1 nM, and IL‑2Rα alone binds at ~10 nM. CD25 thus increases apparent affinity ~100‑fold by recruiting β/γc to the ligand‑bound complex. (Oncoimmunology, 2025; doi:10.1080/2162402x.2025.2452654, published January 2025) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- Cell type expression and localization: CD25 is constitutively high on FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), is rapidly induced on antigen‑activated conventional T cells, is expressed by group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and can be present on some regulatory NK subsets. CD25 resides at the plasma membrane; upon IL‑2 engagement the receptor complex internalizes, terminating signaling and enabling ligand/receptor turnover. (Immunity, 2024; doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2024.02.001, March 2024; Oncoimmunology, 2025) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- Soluble CD25 (sCD25): CD25’s ectodomain can be proteolytically released, generating soluble IL‑2Rα (sCD25) detectable in blood/CSF as a marker of T‑cell activation. sCD25 may bind IL‑2 and act as a decoy, reducing free IL‑2 bioavailability. (Frontiers/Reviews cited in 2024–2025 syntheses) (slivkova2025theroleof pages 41-43)

Cellular and biochemical mechanism of action (localization, pathways, substrate/ligand specificity)
- Ligand and receptor specificity: IL‑2 is a 133‑aa cytokine produced mainly by activated T cells; high‑affinity recognition requires the α/β/γc trimer. IL‑2Rβ/γc alone mediate intermediate‑affinity signaling and are abundant on NK cells and memory‑phenotype CD8+ T cells, allowing responses at higher IL‑2 levels even without CD25. (Oncoimmunology, 2025; Immunity, 2024) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2, shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- Subcellular site of action: CD25 functions at the plasma membrane to capture IL‑2 and nucleate assembly of the signaling dimer (β/γc) with associated Janus kinases. Ligand–receptor complexes undergo endocytosis after activation. (Immunity, 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- Downstream signaling: Productive signaling is transduced by JAK1 (bound to IL‑2Rβ) and JAK3 (bound to γc), which phosphorylate receptor cytoplasmic motifs and recruit STAT5A/B for phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation. IL‑2 also activates PI3K→AKT→mTOR and RAS→MAPK cascades; proteomic studies attribute the majority (~90%) of IL‑2‑regulated phosphorylation events to JAK‑dependent pathways. In Tregs, high PTEN biases signaling toward STAT5 and away from PI3K–AKT–mTOR. (Immunity, 2024; mechanistic reviews 2025) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, slivkova2025theroleof pages 12-15)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2025)
- Quantitative binding and selective agonism through engineering: A 2024 engineered covalent IL‑2/anti‑IL‑2 fusion (IL‑2/SD‑01) increased apparent affinity to IL‑2Rα to ~0.13 nM while abrogating binding to IL‑2Rβγ, driving highly selective STAT5 activation in human Tregs (reported Treg EC50 ≈ 0.0003 nM). This validates tunable receptor bias via altered α vs βγ engagement and extends cytokine half‑life via Fc fusion. (Communications Biology, 2024; doi:10.1038/s42003-024-05987-z, published March 2024) (lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2)
- Low‑dose IL‑2 and receptor‑selective strategies: Contemporary reviews and experimental studies emphasize dose‑dependent biology—very low IL‑2 preferentially sustains CD25hi Tregs, whereas higher doses broaden activity to CD8+ T and NK cells via βγ receptors. Multiple approaches (muteins, PEGylation, IL‑2:mAb complexes, and immunocytokines) are in late preclinical/clinical phases to improve therapeutic index and Treg or effector bias. As of 2024, >50 next‑generation IL‑2 agonist trials were active. (Oncoimmunology, 2025; Immunity, 2024) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2, shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- Mechanistic consolidation of signaling strength: A 2024 Immunity synthesis clarifies that IL‑2 signaling strength and receptor composition regulate fate decisions and proliferation across T‑cell subsets, with STAT5 as the dominant effector and PI3K/MAPK contributing to metabolic and cell‑cycle programs. (Immunity, 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Immunoregulation with low‑dose IL‑2: Clinically, low‑dose IL‑2 regimens exploit constitutive CD25 expression on Tregs to restore immune tolerance in autoimmune/inflammatory settings by selectively expanding/activating Tregs while minimizing effector activation. Emerging engineered IL‑2s seek to broaden this window by increasing CD25 bias and half‑life. (Immunity, 2024; Communications Biology, 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2)
- Cancer immunotherapy: High‑dose IL‑2 can drive durable responses in subsets of metastatic RCC and melanoma but is limited by toxicity (hypotension, vascular leak). Next‑gen IL‑2 agonists are being developed to preferentially stimulate CD8+ T and NK cells or, conversely, to avoid Treg activation, via decreased CD25 affinity and increased βγ engagement, fusion formats, or targeted delivery. (Oncoimmunology, 2025) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The Immunity 2024 review by Malek and colleagues highlights that CD25 converts low ambient IL‑2 signals into potent STAT5‑dominant programs in Tregs, with PTEN enforcing Treg selectivity; it underscores that >600 IL‑2‑regulated phospho‑events are largely JAK‑dependent, prioritizing JAK–STAT5 as the central axis for therapeutic tuning. URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2024.02.001 (published March 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- The 2025 Oncoimmunology perspective quantifies IL‑2R affinities and catalogs the rapid expansion of next‑gen IL‑2 agonists, arguing for receptor‑biased designs (e.g., βγ‑selective variants for cancer; α‑biased for autoimmunity) to separate efficacy from toxicity. URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2025.2452654 (published January 2025) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- The 2024 Communications Biology study provides quantitative validation that covalent IL‑2/anti‑IL‑2 fusions can achieve strong Treg selectivity by enhancing IL‑2Rα engagement and eliminating βγ binding, offering a blueprint for clinical translation with improved pharmacokinetics. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-05987-z (published March 2024) (lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Affinity constants for human IL‑2R subunits/assemblies: trimeric α/β/γc Kd ≈ 10 pM; dimeric β/γc Kd ≈ 1 nM; α alone Kd ≈ 10 nM. These values rationalize Treg hypersensitivity to low‑abundance IL‑2 and effector responses at higher doses. (Oncoimmunology, 2025) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- Engineered Treg‑selective IL‑2 fusion: ~85‑fold increased apparent α‑chain affinity (to ~0.13 nM) with loss of βγ binding; Treg STAT5 EC50 ≈ 0.0003 nM, demonstrating potent, highly selective signaling. (Communications Biology, 2024) (lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2)
- JAK‑dependency of IL‑2 signaling: phosphoproteomics attribute ~90% of IL‑2‑regulated phospho‑events to JAK‑dependent mechanisms, consolidating JAK1/3 as proximal therapeutic nodes. (Immunity, 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)

Functional role and pathway placement of IL2RA (CD25)
- Precise role: CD25 is a non‑signaling capture/presentation module that dramatically increases the sensitivity of IL‑2R signaling in CD25‑expressing cells by facilitating assembly of the signaling‑competent β/γc dimer with IL‑2. Its expression is the dominant determinant of which cells respond to low‑level IL‑2 in tissues and blood. (Immunity, 2024; Oncoimmunology, 2025) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- Pathway context: Upon IL‑2 binding and trimer assembly, JAK1/3 activation drives STAT5A/B phosphorylation and transcriptional programs for proliferation/survival; concurrent PI3K–AKT–mTOR and RAS–MAPK pathways shape metabolism, cell‑cycle progression, and differentiation, with subset‑specific biases (e.g., PTEN‑high Tregs). (Immunity, 2024; mechanistic reviews) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3, slivkova2025theroleof pages 12-15)

Soluble CD25 (biomarker and mechanism)
- Biogenesis and effects: sCD25 arises by proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain. It binds IL‑2 and can act as a decoy receptor, modulating cytokine availability. Clinically, elevated sCD25 is used as a marker of T‑cell activation and immune dysregulation in diverse conditions; its levels are often integrated into disease activity assessments and prognostic models. (2024–2025 reviews) (slivkova2025theroleof pages 41-43)

Genetic associations with autoimmunity (evidence summary)
- Evidence synthesis indicates that the IL2RA locus is a shared signal across multiple autoimmune diseases and a rational target for preventive/therapeutic modulation of IL‑2 signaling; while disease‑specific effect sizes vary, convergent analyses prioritize IL‑2/IL‑2R signaling in autoimmunity pathogenesis. (expert reviews, 2024–2025) (slivkova2025theroleof pages 41-43, shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)

Therapeutic landscape targeting CD25/IL‑2R pathway
- Low‑dose IL‑2: Clinically used to expand Tregs and restore tolerance; dose and schedule are tuned to exploit CD25‑dependent hypersensitivity. (Immunity, 2024) (shouse2024interleukin2signalingin pages 1-3)
- Engineered IL‑2 agonists: Multiple clinical programs are testing receptor‑biased IL‑2 variants (e.g., βγ‑selective for cancer, α‑biased for autoimmunity) and fusion formats to extend half‑life and alter tissue targeting. (Oncoimmunology, 2025) (tanigawa2025currentlandscapeand pages 1-2)
- IL‑2:anti‑IL‑2 fusion proteins: A covalent human IL‑2/anti‑IL‑2 fusion with Fc engineering achieved strong Treg selectivity and favorable in‑vitro potency profiles, supporting translation to human autoimmune indications. (Communications Biology, 2024) (lin2024asingleagentfusion pages 1-2)
