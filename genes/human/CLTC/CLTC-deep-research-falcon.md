### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q00610
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Clathrin heavy chain 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:26822784, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29100083}; AltName: Full=Clathrin heavy chain on chromosome 17; Short=CLH-17;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CLTC {ECO:0000303|PubMed:26822784, ECO:0000303|PubMed:29100083, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:2092}; Synonyms=CLH17, CLTCL2, KIAA0034;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the clathrin heavy chain family. .
- **Key Domains:** ARM-type_fold. (IPR016024); CHCR. (IPR055358); Clathrin_H-chain/VPS_repeat. (IPR000547); Clathrin_H-chain_linker_core. (IPR015348); Clathrin_H-chain_N. (IPR016025)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CLTC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CLTC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CLTC** (gene ID: CLTC, UniProt: Q00610) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status and target verification
- Identity check: The target is human CLTC (UniProt Q00610), encoding clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC17). Evidence from clinical and mechanistic literature explicitly refers to human CLTC/CHC17 and its domains (N-terminal terminal/WD40 domain, clathrin heavy-chain repeat [CHCR/VPS] legs, C-terminal hub/trimerization domain) forming clathrin triskelia with light chains; this matches the UniProt description and domain architecture provided. No conflicting organism or alternative gene was used. (cheng2023anovelde pages 5-7, morris2019cryoemofmultiple pages 1-12, sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report: CLTC (CHC17)

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and assembly: CLTC encodes the clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC17), which assembles as a triskelion composed of three heavy chains and three light chains. The heavy chain contains an N-terminal terminal domain (WD40/β-propeller) that binds adaptor proteins, repeating CHCR/VPS arm segments along the leg, and a C‑terminal hub/trimerization domain required for trimer formation. Cryo‑EM of assembled cages defines a conserved consensus hub and variable leg conformations that enable different cage architectures (hexagon/pentagon tiling) while maintaining a universal mode of self‑assembly. Publication: Oct 2019; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-019-0292-0. Additional domain mapping and truncation effects were shown in Dec 2023 prenatal case work. Publication: Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-023-01778-3. (morris2019cryoemofmultiple pages 1-12, cheng2023anovelde pages 5-7)
- Uncoating mechanism: Following vesicle formation, auxilin recruits Hsc70 to the clathrin lattice; ATP‑driven Hsc70 action generates mechanical forces that destabilize the lattice and drive disassembly, consistent with collision‑pressure/entropic mechanisms for Hsp70 force generation. Publications: Aug 2016; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.3272; 2024 review summarizing auxilin/Hsc70 and synaptojanin roles. (sengupta2024structuralinsightsinto pages 24-28)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Revised mechanistic model—clathrin as a fission protein: In live neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, polymerized clathrin localized at the base/neck of Ω‑profile pits actively constricts pores and mediates pore closure, revising the classical view that dynamin alone executes fission. Modeling supports that clathrin’s intrinsic curvature generates constrictive forces; clathrin was essential for fast and slow endocytosis at hippocampal synapses, suggesting broad neuronal relevance. Publication: Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-024-00677-w. (wei2024clathrinmediatesmembrane pages 1-2)
- Isoform distinctions—CHC17 (CLTC) vs CHC22 (CLTCL1): CHC17 carries out endocytosis and housekeeping membrane traffic in all cells, engaging adaptor AP‑2 and others at the plasma membrane. CHC22, by contrast, is specialized for GLUT4 trafficking: it is recruited to the ERGIC via a bipartite mechanism whereby its C‑terminal trimerization/hub region binds SNX5 (with SNX6 redundancy) and an isoform‑specific N‑terminal patch binds p115, targeting CHC22 to mediate GLUT4 sorting to the insulin‑responsive GLUT4 storage compartment (GSC). Publication: Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00198-y. (greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 1-2, greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 14-15, greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 8-9, greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 13-14, greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 19-21)
- Structural context: Cryo‑EM studies continue to support a universal self‑assembly mode across multiple cage geometries, with a consensus hub and variable leg conformations accommodating vesicle size/shape diversity (Oct 2019). Publication: Oct 2019; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-019-0292-0. (morris2019cryoemofmultiple pages 1-12)
- Virus entry via CME: Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV‑229E) utilizes clathrin‑mediated endocytosis for entry into Huh‑7 cells; pharmacologic CME inhibition and AP‑2 μ subunit CRISPR knockout reduced infection by >50%, and entry required endosomal acidification. Publication: Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101232. (morris2019cryoemofmultiple pages 1-12, sengupta2024structuralinsightsinto pages 24-28, zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16)
- Biomarker/methodological advances: A machine‑learning analysis across multi‑source exosome proteomes identified CLTC (CHC) among highly abundant, universal exosome proteins, enabling pan‑cancer exosome signatures (AUROC >0.91) across plasma/serum/urine. Publication: Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90390. Separately, a new 2D template matching statistical metric improved cryo‑EM in situ detection of small/aspherical targets and demonstrated detection of clathrin monomers in simulated data, expanding visual proteomics capabilities. Publication: Oct 2024 preprint; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.01.616095. (zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16, ashby2024physicalpropertiesof pages 40-43)

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- CME inhibitors as research tools: Targeting the clathrin terminal domain–AP‑2 interface with designed peptides (e.g., Wbox2) yields rapid, reversible CME inhibition with functional rescue on washout, illustrating precision modulation of clathrin–adaptor interactions for probing endocytosis and potentially for therapy development. Publication: Oct 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1039/d5md00650c. (zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16)
- Exosome diagnostics: CLTC’s high abundance in cancer exosomes supports its inclusion in diagnostic panels with high AUROC performance across biofluids, suggesting translational biomarker utility. Publication: Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90390. (zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16)
- Cryo‑EM/cryo‑ET detection: Methodological progress in template matching enhances the ability to detect clathrin assemblies or monomers in cells, facilitating in situ mapping of endocytic machinery for systems‑level cell biology. Publication: Oct 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.01.616095. (ashby2024physicalpropertiesof pages 40-43)
- Infectious disease: Demonstration that HCoV‑229E entry depends on CME (drug inhibition and AP‑2 μ loss) offers a rationale to evaluate endocytic pathway components as host‑directed antiviral targets in specific contexts. Publication: Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101232. (zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- EMBO Journal (Brodsky/Cullen teams) position CHC17 as the canonical clathrin driving endocytosis/housekeeping traffic and define CHC22’s distinct early secretory pathway targeting via SNX5/p115 to support GLUT4 storage compartment biogenesis, highlighting isoform‑specific recruitment logic and partitioned physiological roles. Publication: Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00198-y. (greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 1-2, greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 13-14)
- Cell Discovery 2024 proposes a paradigm shift by identifying clathrin as a fission protein that constricts pores in diverse endocytic modes; this perspective suggests reevaluating classifications of “clathrin‑independent” endocytosis that may still rely on clathrin’s pore‑closure function in certain cells. Publication: Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-024-00677-w. (wei2024clathrinmediatesmembrane pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Neurodevelopmental disorder spectrum: In a combined cohort of 27 individuals (13 newly reported plus 14 prior), all had intellectual disability (mild–severe). Among the 13 newly reported, epilepsy occurred in 5/13, and brain structural anomalies were present in 8/10 with imaging, including corpus callosum hypoplasia (5/8) and microcephaly (3/13). CLTC is highly constrained (pLI = 1.00; missense z‑score = 8.09); missense/in‑frame deletions tended to cluster within CHCR repeats and were associated with more severe phenotypes, suggesting dominant‑negative effects, whereas truncating variants likely act via haploinsufficiency. Publication: Apr 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-019-0703-y. (sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2, sa2020denovocltc pages 5-6)
- Prenatal presentation: A de novo splice‑site variant c.3249+1G>C produced a truncated CLTC and loss of protein; fetal ultrasound showed bilateral choroid plexus cysts, hyperechogenic kidneys, and ventricular septal defect, expanding the CLTC prenatal phenotype spectrum. Publication: Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-023-01778-3. (cheng2023anovelde pages 5-7)
- Functional disease mechanism (variant modeling): The recurrent p.Pro890Leu variant reduces transferrin uptake in patient fibroblasts and causes broad synaptic transmission defects in C. elegans models; a severe human variant (p.Leu1047Pro) maps to the heavy chain leg and produced stronger phenotypes in vivo, supporting genotype–phenotype correlations. Publication: May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2023.1170061. (pannone2023therecurrentpathogenic pages 8-10)
- Oncogenic fusions and TKI response: In ALK‑positive large B‑cell lymphoma, a case bearing CDK14‑ALK and CLTC‑ALK fusions developed progressive disease after ~5.5 months on crizotinib with an increased abundance of CLTC‑ALK; switching to alectinib led to partial response maintained for 21 months, suggesting fusion variant context influences TKI sensitivity. Publication: Oct 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2023.2271212. (greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 8-9)
- Viral entry dependency on CME: AP‑2 μ knockout reduced HCoV‑229E infection by >50% in Huh‑7 cells; lysosomotropic agents that block endosomal acidification similarly reduced entry, quantifying CME involvement. Publication: Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101232. (zhang2025targetingclathrinmediatedendocytosis pages 15-16)

Cellular functions, pathways, and localization
- Primary function and pathways: CHC17 scaffolds clathrin coats that capture cargo via adaptor proteins (e.g., AP‑2 at the plasma membrane) to drive clathrin‑mediated endocytosis; it participates in intracellular trafficking at the TGN/early secretory pathway (shared adaptors/AP‑1, GGAs) and in synaptic vesicle recycling. Structural data support adaptor interactions through the N‑terminal terminal domain and trimerization via the C‑terminal hub. Publications: Oct 2019; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-019-0292-0; Apr 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-019-0703-y. (morris2019cryoemofmultiple pages 1-12, sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2)
- Mitosis: CHC17 contributes to mitotic spindle organization and k‑fiber stabilization; recent spindle literature situates CHC17 within networks that localize and modulate Aurora‑A/TACC3 activities impacting spindle assembly and centrosome function. Publication: Apr 2020 overview; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-019-0703-y. (sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2)
- Subcellular localization: CHC17 localizes to plasma membrane coated pits/vesicles, endosomal and TGN/ERGIC compartments, and mitotic spindle regions; in live cells, CHC accumulates at vesicle necks/Ω‑profiles where it can constrict pores and promote fission. Publication: Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-024-00677-w. (wei2024clathrinmediatesmembrane pages 1-2, sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2)

Disease relevance
- Neurodevelopmental disorders: De novo CLTC variants produce a variable neurodevelopmental phenotype with ID, epilepsy, microcephaly, and callosal hypoplasia. Constraints (pLI/missense z‑score) and variant clustering support a pathogenic model involving both dominant‑negative missense/in‑frame changes and haploinsufficiency from truncating alleles; prenatal anomalies can be detected. Publications: Apr 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-019-0703-y; Dec 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12920-023-01778-3; May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2023.1170061. (sa2020denovocltc pages 1-2, sa2020denovocltc pages 5-6, cheng2023anovelde pages 5-7, pannone2023therecurrentpathogenic pages 8-10)
- Parkinsonism spectrum: Adult carriers of pathogenic CLTC variants have been reported with parkinsonism evolving from earlier neurodevelopmental phenotypes, underscoring the need for protracted clinical follow‑up; this extends the CLTC‑related disorder spectrum into movement disorders. Publication: Apr 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.14039. (pannone2023therecurrentpathogenic pages 8-10)
- Oncogenic fusions: CLTC rearrangements (e.g., CLTC::ALK in ALK+ large B‑cell lymphoma) drive constitutive kinase activation; clinical response may vary by fusion partner context, with case evidence of crizotinib resistance and alectinib response. Publication: Oct 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15384047.2023.2271212. (greig2024chc22clathrinrecruitment pages 8-9)
