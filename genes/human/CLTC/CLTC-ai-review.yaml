description: >-
  CLTC encodes clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC17), the major structural component of clathrin-coated
  vesicles. CHC17 forms triskelia composed of three heavy chains and three light chains
  that
  polymerize into polyhedral lattices at the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network.
  The protein
  contains an N-terminal WD40-like beta-propeller domain (terminal domain) that serves
  as the primary
  adaptor binding site, seven clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domains forming the
  leg, and a
  C-terminal hub/trimerization domain. Core functions include: (1) clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis
  at the plasma membrane via AP-2 adaptor interaction; (2) intracellular trafficking
  at the TGN
  via AP-1 and GGA adaptors; (3) mitotic spindle stabilization through TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin
  complex formation at kinetochore fibers. Recent evidence (2024) suggests clathrin
  also actively
  constricts membrane pores during fission, beyond its traditional coat function.

    description: >-
      CHC17 is the major structural component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles
      at the plasma membrane. It forms triskelia with light chains that polymerize
      into polyhedral lattices to drive cargo internalization via AP-2 adaptor
      complexes.

        label: clathrin complex
    description: >-
      CHC17 assembles with clathrin light chains (CLTA, CLTB) into triskelia,
      the fundamental building blocks of clathrin coats. The heavy chain provides
      the structural arms while light chains regulate assembly dynamics.

        label: mitotic spindle
    description: >-
      CHC17 participates in mitosis through the TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin complex
      that stabilizes kinetochore fibers by inter-microtubule bridging.
      This represents a well-documented moonlighting function.
