description: Synaptophysin is a major integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles with four transmembrane domains (MARVEL domain). It regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis kinetics, interacts with synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2, binds cholesterol for vesicle biogenesis, and modulates synaptic plasticity. Forms hexameric structures and acts as a membrane elastomer regulating vesicle size and neurotransmitter-dependent expansion.

  review:
    summary: Synaptophysin is one of the most abundant integral membrane proteins on synaptic vesicles, with the MARVEL domain spanning the membrane four times. This is the core and defining localization of this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents the primary and core cellular localization of synaptophysin. The deep research confirms synaptophysin resides on synaptic vesicle membranes as its main location, and UniProt annotates it as "synaptic vesicle membrane" with experimental evidence. The IBA annotation is well-supported and represents core function.

  review:
    summary: Synaptic vesicle priming is the process that makes vesicles fusion-competent. Synaptophysin regulates release probability but acts downstream of priming steps.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The deep research indicates that synaptophysin family members act downstream of the final steps in vesicle priming, not in regulating priming itself. The elevated release probability in quadruple knockout mice occurs after priming is complete, indicating synaptophysin functions as an inhibitor of fusion rather than a regulator of the priming process. This annotation conflates priming regulation with fusion regulation and should be removed.

  review:
    summary: Synaptophysin organizes the synaptic vesicle membrane through cholesterol binding, formation of hexameric structures, and regulation of membrane elasticity and curvature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is strongly supported by PMID:10620806 which demonstrates cholesterol binding and role in vesicle biogenesis. The deep research extensively documents synaptophysin's role as a membrane organizer and elastomer. This is a core molecular function of synaptophysin.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:10620806
  review:
    summary: Synaptophysin is a major cholesterol-binding protein on synaptic vesicles. Cholesterol binding is essential for synaptic vesicle biogenesis and membrane organization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is directly demonstrated by PMID:10620806 using photoactivatable cholesterol labeling. This is a core molecular function of synaptophysin with important implications for vesicle biogenesis and membrane properties. Well-supported with direct experimental evidence.

  review:
    summary: Synaptophysin is involved in synaptic vesicle maturation, the process by which newly formed vesicles acquire their characteristic properties and protein composition.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:10620806 demonstrates synaptophysin's role in synaptic vesicle biogenesis from the plasma membrane, which is part of vesicle maturation. The cholesterol-binding function and membrane organizing properties contribute to vesicle maturation. This represents a core biological process.

  review:
    summary: Third annotation for the core synaptic vesicle membrane localization, this time with NAS evidence from an early paper characterizing the human SYP gene.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the third annotation for this core localization term (IBA, IEA, and now NAS). All are correct. PMID:1975480 is an early paper on the structure of the human synaptophysin gene. The NAS evidence code indicates non-traceable author statement, which is appropriate for well-established facts. Core localization.
