description: SFT2D3 encodes vesicle transport protein SFT2C, an integral membrane
  component of the evolutionarily conserved SFT2 family. This tetra-span transmembrane
  protein (containing the pfam04178 Got1/Sft2 domain) functions as a vesicle fusion
  facilitator in the retrograde transport pathway from endosomes to Golgi apparatus.
  The protein localizes to Golgi membranes and endosomal compartments where it likely
  organizes or stabilizes SNARE complexes during vesicle fusion events. Based on strong
  experimental evidence from paralog SFT2D2 and yeast homologs Sft2p/Got1p, SFT2D3
  operates as a SNARE-associated factor that promotes fusion of retrograde transport
  vesicles derived from endocytic compartments with the trans-Golgi network. The gene
  shows ubiquitous but low-level expression consistent with a fundamental housekeeping
  role in cellular trafficking machinery.

  review:
    summary: This membrane annotation is well-supported. SFT2D3 is clearly an integral
      membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains as documented in UniProt topology
      data. The 2024 Golgi vesicle proteomics study detected SFT2D3 enriched in Golgi-derived
      vesicle fractions (Sumya et al., bioRxiv 2024). The generic "membrane" term appropriately
      captures the core structural feature of this multi-pass transmembrane protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SFT2D3 is unambiguously a multi-pass transmembrane protein with 4 predicted
      transmembrane helices (residues 83-103, 108-128, 143-163, 167-187). This structural
      feature is evolutionarily conserved across the SFT2 family.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate and well-supported by convergent evidence
      from multiple sources. SFT2D3 belongs to the SFT2/Got1 family whose members are
      established vesicle transport factors. Yeast Sft2p is required for vesicle fusion
      with the Golgi complex (PMID:10406798), and paralog SFT2D2 is required for endosome-to-Golgi
      retrieval (PMID:25464851). The 2024 yeast study confirms Sft2 functions in SNARE
      recycling transport (Lai et al., MBoC 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The Got1/Sft2 InterPro domain (IPR007305) is specifically associated with
      vesicle transport function. Multiple experimental studies in yeast and functional
      studies of mammalian paralogs support this core function.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is technically correct but overly general and uninformative.
      SFT2D3 is localized to specific cytoplasmic compartments (Golgi apparatus and
      endosomes), not broadly distributed in the cytoplasm. The deep research indicates
      SFT2D3 detection in Golgi-derived vesicle proteomes and yeast ortholog localization
      to late Golgi/TGN.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While a more specific localization term would be preferred, this broad
      IEA annotation is not incorrect. SFT2D3 is indeed in the cytoplasm (as opposed
      to nucleus or extracellular). The endomembrane system annotation (GO:0012505)
      provides more informative localization.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate and appropriately specific. SFT2D3 is a component
      of the endomembrane system, functioning at the interface between endosomes and
      Golgi apparatus. The 2024 proteomics study detected SFT2D3 enriched in Golgi-derived
      vesicles, and yeast ortholog studies place Sft2p at the late Golgi/TGN cycling
      with endosomal compartments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The endomembrane system term appropriately captures SFT2D3 localization
      to intracellular membrane-bound organelles within the secretory/endocytic pathway
      network. This is more informative than "cytoplasm" while being appropriately
      general for a protein that functions at Golgi-endosome interfaces.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate. SFT2D3 participates in protein transport
      in the context of retrograde vesicular trafficking where membrane proteins and
      cargo receptors (e.g., CIMPR, TGN46) are retrieved from endosomes back to the
      Golgi. The UniProt keyword mapping correctly identifies SFT2D3 as involved in
      protein transport based on its function annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While "retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi" (GO:0042147) would be more
      specific, the broader protein transport term is not incorrect as an IEA annotation.
      The more specific term is proposed separately as a NEW annotation.

      Evidence from paralog SFT2D2 (PMID:25464851) demonstrates a direct role in endosome-to-Golgi
      retrieval. Yeast ortholog studies (PMID:10406798) show Sft2p functions in endosome-Golgi

      5 and syntaxin 6 (PMID:25464851). Yeast Sft2p localizes to late Golgi/TGN. The
      2024 proteomics study detected SFT2D3 enriched in Golgi-derived vesicle fractions.

      retrieval of cargo proteins
    supporting_text: We further demonstrate a role for three multipass membrane proteins,
      SFT2D2, ZDHHC5, and GRINA, in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval.
  - statement: SFT2D2 is partially homologous to yeast Sft2p protein and represents
      an uncharacterized mammalian homolog of the SFT2 family
    supporting_text: SFT2D2 is partially homologous to the yeast Sft2p protein, a
      genetic interactor of Sed5p (the yeast syntaxin 5 protein) and affects post-Golgi
      trafficking (Conchon et al., 1999). However, the mammalian homologs (SFT2D1,
      SFT2D2, and SFT2D3) are uncharacterized.
  - statement: SFT2D2 localizes to both perinuclear membranes and endosomal structures
      containing the retromer complex
    supporting_text: We find that SFT2D2 localizes to both perinuclear membranes and
      structures positive for the retromer CSC protein, VPS35. The colocalization
      of SFT2D2 with VPS35 is especially apparent after treatment with nocodazole
      to depolymerize microtubules
  - statement: SFT2D2 exhibits specific colocalization with syntaxin 6 SNARE protein,
      indicating functional interaction with post-Golgi membrane fusion machinery
    supporting_text: We find that SFT2D2 partially colocalizes with syntaxin 5 but
      exhibits almost complete colocalization with syntaxin 6 (indicated by arrowheads
      in the immunofluorescence images shown in Figure 3C). Quantitation of the colocalization
      of SFT2D2 with a number of post-Golgi SNARE proteins is shown graphically in
      Figure 3C (right panel) and confirms that SFT2D2 resides in a compartment strongly
      positive for syntaxin 6.
  - statement: SFT2D2 depletion alters SNARE protein distribution without affecting
      their total expression levels
    supporting_text: when SFT2D2 expression is silenced by RNAi, we observed a marked
      change in the fluorescence intensity of several SNARE proteins, with syntaxin
      6 and VAMP3 exhibiting the strongest change (Figure 3D). An example of the altered
      fluorescence intensity for VAMP3 is shown along with the graph in Figure 3D.
      Surprisingly, however, changes in the fluorescence intensity are not the result
      of changes in overall levels of the respective SNARE proteins (Figure 3E).

  findings:

    supporting_text: Sft2p is a non-essential tetra-spanning membrane protein, found
      mostly in the late Golgi, that can suppress some sed5 alleles.
  - statement: Sft2p has similar membrane topology to Got1p and both are evolutionarily
      conserved proteins involved in vesicle fusion
    supporting_text: Got1p is an evolutionarily conserved non-essential protein with
      a membrane topology similar to that of Sft2p.
  - statement: Either Got1p or Sft2p is required for vesicle fusion with the Golgi
      complex in vivo
    supporting_text: Thus the presence of either Got1p or Sft2p is required for vesicle
      fusion with the Golgi complex in vivo.
  - statement: Got1p facilitates Sed5p-dependent fusion events while Sft2p performs
      a related function in the late Golgi
    supporting_text: We suggest that Got1p normally facilitates Sed5p-dependent fusion
      events, while Sft2p performs a related function in the late Golgi.
  - statement: Loss of both Got1p and Sft2p causes defects in endosome-Golgi traffic
      and ER-Golgi transport
    supporting_text: In vivo, inactivation of both Got1p and Sft2p results in phenotypes
      ascribable to a defect in endosome-Golgi traffic, while their complete removal
      results in an ER-Golgi transport defect.
  - statement: Got1p localizes to early Golgi cisternae and shows defects in vesicle
      fusion after tethering
    supporting_text: Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation indicate that
      it is present in early Golgi cisternae. got1 mutants, but not sft2 mutants,
      show a defect in an in vitro assay for ER-Golgi transport at a step after vesicle
      tethering to Golgi membranes.
