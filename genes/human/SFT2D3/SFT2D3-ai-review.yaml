description: SFT2D3 encodes vesicle transport protein SFT2C, an integral membrane
  component of the evolutionarily conserved SFT2 family. This tetra-span transmembrane
  protein (containing the pfam04178 Got1/Sft2 domain) functions as a vesicle fusion
  facilitator in the retrograde transport pathway from endosomes to Golgi apparatus.
  The protein localizes to Golgi membranes and endosomal compartments where it likely
  organizes or stabilizes SNARE complexes during vesicle fusion events. Based on strong
  experimental evidence from paralog SFT2D2 and yeast homologs Sft2p/Got1p, SFT2D3
  operates as a SNARE-associated factor that promotes fusion of retrograde transport
  vesicles derived from endocytic compartments with the trans-Golgi network. The gene
  shows ubiquitous but low-level expression consistent with a fundamental housekeeping
  role in cellular trafficking machinery.

  review:
    summary: This membrane annotation is accurate and appropriate for SFT2D3. The
      protein is clearly an integral membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains
      as shown in UniProt topology data and confirmed by structural predictions. The
      generic \"membrane\" term is suitable as it correctly captures the protein localization
      without being overly specific about particular membrane types. Given SFT2D3
      localizes to multiple membrane compartments (Golgi, endosomes), this broad term
      is acceptable.

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is accurate and well-supported by strong evidence. SFT2D3
      is clearly involved in vesicle-mediated transport based on: (1) UniProt annotation
      stating involvement in fusion of retrograde transport vesicles; (2) experimental
      evidence from SFT2D2 paralog showing role in endosome-to-Golgi retrieval; (3)
      yeast homolog studies demonstrating vesicle fusion function; (4) evolutionary
      conservation of the SFT2 family in vesicle trafficking. This represents a core
      function and should be accepted as-is.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: This annotation is technically correct but overly general and not informative
      for SFT2D3 function. While SFT2D3 is localized to cytoplasmic organelles (not
      nucleus or extracellular), this broad term fails to capture its specific subcellular
      localization. Based on functional evidence and paralog localization studies,
      SFT2D3 specifically localizes to Golgi apparatus and endosomal membranes. This
      should be modified to the more specific and functionally relevant "Golgi apparatus"
      (GO:0005794).

  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate and well-supported. SFT2D3 is clearly a component
      of the endomembrane system as an integral membrane protein involved in trafficking
      between endosomes and Golgi. This term appropriately captures its localization
      to intracellular membrane-bound organelles within the secretory/endocytic pathway
      network. The term is at the right level of specificity - more general than specific
      organelles but more specific than just "membrane" or "cytoplasm". This should
      be accepted as representing accurate cellular localization.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate but could be more specific. SFT2D3 is indeed
      involved in protein transport, particularly in the context of retrograde transport
      where membrane proteins and sorting receptors are retrieved from endosomes back
      to the Golgi. However, the evidence strongly points to a more specific role
      in "retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi" (GO:0042147). While the current
      term is not wrong, the more specific term better captures the precise biological
      process SFT2D3 participates in based on functional evidence.
