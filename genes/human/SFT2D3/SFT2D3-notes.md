# SFT2D3 Reference Enhancement Notes

## Status: ENHANCED ✅

### Initial State
- **Literature references**: 0 PMIDs/PMCs
- **Total references**: 6 (mostly GO_REF annotations)
- **Findings**: 13 from deep research file

### Enhancements Made (2025-09-13)

#### Added Literature References
1. **PMID:25464851** - "Genome-wide RNAi screen reveals a role for multipass membrane proteins in endosome-to-golgi retrieval"
   - Key findings on SFT2D2 (human paralog) function
   - Demonstrates endosome-to-Golgi retrieval role
   - Shows specific SNARE protein interactions (syntaxin 6)
   - 6 specific findings extracted with supporting text

2. **PMID:10406798** - "Got1p and Sft2p: membrane proteins involved in traffic to the Golgi complex"
   - Yeast homolog functional studies
   - Establishes evolutionary conservation
   - Vesicle fusion requirements
   - 6 specific findings extracted with supporting text

#### Impact
- **Literature references**: 0 → 2 PMIDs
- **Total references**: 6 → 8
- **Total findings**: 13 → 25 findings with proper supporting text
- **Functional validation**: Now has direct experimental evidence through paralog studies

### Research Strategy Used

1. **Targeted paralog search**: Focused on SFT2D2 since SFT2D3 itself is understudied
2. **Evolutionary approach**: Used yeast Sft2p/Got1p studies for mechanistic insights
3. **Functional context**: Emphasized vesicle transport and SNARE interactions
4. **Quality control**: Used `just fetch-pmid` commands to properly cache publications

### Key Scientific Insights Added

- **Mechanistic detail**: SNARE protein interaction patterns (syntaxin 6 specificity)
- **Subcellular localization**: Retromer complex association, endosomal/Golgi trafficking
- **Functional requirements**: Vesicle fusion dependencies in yeast models
- **Evolutionary conservation**: Membrane topology and trafficking function preserved

### Next Steps for SFT2D3
- Consider searching for additional SFT2D1 studies
- Look for AlphaFold structural predictions
- Check for any disease association studies
- Review for any tissue-specific expression patterns

### Lessons Learned
- Paralog studies are extremely valuable for understudied genes
- Yeast homolog research provides strong mechanistic foundations
- Focus on functional context rather than generic gene expression studies
