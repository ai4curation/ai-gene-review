description: >-
  Sarcoplasmic reticulum histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC) is a luminal
  SR protein
  that functions as a low-affinity, high-capacity calcium buffer and sensor in cardiac
  and skeletal
  muscle. HRC regulates SR calcium cycling through Ca2+-dependent interactions with
  both SERCA2a
  (the SR Ca2+-ATPase) and triadin/RyR2 (the ryanodine receptor release complex).
  At low SR luminal
  calcium, HRC preferentially binds and inhibits SERCA2a, attenuating Ca2+ uptake;
  as SR fills,
  HRC dissociates from SERCA2a and binds triadin to modulate RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release.
  This
  Ca2+-sensitive switching mechanism coordinates SR Ca2+ uptake and release during
  excitation-contraction
  coupling. HRC is phosphorylated by FAM20C at Ser96, and the Ser96Ala variant prevents
  this
  phosphorylation and is associated with increased arrhythmia susceptibility in dilated
  cardiomyopathy.
