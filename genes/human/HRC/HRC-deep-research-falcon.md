## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P23327
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Sarcoplasmic reticulum histidine-rich calcium-binding protein; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HRC; Synonyms=HCP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HRC family. .
- **Key Domains:** Hist_rich_Ca-bd. (IPR019552); HRC. (IPR015666); Hist_rich_Ca-bd (PF10529)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HRC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HRC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HRC** (gene ID: HRC, UniProt: P23327) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target as human HRC (UniProt P23327), a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) luminal protein of the HRC family with histidine-rich Ca2+-binding repeats (Hist_rich_Ca-bd) and a C‑terminal cysteine cluster. Literature consistently places HRC in the SR lumen of cardiomyocytes and describes it as a low-affinity, high-capacity Ca2+ binder that interacts with SERCA2a and the RyR2 release complex via triadin/junctin, consistent with the UniProt description and family/domain annotations (Hist_rich_Ca-bd/HRC) (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Protein identity and domains: HRC is an SR-lumenal histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein (∼170 kDa in human) with nine histidine-rich tandem repeats and a C‑terminal cysteine-rich region; it belongs to the HRC family (Hist_rich_Ca-bd domains) (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5). It is targeted to and resides within the SR lumen (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2). URLs: 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol review (published Jan 2011): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021; 2017 PNAS (Aug 2017): https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114.
- Ca2+-binding mode: HRC binds Ca2+ with low affinity and high capacity (reported capacity ≈200 nmol Ca2+/mg; KD ≈1.9 mM), and exhibits Ca2+-dependent multimerization, properties consistent with a luminal Ca2+ buffer/sensor (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5). URL: 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021.
- Cellular localization and role: HRC is in the SR lumen of cardiac myocytes where it regulates SR Ca2+ uptake and release by binding SERCA2a (ATP2A2) and the RyR2 complex via triadin; it functions as a luminal Ca2+ sensor that modulates cross-talk between uptake and release (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2). URLs: 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021; 2017 PNAS: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114.

Molecular interactions, mechanisms, and regulation
- Direct interactions: HRC binds SERCA2a (mapping to an HRC central region interacting with a luminal SERCA segment), and binds triadin via a C‑terminal luminal KEKE-like motif to influence the RyR2 quaternary release complex. Junctin/junctate are related luminal partners in the junctional SR (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, arvanitis2018thehistidinerichcalcium pages 5-7). URLs: 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021; 2018 Front Physiol (Sep 2018): https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01379.
- Ca2+-dependent switching: A unifying model posits that at low luminal [Ca2+] HRC preferentially binds and inhibits SERCA2a, attenuating Ca2+ uptake; as SR fills, HRC dissociates from SERCA2a and binds triadin to modulate RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release, thus linking uptake and release in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, arvanitis2018thehistidinerichcalcium pages 2-3). URL: 2018 Front Physiol: https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01379.
- Post-translational regulation: HRC is phosphorylated within the secretory pathway lumen at Ser96 by Fam20C in vivo; Ser96 phosphorylation was confirmed in human hearts and cellular systems. Earlier work implicated casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a lumenal kinase for some HRC sites in vitro; however, the key in vivo event for Ser96 is Fam20C. Ser96 phosphorylation modulates HRC’s cardioprotective, anti-arrhythmic function (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 7-8). URL: 2017 PNAS: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114; 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021.

Mechanistic phenotypes from perturbation
- Overexpression: Cardiac HRC overexpression reduces SR Ca2+ uptake, slows Ca2+ decay, and depresses contractility; it can also alter triadin/junctin levels and predispose to stress-induced remodeling (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 5-7, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2). URL: 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021.
- Knockout/deficiency: HRC ablation increases SERCA2a-mediated uptake and basal contractility but augments susceptibility to spontaneous SR Ca2+ release and aftercontractions under adrenergic stress, consistent with loss of luminal buffering/sensing (chen2009histidinerichcabindinga pages 65-70). (Secondary summary) URL: 2009 summary (reviewed in 2011 J Mol Cell Cardiol): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021.
- Ser96 phosphorylation mechanistics: In mice and cells, preventing HRC Ser96 phosphorylation (S96A) increased arrhythmic events, while a phosphomimetic (S96D) reduced delayed aftercontractions and rescued the pro-arrhythmic phenotype. Thus, Fam20C→HRC Ser96 phosphorylation acts to prevent arrhythmia (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2). URL: 2017 PNAS: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114.

Disease associations and variants (quantitative data)
- Idiopathic DCM and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (2008): In 123 idiopathic DCM patients vs 96 controls, the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. During 4.02 ± 2.4 years follow-up, Ala/Ala had markedly higher risk vs Ser/Ser (unadjusted HR 9.620; 95% CI 2.183–42.394; P=0.003). In multivariable analysis, Ser96Ala remained a significant predictor (HR 4.191; 95% CI 0.838–20.967; P=0.018). Genotype counts among DCM patients: Ser/Ser n=31, Ser/Ala n=61, Ala/Ala n=31 (arvanitis2008theser96alavariant pages 1-1, arvanitis2008theser96alavariant pages 5-6). URL: 2008 Eur Heart J (Jul 2008): https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehn328.
- AF ablation recurrence (2019): In paroxysmal AF cohorts (screening N=334; replication N=245), HRC Ser96Ala associated with post‑ablation recurrence (screening OR 1.80, P=0.006; replication OR 1.74, P=0.03; combined P=0.0008). Multivariate Cox HR 2.66 (P=0.007), independent of clinical covariates (amioka2019ser96alageneticvariant pages 1-2). URL: 2019 PLOS ONE (Mar 2019): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213208.
- 2023 multi-cohort modifier analysis: A large analysis found no evidence that Ser96Ala modifies risk in cardiomyopathies. Cohorts included PLN p.Arg14del carriers (after QC n=848), ACM registry (n=882), and DCM from UK Biobank (n=985). Allele frequencies approximated controls (∼40–44%). Reported effect sizes were small and non‑significant across endpoints (examples: PLN ventricular arrhythmias OR 0.792; 95% CI 0.584–1.066; p=0.128. ACM VA OR 0.862; 95% CI 0.576–1.288; p=0.467. DCM VT OR 0.848; p=0.210; SCD OR 1.016; p=0.941; ICD implantation OR 0.887; p=0.284; all‑cause mortality HR 1.140; p=0.172). The authors conclude no clinically useful modifier signal (voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 2-4, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6). URL: 2023 Int J Mol Sci (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115931.

Current understanding synthesized
- Primary function: HRC is a luminal SR Ca2+ buffer/sensor that integrates SR Ca2+ uptake (via SERCA2a) with release (via triadin–RyR2), switching binding partners as luminal Ca2+ changes. It binds Ca2+ with low affinity (mM KD) and high capacity, allowing it to modulate luminal microdomain Ca2+ and protein interactions without saturating at physiological SR [Ca2+] (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2).
- Regulatory phosphorylation: Fam20C phosphorylates Ser96 in vivo in the secretory pathway; Ser96 phosphorylation is cardioprotective in models, and loss of this phosphorylation (Ser96Ala) predisposes to arrhythmia via altered interactions with SERCA2a and triadin/RyR2 (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 7-8).
- Variant interpretation (context-dependent): Early DCM data (2008) suggest Ser96Ala confers increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias within a small cohort, and AF ablation studies suggest elevated recurrence risk; however, larger 2023 multi-cohort analyses in cardiomyopathy contexts do not support a robust risk-modifier role. Thus, current evidence for routine clinical stratification using HRC Ser96Ala is mixed and insufficient for broad implementation (arvanitis2008theser96alavariant pages 1-1, amioka2019ser96alageneticvariant pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6).

Recent developments (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Genetic modifier reappraisal: The 2023 multi-cohort study (n≈848–985 per disease group) reports no significant association of Ser96Ala with ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure events, SCD, or ICD therapy across ACM, DCM, and PLN-R14del contexts, contradicting the earlier small DCM cohort reports (voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6). URL: 2023 Int J Mol Sci: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115931.
- Therapeutic context: Continued emphasis on luminal phosphorylation networks (Fam20C→HRC Ser96) as anti-arrhythmic mechanisms and potential targets; in vivo work shows Ser96 phosphorylation reduces aftercontractions and protects against arrhythmia, suggesting a tractable axis for drug discovery or gene therapy, though no 2023–2024 interventional trials targeting HRC/Fam20C were identified in this evidence set (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2). URL: 2017 PNAS: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114.

Applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarkers/stratification: HRC Ser96Ala has been explored as a candidate biomarker for risk stratification in DCM and for AF ablation outcomes; positive single-center or moderate-sized studies exist (e.g., AF ablation HR 2.66), but multi-cohort 2023 analyses did not validate modifier effects in cardiomyopathies, indicating that clinical use should be cautious, context-specific, and ideally embedded within polygenic/clinical risk models rather than as a standalone determinant (amioka2019ser96alageneticvariant pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6). URLs: 2019 PLOS ONE: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213208; 2023 Int J Mol Sci: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115931.
- Experimental/diagnostic implications: Mechanistic markers such as phospho‑Ser96 status (Fam20C activity) and HRC interaction dynamics with SERCA2a/triadin are promising for research assays; clinical translation would require validated assays and outcome associations in large prospective cohorts (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative perspectives
- Mechanistic reviews frame HRC as a nodal regulator of the PLN/SERCA2a regulatome and the RyR2 release complex, integrating luminal buffering with protein-protein interactions to fine‑tune excitation–contraction coupling. These sources (2011 domain-leading review; 2018 physiology review) emphasize luminal Ca2+ sensitivity of HRC–SERCA and HRC–triadin interactions and hypothesize HRC as an intra‑SR Ca2+ sensor (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, arvanitis2018thehistidinerichcalcium pages 2-3).

- The 2017 PNAS Fam20C study provides a contemporary mechanistic anchor: luminal kinase control of HRC phosphorylation is necessary to prevent arrhythmia, linking biochemical regulation to physiologic protection (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706441114.

| Mechanistic function | Model: HRC acts as a luminal Ca2+ sensor/buffer that switches binding partners with luminal Ca2+ changes — at low SR [Ca2+] preferentially inhibits/associates with SERCA2a (reducing uptake), whereas at higher SR [Ca2+] it dissociates from SERCA and binds triadin to modulate RyR2-mediated release. | Arvanitis et al., 2011. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.08.021 (arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5); Arvanitis et al., 2018. https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01379 (arvanitis2018thehistidinerichcalcium pages 2-3) | Provides mechanistic explanation for dual role in SR uptake vs release regulation. |
| Phenotypes from perturbation | Overexpression: decreased SR Ca2+ uptake rates, slowed Ca2+-transient decay, impaired contractility and stress‑induced remodeling. Knockout: increased SERCA2a-mediated uptake and hypercontractile cellular phenotype but enhanced propensity for spontaneous SR Ca2+ release and stress-induced arrhythmias.

Limitations and open questions
- Structural details of HRC complexes and dynamic, luminal Ca2+-dependent binding mechanics remain incompletely resolved in humans.
- The translational value of Ser96Ala as a clinical biomarker is currently uncertain given conflicting findings; future large, prospective, multi-ancestry studies with standardized endpoints and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., phospho‑Ser96 assays) are needed (voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6).

Conclusion
HRC (P23327) is a verified human SR luminal protein in the HRC family with histidine-rich Ca2+-binding domains. It functions as a low-affinity/high-capacity Ca2+ buffer and luminal sensor that coordinates SR Ca2+ uptake and release via Ca2+-sensitive interactions with SERCA2a and the triadin/RyR2 complex. Fam20C-mediated phosphorylation at Ser96 is cardioprotective in models; the common Ser96Ala variant prevents this phosphorylation and confers arrhythmogenicity in mechanistic systems. Human genetic evidence is mixed—early small-cohort signals versus larger, recent multi-cohort negative findings—so, at present, HRC Ser96Ala should be considered a context-dependent research marker rather than a routine clinical stratifier. Continued work on luminal phosphorylation networks and HRC interaction dynamics may yield therapeutic strategies to stabilize SR Ca2+ handling and reduce arrhythmia risk (pollak2017phosphorylationofserine96 pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 1-2, arvanitis2011histidinerichcalciumbinding pages 4-5, arvanitis2008theser96alavariant pages 1-1, amioka2019ser96alageneticvariant pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 1-2, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 6-7, voorn2023lackofevidence pages 4-6).
