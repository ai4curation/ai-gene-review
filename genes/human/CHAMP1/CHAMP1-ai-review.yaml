  CHAMP1 (Chromosome Alignment-Maintaining Phosphoprotein 1) is a vertebrate-specific zinc finger protein
  that regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis and promotes homologous recombination
  DNA repair. The protein localizes to chromosomes and spindle structures during mitosis, where it ensures
  proper chromosome alignment at metaphase by maintaining stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments.
  CHAMP1 recruits CENP-E and CENP-F to kinetochores as downstream effectors. Through its WK motif,
  CHAMP1 binds REV7/MAD2L2 to promote homologous recombination by inhibiting the Shieldin complex.
  CHAMP1 also functions as part of a heterochromatin assembly complex with POGZ and HP1 proteins.
  De novo mutations in CHAMP1 cause an intellectual disability syndrome with severe speech impairment.
