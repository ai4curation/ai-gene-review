### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O75306
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2, mitochondrial; EC=7.1.1.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22036843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30922174}; AltName: Full=Complex I-49kD; Short=CI-49kD; AltName: Full=NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 49 kDa subunit; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NDUFS2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the complex I 49 kDa subunit family.
- **Key Domains:** NADH_Q_OxRdtase_suD. (IPR001135); NADH_UbQ_OxRdtase_49kDa_CS. (IPR014029); NDH1_su_D/H. (IPR022885); NiFe-Hase_large. (IPR029014); Complex1_49kDa (PF00346)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NDUFS2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NDUFS2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NDUFS2** (gene ID: NDUFS2, UniProt: O75306) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
We verified target identity and scope (NDUFS2, UniProt O75306), then prioritized 2023–2024 structural/mechanistic literature on mammalian complex I (Q-site chemistry, active/deactive states), recent inhibitor studies, and clinically relevant disease associations. Finally, we synthesized expert perspectives and quantitative data where available and provide a summary table artifact.

Gene/protein identity verification and scope
- Correct target: NDUFS2 encodes the 49 kDa subunit of mammalian mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), positioned in the matrix-arm Q-module contributing to the ubiquinone (Q) binding channel. Verified in recent structural and assembly-focused work on mammalian/arthropod complex I and assembly factors (Laube 2024, Acta Cryst D; Grba et al. 2023, Sci Adv). Organism: Homo sapiens is the intended focus; the structural principles are conserved across mammals and Drosophila models used to derive high-resolution insights (urls in citations). Protein family/domains are consistent with the complex I 49 kDa family and its role at the Q-site. (laube2024usingcryoemto pages 7-9, grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Complex I function and architecture. Mitochondrial complex I is a ~1 MDa enzyme that oxidizes NADH, reduces ubiquinone-10 (CoQ10), and pumps four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive ATP synthesis. The Q-binding (quinone) channel resides at the junction of the peripheral (matrix) and membrane arms, formed principally by NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS7 (PSST), and ND1. State-dependent conformations are recognized: an “active” (closed, ordered) state with a sealed, turnover-ready Q-channel, and a deactive/dormant (open, locally disordered) state that requires reactivation. Bridges 2023 and Grba 2024 provide authoritative definitions and structural correlates of these states (Science, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade3332; Science, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado2075). (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2, grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11)
- Position and role of NDUFS2 at the Q-site. NDUFS2 lines the amphipathic Q-channel and contributes the conserved His/Tyr ligand pair (His59, Tyr108) that interacts with the quinone headgroup and small-molecule Q-site ligands. High-resolution modeling and simulations in 2023 locate His59/Tyr108 at or near the redox-proximal binding region (ROT1), adjacent to Fe–S cluster N2. (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6). (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 1-2)
- Proton-transfer architecture around the Q-site. A 2.4-Å cryo-EM structure (mouse heart) with 2945 waters models hydrated channels linking the Q-site region and the E-channel (ND1) into membrane subunits (ND2/ND4/ND5). These studies place NDUFS2-His59 within the H-bond/water network, although a continuous structural proton path from the Q-site His/Tyr pair to ND3-D66 is not fully resolved, suggesting transient hydration and state dependence. (Science Advances, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359). (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10, grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 5-8)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Ischemia-induced regulatory switch in complex I. Grba et al. unified biochemistry with cryo-EM in proteoliposomes to delineate the transition into a protective dormant (deactive) state under low oxygen, identifying open vs closed conformers and defining how Q-channel loops (including the NDUFS2 β1–β2 loop) reconfigure to control catalysis and reactivation. This provides a mechanistic basis for complex I regulation in ischemia/reperfusion settings (Science, Jun 2024, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado2075). (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11)
- High-resolution hydrated proton pathways. Grba et al. (2023) evaluated water-mediated proton pathways in a 2.4-Å map, comparing multiple organisms and emphasizing that E-channel connectivity near the Q-chamber can vary with state; the NDUFS2 His/Tyr environment is integrated into candidate proton-transfer routes but an unbroken route to ND3-D66 is not visible in static structures (Science Advances, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359). (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10)
- Rotenone binding mechanism and ligand flexibility. MD and enhanced-sampling simulations reconciled cryo-EM observations of multiple binding modes (ROT1, ROT2, ROT3) within the Q-channel. Rotenone must pass a narrow hydrophobic entrance in a straight conformer and then stabilizes in the redox-proximal site in a bent conformer that engages NDUFS2-His59 and nearby residues; a straight-locked analog is ~600-fold less potent, quantifying the role of conformational exchange in both kinetics and affinity (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6). (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 6-7, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 5-6, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 4-5, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 1-2)
- State-selective biguanide inhibition at the Q-channel. Bridges et al. (2023) demonstrated that medicinal biguanides preferentially bind the deactive state at an amphipathic region of the Q-channel and exert additional local chaotropic effects on a membrane helix, rationalizing state-dependent pharmacology and informing structure-guided design (Science, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade3332). (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting of complex I states. The mechanistic definition of the deactive/dormant state provides a basis for cardioprotection strategies in ischemia-reperfusion injury by stabilizing dormant conformations to limit ROS on reoxygenation; conversely, timely reactivation may be desirable in other contexts. Grba 2024 outlines how state control can be manipulated biochemically/structurally (Science, Jun 2024). (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11)
- Drug design against the Q-site. Biguanide structures and state selectivity suggest medicinal chemistry avenues to target the amphipathic Q-channel pocket in pathological states (e.g., cancer metabolism), complementing canonical Q-site inhibitors like rotenone/piericidin. Bridges 2023 provides structural blueprints (Science, Jan 2023). (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2)
- Mechanism-guided safety/efficacy profiling. The rotenone pathway study quantifies how ligand flexibility and channel gating (NDUFS7/ND1/NDUFS2) shape potency. These insights enable prediction and optimization of inhibitor kinetics and species specificity for translational efforts (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023). (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 5-6)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- State-of-the-field structural mechanism. Science and Science Advances papers (Hirst lab and collaborators) synthesize structure–function relationships and outstanding mechanistic questions (e.g., directionality and coupling across the E-channel, transient hydration, and the A/D transition). They emphasize the central positioning of NDUFS2 His/Tyr ligands at the Q-site and the importance of loop ordering for catalysis and regulation (Science, Jun 2024; Science Advances, Aug 2023). (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11, grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10)
- Comprehensive inhibitor perspectives. A 2024 review summarizes how Q-channel architecture modulates interactions with artificial acceptors and inhibitors; it reaffirms a deep (redox-proximal) site near N2 and a more central site, with conformational state controlling chamber width/loop order—features that affect ligand movement and binding energetics (Int J Mol Sci, Dec 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421). (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 9-11, grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 8-9)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Rotenone flexibility–potency coupling. A straight-locked rotenone analog exhibited ~600-fold reduced inhibitory potency (IC50 4 µM vs 6.9 nM), quantifying how conformational exchange governs Q-channel passage and high-affinity binding at ROT1 (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6). (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4)
- Disease burden context for complex I defects. Reviews summarizing mitochondrial disease indicate that complex I deficiencies constitute a major share of early-onset mitochondrial disorders; nuclear-encoded CI genes (including NDUFS2) are recurrently implicated in Leigh and Leigh-like syndromes, as well as cardiomyopathy/encephalomyopathy presentations (Antioxidants, Jan 2025, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox14010076). Although 2025, this is consistent with the broader 2023–2024 literature emphasizing CI gene involvement. (osz2025mutationsofthe pages 2-4)

Functional annotation of human NDUFS2 (UniProt O75306)
- Primary biochemical role. NDUFS2 is a catalytic/structural subunit of complex I embedded in the matrix-arm Q-module, shaping the Q-channel where NADH-derived electrons (via FMN and Fe–S clusters to N2) reduce ubiquinone. It contributes the conserved His59/Tyr108 pair positioned to stabilize and orient the Q headgroup and engage Q-site ligands; this environment also couples to water-mediated networks that communicate with the membrane domain for proton pumping. (Sci Adv, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359; Sci Rep, Apr 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6). (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4)
- Subcellular localization. NDUFS2 resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of the matrix-facing peripheral arm; its Q-site-facing loops and neighboring ND1/NDUFS7 segments form an amphipathic tunnel extending from the membrane into the catalytic core. (Science, Jan 2023; Acta Cryst D, Feb 2024). (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2, laube2024usingcryoemto pages 7-9)
- Key residues and structural neighborhoods. His59 and Tyr108 in NDUFS2 form a conserved ligand pair at the redox-proximal Q-site (ROT1). Adjacent residues in NDUFS7 (e.g., Met70, Arg87, Thr59) and ND1 (e.g., Phe224 and loop elements) define the narrow entrance and central kink, gating ligand entry and influencing state-dependent ordering of the NDUFS2 β1–β2 loop and the ND1 TMH5–6 loop. (Sci Rep, Apr 2023; Sci Adv, Aug 2023). (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 4-5, grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10)
- Active vs deactive/dormant states. In the active (closed) state, the Q-channel is enclosed and ordered; in dormant/deactive states, Q-channel loops (including from NDUFS2) are disordered and the chamber widens, altering ligand accessibility. Ischemia promotes the dormant form to mitigate oxidative damage, and reactivation entails structural resealing of the channel. (Science, Jun 2024; Science, Jan 2023). (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11, bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2)
- Inhibitor interactions at the Q-site. Biguanides preferentially bind the deactive state in an amphipathic Q-channel region and can exert local chaotropic effects on a membrane helix; rotenone travels from the membrane through a constriction shaped by NDUFS7/ND1, then occupies a redox-proximal site engaging NDUFS2-His59 (and nearby Tyr108), with bent↔straight interconversion required for high potency. (Science, Jan 2023; Sci Rep, Apr 2023). (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 1-2)
- Pathway context. Electron transfer proceeds FMN→Fe–S chain→N2 and onto Q at the NDUFS2/NDUFS7/ND1 chamber; proton pumping is effected across the membrane domain (ND2/ND4/ND5/ND4L) via hydrated pathways/E-channel regions connected to the Q-site environment. Static structures indicate incomplete visible proton paths, consistent with transient hydration and state coupling. (Sci Adv, Aug 2023). (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10, grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 5-8)

Human disease associations and clinical relevance
- Disease links. Biallelic pathogenic NDUFS2 variants cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency and are a recognized cause of Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like encephalopathies; reported phenotypes also include cardiomyopathy and encephalomyopathy with specific missense changes. Recent reviews aggregate variant classes and presentations and highlight NDUFS2 among recurrent nuclear CI disease genes. (Antioxidants, Jan 2025, https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox14010076). (osz2025mutationsofthe pages 2-4)
- Mechanistic implications. Structural placement of NDUFS2 at the Q-site rationalizes how missense substitutions near His59/Tyr108 or in the β1–β2 loop could impair Q binding/reduction, perturb state transitions, or destabilize Q-channel hydration networks, contributing to primary CI deficiency and Leigh pathogenesis. State-control findings (Science 2024) further suggest why tissue hypoxia/ischemia exacerbate disease and motivate therapeutic strategies that modulate A/D transitions. (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11)

Selected summary artifact
| Aspect | Key findings | Evidence/source |
|---|---|---|
| Identity & localization | NDUFS2 is a nuclear-encoded ~49 kDa subunit of mammalian mitochondrial Complex I that sits in the matrix-arm Q-module adjacent to the ubiquinone-binding channel and contributes structural elements to the quinone chamber. | Laube 2024, Acta Crystallogr D, https://doi.org/10.1107/s205979832400086x (laube2024usingcryoemto pages 7-9); Grba 2023, Sci Adv, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359 (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10) |
| Q-site residues (His59, Tyr108) and role | NDUFS2-His59 (His59) is a quinone/ligand-contacting residue implicated in H-bonding and stabilization of the quinone head; Tyr108 locates near the redox site and contributes to headgroup interactions and local ordering of the Q-channel. | Pereira 2023, Sci Rep, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6 (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4); Grba 2023, Sci Adv, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359 (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10) |
| Active vs deactive (dormant) states | The active (closed/turnover-ready) state features an ordered, enclosed Q-channel; the deactive/dormant state shows local disorder of Q-channel loops (including NDUFS2 loop regions) and selectively exposes distinct inhibitor-binding conformations relevant to ischemia/reperfusion regulation. | Grba 2024, Science, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ado2075 (grba2024molecularmechanismof pages 9-11); Bridges 2023, Science, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade3332 (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2) |
| Biguanide binding and state selectivity | Medicinal biguanides (model IM1092) preferentially bind an amphipathic site in the Q-channel of the deactive state (state-selective, non-classical inhibition) and can displace local helical elements; this explains metformin/phenformin state-dependent potency. | Bridges 2023, Science, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade3332 (bridges2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2); Grivennikova 2024, Int J Mol Sci, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252413421 (grivennikova2024protontranslocatingnadh–ubiquinoneoxidoreductase pages 8-9) |
| Rotenone pathway and ligand flexibility | Rotenone enters from the membrane through a narrow hydrophobic entrance and samples bent↔straight conformers; the bent form is thermodynamically favored at the redox/ROT1 site (contacts with NDUFS2-His59 and Tyr108), while locking the straight form greatly reduces potency (~600-fold), showing flexibility governs pathway kinetics and final binding. | Pereira 2023, Sci Rep, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33333-6 (pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 3-4, pereira2023mechanismofrotenone pages 6-7) |
| Proton pathways / E-channel relation to Q-site | High-resolution cryo-EM with modeled waters reveals hydrated E-channel networks connecting the ubiquinone-binding region toward ND1/ND4/ND5; NDUFS2-His59 is positioned near elements of the H-bond/water network, but a fully continuous structural proton-delivery path to ND3-D66 is not yet observed. | Grba 2023, Sci Adv, https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi1359 (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10); Grba 2023 (pages 5–8) (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 5-8) |
| Disease associations (Leigh syndrome, CI deficiency) | Pathogenic missense and truncating variants in NDUFS2 cause autosomal-recessive Complex I deficiency and Leigh or Leigh-like syndromes; multiple cohort/review articles report NDUFS2 among recurrent nuclear CI disease genes and link CI defects to early-onset mitochondrial disease burden. | Clinical/cohort and review summaries (examples): reported variant lists and cohort analyses (e.g., NDUFS2-linked Leigh cases) (osz2025mutationsofthe pages 2-4) |
| Assembly / adjacent subunits influencing NDUFS2 | NDUFS2 function and Q-channel architecture are influenced by neighboring subunits (NDUFS7, ND1) and their loop conformations; ND1 and NDUFS7 residues shape the Q-channel entrance and ordering of NDUFS2 loops, and assembly factors/modular maturation affect NDUFS2 incorporation. | Laube 2024, Acta Cryst D, https://doi.org/10.1107/s205979832400086x (laube2024usingcryoemto pages 7-9); Yin 2024, EMBO J, https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-023-00001-4 (grba2023investigationofhydrated pages 9-10) |

Notes on verification and ambiguity
- The symbol “NDUFS2” is unambiguous in human literature as the 49 kDa subunit of complex I in the nuclear genome. The evidence above consistently maps to the human/mammalian enzyme and conserved residues His59/Tyr108 at the Q-site. No conflicting symbols from other organisms were used to guide function; cross-species structures were leveraged only to illuminate conserved mechanisms.
