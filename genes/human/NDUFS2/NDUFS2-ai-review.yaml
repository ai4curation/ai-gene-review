description: >-
  NDUFS2 encodes the 49 kDa subunit of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase,
  EC 7.1.1.2), and is a core catalytic subunit of the Q-module in the peripheral (matrix-facing)
  arm. NDUFS2 directly contributes to the ubiquinone-binding channel, providing the conserved
  His59/Tyr108 residue pair that contacts and orients the ubiquinone headgroup during reduction.
  It binds one [4Fe-4S] cluster and is essential for both Complex I assembly and catalytic activity.
  NDUFS2 is dimethylated at Arg-85 (Arg-118 in precursor numbering) by the assembly factor NDUFAF7,
  a modification required for stabilization of early assembly intermediates. NDUFS2 is also a
  redox-sensitive component implicated in acute oxygen sensing in pulmonary artery smooth muscle
  cells, where its cysteine residues become reduced under hypoxia, inhibiting Complex I and
  triggering hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Pathogenic mutations cause mitochondrial Complex I
  deficiency (MC1DN6, presenting as Leigh syndrome) and Leber-like hereditary optic neuropathy
  (LHONAR2).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation with 'contributes_to' qualifier for the complex-level NADH dehydrogenase
      (ubiquinone) activity (EC 7.1.1.2). NDUFS2 is a core catalytic subunit that forms the
      ubiquinone-binding channel with its conserved His59/Tyr108 residue pair, directly
      participating in ubiquinone reduction. The 'contributes_to' qualifier is correct because
      the full reaction (NADH + ubiquinone + 5H+_in -> NAD+ + ubiquinol + 4H+_out) requires
      the entire 45-subunit complex. Multiple studies demonstrate that NDUFS2 mutations impair

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation inferred from GO:0008137 (NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone activity) via
      logical inference. Complex I couples electron transfer to proton translocation across
      the inner membrane. NDUFS2 does not directly participate in proton pumping, which is
      performed by the membrane arm subunits (ND2, ND4, ND5). However, the Q-site region
      where NDUFS2 resides is mechanistically coupled to the proton-pumping machinery via
      hydrated channels and the E-channel (Grba et al. 2023, Sci Adv). As an IEA for a
      Complex I subunit, this is acceptable as a broader process annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While proton translocation is performed by the membrane arm, this is a legitimate
      broader process annotation for a Complex I subunit. The coupling between NDUFS2's
      Q-site and proton pumping is mechanistically real, though the annotation is not
      the most informative for NDUFS2 specifically.

      interact with NADH (the NADH-binding site is in the N-module on NDUFV1). This is a

      for NDUFS2.
    action: MODIFY

      While Complex I as a whole acts on NADH, NDUFS2 specifically is in the Q-module and
      interacts with ubiquinone, not NADH. The NADH binding site is on NDUFV1 in the N-module.
      For NDUFS2 specifically, quinone binding (GO:0048038) is more appropriate. However,
      as an IEA from InterPro domain mapping to the Complex I 49kDa subunit family, it is

      IEA from Ensembl Compara for Complex I assembly. NDUFS2 is a core subunit of the
      Q-module that forms the initial nucleus of the peripheral arm junction with the
      membrane arm. Its methylation by NDUFAF7 at Arg-85 stabilizes the early 400 kDa
      assembly intermediate (PMID:24089531). Mutations in NDUFS2 affect assembly
      (PMID:14749350).

    reason: >-
      NDUFS2 is essential for Complex I assembly as a structural core subunit, and its
      modification by NDUFAF7 is required for the assembly pathway. However, its role is
      primarily as a structural component that must be present for assembly to proceed,
      rather than having a specific assembly factor function. Assembly-related annotations

  description: >-
    NDUFS2 is the 49 kDa core catalytic subunit of mitochondrial Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone
    oxidoreductase, EC 7.1.1.2), located in the Q-module of the peripheral (matrix-facing)
    arm. It directly forms the ubiquinone-binding channel with the conserved His59/Tyr108
    residue pair that contacts and orients the ubiquinone headgroup during reduction. NDUFS2
    binds one [4Fe-4S] cluster (designated N2), the terminal electron acceptor in the Fe-S
    relay chain before ubiquinone. NDUFS2 enables ubiquinone binding (GO:0048039) and electron
    transfer activity via its N2 cluster, and contributes to the overall NADH dehydrogenase
    (ubiquinone) activity (GO:0008137) of the 45-subunit Complex I holoenzyme. The Asp446Asn
    mutation near the coenzyme Q binding pocket specifically impairs catalytic activity without
    affecting complex assembly, demonstrating NDUFS2's direct role in the enzymatic reaction.
    NDUFS2 is dimethylated at Arg-85 by the assembly factor NDUFAF7, a modification required
    for stabilization of early assembly intermediates. Pathogenic mutations cause mitochondrial
    Complex I deficiency (MC1DN6, Leigh syndrome) and Leber-like hereditary optic neuropathy
