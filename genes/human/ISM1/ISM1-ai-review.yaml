gene_symbol: ISM1
product_type: PROTEIN
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: Isthmin-1, secreted protein (~60 kDa) containing thrombospondin type
  1 repeats and AMOP domain. Functions as secreted glycoprotein in extracellular matrix
  and circulation. Acts as angiogenesis inhibitor - blocks endothelial cell proliferation,
  migration, and tube formation, inhibiting blood vessel formation. Binds to cell
  surface receptors (integrin αVβ5, GRP78) to regulate cell adhesion and migration.
  Involved in developmental processes including midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation,
  neuronal differentiation, and axon guidance. Modulates TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways.
  Proapoptotic in certain contexts - induces endothelial cell apoptosis. Expression
  in brain, kidney, and other tissues during development and in adults. Secreted into
  extracellular space where it interacts with ECM components and cell surface receptors.
  May have roles in tissue homeostasis, wound healing, and tumor suppression through
  anti-angiogenic activity.
