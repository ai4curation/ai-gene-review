description: Isthmin-1 is a secreted glycoprotein (~50-60 kDa) containing a thrombospondin
  type-1 repeat (TSR1) and a C-terminal AMOP (adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and
  other proteins) domain. ISM1 functions as an extracellular signaling factor with
  multiple biological roles. Its primary established function is as an angiogenesis
  inhibitor that blocks endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation.
  ISM1 binds to cell-surface GRP78 (high affinity, Kd ~8.6 nM) and integrin alphaVbeta5
  (low affinity) to trigger apoptosis in activated endothelial cells and tumor cells.
  The protein is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and traffics to
  mitochondria where it blocks ATP transport via the adenine nucleotide transporter.
  ISM1 also functions as a novel adipokine that promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes
  and skeletal muscle through PI3K-Akt signaling independent of insulin/IGF receptors.
  In development, ISM1 acts as a Nodal antagonist that modulates TGF-beta family
  signaling for proper left-right patterning. Expression is detected in lung, brain,
  kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and immune cells (NK cells, NKT cells,
  Th17 cells). ISM1 binds integrin alpha8beta1 in kidney mesenchyme to regulate
  branching morphogenesis during nephrogenesis.

  review:
    summary: ISM1 is a well-established angiogenesis inhibitor. The protein blocks
      endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation through binding
      to cell-surface receptors (GRP78 and integrin alphaVbeta5), triggering apoptosis.
      This anti-angiogenic function is supported by extensive experimental evidence
      from multiple studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of ISM1. The anti-angiogenic activity has been
      demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant ISM1 or its C-terminal AMOP
      domain inhibits endothelial tube formation and suppresses angiogenesis in mouse
      models. Overexpression of ISM1 in tumor cells strongly suppressed tumor
      vascularization and growth in xenograft models. The IBA annotation based on
      phylogenetic inference is well-supported by primary literature.

  review:
    summary: ISM1 is a secreted protein with a signal peptide that is exported to
      the extracellular space where it functions as a signaling factor. It is detected
      in circulation (serum) and associates with the extracellular matrix.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The secreted localization is fundamental to ISM1 function. UniProt annotation
      indicates secreted status, and this is confirmed by detection of circulating
      ISM1 in human serum in multiple clinical studies. ISM1 carries out its functions
      extracellularly by binding to cell-surface receptors.

  review:
    summary: ISM1 binds to integrins including alphaVbeta5 on endothelial cells
      and alpha8beta1 on kidney mesenchyme. The AMOP domain contains an RKD/KGD
      motif that mediates integrin interactions.
    action: NEW
    reason: Integrin binding is a key molecular function of ISM1 that mediates both
      its anti-angiogenic effects (via alphaVbeta5) and developmental roles (via
      alpha8beta1). This annotation should be added based on strong experimental
      evidence.

      dysfunction.
    action: NEW

        interacts with ADP/ATP carriers on the inner membrane and blocks ATP transport
        from mitochondria to cytosol, thereby causing apoptosis.
