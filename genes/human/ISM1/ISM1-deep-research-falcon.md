## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** B1AKI9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Isthmin-1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ISM1; Synonyms=C20orf82, ISM;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the isthmin family. .
- **Key Domains:** AMOP_dom. (IPR005533); Angio_Inhib/Adhesion_GPCR. (IPR051867); TSP1_rpt. (IPR000884); TSP1_rpt_sf. (IPR036383); AMOP (PF03782)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ISM1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ISM1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ISM1** (gene ID: ISM1, UniProt: B1AKI9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: ISM1 (UniProt B1AKI9)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and structure: ISM1 (Isthmin‑1) encodes a secreted glycoprotein composed of an N‑terminal signal peptide, a central thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1), and a C‑terminal AMOP domain; the human gene spans ~77.7 kb on chromosome 20p12.1 with six exons and produces a ~499 aa protein of ~60 kDa (Homo sapiens confirmed) (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 136-139, menghuan2023advancesinresearch pages 1-2). Post‑translational modifications include N‑glycosylation (Asn28, Asn39) and C‑mannosylation (Trp223, Trp226), which regulate folding, secretion, and ER→Golgi trafficking (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedc pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142). Functionally important motifs include TSR CSVTCG/WSLW and AMOP RKD/KGD (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 136-139, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 136-139).
- Family and domains: ISM1 belongs to the isthmin family. The TSR often mediates anti‑angiogenic and adhesion-related interactions, whereas the AMOP domain is implicated in receptor binding and cell adhesion (menghuan2023advancesinresearch pages 1-2, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 136-139).

Cellular localization and receptors/partners
- Localization and secretion: ISM1 is a secreted protein detectable in circulation in several human studies and also binds extracellular matrix; tissue expression is prominent in lung epithelium, brain, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and adipocytes (adipokine role) (menghuan2023advancesinresearch pages 1-2, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 136-139).
- Receptors and binding partners: Two principal receptor systems are supported by recent work. First, cell‑surface GRP78 (csGRP78) binds ISM1 with high affinity, mediating selective apoptosis of csGRP78high alveolar macrophages and controlling endothelial barrier function and permeability (PNAS 2022; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2019161119) (lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142). Second, integrins: αvβ5 has been reported as a low‑affinity ISM1 receptor linked to anti‑angiogenesis and context‑dependent adhesion signaling, while integrin α8β1 was identified as an ISM1 receptor in developing kidney mesenchyme, transmitting FAK/Akt/ERK signaling and promoting mesenchymal condensation (Nature Communications 2023; DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37992-x) (gao2023isthmin1(ism1)modulates pages 6-9, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142).

Primary molecular functions and pathways
- Anti‑angiogenic and apoptosis pathways: Soluble ISM1 can trigger apoptosis, either via αvβ5‑caspase‑8/3 or via csGRP78‑mediated internalization and mitochondrial dysfunction; in contrast, immobilized/ECM‑bound ISM1 can activate FAK and support adhesion/migration, underscoring context‑dependent, sometimes opposing roles (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedc pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142). In the lung, ISM1–csGRP78 signaling shapes alveolar macrophage populations and limits chronic inflammation and emphysema (PNAS 2022; 10.1073/pnas.2019161119) (lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2).
- Metabolic signaling as an adipokine: ISM1 increases glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscle, improves glucose tolerance, suppresses hepatic lipogenesis, and stimulates hepatic protein synthesis via PI3K–Akt signaling distinct from insulin/IGF receptors, engaging mTORC2 (Akt S473) and mTORC1→S6 for protein synthesis (Cell Metabolism 2021; DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2021.07.010) (jiang2021isthmin1isan pages 1-3). Phosphoproteomic mapping shows ~53% overlap with insulin but hundreds of unique phospho‑events, including translational control and muscle function nodes (eLife 2022; DOI: 10.7554/eLife.80014) (zhao2022phosphoproteomicmappingreveals pages 1-1).
- Developmental morphogenesis: ISM1 is essential for early kidney development; Ism1−/− mice display impaired ureteric bud branching and mesenchyme condensation due to reduced Gdnf/Ret signaling. Mechanistically, ISM1 binds integrin α8β1 on mesenchyme, activates FAK/Akt/ERK, promotes N‑cadherin expression and aggregation, and restores GDNF/RET signaling ex vivo (Nature Communications 2023; 10.1038/s41467-023-37992-x) (gao2023isthmin1(ism1)modulates pages 6-9).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Kidney branching via integrin α8β1: Gao et al. (2023) define ISM1 as a ligand for integrin α8β1 in kidney mesenchyme, providing precise receptor identity and downstream signaling during nephrogenesis (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37992-x; published April 2023) (gao2023isthmin1(ism1)modulates pages 6-9).
- Clinical biomarker studies (2023–2024): Cross‑sectional human studies report altered circulating ISM1 in metabolic disease. In Chinese adults, ISM1 was higher in T2DM vs controls (median 7.78 ng/mL [IQR 6.33–9.06] vs 5.22 [3.86–6.04]; adjusted OR 4.218 [95% CI 1.843–9.653]; Diabetes, Metab Syndrome and Obesity; published July 3, 2023; https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s411127) (liao2023serumisthmin1was pages 1-2). In BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (Sept 2024), ISM1 was higher in MAFLD, T2DM, and MAFLD+T2DM vs controls (means ~1.13–1.19 vs 0.83 ng/mL), correlated positively with BMI, fasting insulin, HOMA‑IR, TC and negatively with HDL‑C; higher ISM1 quartiles tracked more metabolic syndrome components (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004514) (lei2024serumisthmin1is pages 3-5). In individuals with obesity, ISM1 in serum tracked the subcutaneous/visceral fat ratio (SFA/VFA) measured by CT and correlated with adipose gene expression, supporting a role as a non‑invasive biomarker of abdominal fat partitioning (Cardiovascular Diabetology; Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-023-02075-0) (lopezyus2023isthmin1(ism1)a pages 6-9). In a 2024 community cohort (n=522) without diabetes, ISM1 was higher in men than women (1.74 vs 0.88 ng/mL) and, in men, each unit increase in ISM1 associated with 32% lower odds of isolated post‑challenge hyperglycemia (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49–0.90); adding ISM1 to a risk model improved net reclassification by 58% (Frontiers in Endocrinology; July 25, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1394190) (fan2024sexspecificassociationof pages 1-2).
- Field synthesis: 2024 reviews highlight ISM1 among emerging secreted regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, emphasizing distinct signaling from canonical hormones and sex‑dependent differences in humans (Diabetologia; Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-024-06253-x) (wat2024novelsecretedregulators pages 5-7).
- Structural advance and controversy (2025 context): The first crystal structure of ISM1 (AMOP+TSR) revealed an AMOP fold reminiscent of streptavidin and reported that highly purified ISM1 did not stimulate AKT in pre‑adipocyte assays; activity in earlier studies could partly reflect co‑purifying growth factors (Nature Communications; Apr 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58828-w) (li2025crystalstructureof pages 7-8). This does not negate in vivo adipokine effects reported in 2021/2022 but introduces caution regarding assay conditions and receptor identity in adipocytes.

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Metabolic disease biomarkers: ISM1 is measurable in serum by ELISA and associates with T2DM, MAFLD, obesity distribution, and IPH risk, with sex‑specific patterns; quantitative thresholds vary across assays/cohorts (liao2023serumisthmin1was pages 1-2, lei2024serumisthmin1is pages 3-5, lopezyus2023isthmin1(ism1)a pages 6-9, fan2024sexspecificassociationof pages 1-2).
- Respiratory disease therapeutic concept: Pulmonary delivery of recombinant ISM1 depleted pro‑inflammatory csGRP78high alveolar macrophages, reduced inflammation, and blocked emphysema progression in cigarette smoke–induced COPD mice, suggesting a translational path for inhaled rISM1 (PNAS 2022; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2019161119) (lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Pathway integration: Evidence supports ISM1 as a pleiotropic secreted factor coupling extracellular adhesion modules (TSR/AMOP) to integrin and csGRP78 systems, thereby influencing angiogenesis/permeability, immune cell apoptosis, and developmental morphogenesis. In metabolism, ISM1 engages PI3K–Akt with a signaling signature overlapping but distinct from insulin, consistent with a separate receptor system; structural work underscores the need to identify definitive adipocyte receptors and control for contaminants in biochemical assays (zhao2022phosphoproteomicmappingreveals pages 1-1, jiang2021isthmin1isan pages 1-3, li2025crystalstructureof pages 7-8).
- Context dependence: The dichotomy between soluble vs immobilized ISM1 and between GRP78 vs integrin engagement explains divergent reports (anti‑angiogenic apoptosis vs pro‑adhesive signaling). Therapeutic targeting should therefore consider ligand presentation, receptor abundance, and tissue context (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedc pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142, lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2).

- MAFLD/T2DM vs controls: mean ISM1 ~1.13–1.19 vs 0.83 ng/mL; ISM1 positively correlated with BMI, fasting insulin, HOMA‑IR, TC; negatively with HDL‑C; ISM1 quartiles associated with greater numbers of metabolic syndrome components (BMJ Open DRC 2024; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004514) (lei2024serumisthmin1is pages 3-5).
- Obesity distribution (CT‑based): ISM1 increases across SFA/VFA ratio tertiles; serum ISM1 correlates with subcutaneous adipose expression, supporting non‑invasive biomarker potential (Cardiovasc Diabetol 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-023-02075-0) (lopezyus2023isthmin1(ism1)a pages 6-9).
- IPH in men: per unit ISM1 associated with OR 0.68 (95% CI 0.49–0.90) for isolated post‑challenge hyperglycemia; men have higher ISM1 than women (1.74 vs 0.88 ng/mL); addition to NCDRS improved NRI by 58% (Front Endocrinol 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1394190) (fan2024sexspecificassociationof pages 1-2).

Conclusions and open questions
- Verified target: ISM1 is the human secreted protein Isthmin‑1 with TSR/AMOP domains and characteristic glycosylation, acting via integrins (α8β1 in kidney; αvβ5 context‑dependently) and csGRP78. It signals through PI3K–Akt/mTOR, ERK, caspases, and Src‑junctional pathways to regulate development, vascular biology, immunity, and metabolism (gao2023isthmin1(ism1)modulates pages 6-9, lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2, zhao2022phosphoproteomicmappingreveals pages 1-1, jiang2021isthmin1isan pages 1-3).
- Clinical relevance: Serum ISM1 associates with T2DM, MAFLD, fat distribution, and IPH with quantifiable effect sizes in 2023–2024 studies, supporting biomarker potential. Sex‑specific patterns are emerging, particularly for post‑challenge glycemia (liao2023serumisthmin1was pages 1-2, lei2024serumisthmin1is pages 3-5, lopezyus2023isthmin1(ism1)a pages 6-9, fan2024sexspecificassociationof pages 1-2).
- Controversies and research needs: The adipocyte receptor(s) and direct signaling competence of purified ISM1 warrant clarification; structural insights into the AMOP fold provide a framework for mapping receptor epitopes and for rational therapeutic design (li2025crystalstructureof pages 7-8). Context‑dependent effects (soluble vs immobilized; GRP78 vs integrins) must be accounted for in translational applications (kural2024kawtherameenmuhammeda pages 139-142, kural2024kawtherameenmuhammedb pages 139-142, lam2022ism1protectslung pages 1-2).
