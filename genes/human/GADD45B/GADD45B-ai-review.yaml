description: >-
  GADD45B (Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 beta, also known as MyD118)
  is a stress-inducible protein that mediates activation of stress-responsive MAPK signaling
  pathways. The protein binds directly to the N-terminal regulatory domain of MTK1/MEKK4
  (MAP3K4), relieving autoinhibition and activating its kinase activity. This leads to
  downstream activation of both p38 MAPK and JNK cascades in response to environmental
  stresses including UV irradiation, genotoxic agents (MMS), and gamma irradiation.
  GADD45B also interacts with MKK7 (MAP2K7), where it blocks kinase activity and suppresses
  JNK-mediated apoptosis. This dual activity - activating MTK1/MEKK4 while inhibiting MKK7 -
  positions GADD45B as a key modulator of stress responses and cell fate decisions. The gene
  is transcriptionally regulated by NF-kB, and its expression is elevated in multiple myeloma
  where it promotes cancer cell survival by blocking MKK7/JNK-mediated apoptosis.
