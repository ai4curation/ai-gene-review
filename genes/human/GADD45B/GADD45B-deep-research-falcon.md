## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O75293
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 beta; AltName: Full=Myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD118; AltName: Full=Negative growth regulatory protein MyD118;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GADD45B; Synonyms=MYD118;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GADD45 family. .
- **Key Domains:** GADD45. (IPR024824); Ribosomal_eL30-like_sf. (IPR029064); Ribosomal_eL8/eL30/eS12/Gad45. (IPR004038); Ribosomal_L7Ae (PF01248)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GADD45B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GADD45B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GADD45B** (gene ID: GADD45B, UniProt: O75293) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- Verified identity: GADD45B (human; UniProt O75293) encodes growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein beta (GADD45β; a.k.a. MyD118), a small, acidic, stress-induced protein of the GADD45 family that acts primarily as a non-enzymatic adaptor in stress and immune signaling. Family-level reviews and recent literature confirm nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, MAPK and NF-κB pathway modulation, and epigenetic roles including active DNA demethylation (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report on human GADD45B (GADD45β; UniProt O75293)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: GADD45B is one of three mammalian GADD45 proteins (α/β/γ), small (~18 kDa), highly acidic, evolutionarily conserved stress sensors induced by genotoxic and physiological stress. They lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and function via protein–protein interactions (e.g., with PCNA, CDK1/cyclin B1, p21, and MAPK components), positioning them as adaptor/scaffold proteins in DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoints, and stress signaling (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; doi:10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069, published Feb 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13).
- Subcellular localization: GADD45 proteins are predominantly nuclear but can be found in both nucleus and cytoplasm; GADD45β is described as a stress-responsive nuclear protein with reported nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; doi:10.3389/fnins.2024.1349409, published Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2024.1349409) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).
- Pathway roles: The family integrates stress signals into MAPK cascades (JNK and p38) through interactions with upstream MAP3Ks (e.g., MTK1/MEKK4) and modulates NF-κB signaling. GADD45β participates in DNA damage response, checkpoint control (S and G2/M), apoptosis/survival decisions, and immune regulation (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).
- Epigenetic regulation: GADD45 proteins facilitate active DNA demethylation by interacting with DNA demethylation machinery, thereby regulating gene expression programs; Gadd45b is specifically implicated in activity-dependent demethylation in neurons (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; published Jan 2024) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14).

2) Primary molecular functions and mechanisms (current understanding)
- Non-enzymatic adaptor in MAPK signaling: GADD45β modulates MAPK pathways by interacting with upstream MAP3Ks (e.g., MTK1/MEKK4), influencing JNK and p38 activation states, thereby affecting apoptosis, differentiation, and stress responses (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13).
- NF-κB pathway integration: GADD45β expression is regulated by NF-κB during acute inflammation, and GADD45β can interface with NF-κB signaling networks that determine immune cell phenotypes and survival under inflammatory stress (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; published Feb 2025) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13).
- DNA repair and checkpoint control: GADD45 proteins interact with PCNA and CDK complexes, supporting roles in nucleotide excision repair and in enforcing S and G2/M checkpoints following DNA damage (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).
- Epigenetic/active DNA demethylation: In neurons, Gadd45b is induced by activity and promotes DNA demethylation at specific promoters (e.g., Bdnf), coupling synaptic activity to transcriptional plasticity and adult neurogenesis (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; published Jan 2024) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14).

3) Biological processes, cellular context, and localization
- Cellular localization and context: Predominantly nuclear with nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution, consistent with roles at DNA replication/repair foci and signaling hubs (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).
- Stress response and survival/apoptosis: GADD45β influences cell survival under genotoxic stress by shaping JNK/p38 outputs; family members contribute to checkpoint enforcement and can confer protection from apoptosis in certain contexts (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2).
- Immunity/inflammation: GADD45β modulates innate and adaptive immune responses, including cytokine signaling (e.g., IL-18) and NF-κB–dependent programs that regulate inflammatory outcomes and autoimmunity (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13).
- Neurobiology and plasticity: Gadd45b is linked to activity-dependent epigenetic remodeling, adult neurogenesis, and behavioral plasticity; dysregulation of GADD45β expression is reported across neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., MDD, PTSD, BD, Parkinson’s disease), and in addiction-related adaptations (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; published Jan 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2024.1349409) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 10-12, huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14, huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-15).

4) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- 2024 expert review (CNS focus): A comprehensive review synthesizes GADD45 family roles in neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders, detailing GADD45β’s nuclear localization, stress signaling via MAPK and NF-κB, and its function in activity-dependent demethylation and neuroplasticity. It compiles evidence for altered GADD45β expression across CNS disorders and highlights the family as potential therapeutic targets for CNS disease (Frontiers in Neuroscience, Jan 2024; doi:10.3389/fnins.2024.1349409) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, huang2024advancesinthe pages 10-12, huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14).
- Immune/inflammation perspective: A 2025 immunology review (capturing 2023–2024 literature) summarizes GADD45B’s adaptor functions at the nexus of MAPK and NF-κB, roles in checkpoint control, and immunomodulatory effects in inflammatory and autoimmune disease models (Frontiers in Immunology, Feb 2025; doi:10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker and disease association: Integrative analyses and reviews implicate GADD45B dysregulation in human disease, including neurological disorders and inflammatory pathologies, supporting exploration of GADD45B as a biomarker candidate in specific contexts (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 10-12, ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13, huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic targeting concepts: Expert authors emphasize the therapeutic potential of modulating GADD45 family function in CNS diseases and inflammatory conditions; while concrete drug examples targeting GADD45B are not detailed in the cited 2023–2024 sources here, the mechanistic positioning of GADD45B within MAPK and NF-κB networks highlights tractable intervention points (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13).

6) Expert opinions and analysis
- Consensus from recent reviews: GADD45B is viewed as a rapid-response, non-enzymatic adaptor integrating DNA damage and inflammatory/physiological stress into MAPK and NF-κB signaling, linking environmental stimuli to gene expression programs (including active DNA demethylation) and cell-fate control. The breadth of roles across immunity and neurobiology suggests context-dependent pro-survival, pro-apoptotic, or plasticity-promoting functions, reinforcing careful tissue- and stimulus-specific investigation for translational development (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2025) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14, ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13).

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Neuropsychiatric and addiction models: The 2024 CNS review summarizes multiple primary studies reporting disorder- and region-specific dysregulation of GADD45β (e.g., decreases in MDD and PTSD prefrontal/limbic regions; increases in addiction-related brain regions after acute cocaine), and functional knockdown experiments that attenuate cocaine-induced behavioral and transcriptional responses (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Jan 2024) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 10-12).
- Epigenetic plasticity: Foundational experiments summarized in 2024 identify activity-induced Gadd45b as a regulator of promoter demethylation (e.g., Bdnf) and adult neurogenesis, establishing a quantitative mechanistic link between neuronal activity and chromatin remodeling (Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024; Jan 2024) (huang2024advancesinthe pages 14-14).

8) Notes on domain and structural inferences
- Protein family/domains: While recent reviews emphasize function over structure, GADD45 proteins share a conserved fold associated with nucleic acid- and protein-binding and are annotated with interactions at replication/repair machinery and MAPK pathway components, consistent with the UniProt domain annotations and the family’s adaptor role (Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; Frontiers in Neuroscience, 2024) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2, huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2).

Limitations and scope
- This synthesis is grounded in recent peer-reviewed reviews from 2024–2025 and focuses on human GADD45B. Certain classic mechanistic specifics such as direct binding interfaces to MKK7 in human cells and specific clinical-stage inhibitors were not detailed in the evidence retrieved here; thus, translational claims are framed at a conceptual level pending direct primary citations (huang2024advancesinthe pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 1-2, ma2025growtharrestand pages 13-13).
