description: PAX6 is a paired-box transcription factor with dual DNA-binding domains
  (paired domain and homeodomain) that functions as a master regulator of eye development
  (aniridia gene) and is critical for neural development, particularly in maintaining
  cortical progenitor/radial glia identity and regulating neurogenesis timing. It
  also plays roles in pancreatic endocrine development. PAX6 acts in the nucleus to
  regulate developmental gene programs through sequence-specific DNA binding. Haploinsufficiency
  causes aniridia and related eye defects.
