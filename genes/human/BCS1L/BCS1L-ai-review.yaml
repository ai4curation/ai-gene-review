description: >-
  BCS1L (Mitochondrial chaperone BCS1) is a conserved AAA-type ATPase that functions as a
  dedicated assembly factor for mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex III (cytochrome bc1
  complex). BCS1L forms a heptameric ring embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and
  uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate the fully folded Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1)
  from the matrix across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space (IMS), where it is
  incorporated into pre-Complex III. This is an essential late step in CIII biogenesis.
  BCS1L is NOT a structural subunit of the mature Complex III; it is an assembly factor that
  acts transiently during biogenesis. The protein has a single N-terminal transmembrane helix,
  a BCS1-specific middle domain, and a C-terminal AAA ATPase domain. It also interacts with
  LETM1 and influences LETM1 complex formation. Loss-of-function mutations in BCS1L cause
  a spectrum of diseases including GRACILE syndrome (growth retardation, aminoaciduria,
  cholestasis, iron overload, lactic acidosis, and early death), Bjornstad syndrome
  (sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti), and mitochondrial complex III deficiency
  nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1). BCS1L is the human ortholog of yeast Bcs1.

    summary: >-
      BCS1L translocates the folded Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1) from the
      mitochondrial matrix across the inner membrane for incorporation into pre-Complex III.
      This function is conserved from yeast Bcs1 to human BCS1L. The IBA annotation to
      GO:0032979 (protein insertion into mitochondrial inner membrane from matrix)
      accurately captures this core translocase function. The deep research review confirms
      BCS1L as an "ATP-driven translocase/chaperone that translocates the folded Rieske
      Fe-S protein (UQCRFS1 / RISP) from the matrix into the IMS"
      (file:human/BCS1L/BCS1L-deep-research-falcon.md). UniProt describes it as a
      "Chaperone necessary for the incorporation of Rieske iron-sulfur protein UQCRFS1
      into the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III" (PMID:11528392, PMID:9878253).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This IBA annotation is well-supported and at the correct level of specificity.
      BCS1L's primary molecular mechanism is the ATP-driven translocation of the folded
      UQCRFS1 from the matrix side into/through the inner membrane. This is the defining
      translocase activity of BCS1L and is phylogenetically conserved from yeast to human.
      The annotation is well-placed: BCS1L does insert a protein (UQCRFS1) into or through
      the mitochondrial inner membrane from the matrix.

      "disassembly of the respiratory chains." This broad disassembly phenotype was
      interpreted as affecting Complex IV assembly as well. However, BCS1L is specifically
      a Complex III assembly factor. There is no evidence that BCS1L directly participates
      in Complex IV biogenesis. The CIV assembly defect observed upon BCS1L knockdown is
      an indirect consequence of CIII destabilization, since CI, CIII, and CIV form
      supercomplexes and loss of one component can destabilize others. This is analogous
      to how SURF1 (a CIV assembly factor) mutations affect other complexes secondarily.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      BCS1L is not a Complex IV assembly factor. It is a Complex III assembly factor.
      The observed effect on Complex IV assembly upon BCS1L knockdown is a secondary
      consequence of CIII destabilization affecting supercomplex stability. Annotating
      BCS1L to CIV assembly conflates indirect downstream effects with direct function.
      This is an over-annotation analogous to the CI assembly annotation.

# ===== ANNOTATION 19: GO:0045275 (CC) - TAS =====

    label: respiratory chain complex III
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9878253
  review:
    summary: >-
      This TAS annotation places BCS1L as part_of "respiratory chain complex III"
      (GO:0045275). The GOA file uses the qualifier "part_of." GO:0045275 is defined as
      "A protein complex that transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and
      translocates two protons across a membrane." BCS1L is NOT a structural subunit of
      the mature Complex III. It is an assembly factor that transiently associates with
      pre-Complex III during biogenesis but is not a component of the final holoenzyme.
      The original paper (PMID:9878253) describes BCS1 as "involved in the assembly of
      complex III" in yeast, not as a subunit. UniProt describes BCS1L as a "Chaperone
      necessary for the incorporation of Rieske iron-sulfur protein UQCRFS1 into the
      mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III," clearly distinguishing it from a
      structural subunit. The Reactome pathway (R-HSA-9865881) places BCS1L as an
      assembly factor, not as a component of the mature complex.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      BCS1L is NOT a structural subunit of respiratory chain complex III. It is a transient
      assembly factor that facilitates UQCRFS1 incorporation into pre-CIII but is not
      part of the mature complex. The "part_of" qualifier in GOA makes this annotation
      explicitly incorrect -- BCS1L is not part of the CIII holoenzyme. The founding paper
      (PMID:9878253) describes BCS1 as involved in "assembly" of CIII, not as a component.
      This annotation likely arose from confusion between an assembly factor and a
      structural subunit. The correct annotations for BCS1L are to CIII assembly
      (GO:0034551, already present) and to the mitochondrial inner membrane (GO:0005743,
      already present). This parallels the SURF1 case where annotation to
      "respiratory chain complex" was modified because SURF1 is an assembly factor,
      not a structural subunit.

# ===== NEW ANNOTATION 1: GO:0008320 (MF) - protein transmembrane transporter activity =====
- term:
    id: GO:0008320
    label: protein transmembrane transporter activity
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9878253
  review:
    summary: >-
      BCS1L functions as an ATP-driven transmembrane translocase that moves the folded
      Rieske Fe-S protein (UQCRFS1) from the matrix across the inner membrane into the
      intermembrane space. This translocase function is conserved from yeast Bcs1 to
      human BCS1L. GO:0008320 (protein transmembrane transporter activity) is defined as
      "Enables the transfer of a protein from one side of a membrane to the other." This
      accurately describes BCS1L's core molecular function. The deep research review
      describes BCS1L as a "specialized transmembrane protein translocase for a folded
      cofactor-containing substrate" with an "ATP-coupled airlock-like gating mechanism."
      This annotation is missing from the current set and would capture the specific MF
      of BCS1L that goes beyond simple ATP hydrolysis.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The current annotation set lacks a specific MF annotation capturing BCS1L's
      translocase activity. While ATP hydrolysis (GO:0016887) and ATP binding (GO:0005524)
      are present, these describe the energy source, not the actual function. GO:0008320
      (protein transmembrane transporter activity) would capture what BCS1L actually does
      with the energy from ATP hydrolysis: it translocates a protein (UQCRFS1) across
      the inner membrane. This is more informative than the generic protein binding
      currently annotated.

  description: >-
    BCS1L is an AAA-type ATPase that uses ATP hydrolysis to power the translocation of the
    folded Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1) from the mitochondrial matrix across the
    inner membrane into the intermembrane space, where UQCRFS1 is incorporated into
    pre-Complex III to complete CIII assembly. BCS1L forms a heptameric ring in the inner
    membrane, operating via an ATP/ADP-dependent airlock-like gating mechanism. This is
    the sole known function of BCS1L -- it is a dedicated CIII assembly factor and UQCRFS1
    translocase, not a structural subunit of the mature complex.
