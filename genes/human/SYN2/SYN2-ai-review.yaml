description: >-
  Synapsin-2 (SYN2) is a presynaptic phosphoprotein of the synapsin family that
  associates with the cytosolic surface of synaptic vesicles. It functions as a
  synaptic vesicle-tethering and clustering scaffold whose assembly state is
  regulated by phosphorylation and cellular ATP levels. SYN2 operates through two
  complementary mechanisms: liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that predominates
  at inhibitory synapses, and tetramerization-dependent cross-linking (via Syn2a
  isoform) that organizes the reserve pool at excitatory synapses. The protein
  maintains the synaptic vesicle reserve pool, regulates vesicle mobility, and
  supports sustained neurotransmission during high-frequency activity. SYN2
  contains conserved N-terminal A-C domains that mediate SV association, and
  intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains including the E-domain that binds
  alpha-synuclein and is necessary for its synaptic function.

    summary: >-
      Synapsin-2 is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with the
      cytosolic face of synaptic vesicle membranes via its N-terminal domains
      (A-C domains). The deep research confirms SYN2 is "enriched at presynaptic
      boutons and axons; peripherally associated with SV membranes on the
      cytosolic side" [Longfield et al. 2024, Stavsky et al. 2024]. UniProt

      Synaptic vesicle clustering is the primary molecular function of SYN2.
