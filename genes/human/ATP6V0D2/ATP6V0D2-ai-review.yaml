description: >-
  ATP6V0D2 encodes the d2 isoform of the V0 d subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase).
  The V-ATPase is a multisubunit enzyme consisting of a peripheral V1 domain that hydrolyzes
  ATP and a membrane-integral V0 domain responsible for proton translocation. The d subunit
  is part of the V0 domain and plays a central role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton
  transport by directly interacting with the D and F subunits of the V1 central stalk.
  ATP6V0D2 shows tissue-restricted expression, predominantly in kidney intercalated cells
  and osteoclasts, where V-ATPases function at the plasma membrane for urinary acidification
  and bone resorption, respectively. Recent studies have also demonstrated that ATP6V0D2
  facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion by interacting with RAB7 and HOPS complex
  components (e.g., VPS41), thereby promoting SNARE complex assembly. This fusion-promoting
  function is distinct from the classical proton-pumping role and has implications for
  lysosomal degradation and autophagy.

    summary: >-
      ATP6V0D2 is definitively a component of the V-ATPase complex. The d2 subunit
      is part of the membrane-integral V0 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. This has
      been confirmed through multiple lines of evidence including immunoprecipitation
      studies showing that d2 directly interacts with V1 subunits D and F
      [PMID:18752060 "d1-GST and d2-GST, but not GST alone, are each able to pull down
      the H+-ATPase D and F subunits from solubilized human kidney membrane preparations"].

  review:
    summary: >-
      ATP6V0D2 is part of the V-ATPase which functions via a rotational mechanism.
      The d subunit forms part of the pump's central stalk and is important in the
      rotary mechanism, as demonstrated by its direct interaction with the central
      stalk D and F subunits [PMID:18752060]. However, the d2 subunit itself does not
      have ATPase catalytic activity - it is a structural component that couples ATP
      hydrolysis (occurring in V1) to proton translocation (in V0).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the d2 subunit is not itself the catalytic subunit, it is an integral
      component of the V-ATPase that contributes to the rotational mechanism by
      linking the V1 central stalk to the V0 proteolipid ring. The IBA annotation
      correctly captures the function of the assembled complex.

  review:
    summary: >-
      From the study demonstrating that d2 directly interacts with V-ATPase
      D and F subunits [PMID:18752060 "d1 and d2 interact directly with the
      D and F subunits"]. While the IPI evidence supports protein binding,
      the generic term is uninformative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Generic "protein binding" annotation does not convey functional information.
      The specific interactions (with D and F subunits, RAB7, HOPS components)
      are better captured by complex membership and process annotations.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Very general membrane localization annotation. ATP6V0D2 is a peripheral
      membrane protein that associates with the V0 domain of the V-ATPase
      [PMID:18752060 "It associates with the membrane bound V0 domain, probably
      by protein-protein interactions rather than being directly anchored in
      the membrane"].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct but very general annotation. More specific membrane localizations
      (lysosomal membrane, plasma membrane, etc.) are more informative but
      this is not incorrect.

    ATP6V0D2 is a structural component of the V0 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase,
    serving as the d2 isoform of the d subunit. It links the V1 central stalk
    (D and F subunits) to the V0 proteolipid ring, playing a critical role in
    coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation. Direct biochemical evidence
    from pull-down and in vitro binding experiments [PMID:18752060]; structural
    modeling showing d2 is orthologous to bacterial A-ATPase subunit C.

    As part of the V-ATPase, ATP6V0D2 contributes to acidification of intracellular
    compartments (lysosomes, endosomes) and extracellular spaces (in specialized
    cells like kidney intercalated cells and osteoclasts). Immunolocalization in
    kidney intercalated cells [PMID:15800125]; functional studies showing ATP6V0D2
    depletion impairs lysosomal acidification [Li et al. 2025 Autophagy].

    ATP6V0D2 facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion independent of its role
    in proton pumping, by directly interacting with RAB7 and HOPS complex
    components (VPS41), promoting SNARE complex assembly. Co-IP, GST pulldown,
    and colocalization studies in human cells [Li et al. 2025 Autophagy] showing
    direct interaction with RAB7 and VPS41; knockdown impairs fusion and increases
    autophagosome accumulation.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Does ATP6V0D2 have a specific role in osteoclast bone resorption distinct
    from d1, given its co-localization with a3 rather than a4 in osteoclasts?
    ATP6V0D2 associates with different a-subunit isoforms in different tissues
    (a4 in kidney, a3 in osteoclast). The functional significance of these
    isoform combinations remains unclear.
- question: >-
    Is the autophagosome-lysosome fusion function of ATP6V0D2 independent of
    its incorporation into the V-ATPase complex? Recent studies suggest ATP6V0D2
    promotes fusion via RAB7/HOPS interactions. It is unclear whether this
    requires assembled V-ATPase or if d2 has an independent fusion-promoting function.
suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Test whether ATP6V0D2 mutants that cannot interact with D/F subunits
    (and thus cannot assemble into V-ATPase) retain autophagosome-lysosome
    fusion activity. This would distinguish V-ATPase-dependent from
    V-ATPase-independent functions of ATP6V0D2 in autophagy.
- description: >-
    Generate tissue-specific d2 knockout mice (kidney intercalated cell-specific,
    osteoclast-specific) to define physiological roles. This would clarify
    whether d2 has unique functions not compensated by d1 in specialized cell types.
