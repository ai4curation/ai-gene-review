description: >-
  Frizzled-7 (FZD7) is a seven-transmembrane receptor belonging to the class F
  G-protein coupled receptor family. It functions as the primary receptor for Wnt
  ligands, transducing both canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and non-canonical
  Wnt signaling pathways (planar cell polarity/PCP and Wnt/Ca2+). The receptor
  contains an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that binds Wnt proteins,
  a seven-transmembrane core, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that recruits
  Dishevelled (DVL) and other PDZ domain-containing proteins. FZD7 is essential
  for human embryonic stem cell self-renewal, skeletal muscle satellite stem cell
  maintenance, and postnatal angiogenesis. It is frequently overexpressed in
  multiple cancers where it drives tumor progression through Wnt pathway activation.
  FZD7 also serves as a receptor for C. difficile toxin B in colonic epithelium.

    FZD7 functions as a transmembrane Wnt receptor at the plasma membrane, binding
    Wnt ligands via its extracellular cysteine-rich domain and transducing signals
    through recruitment of intracellular adaptor proteins including Dishevelled (DVL).

    FZD7 recruits DVL and other PDZ domain-containing proteins (SDCBP/syntenin,

    essential for signal transduction from the receptor to downstream pathways.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the relative contribution of FZD7 to canonical versus non-canonical
    Wnt signaling in different cell types? Are there cell-type-specific co-factors
    that determine pathway choice?
  experts: []

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Systematic comparison of Wnt ligand binding affinities to FZD7 using
    surface plasmon resonance or isothermal calorimetry to determine which
    Wnts preferentially activate FZD7.
  hypothesis: >-
    Different Wnt ligands may preferentially activate canonical or non-canonical
    pathways through FZD7, but quantitative binding data is limited.
