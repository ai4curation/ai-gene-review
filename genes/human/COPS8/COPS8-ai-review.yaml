        OVER-ANNOTATION: COPS8 is a PCI-domain scaffold subunit of the COP9 signalosome
        (CSN). PMID:9535219 shows the CSN complex has kinase activity, but UniProt
        notes
        this is "possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases". COPS8 itself
        doesn't have kinase catalytic activity - it's a structural scaffold. Same
        issue
        as COPS2 - the kinase activity comes from associated kinases, not CSN subunits.
