description: >-
  COPS8 (CSN8) encodes the eighth subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionarily
  conserved eight-subunit protein complex. COPS8 is a PCI-domain scaffold subunit essential
  for CSN holocomplex integrity and stability. The CSN complex functions as a master regulator
  of cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) through its deneddylation activity, removing the
  ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 from cullin scaffolds. While COPS8 itself does not possess
  catalytic activity (the deneddylase activity resides in CSN5/JAB1), it is required for
  proper complex assembly and function. CSN8 hypomorphism destabilizes the CSN holocomplex
  and leads to formation of cytoplasmic CSN5 mini-complexes. The protein localizes to both
  cytoplasm and nucleus where the CSN complex regulates CRL-dependent protein turnover
  affecting signaling pathways including p53, c-Jun/AP-1, and NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha.

        COPS8 is an integral subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex. This is well-established
        from multiple studies including the original characterization (PMID:9535219) and
        structural studies (PMID:18850735, PMID:25043011). The IBA annotation is consistent

    review:
      summary: >-
        The CSN complex mediates protein deneddylation, removing NEDD8 from cullin substrates.
        While COPS8 itself lacks deneddylase catalytic activity (which resides in CSN5), it is
        required for CSN holocomplex integrity and thus for deneddylation function. The IEA
        annotation from InterPro is appropriate as a broader functional annotation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        The CSN complex functions as the major deneddylase in cells. COPS8 is required for
        proper CSN complex assembly and therefore contributes to the deneddylation process,
        even though it does not contain the catalytic metalloprotease domain (found in CSN5).

            The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an eight-subunit protein complex that is found in

        The CSN complex was found to have kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaBalpha,
