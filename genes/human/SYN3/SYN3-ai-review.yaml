description: >-
  Synapsin-3 (SYN3) is a neuron-specific, presynaptic vesicle-associated phosphoprotein
  that is a member of the synapsin family (SYN1, SYN2, SYN3). It maintains and mobilizes
  the synaptic vesicle reserve pool through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms.
  Synapsin-3 negatively modulates dopamine release in dopaminergic terminals and
  controls recycling/reserve vesicle pool organization. The protein is phosphorylated
  by PKA at Ser9 and by Cdk5 at Ser404, which are essential for its roles in neuronal
  morphological maturation, axon specification, and neuronal survival. Unlike other
  synapsins, SYN3 shows precocious expression during development and is involved in
  early dopaminergic neuron development upstream of BDNF and Cdk5 signaling. The
  protein binds ATP (regulated by calcium) and interacts with alpha-synuclein, with
  implications for Parkinson's disease pathophysiology.

    summary: >-
      Synaptic vesicle clustering is a core function of the synapsin family. Synapsins
      are central organizers of the presynaptic vesicle cluster and reserve pool.
      The specific role of synapsins in maintaining the reserve pool through SV clustering
      is well documented in the literature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This represents a core biological process for Synapsin-3. Synapsins maintain the
      synaptic vesicle reserve pool via SV clustering, and this function is conserved
      across the synapsin family. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and

      While the interaction with SYN2 is documented and synapsins are known to form

      This annotation is transferred from mouse ortholog via Ensembl Compara. However,
      Synapsin-3 is characterized as a presynaptic protein associated with synaptic

      This annotation appears inconsistent with the established presynaptic localization
      of Synapsin-3. Synapsins are well-characterized as presynaptic vesicle-associated
      proteins. While some postsynaptic localization cannot be completely ruled out,
      this conflicts with the primary literature characterizing SYN3 as a synaptic vesicle
      membrane protein. The annotation may reflect an error in the orthology transfer
      or proteomics detection of contamination.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the specific role of Synapsin-3 in GABAergic synaptic transmission?
  - question: What is the functional significance of the SYN3-SYN2 interaction?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Conditional knockout of SYN3 in GABAergic neurons to test role in GABAergic transmission.
      This would address uncertainty about the GABAergic-specific annotation.
  - description: >-
      Structure-function analysis of SYN3-SYN2 heterodimers.
      This would elucidate the functional significance of synapsin heteromerization.
