description: >-
  DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B) is a type II topoisomerase that catalyzes
  ATP-dependent double-strand break formation, strand passage, and religation
  of DNA to resolve topological constraints during transcription, replication,
  and chromatin remodeling. Unlike TOP2A which is primarily associated with
  cell division, TOP2B is constitutively expressed in both dividing and
  non-dividing cells and plays essential roles in transcriptional activation
  of immediate early genes, regulation of long gene transcription,
  three-dimensional genome organization at TAD boundaries, and B cell
  development. TOP2B localizes to the nucleoplasm and interacts with chromatin
  at promoters, enhancers, and CTCF/cohesin binding sites at TAD boundaries.
  Mutations in TOP2B cause B cell immunodeficiency with limb anomalies and
  urogenital malformations (BILU syndrome).

        IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. While type II

        (unlike TOP2A) diffuses into the cytosol during mitosis and is not

        IMP annotation from study of TOP2 activity in HIV-1 replication.
        TOP2 inhibitors block HIV replication and TOP2B expression
        increases in infected cells. However, this is a host-pathogen
        interaction rather than core cellular function.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        Valid experimental evidence for TOP2B role in HIV replication,
        but this represents a host-pathogen interaction exploited by
        the virus rather than a core cellular function of TOP2B.

            It has been shown that Topoisomerase II activity is required for
            HIV-1 replication and the enzyme is phosphorylated during early
            time points of HIV-1 replication.

      summary: >-
        ISS annotation based on sequence similarity to UniProtKB:Q14TE9
        (Xenopus TOP2B). The annotation suggests TOP2B is part of an
        RNP complex. TOP2B does have RNA binding capacity through its

      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: >-
        The evidence is indirect (sequence similarity). While TOP2B
        does bind RNA and may associate with RNP complexes, direct
        evidence for human TOP2B as part of a specific RNP complex
        is limited.
