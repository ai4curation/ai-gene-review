## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q02880
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA topoisomerase 2-beta; EC=5.6.2.2 {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10684600}; AltName: Full=DNA topoisomerase II, beta isozyme;
- **Gene Information:** Name=TOP2B;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the type II topoisomerase family. .
- **Key Domains:** DNA_Topoisomerase_II. (IPR050634); DTHCT. (IPR012542); HATPase_C_sf. (IPR036890); Ribosomal_Su5_D2-typ_SF. (IPR020568); Ribsml_uS5_D2-typ_fold_subgr. (IPR014721)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TOP2B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TOP2B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TOP2B** (gene ID: TOP2B, UniProt: Q02880) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# TOP2B (DNA Topoisomerase II Beta) – Function, Roles, and Current Insights

## Overview and Key Concepts  
**TOP2B (DNA topoisomerase IIβ)** is a human enzyme that controls DNA topology by cutting and rejoining DNA strands. It is one of two isoforms of DNA topoisomerase II in humans (the other being TOP2A) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)). Topoisomerase II enzymes transiently cleave both strands of a DNA double helix, pass another segment of double-stranded DNA through this break, then reseal the break ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,cell%20differentiation.%20TOP2B_HUMAN%2CQ02880)). This ATP-dependent “cut-and-pass-through” mechanism relaxes DNA supercoils and resolves DNA entanglements (catenanes) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=link%20between%20TOP2%20and%20the,terminal%20regions%20%28Figure%C2%A01B%29%20and)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=%2A%20Reaction%3DATP,TOP2B_HUMAN%2CQ02880)). TOP2B plays a **“decatenating” role**, enabling chromosome strands to separate and relieving torsional stress in DNA ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,cell%20differentiation.%20TOP2B_HUMAN%2CQ02880)). Human TOP2B is a large, ~1,626-amino-acid protein (~180 kDa) encoded on chromosome 3 (TOP2A is on chromosome 17), and it belongs to the type II topoisomerase family characterized by an N-terminal ATPase domain and a central DNA-cleavage core domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=TOP2B%20structure%20and%20function,mediated%20DNA%20breaks%2C%20chromatin%20remodeling)). The C-terminal region of TOP2B is poorly conserved relative to TOP2A – it is intrinsically disordered and mediates unique protein-protein interactions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=TOP2B%20structure%20and%20function,mediated%20DNA%20breaks%2C%20chromatin%20remodeling)). 

**Catalytic Activity:** TOP2B’s enzymatic activity is classified under EC 5.6.2.2, reflecting **ATP-dependent double-stranded DNA breakage and rejoining** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=%2A%20Reaction%3DATP,TOP2B_HUMAN%2CQ02880)). In practical terms, TOP2B can relax both positive and negative DNA supercoils and untangle interlinked DNA loops ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=link%20between%20TOP2%20and%20the,terminal%20regions%20%28Figure%C2%A01B%29%20and)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,treatment%20of%20human%20cancers%20TOP2B)). During its catalytic cycle, TOP2B binds two DNA duplexes: it introduces a transient double-strand break in one DNA (the “G-segment”) and passes the second duplex (the “T-segment”) through the break before ligating the DNA back together ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,cell%20differentiation.%20TOP2B_HUMAN%2CQ02880)). This reaction consumes ATP and results in a change of DNA linking number by ±2, effectively removing supercoils or catenanes that form during DNA replication and transcription ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=link%20between%20TOP2%20and%20the,terminal%20regions%20%28Figure%C2%A01B%29%20and)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=TOP2B%20structure%20and%20function,mediated%20DNA%20breaks%2C%20chromatin%20remodeling)). Notably, TOP2B forms a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (a TOP2B–DNA cleavage complex) during strand cleavage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=transiently%20cleaving%20both%20strands%20of,encode%20two%20TOP2%20paralogues%2C%20topoisomerases)). Under normal conditions these cleavage complexes are transient, but if they stall or abort they can become permanent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%281%20%29,TOP2B%20activity)). Such abortive TOP2B breaks are dangerous lesions that threaten genome stability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%281%20%29,TOP2B%20activity)). 

**TOP2B vs. TOP2A:** The β isoform (TOP2B) arose from a gene duplication and shares core mechanistic functions with TOP2A, but the two are **non-redundant in vivo** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)). TOP2A is essential for proliferating cells – it is highly expressed in S/G2-phases and is crucial for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=link%20between%20TOP2%20and%20the,terminal%20regions%20%28Figure%C2%A01B%29%20and)). By contrast, TOP2B is expressed ubiquitously (including in non-dividing cells like neurons) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,treatment%20of%20human%20cancers%20TOP2B)) and is dispensable for initial cell proliferation but critical for specialized DNA transactions such as gene transcription and developmental processes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20expression%20of%20nearly,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)). The two isoforms have highly similar ATPase and DNA-cleavage domains, but differ in their C-terminal tails which confer different regulatory interactions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=TOP2B%20structure%20and%20function,mediated%20DNA%20breaks%2C%20chromatin%20remodeling)). For example, TOP2A contains signals for mitotic chromatin targeting and is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, whereas TOP2B’s unique C-terminus allows engagement with transcriptional machinery and chromatin organizing factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=Elongation%20factors%20NELF%20and%20DSIF,resulting%20in%20a%20DNA%20loop)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=TOP2B%20structure%20and%20function,mediated%20DNA%20breaks%2C%20chromatin%20remodeling)). In yeast, either isoform can fulfill the essential topoisomerase II function, but in mammals each has distinct roles that the other cannot fully substitute ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%284%20%E2%80%93%208%29,of%20TOP2B%20in%20the%20immune)). This distinction is evident in knockout models: **Top2a** deletion is lethal early in embryogenesis (due to failure of cell division), whereas **Top2b** knockout mice survive to late gestation but suffer specific developmental defects (notably in neural tissues) and die perinatally ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=Mice%20lacking%20topoisomerase%20IIbeta%20,for%20the%20expression%20of%20developmentally)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=The%20description%20of%20the%20Top2b,of%20transcriptional%20programs%20far%20beyond)). These observations underscore that TOP2B’s primary importance lies in post-replicative DNA processes, especially in gene regulation and differentiation.

## Cellular Localization and Expression  
TOP2B is predominantly a **nuclear enzyme**, functioning in the nucleus where it associates with chromatin. It is broadly expressed across tissues (reflecting its fundamental role in DNA metabolism) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TOP2B#:~:text=,treatment%20of%20human%20cancers%20TOP2B)). In dividing cells both TOP2 isoforms are present, but in quiescent or terminally differentiated cells TOP2B becomes the dominant form as TOP2A levels decline ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=The%20description%20of%20the%20Top2b,of%20transcriptional%20programs%20far%20beyond)). For instance, during neuronal differentiation, TOP2A expression drops while TOP2B remains highly expressed, indicating a switch to reliance on TOP2B in mature neurons ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=The%20description%20of%20the%20Top2b,of%20transcriptional%20programs%20far%20beyond)). Immunolocalization and live-cell imaging studies show TOP2B is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm where transcription occurs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=DNA%20topoisomerase%20II,predictions%2C%20with%20accessible%20chromatin%20and)). A fraction may also localize to nucleoli under certain conditions (e.g. energy depletion or rRNA transcription stress) ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/14/9005/1287871#:~:text=Nuclear%20dynamics%20of%20topoisomerase%20II%CE%B2,immunostaining%20varies%20depending%20on%20cell)), but its primary site of action is the euchromatic regions of the nucleus. Notably, TOP2B tends to occupy open chromatin regions and is often found at genomic sites bound by architectural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=determine%20the%20genome,features%3A%20DNase%20I%20hypersensitivity%2C%20CTCF)). A 2021 machine-learning analysis of TOP2B ChIP-seq data showed that **DNA accessibility and CTCF/cohesin binding were the strongest predictors of TOP2B binding** across the genome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=determine%20the%20genome,features%3A%20DNase%20I%20hypersensitivity%2C%20CTCF)). In fact, **just three features (DNase I hypersensitivity, CTCF, and cohesin)** could explain a large portion of TOP2B’s binding profile ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=determine%20the%20genome,features%3A%20DNase%20I%20hypersensitivity%2C%20CTCF)). This enrichment at CTCF/cohesin sites suggests TOP2B is strategically positioned at chromatin loop anchors and other regulatory elements to relieve supercoiling and torsional stress that accumulate during transcription or chromatin loop extrusion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). Thus, within the nucleus TOP2B dynamically scans and resolves topological problems, especially in active genes and at 3D chromosome domain boundaries.

## Mechanistic Role in DNA Replication and Topology  
Although TOP2A is the workhorse for DNA replication, TOP2B can also contribute to maintaining replication fork stability and resolving entanglements that arise during DNA synthesis. Recent evidence suggests TOP2B helps safeguard replication forks in certain contexts – for example, a 2024 study highlighted that **TOP2B can recognize and cleave tangled DNA at stalled or stressed replication forks**, helping to maintain fork integrity and progression ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925443924000292#:~:text=evidence%20highlights%20the%20essential%20role,allowing%20proper%20progression%20of%20the)). Generally, during late S/G2 phase, type II topoisomerases remove inter-sister catenanes that form when replication forks converge. TOP2B has decatenation activity  ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=link%20between%20TOP2%20and%20the,terminal%20regions%20%28Figure%C2%A01B%29%20and))and can in principle fulfill this role, but in rapidly dividing cells TOP2A largely handles replication decatenation. Importantly, cells possess a “decatenation checkpoint” to ensure catenanes are resolved before mitosis; TOP2A’s C-terminal domain is known to regulate this checkpoint ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28472494/#:~:text=Roles%20of%20the%20C,preserving%20the%20nuclear%20localization%20signal)). TOP2B’s role in routine cell cycle decatenation is limited, but it may substitute if TOP2A is absent or inhibited – for instance, zebrafish embryos lacking Top2a can complete development only if maternal Top2b is present, underscoring some functional overlap ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3287258/#:~:text=Maternal%20topoisomerase%20II%20alpha%2C%20not,1)). In summary, **TOP2B is capable of resolving DNA entanglements and supporting DNA replication topology**, but under normal conditions it plays a secondary role to TOP2A in proliferating cells. Its **essential contribution lies in managing DNA topology outside of replication**, particularly in transcription-coupled scenarios.

## TOP2B in Transcription and Chromatin Organization  
One of the most critical functions of TOP2B is in facilitating gene **transcription** and regulating chromatin architecture. As RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes DNA, it generates positive supercoils ahead of it and negative supercoils behind ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11477040/#:~:text=,growing%20repertoire%20of%20biological%20functions)). If unchecked, this supercoiling can stall transcription. Topoisomerases relieve this tension: TOP1 mainly nicks single strands, whereas TOP2 (including TOP2B) can remove heavier supercoils and knots by its double-strand passage mechanism ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2016.111#:~:text=Topoisomerases%20introduce%20transient%20DNA%20breaks,the%20nuclear%20and%20mitochondrial%20genomes)). **TOP2B has emerged as a key player in releasing paused RNA polymerase II and enabling productive elongation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=Advances%20in%20genomic%20technologies%20have,in%20patients%20with%20TOP2B%20deficiency)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). Recent studies show that for certain inducible genes, Pol II pauses near the promoter after initiation (a checkpoint regulated by factors NELF/DSIF). The release of this pause and transition to elongation correlates with **TOP2B creating a transient double-strand break near the promoter**, which triggers local chromatin remodeling and recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) factors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=Elongation%20factors%20NELF%20and%20DSIF,resulting%20in%20a%20DNA%20loop)). This process involves the ATM kinase: a well-known 2015 study by H. Bunch *et al.* demonstrated that **transcriptional elongation of some stimulus-responsive genes requires TOP2B-mediated DSBs and subsequent ATM signaling** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4984685/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20indicated%20a,breaks%20seemed%20both%20necessary%20and)). Specifically, induction of immediate-early genes (e.g. in neurons upon stimulation, or hormone-responsive genes) was blocked when TOP2B or ATM activity was inhibited ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4984685/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20indicated%20a,breaks%20seemed%20both%20necessary%20and)). In other words, TOP2B’s enzymatic cut not only relieves superhelical stress but also serves as a molecular signal – the resulting break is rapidly recognized by DDR proteins, and this signaling appears to facilitate release of Pol II into productive elongation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=Elongation%20factors%20NELF%20and%20DSIF,resulting%20in%20a%20DNA%20loop)). This concept was summarized by Calderwood (2016) as a “novel role for topoisomerase IIβ in transcription,” where *multiple gene activation events (heat shock, immediate-early, and nuclear receptor target genes) each **require TOP2B-generated DSBs*** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4984685/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20have%20indicated%20a,breaks%20seemed%20both%20necessary%20and)). These TOP2B-induced breaks are normally repaired promptly (so the transcription-linked DNA damage is transient), but they underscore how intimately TOP2B is involved in **transcription regulation via a controlled damage-and-repair mechanism**.

Beyond elongation, **TOP2B contributes to higher-order genome organization**. Chromatin is organized into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) which bring enhancers and promoters together. The loop extrusion model suggests that cohesin complexes spool DNA into loops until they’re stopped by convergent CTCF sites (loop anchors). **Ongoing transcription within loops generates torsional stress at the loop boundaries**, and evidence indicates TOP2B localizes to these loop anchor regions (co-bound with CTCF/cohesin) to relieve accumulated supercoils ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). By cutting and rejoining DNA at loop bases, TOP2B may help “reset” DNA topology, thereby maintaining stable contacts between regulatory elements and preventing persistent stress. In doing so, **TOP2B indirectly influences gene expression by preserving 3D genome architecture** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=Advances%20in%20genomic%20technologies%20have,in%20patients%20with%20TOP2B%20deficiency)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). However, if TOP2B fails to religate or if its cleavage complexes persist at loop anchors, the outcome can be deleterious: collisions of transcription and replication or unresolved supercoils might convert TOP2B nicks into chromosome breakage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). Indeed, chromosomal translocations found in cancers often coincide with fragile sites where transcription-induced supercoiling and TOP2B activity are high ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). For example, one recent study (Lensing *et al.*, 2016) showed TOP2B binding sites in the genome are associated with recurrent DNA breakpoints and mutations in cancer, highlighting TOP2B as both a *“safeguard of genome integrity”* and a contributor to mutagenic processes when misregulated ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65005-6#:~:text=driver%20mutations%20in%20cancer%20genomes,a%20marker%20of%20mutational%20processes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=genome,used)). In summary, TOP2B is crucial for **maintaining transcriptional flow and genome organization**, acting at the nexus of DNA topology and gene regulation. Its activity ensures genes can be turned on/off efficiently by preventing topological bottlenecks, but the same activity must be tightly controlled to avoid DNA damage.

## Developmental and Cell-Type Specific Roles  

### Neuronal Development and Gene Expression  
The importance of TOP2B in development was first apparent from mouse knockout studies. **Top2b-null mice die at birth with severe neural defects**, notably failure of proper axon guidance and elongation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=The%20description%20of%20the%20Top2b,of%20transcriptional%20programs%20far%20beyond)). These mice cannot suckle and exhibit paralysis, indicating that TOP2B is indispensable for nervous system function (despite not being required for earlier embryonic cell divisions) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=The%20description%20of%20the%20Top2b,of%20transcriptional%20programs%20far%20beyond)). Transcriptomic analyses of Top2b⁻/⁻ embryos revealed that relatively few genes change globally; however, a disproportionately large subset of **developmentally regulated neuronal genes (≈30%) were mis-regulated** in the absence of TOP2B ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=a%20small%20number%20,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)). Many genes normally activated during later stages of neuronal differentiation failed to be properly induced (or repressed) without TOP2B, even though general housekeeping genes and early differentiation markers remained largely normal ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=a%20small%20number%20,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)). This suggests **TOP2B specifically enables the expression of genes required in late neuronal maturation** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=affected%2C%20suggesting%20that%20TopIIbeta%20is,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)). For example, one study found TOP2B is required for the timely expression of a brain potassium channel gene (Kcnd2) during neuronal differentiation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=affected%2C%20suggesting%20that%20TopIIbeta%20is,sensitive%20gene%2C%20Kcnd2%2C%20revealed%20the)). Mechanistically, TOP2B likely facilitates the large-scale transcriptional programs in neurons by resolving supercoils in long gene bodies and promoting chromatin changes at key gene promoters. Consistent with this, TOP2B protein is highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons and colocalizes with markers of active chromatin ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=affected%2C%20suggesting%20that%20TopIIbeta%20is,sensitive%20gene%2C%20Kcnd2%2C%20revealed%20the)). It also interacts with chromatin regulators like HDAC2 in neurons ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=affected%2C%20suggesting%20that%20TopIIbeta%20is,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)), potentially linking TOP2B’s activity to chromatin remodeling. A 2023 analysis by King *et al.* found that **Top2b-knockout neurons have dysregulation of genes controlling neurite outgrowth and survival, leading to premature neuronal death** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22474351/#:~:text=Target%20genes%20of%20Topoisomerase%20II%CE%B2,The%20y%20axis%20represents%20log2)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=genes%20,study%2C%20transcription%20profiles%20of%20the)). One such gene affected is the neurotrophin receptor *Ngfr* (p75^NTR), whose aberrant upregulation in Top2b⁻/⁻ neurons contributes to apoptosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22474351/#:~:text=defined%20by%20their%20chromatin%20state,%28B%29%20PCR%20validation)). These findings illustrate that TOP2B is tightly integrated into the gene networks that drive neuronal maturation and connectivity. By enabling the proper transcriptional activation of late-differentiation genes and repressing others, **TOP2B helps choreograph complex developmental programs in the brain** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=a%20small%20number%20,interacting%20protein%2C%20were)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16923961/#:~:text=Role%20of%20topoisomerase%20IIbeta%20in,study%2C%20transcription%20profiles%20of%20the)). The perinatal lethality of Top2b deficiency underscores that its role in the nervous system is indispensable.

### B-Cell Development and Immunity  
Another striking cell-type specific role for TOP2B has come to light in the immune system. In 2019, rare **heterozygous mutations in human TOP2B were found to cause an immunodeficiency characterized by an absence of B cells** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Sequencing%20of%20patients%20with%20B,function%20in%20response%20to%20immunization)). Affected patients from multiple families had near-complete loss of circulating CD19⁺ B cells (with counts essentially **0, compared to hundreds per µL in healthy individuals**) and severe hypogammaglobulinemia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=severe%20hypogammaglobulinemia%2C%20and%20absent%20CD19%2B,11)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Affected%20patients%20have%20a%20normal,but%20may%20not%20be%20entirely)). Notably, T cell numbers and function were normal, pointing to a B lineage–specific requirement for TOP2B ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=severe%20hypogammaglobulinemia%2C%20and%20absent%20CD19%2B,11)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Affected%20patients%20have%20a%20normal,but%20may%20not%20be%20entirely)). This disorder, now termed **“TOP2B deficiency syndrome,”** revealed that human B-cell development is uniquely dependent on TOP2B’s DNA topology-modulating activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=and%20contribute%20to%20DNA%20loops,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). Follow-up studies in mice (using B cell–specific Top2b knockouts) confirmed a developmental block: bone marrow B progenitors failed to progress normally through early stages (Pre-Pro B to immature B), and peripheral B cells were greatly reduced ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Top2b%5E%7B%E2%88%92%2F%E2%88%92%7Dmb1,cre)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=mb1,CD19)). The few B cells that did form were functionally impaired – they proliferated poorly in response to stimuli and produced little antibody upon antigen challenge ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=B%20cells%20fail%20to%20activate,in%20the%20absence%20of%20Top2b)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis%20test%29,Total%20number%20of%20CFSE%20positive)). These phenotypes mirror the human immunodeficiency. At the molecular level, **TOP2B loss in B progenitors led to reduced expression of key differentiation genes**. For example, the transcription factor *Pax5* (master regulator of B-cell commitment) was significantly downregulated in Top2b-deficient B cells, even though early lymphocyte genes like *Rag1* remained unchanged ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=spleen%20and%20bone%20marrow%20%28Fig,Furthermore%2C%20expression%20of%20Pax5%2C%20a)). This suggests TOP2B is necessary to properly activate certain large or topologically challenging gene loci during B-cell maturation – likely including the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and factors like *Pax5*. The immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene is one of the largest in the genome and undergoes rapid transcription in developing B cells; TOP2B may relieve the extreme supercoiling generated during IgH transcription or V(D)J recombination. Additionally, TOP2B could be important for long-range chromatin loops at the IgH locus that bring distant gene segments together. **Patients with TOP2B mutations show B cells “stuck” in development, highlighting that DNA topology must be correctly managed for B-cell differentiation to proceed** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692411/#:~:text=Sequencing%20of%20patients%20with%20B,function%20in%20response%20to%20immunization)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=and%20contribute%20to%20DNA%20loops,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). As one review noted, this finding *“highlights the fundamental and unique dependency of B-cell progenitor differentiation on TOP2B-mediated DNA topological changes.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=and%20contribute%20to%20DNA%20loops,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). In summary, TOP2B is as critical to the immune system’s development as it is to the nervous system’s, reinforcing that its enzymatic action is not just globally important but also acutely required at specific genomic junctures in different cell lineages.

It is worth mentioning that other emerging links between TOP2B and human disease are being explored. For instance, certain **hereditary hearing loss** cases have been associated with dominant TOP2B mutations, posited to affect hair cell survival via altered PI3K–Akt signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151872/#:~:text=Reduction%20of%20DNA%20Topoisomerase%20Top2,via%20Inhibition%20of%20the%20PI3K%E2%80%90Akt)). This suggests TOP2B’s role in gene regulation might extend to inner ear cells as well. Moreover, chronic neurodegenerative conditions like ataxia-telangiectasia (caused by ATM deficiency) show neuron loss that may be partly due to un-repaired TOP2B-induced breaks ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19557000/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20page%20content,mediator%20for%20the%20DNA%20damage)). These examples, while still under research, further illustrate how **TOP2B’s activity intersects with critical cellular pathways and, when disturbed, can lead to tissue-specific pathologies**.

## Therapeutic and Real-World Implications  
TOP2B’s pivotal role in managing DNA topology has made it a **target (and unintended victim) of several drugs**. Topoisomerase II enzymes are famously targeted by anti-cancer chemotherapeutics: drugs like **doxorubicin** (an anthracycline) and **etoposide** stabilize the Topo II cleavage complex on DNA, preventing re-ligation and thus causing lethal DNA breaks in rapidly dividing cancer cells ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65005-6#:~:text=Type,for%20driver%20mutations%20and%20mutational)). These “Topo II poisons” do not discriminate between TOP2A and TOP2B, and their efficacy comes from inducing DNA damage, especially in proliferating cells where TOP2A is abundant ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65005-6#:~:text=Type,for%20driver%20mutations%20and%20mutational)). However, **TOP2B in non-dividing cells can also be trapped by these drugs, leading to side effects**. A prime example is **anthracycline cardiotoxicity**: Doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy, can cause cumulative heart damage. Research in 2011–2012 uncovered that doxorubicin’s cardiac toxicity is largely mediated by TOP2B in cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells, which are largely non-dividing). Doxorubicin-TOP2B complexes induce DNA breaks in cardiomyocytes, activating cell death pathways in the heart. Mice lacking Top2b in the heart are protected from doxorubicin injury, confirming TOP2B as the culprit for this side effect ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3792022/#:~:text=Catalytic%20Inhibitors%20of%20Topoisomerase%20II,1%7D%2C%20Hana)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116135/#:~:text=cardiotoxicity.%20Dexrazoxane%20%28ICRF,Its%20activity%20has%20traditionally%20been)). This discovery directly led to changes in clinical practice: **Dexrazoxane**, a drug that **inhibits TOP2B catalytic activity**, is now used to protect the heart during anthracycline therapy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116135/#:~:text=,Its%20activity%20has%20traditionally%20been)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773441/#:~:text=The%20Role%20of%20Topoisomerase%20II%CE%B2,catalytic%20inhibitor%20of%20topoisomerase%20II)). Dexrazoxane (approved as a cardioprotective agent) works by intercalating into Topo II’s ATPase sites and promoting degradation of TOP2B in cardiac cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773441/#:~:text=concentration%20of%20dexrazoxane%20occurred%20slowly%2C,levels%20were%20at%20their%20lowest)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773441/#:~:text=occurring%20after%2024%20h,levels%20were%20at%20their%20lowest)). As a result, doxorubicin causes far fewer DNA breaks in the heart. Studies show dexrazoxane dramatically lowers TOP2B levels in cardiomyocytes within hours, and heart cells suffer less damage when TOP2B is at its lowest ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773441/#:~:text=concentration%20of%20dexrazoxane%20occurred%20slowly%2C,levels%20were%20at%20their%20lowest)). This is a compelling real-world illustration of TOP2B biology: *inhibiting Topo IIβ in a specific tissue (heart) can prevent lethal DNA damage without undermining the anti-cancer efficacy of a drug mostly directed at dividing cells (Topo IIα in tumors)* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116135/#:~:text=,Its%20activity%20has%20traditionally%20been)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773441/#:~:text=The%20Role%20of%20Topoisomerase%20II%CE%B2,catalytic%20inhibitor%20of%20topoisomerase%20II)). 

Another medical context involving TOP2B is **secondary malignancies**. Chemotherapy agents like etoposide and doxorubicin, while effective against primary tumors, are known to increase the risk of therapy-related leukemias. These leukemias often feature specific chromosomal translocations (for example, involving the MLL gene on 11q23) that bear signatures of Topo II-mediated DNA breaks. TOP2B in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells can be trapped by these drugs, causing chromosomal breaks that misrepair into translocations ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). Thus, TOP2B is implicated in the origin of some secondary cancers after chemotherapy. Modern research aims to mitigate these risks by developing **isoform-specific Topo II inhibitors**. For instance, scientists are searching for compounds that selectively inhibit TOP2A (to kill cancer cells) or TOP2B (to protect certain tissues). A recent development reported in 2025 is a molecule dubbed **“Topobexin”**, which targets the ATPase domain of Topo II and shows **selective inhibition of TOP2B** over TOP2A ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40425539/#:~:text=Topobexin%20targets%20the%20Topoisomerase%20II,cancer%20effects)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116762/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Nat,and%20License%20information%20PMCID%3A%20PMC12116762)). In preclinical models, Topobexin was able to protect cardiac cells from anthracycline toxicity (similar to dexrazoxane) while sparing Topo IIα activity in cancer cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116762/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Nat,and%20License%20information%20PMCID%3A%20PMC12116762)). This strategy of isoform-selective modulation could improve chemotherapy outcomes by reducing side effects. Though Topobexin is not yet in clinical use (and as of 2025 was in research stages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116762/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Nat,and%20License%20information%20PMCID%3A%20PMC12116762))), it exemplifies how detailed knowledge of TOP2B structure and function is driving drug design.

Beyond cancer, there is growing interest in **TOP2B as a therapeutic target in age-related diseases**. Post-mitotic cells (like neurons and cardiomyocytes) accumulate DNA damage over time, and one hypothesis is that ongoing TOP2B activity contributes to this by inflicting low-level DNA breaks during transcription. A 2024 review in *BBA Molecular Basis of Disease* even suggested **“targeting TOP2B as a vulnerability in aging”**, noting that reducing Topo IIβ activity might diminish transcription-associated DNA damage and genomic instability in aging tissues ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925443924000292#:~:text=Targeting%20TOP2B%20as%20a%20vulnerability,related%20diseases)). In model organisms like *C. elegans*, partial knockdown of topoisomerase II was reported to extend lifespan, hinting that a lower TOP2B activity could be beneficial in certain contexts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151872/#:~:text=Reduction%20of%20DNA%20Topoisomerase%20Top2,via%20Inhibition%20of%20the%20PI3K%E2%80%90Akt)). These findings are still preliminary, but they raise an intriguing point: while TOP2B is essential for normal physiology, *excessive or unrestrained TOP2B activity might contribute to genomic wear-and-tear over a lifetime*. It’s a delicate balance – too little TOP2B causes developmental failure (as seen in B cells and neurons), yet too much or persistent TOP2B action could underlie some degenerative changes. Future therapies might seek to **fine-tune TOP2B activity**: enhancing it where DNA topology problems cause disease, or dampening it where its activity exacerbates damage.

## Expert Commentary and Current Research Directions  
TOP2B sits at an intersection of DNA mechanics and gene regulation, and experts highlight its dual nature. On one hand, it is a “**safeguard of genome integrity**” ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65005-6#:~:text=driver%20mutations%20in%20cancer%20genomes,a%20marker%20of%20mutational%20processes)) – by resolving DNA tangles and supercoils, it prevents catastrophic chromosomal failures. On the other hand, its mechanism (cutting DNA) inherently risks genomic lesions if not properly controlled ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). Jerry Nitiss, a leading topoisomerase researcher, noted that topoisomerases are *“delicate enzymes”* because *“their catalytic intermediates [cleavage complexes] are also potent DNA lesions”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11477040/#:~:text=Genome%20Instability%20Induced%20by%20Topoisomerase,growing%20repertoire%20of%20biological%20functions)). This is poignantly true for TOP2B: it is required for normal transcription of many genes, yet the very breaks it creates can lead to mutations or chromosome translocations if misrepaired ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). Recent high-profile studies underscore this fine line. For example, Canela *et al.* (2019) showed that TOP2B-induced DSBs in neural cells can accumulate when DNA damage response is impaired, possibly linking to neurodegeneration in ATM-deficient models ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19557000/#:~:text=Ataxia%20telangiectasia%20mutated%20activation%20by,mediator%20for%20the%20DNA%20damage)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7021672/#:~:text=%28T,malignancies%20are%20frequently%20linked%20to)). Papapietro and Nejentsev (2022) emphasized in a review that *“in recent years, TOP2B emerged as one of the key proteins connecting transcription and 3D genome organization”*, but also that *“unresolved TOP2B activity at loop anchors can cause DNA translocations often seen in cancer”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=key%20proteins%20connecting%20transcription%20and,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=%282%20%29,bottom)). Their work on B cells brings a new appreciation for TOP2B’s specificity – as they put it, the discovery of B-cell developmental defects in TOP2B-deficient patients *“highlights the fundamental and unique dependency”* of certain cell lineages on DNA topology regulation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423374/#:~:text=and%20contribute%20to%20DNA%20loops,mediated%20DNA%20topological%20changes)). In practical terms, this means genome topology isn’t just a background housekeeping task; it’s an active, regulated component of cell fate decisions.

Structurally, ongoing research is shedding light on how TOP2B works at the atomic level. Cryo-EM and crystallography studies in the last few years have resolved parts of human TOP2B in complex with DNA and inhibitors ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60167-9#:~:text=selective%20inhibition%20and%20anthracycline%20cardioprotection,redundant%20cellular%20functions.%20Anthracyclines%20induce)). These structures reveal how TOP2B’s ATPase domains dimerize upon ATP binding, how the DNA gate opens/closes, and how the C-terminal region might interact with other proteins. Such insights are guiding the design of **isoform-specific drugs** and improved TOP2B inhibitors that avoid trapping the cleavage complex (to act as catalytic inhibitors rather than poisons) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3792022/#:~:text=Catalytic%20Inhibitors%20of%20Topoisomerase%20II,1%7D%2C%20Hana)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24116135/#:~:text=Catalytic%20inhibitors%20of%20topoisomerase%20II,Its%20activity%20has%20traditionally%20been)). For instance, structural differences in the C-terminal domain are being explored as a route to selectively target TOP2B versus TOP2A ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116762/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Nat,and%20License%20information%20PMCID%3A%20PMC12116762)). 

Another active research area is mapping TOP2B’s genome-wide binding and its relationship to epigenetic features. High-resolution ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag profiles of TOP2B have been integrated with maps of R-loops, G-quadruplexes, and enhancer-promoter contacts to see where TOP2B is most needed ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925443924000292#:~:text=Targeting%20TOP2B%20as%20a%20vulnerability,related%20diseases)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=DNA%20topoisomerase%20II,predictions%2C%20with%20accessible%20chromatin%20and)). One finding is that TOP2B often colocalizes with sites of active transcription and overlaps with RNAP II and BRD4 peaks, especially on long genes, suggesting a role in preventing R-loop accumulation and transcription-associated recombination. Additionally, cancer genome sequencing projects have identified mutation clusters near TOP2B binding motifs in certain non-coding regions, implying TOP2B may inadvertently contribute to localized mutational processes (by cleavage at specific hotspots) ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65005-6#:~:text=driver%20mutations%20in%20cancer%20genomes,a%20marker%20of%20mutational%20processes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7845959/#:~:text=genome,used)). 

In summary, current expert consensus portrays TOP2B as a **crucial DNA enzyme with specialized roles in gene regulation**. It acts as a molecular “untangler” that not only prevents topological problems but also actively participates in gene control by coupling with transcription and chromatin factors. *“Topoisomerases introduce transient DNA breaks to relax supercoiled DNA, remove catenanes and enable chromosome segregation,”* wrote Pommier *et al.* (2016) in *Nature Reviews* ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2016.111#:~:text=Topoisomerases%20introduce%20transient%20DNA%20breaks,the%20nuclear%20and%20mitochondrial%20genomes)) – and TOP2B exemplifies this, with the added twist that it is harnessed for developmental gene expression. As our understanding deepens (through 2023 and 2024 studies on immune cells, aging, and genome architecture), TOP2B stands out not just as a maintenance enzyme but as a dynamic regulator at the heart of nuclear function. Its activity is a double-edged sword: essential for normal physiology, yet a source of genomic fragility when misregulated. This duality makes TOP2B a fascinating subject of ongoing research, with implications ranging from fundamental biology to targeted therapies.
