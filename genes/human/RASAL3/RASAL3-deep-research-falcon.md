## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q86YV0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=RAS protein activator like-3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=RASAL3;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C2_dom. (IPR000008); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); Ras_GTPase. (IPR039360); RasGAP_CS. (IPR023152); RasGAP_dom. (IPR001936)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RASAL3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RASAL3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RASAL3** (gene ID: RASAL3, UniProt: Q86YV0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verified identity and domains: RASAL3 (UniProt Q86YV0), human, RasGAP-like protein with PH, C2, and RasGAP domains; aligned with literature.
- Collected and synthesized recent primary evidence (2024–2015) on function, pathways, cell types, and phenotypes.
- Summarized biochemical activity and substrate specificity; cellular localization and context; signaling roles; genetic/functional perturbation phenotypes; disease links and translational implications; and 2023–2024 developments.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human RASAL3 (UniProt Q86YV0)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and domains: RASAL3 (RAS protein activator like-3) is a Ras-superfamily GTPase-activating protein (GAP) with an N‑terminal PH domain, a C2 domain, and a central RasGAP domain. This architecture matches the UniProt domain annotations and is consistent with experimental reports classifying RASAL3 within SynGAP-like RasGAPs predominantly expressed in hematopoietic lineages (human and mouse orthologs studied) (molecular domain descriptions and lineage expression summarized in Muro 2015; domain boundaries and annotations in human transcripts described in a clinical genetics report) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, iezziUnknownyearimplicationsofrasal3 pages 9-11).
- Biochemical function: RASAL3 accelerates GTP hydrolysis on small GTPases. In T cells, Rasal3 acts as a RasGAP to dampen Ras‑ERK signaling following TCR stimulation; it does not exhibit Rap1GAP activity in those assays (Muro 2015) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2). In vitro GAP assays using human RASAL3 GAP domain found preferential stimulation of GTP hydrolysis on Rac2 (a hematopoietic Rho family GTPase), indicating substrate breadth beyond Ras and suggesting pathway crosstalk into Rac2–AKT signaling (Shin 2018) (shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3).
- Cellular context and complexes: In dendritic cells (DCs), RASAL3 physically and functionally associates with the scaffold CCDC88B and the Rho/Rac GEF ARHGEF2, forming a complex that modulates RHOA activation and cell migration (Olivier 2024, Communications Biology, Jan 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05751-9) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- DC migration and neuroinflammation/colitis models: A 2024 study identified CCDC88B–RASAL3–ARHGEF2 interactions and showed that loss of Rasal3 alters disease phenotypes in murine neuroinflammation (EAE protection) and colitis susceptibility. Mechanistically, the complex tunes DC migration via RHOA activity, with RASAL3 acting in an opposing fashion to ARHGEF2 (Olivier 2024; Jan 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Integrative immunology context: Earlier multi-omics work from the same group leading up to 2024 situated RASAL3 in pathways controlling leukocyte mobility and inflammatory responses across myeloid and lymphoid compartments, linking Ras/ERK and Rac-family nodes; this provided the rationale for the 2024 focused mechanistic work (Olivier 2022) (olivier2022uncoveringnewimmunologicala pages 128-133).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Immuno-inflammatory modulation: Mouse data indicate that RASAL3 restrains excessive neutrophil activation during sepsis, suggesting a potential target for limiting hyperinflammation. Rasal3 knockout enhanced mortality in LPS-induced septic shock and increased neutrophil effector responses, positioning RASAL3 as a negative regulator of neutrophil-driven pathology (Saito 2021, Frontiers in Immunology, Oct 2021, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.744300) (saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3).
- Adaptive immunity homeostasis: In vivo maintenance of naive T cell pools requires Rasal3; loss reduces peripheral naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by increasing apoptosis, highlighting a role in tonic signaling and homeostatic survival relevant to immune reconstitution and tolerance (Muro 2015, PLoS ONE, Mar 2015, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119898) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 2-4, muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2).
- DC migration and disease modulation: The 2024 work implies that manipulating the CCDC88B–RASAL3–ARHGEF2 axis could modulate DC trafficking and antigen presentation, with implications for neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation interventions (Olivier 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2024 Communications Biology study provides peer‑reviewed mechanistic evidence positioning RASAL3 in a defined protein complex that controls DC migration via RHOA. The authors interpret opposing actions of ARHGEF2 (activator) and RASAL3 (inhibitory context) within the complex to explain differential DC motility and disease outcomes in mice (Olivier 2024; Jan 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Foundational T cell work by Muro et al. proposes Rasal3 as a selective RasGAP in T cells that limits TCR‑driven ERK signaling, thereby supporting naive T cell survival; this interpretation remains widely cited in immunology for RasGAP functional diversity in T cells (Muro 2015) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2).
- Biochemical expansion to Rac2 by Shin et al. suggests RASAL3’s GAP activity can impact Rho‑family GTPase signaling in hematopoietic cells, an interpretation that is congruent with the DC migration findings involving RHOA pathway modulation (Shin 2018) (shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- DC/Inflammation (2024): The Communications Biology paper reports generation and validation of Arhgef2 and Rasal3 mutants, and demonstrates differential DC migration phenotypes in vitro; Rasal3 mutants show enhanced DC migration, aligning with reduced neuroinflammation in EAE and altered DSS‑colitis susceptibility in vivo (details and figures in paper; Jan 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Neutrophil inflammation (2021): In LPS (5 mg/kg) models, Rasal3 knockout mice exhibited significantly increased mortality through hyperinflammation and organ damage; RASAL3 was upregulated by exogenous neutrophil stimuli and functioned to limit NETosis and inflammatory outputs (Frontiers in Immunology, Oct 2021) (saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3).
- T cell survival (2015): Rasal3-deficient mice had significantly reduced numbers of peripheral naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells due to increased apoptosis; TCR‑ERK phosphorylation was repressed by Rasal3 in cell lines, and RasGAP activity (but not Rap1GAP) confirmed with pulldown assays (PLoS ONE, Mar 2015) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 2-4, muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2).
- Biochemical specificity (2018): In vitro GAP assays showed human RASAL3 GAP domain preferentially accelerates Rac2 GTP hydrolysis compared to other Rho/Ras family members tested (Biomedical Reports, Jul 2018) (shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3).

Focused mechanistic narrative
- Biochemical activity and substrate specificity: RASAL3 is a GAP that inactivates Ras in T cells (no Rap1GAP activity detected in those assays) and can directly stimulate GTP hydrolysis on Rac2 in vitro, indicating dual potential targets within Ras and Rho subfamilies relevant to hematopoietic signaling (Muro 2015; Shin 2018) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3).
- Signaling roles and pathways: In T cells, Rasal3 dampens TCR‑induced Ras→Raf→MEK→ERK signaling, supporting naive T cell survival. In myeloid cells, RASAL3 modulates inflammatory outputs; in DCs, it participates in a CCDC88B–RASAL3–ARHGEF2 complex that tunes RHOA activity and migration, placing RASAL3 at the intersection of Ras‑ERK and Rho‑GTPase circuits (Muro 2015; Saito 2021; Olivier 2024) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3, olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Interacting partners and complexes: CCDC88B (scaffold) and ARHGEF2 (Rho/Rac GEF) physically and functionally interact with RASAL3 in DCs, with opposing regulatory effects on migration via RHOA modulation (Olivier 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

Expression pattern and localization
- Hematopoietic bias: RASAL3 is predominantly expressed in T‑lineage cells and other hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils; neutrophil expression increases with exogenous inflammatory stimuli (Muro 2015; Saito 2021) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3).
- Subcellular behavior: Consistent with PH/C2 domains, RASAL3 is suited for membrane-proximal signaling; in DCs it colocalizes within complexes (confocal IF) with CCDC88B/ARHGEF2 that regulate migration, implying function at or near signaling membranes controlling RHOA activity (Olivier 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

Loss-/gain-of-function phenotypes in cells and mice
- T cells: Rasal3 knockout mice retain normal thymic selection but lose peripheral naive T cells due to impaired in vivo survival; Rasal3 represses TCR‑induced ERK phosphorylation (Muro 2015) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 2-4, muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2).
- NKT cells: Prior work reported reduced NKT cell numbers and cytokine production with Rasal3 perturbation, implicating Rasal3 in NKT-mediated responses (European Journal of Immunology; 2015; DOI cited in the literature synthesis) (olivier2022uncoveringnewimmunologicala pages 128-133).
- Neutrophils: Rasal3 deficiency enhances neutrophil activation and increases sepsis mortality; RASAL3 expression is induced by inflammatory stimuli (Saito 2021) (saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3).
- Dendritic cells: Rasal3 mutant DCs show enhanced migration/motility; loss of Rasal3 dampens neuroinflammation and alters colitis susceptibility in vivo (Olivier 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

Disease associations and translational implications
- Autoimmunity: A clinical genetics report describes deleterious RASAL3 variants identified by whole‑exome sequencing in pediatric autoimmune cohorts (e.g., Evans syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis), suggesting a role in immune tolerance; while details require further validation, the association flags RASAL3 for diagnostic consideration in immune dysregulation (report with gene mapping and domain annotation) (iezziUnknownyearimplicationsofrasal3a pages 9-11, iezziUnknownyearimplicationsofrasal3 pages 9-11).
- Infection and sepsis: RASAL3 restrains neutrophil hyperinflammation; deficiency exacerbates endotoxin shock mortality, nominating RASAL3 signaling as a potential therapeutic axis to mitigate harmful innate immune overactivation (Saito 2021) (saito2021rasal3isa pages 2-3).
- Neuroinflammation and colitis: The DC migration role of RASAL3 impacts disease severity in EAE and DSS models, positioning the CCDC88B–RASAL3–ARHGEF2 hub as a candidate for modulating antigen-presenting cell trafficking and tissue inflammation (Olivier 2024) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Epigenetic regulation: Prior reviews have suggested RASGAP genes, including RASAL3, can be transcriptionally or epigenetically controlled in cancer and immune contexts; while specific RASAL3 methylation data were not directly quantified in the curated sources here, its immune-restricted expression and inducibility imply context-dependent regulation that warrants targeted epigenomic profiling (synthesis from collected context) (olivier2022uncoveringnewimmunologicala pages 128-133).

2023–2024 highlights
- Definitive complex and mechanism in DCs (CCDC88B–RASAL3–ARHGEF2) with RHOA modulation and migration control; disease phenotypes in EAE/colitis models (Communications Biology, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05751-9) (olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Expanded systems context for RASAL3 across myeloid/lymphoid inflammation (Olivier 2022 integrative work leading to 2024 study) (olivier2022uncoveringnewimmunologicala pages 128-133).

Verification of target identity and domain alignment
- The research cited here consistently examines RASAL3 as “RAS protein activator like‑3,” human and mouse orthologs, with PH, C2 and RasGAP domains, matching UniProt Q86YV0 annotations. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found; all studies align with hematopoietic/immune contexts and Ras/Rho GTPase regulation (Muro 2015; Shin 2018; Olivier 2024) (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3, olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).

Limitations and open questions
- Direct structural determinations for human RASAL3 domains and in‑cell substrate specificities remain limited; while T cell assays support RasGAP activity and in vitro assays show Rac2 preference, in vivo substrate engagement likely depends on cell type, membrane localization, and interacting partners (muro2015therasgtpaseactivating pages 1-2, shin2018rasal3preferentiallystimulates pages 2-3, olivier2024ccdc88binteractswith pages 1-2).
- Human genetic evidence for autoimmunity association requires larger cohorts and functional validation of specific variants (iezziUnknownyearimplicationsofrasal3a pages 9-11, iezziUnknownyearimplicationsofrasal3 pages 9-11).
