description: RASAL3 (RAS protein activator like-3) is a hematopoietic-specific GTPase-activating
  protein (GAP) that negatively regulates Ras family small GTPases by accelerating
  GTP hydrolysis, converting active RAS-GTP to inactive RAS-GDP. The protein contains
  a canonical GAP1 family architecture with an N-terminal PH domain, a C2 domain,
  and a central RasGAP catalytic domain. RASAL3 is predominantly expressed in cells
  of hematopoietic lineages including T cells, B cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, and
  dendritic cells. Functional studies demonstrate that RASAL3 regulates NKT cell
  number and function by negatively controlling Ras-ERK signaling - loss of RASAL3
  causes decreased NKT cell numbers in liver and reduced cytokine production upon
  alpha-GalCer stimulation, accompanied by enhanced ERK phosphorylation indicative
  of dysregulated Ras signaling. RASAL3 also supports naive T cell survival and
  restrains neutrophil hyperactivation during inflammatory responses. In dendritic
  cells, RASAL3 participates in a complex with CCDC88B and ARHGEF2 that modulates
  RHOA activity and controls cell migration. In vitro biochemical assays indicate
  RASAL3 displays GAP activity toward Ras in T cells (but not Rap1GAP activity) and
  also preferentially stimulates GTP hydrolysis on Rac2, suggesting broader substrate
  specificity within hematopoietic signaling contexts.

    label: GTPase activator activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: GTPase activator activity is the core molecular function of RASAL3, consistent
      with its RasGAP domain architecture and experimental validation of GAP activity
      toward Ras and Rac2 substrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures the primary enzymatic function of
      RASAL3. The protein contains a RasGAP catalytic domain (residues 474-682) and
      has been demonstrated to accelerate GTP hydrolysis on Ras in T cell assays
      [PMID:25652366] and on Rac2 in vitro [Shin 2018, Biomedical Reports]. The IBA
      evidence is well-supported by phylogenetic conservation across the RasGAP family.

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:25652366
  review:
    summary: The annotation indicates RASAL3 positively regulates NKT cell proliferation,
      but this appears to be inverted - RASAL3 knockout DECREASES NKT cell numbers.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation may represent a curator error or misinterpretation. The
      PMID:25652366 study shows that RASAL3-deficient mice have DECREASED NKT cells
      (severe decrease in NKT cells in liver). Therefore RASAL3 is required for normal
      NKT cell maintenance, meaning loss of RASAL3 reduces NKT cell numbers. The
      correct interpretation is that RASAL3 positively regulates NKT cell homeostasis
      or maintenance, but the mechanism is through restraining Ras-ERK signaling
      to appropriate levels. An alternative term might be 'regulation of NK T cell
      homeostasis' if available, or this annotation should be reconsidered. However,
      if the curator intended that RASAL3 acts as a positive regulator by keeping
      Ras signaling in check (preventing exhaustion or death), then the annotation
      could stand but needs clarification.
