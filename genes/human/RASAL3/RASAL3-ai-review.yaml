  label: Homo sapiens
description: RAS protein activator like 3, GTPase-activating protein for RAS family
  small GTPases. Member of RasGAP family that catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on RAS, converting
  active RAS-GTP to inactive RAS-GDP, thereby negatively regulating RAS-MAPK signaling
  pathways. Contains RasGAP catalytic domain. Cytoplasmic and cytoplasmic side of
  membrane localization. Hematopoietic expression with specific importance in NKT
  (natural killer T) cell regulation. RASAL3 regulates NKT cell number and function
  by controlling Ras activity - loss of RASAL3 leads to increased NKT cell proliferation
  due to elevated Ras signaling. Functions in immune regulation, particularly in innate-like
  T cell compartments. Negative regulator of Ras-dependent proliferation and activation
  in immune cells. May also localize to cell cortex for regulation of membrane-proximal
  Ras signaling.
