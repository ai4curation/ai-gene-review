## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P35443
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Thrombospondin-4; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=THBS4; Synonyms=TSP4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thrombospondin family. .
- **Key Domains:** ConA-like_dom_sf. (IPR013320); EGF-like_Ca-bd_dom. (IPR001881); EGF-like_dom. (IPR000742); EGF_Ca-bd_CS. (IPR018097); Thrombospondin_3-like_rpt. (IPR003367)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "THBS4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'THBS4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **THBS4** (gene ID: THBS4, UniProt: P35443) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: THBS4 (Thrombospondin‑4; UniProt P35443) in human
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: THBS4 encodes thrombospondin‑4 (TSP‑4), a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) matricellular glycoprotein belonging to the thrombospondin family. TSP‑4 is oligomeric and displays conserved Ca2+‑binding EGF‑like modules and C‑terminal thrombospondin type 3 repeats that mediate ECM interactions. Literature on human TSP‑4 aligns with UniProt domain architecture and subgroup B thrombospondins (which lack TSRs), consistent with the identity P35443 and the human gene symbol THBS4. Review articles place TSP‑4 in heart, skeletal muscle, cartilage and neuromuscular junctions, emphasizing ECM organization and mechanosensitive roles. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40 (Eba et al.); Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343 (Aihaiti et al.). (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 3-4, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5, aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)
- Localization: TSP‑4 is secreted to the extracellular space and incorporated into the ECM, where it binds collagenous and non‑collagenous components and interfaces with cell‑surface receptors to modulate adhesion, migration, and signaling. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5)
- Primary functional themes: TSP‑4 regulates ECM organization, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling/repair, mechanotransduction in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, and synaptogenesis/neuronal plasticity. In contrast to TSP‑1/2, TSP‑4 can act pro‑angiogenically in some contexts. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)

2) Molecular interactions and pathways
- Integrins: THBS4 engages integrins to influence endothelial and smooth muscle cell behaviors; recent PAH‑CHD work highlights integrin α2‑dependent pro‑angiogenic signaling, with downstream PI3K/AKT activation implicated in phenotypic modulation (proliferation, migration, apoptosis resistance) of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17)
- CD47/eNOS axis: Family‑level evidence locates a CD47‑binding site in the C‑terminal domain of thrombospondins; this interaction can inhibit eNOS activation and angiogenesis, an axis likely relevant to THBS family members including THBS4 in vascular contexts. Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343. (aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)
- ECM mechanobiology: TSP‑4 participates in mechanotransduction, linking mechanical load to biochemical signaling and ECM remodeling in heart and vasculature. Reported functions include regulation of myocardial fibrosis and contractility under pressure overload and hypertensive stress models, placing TSP‑4 upstream of remodeling pathways and integrin‑mediated adhesion signaling. Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)
- Additional modes: TSP‑4 modulates endothelial cell functions, macrophage recruitment in injured tissues, and neurite/synapse remodeling via its EGF‑like domains and C‑terminal modules, consistent with roles in inflammation and neural plasticity after injury. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5, zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)

3) Tissue contexts and biological processes
- Cardiovascular system: TSP‑4 is upregulated with cardiac overload and participates in remodeling, fibrosis, and contractility responses; it is implicated in hypertension‑induced cardiovascular remodeling and atherosclerosis. Reviews and cited primary studies converge on an extracellular role that integrates mechanical and inflammatory cues with ECM changes. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 3-4, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 5-7, zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)
- Pulmonary vasculature (2024 development): In PAH associated with congenital heart disease (PAH‑CHD), THBS4 was elevated in severe lesions, localized predominantly to PASMCs, and functionally drove a synthetic/proliferative PASMC phenotype via PI3K/AKT, while inhibition of THBS4 attenuated remodeling in vivo. Circulating THBS4 was higher in severe vs mild PAH‑CHD patients by ELISA, suggesting biomarker potential. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17)
- Bone and cartilage: THBS4 supports tendon/muscle ECM organization; in 2025, descendants of hypertrophic chondrocytes were shown to promote angiogenesis in bone growth/repair by secreting THBS4, with in vitro THBS4 sufficient to stimulate endothelial proliferation and tube formation—mechanistically suggesting endothelial targets such as CD47. Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-025-00469-2. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5)
- Skin and wound healing: THBS4 is upregulated during skin wound healing and in inflamed psoriatic skin; as a matricellular protein it accelerates wound closure and modulates stem cell niches within skin compartments. Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241814274. ()
- Nervous system: Thrombospondins, including TSP‑4, are linked to excitatory synaptogenesis and spinal sensitization after mechanical injury, consistent with THBS4 expression in neuroglia and potential roles in glial scar ECM modulation post‑ischemia. Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)

4) Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- PAH‑CHD biomarker and mechanism (2024): THBS4 distinguishes severe (irreversible) from mild (reversible) PAH‑CHD, is primarily expressed in PASMCs, modulates phenotype via PI3K/AKT, and its inhibition mitigates remodeling in a rat model. Patient ELISA showed higher circulating THBS4 with severe PAH‑CHD. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17)
- Cancer ECM signature (2023): In colon cancer, a 4‑gene ECM signature including THBS4 stratified prognosis across TCGA and GEO cohorts, with higher risk scores associated with worse overall survival and CMS4 subtype; immunohistochemistry confirmed differential THBS4 expression. Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-2036. ()
- Cardiovascular/ECM mechanobiology (2023–2025): Reviews synthesize TSP‑4’s roles as a mechanosensitive ECM mediator in pressure overload, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertension, integrating integrin adhesion and ECM stiffness cues. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17)
- Musculoskeletal regeneration (2025): THBS4 secreted by chondrocyte descendants drives angiogenesis critical for bone growth and injury repair; exogenous THBS4 rescues angiogenesis deficits ex vivo. Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-025-00469-2. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5)

5) Disease associations, applications, and data
- Cardiovascular disease and vascular pathology: THBS4 is associated with atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease (levels increasing with disease severity and diabetes), and cardiac overload; a TSP‑4 A387P coding variant has been linked to post‑MI risk and altered Ca2+ binding. Dec 2023 review summarizing multiple clinical studies; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 7-7, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 5-7)
- Pulmonary vascular disease (PAH‑CHD): As above, THBS4 elevation and functional necessity in remodeling identify it as a biomarker candidate and potential target; circulating levels discriminate severe from mild PAH‑CHD. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17)
- Cancer: In colon cancer, inclusion of THBS4 in an ECM‑based prognostic model improved risk stratification across multiple cohorts, suggesting utility in prognostics and microenvironmental characterization (CMS4). Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-2036. ()
- Osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disease: Family‑level reviews identify thrombospondins as potential biomarkers/targets in OA (cartilage homeostasis, synovial inflammation, pain), with TSP‑4 upregulated after tissue injury and participating in regeneration/remodeling. Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343. (aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)
- Quantitative/statistical notes from recent studies:
  • Colon cancer ECM signature: The 4‑gene model (including THBS4) separated high‑ vs low‑risk groups with significant survival differences (log‑rank P<0.001 across training/validation cohorts), and risk score served as an independent prognostic factor; details summarized in the 2023 report. Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-2036. ()
  • PAH‑CHD: Circulating THBS4 measured by ELISA was higher in severe vs mild PAH‑CHD; THBS4 inhibition by AAV reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling in vivo, and THBS4 perturbed PASMC phenotype via PI3K/AKT in vitro. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17)
  • Cardiovascular associations: Reviews collate that plasma/serum THBS4 correlates with PAD severity and diabetes and that A387P associates with post‑MI risk; quantitative effect sizes vary across cohorts and are summarized in the Dec 2023 review. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 7-7)

6) Expert opinions and analysis
- Matricellular paradigm: Expert reviews emphasize that thrombospondins function as non‑structural ECM signals that are induced by injury and mechanical stress, shaping cell behavior through receptor engagement and ECM remodeling; THBS4 exemplifies this, with context‑dependent pro‑angiogenic, fibrotic, and neuroplastic actions. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-025-02365-y; Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17, aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)
- Translational trajectory: Recent primary work positions THBS4 as (i) a biomarker for vascular remodeling severity in PAH‑CHD, (ii) a component of prognostic ECM signatures in cancer, and (iii) a regenerative factor in bone repair angiogenesis. These roles highlight opportunities for diagnostic panels and for targeting THBS4‑receptor interfaces (e.g., integrins/CD47) in mechanopathologies. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w; Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-2036; Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-025-00469-2. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5)

7) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Biomarkers: Circulating THBS4 shows promise for stratifying PAH‑CHD severity; PAD/diabetes associations and cancer ECM signatures suggest broader biomarker panel utility across vascular and oncologic settings. Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-024-02932-w; Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-2036; Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40. (zeng2024theroleand pages 16-17, eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 7-7)
- Regenerative medicine: THBS4 as an angiogenic factor for bone growth and repair could be harnessed to promote vascularization in skeletal regeneration strategies. Nov 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41413-025-00469-2. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 4-5)
- Skin repair: Upregulation of THBS4 in wound healing and inflamed psoriatic skin indicates potential as a wound‑healing modulator and inflammatory skin biomarker. Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241814274. ()

8) Verification against ambiguity criteria (required)
- Gene symbol and identity: Literature consistently refers to human thrombospondin‑4 encoded by THBS4, matching UniProt P35443. No conflicting gene symbol usage from other organisms was used to support conclusions here. Reviews and primary data cited are human‑focused or directly relevant to mammalian homologs, consistent with the mandated organism context. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)
- Family/domains: Reports align with thrombospondin family features and the presence of Ca2+‑binding EGF‑like domains and C‑terminal type 3 repeats; subgroup B architecture is congruent. Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.24041/ejmr2023.40; Mar 2025; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.103343. (eba2023structuralcharacteristicsand pages 1-2, aihaiti2025theroleof pages 1-2)

Limitations and open questions
- Receptor specificity in humans remains context‑dependent; while integrin α2 and the CD47 axis are implicated, precise co‑receptor sets and downstream effectors can vary by tissue and pathology. Further high‑resolution structural and in vivo receptor‑blocking studies in human tissues are needed to define therapeutic targetability.
- Many mechanobiology insights derive from animal or ex vivo models, requiring careful translation to human disease.
