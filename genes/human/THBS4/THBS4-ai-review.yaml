description: >-
  Thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4) is a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein
  that forms homopentamers. It belongs to the thrombospondin family (subgroup B,
  which lacks TSR type 1 repeats) and contains calcium-binding EGF-like modules
  and C-terminal thrombospondin type 3 repeats. TSP-4 is primarily expressed in
  heart, skeletal muscle, and tendon tissues. The protein functions as a matricellular
  signaling molecule that modulates cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation
  through interactions with integrins (particularly integrin alpha-M-beta-2) and
  other ECM components. TSP-4 binds heparin and calcium, with calcium binding
  being important for its conformational stability. A key role is in the adaptive
  endoplasmic reticulum stress response, where TSP-4 binds to and activates ATF6alpha
  to promote protective ER stress responses in the heart. TSP-4 is induced during
  tissue injury and remodeling, contributing to cardioprotective responses to
  pressure overload. The A387P variant is associated with increased cardiovascular
  disease risk through enhanced proinflammatory signaling in neutrophils.

    summary: >-
      TSP-4 is a secreted matricellular glycoprotein that is incorporated into the
      extracellular matrix. This is well-established through multiple lines of evidence
      including its secretion from cells, binding to ECM components, and localization
      studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      THBS4/TSP-4 is definitively an extracellular matrix protein. UniProt states it
      is "Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular matrix" and the deep research
      confirms TSP-4 is secreted to the extracellular space and incorporated into the
      ECM, where it binds collagenous and non-collagenous components [THBS4-deep-research-falcon.md].

    summary: >-
      TSP-4 plays a key role in the adaptive ER stress response. It binds ATF6alpha
      in the ER lumen and promotes its activation and nuclear translocation, leading
      to upregulation of protective ER stress response factors.
    action: ACCEPT

      This is a well-established core function of TSP-4. The 2012 Cell paper by Lynch
      et al. definitively established this mechanism, showing that TSP-4 binds ATF6alpha
      and promotes a protective ER stress response. The IBA annotation is appropriate.

      While TSP-4 does participate in signal transduction (e.g., activating p38MAPK

      The evidence is indirect (IEP - expression pattern). TSP-4 expression was

      TSP-4 can be pro-angiogenic in some contexts. This annotation needs further

- question: >-
    Does TSP-4 have chaperone-like activity for other ECM proteins in addition to
    its ATF6alpha regulatory function? The type 3 repeat domain has been implicated
    in ECM protein processing and COMP mutations in this domain cause ER retention
    of collagen.
- question: >-
