### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O60488
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase 4 {ECO:0000305}; EC=6.2.1.3 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21242590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22633490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24269233}; AltName: Full=Arachidonate--CoA ligase {ECO:0000305}; EC=6.2.1.15 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21242590}; AltName: Full=Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4; Short=LACS 4;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ACSL4; Synonyms=ACS4, FACL4, LACS4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATP-dependent AMP-binding enzyme family.
- **Key Domains:** AMP-bd_C_sf. (IPR045851); AMP-binding_CS. (IPR020845); AMP-dep_synth/lig_dom. (IPR000873); ANL_N_sf. (IPR042099); AMP-binding (PF00501)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ACSL4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ACSL4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ACSL4** (gene ID: ACSL4, UniProt: O60488) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verified identity of ACSL4 (human; UniProt O60488) and aligned literature to the long‑chain acyl‑CoA synthetase family and AMP/adenylate‑binding catalytic domains. Prioritized recent (2023–2024) primary and review sources on enzymatic function, ferroptosis lipid remodeling, localization, and translational inhibitors. Extracted mechanistic details (AA/AdA preference; LPCAT3 coupling; lipoxygenase oxidation) and disease relevance (neuro/cancer/organ injury). Compiled a concise artifact table and integrated into a narrative report with URLs and publication dates.

Comprehensive research report: ACSL4 (human; UniProt O60488)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and catalytic function: ACSL4 is a membrane‑associated long‑chain acyl‑CoA synthetase that activates long‑chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) by ligating them to CoA in an ATP‑dependent adenylation/thiolation reaction, generating PUFA‑CoAs used for complex lipid synthesis and β‑oxidation substrates (AMP‑binding/adenylate domain plus C‑terminal catalytic domain; ~711 aa, ~80 kDa) (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2, chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7).
- Substrate specificity: Human ACSL4 shows marked preference for PUFA substrates, especially arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4) and adrenic acid (AdA, 22:4), forming AA‑CoA and AdA‑CoA that seed pro‑oxidant phospholipid pools (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2). Reviews from 2023 corroborate AA/AdA preference among PUFAs (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- Core role in ferroptosis: Ferroptosis is a lipid peroxidation–driven, iron‑dependent regulated cell death. ACSL4 is a positive determinant of ferroptosis sensitivity by supplying PUFA‑CoAs that are esterified into phospholipids subject to peroxidation; GPX4 is a negative regulator that detoxifies lipid peroxides (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- Pathway module (ACSL4–LPCAT3–lipoxygenase): ACSL4‑generated AA/AdA‑CoAs are incorporated into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by LPCAT3; 15‑LOX then oxidizes PE‑AA/PE‑AdA to hydroperoxy‑PE species that execute ferroptosis. ACSL4 abundance/activity thus dictates accumulation of these pro‑ferroptotic PE‑PUFAs (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5, chen2023theacsl4network pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- First targeted, direct ACSL4 inhibitor with in vivo efficacy: A 2024 Science Advances study identified AS‑252424 as a specific ACSL4 inhibitor that binds glutamine 464 on ACSL4, suppressing its enzymatic activity, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis. Nanoparticle‑delivered AS‑252424 ameliorated ferroptosis‑mediated organ injury in mouse models of kidney ischemia/reperfusion and acute liver injury, highlighting translational potential (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2).
- Refined structural/biochemical framing: Contemporary reviews summarize ACSL4 domain architecture (AMP/adenylate‑binding region, catalytic triad Lys‑Asp‑Cys) and its biochemical selectivity for PUFA activation underlying ferroptotic susceptibility (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7, ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- CNS disease relevance updated: A 2023 review details ACSL4’s mechanistic positioning at ER‑associated oxidation centers and its indispensability for AA‑PE/AdA‑PE oxidation in neuronal ferroptosis; knockdown protects against ischemic brain injury models (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Anti‑ferroptosis therapeutics in organ injury models: Targeting ACSL4 with AS‑252424 suppressed ferroptosis and reduced injury severity in kidney and liver models when delivered in nanoparticles, providing a proof‑of‑concept therapeutic avenue to limit ferroptosis‑driven tissue damage (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2).
- Experimental probes and genetic manipulation: ACSL4 knockdown/siRNA reduces ferroptosis sensitivity in neuronal and ischemic contexts, functioning as a tool to delineate ferroptosis pathways and potential protection strategies (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Enzymology and ferroptosis axis: Recent expert reviews converge on ACSL4 as a linchpin enzyme that dictates membrane PUFA composition and oxidative susceptibility, establishing it as a biomarker and target in ferroptosis‑related disease (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- Integrated lipid remodeling model: The ACSL4–LPCAT3–15‑LOX module is repeatedly highlighted as the proximate biochemical circuit for generating peroxidation‑prone PE‑PUFAs, which can be countered by GPX4 activity; this mechanistic clarity supports targeted intervention strategies (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12060864) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5, chen2023theacsl4network pages 2-4).
- Structural and regulatory underpinnings: Domain organization, catalytic motifs, PTMs (including phosphorylation) and transcriptional control (Sp1, CREB, TEAD4/YAP, PPARδ) are implicated in tuning ACSL4 activity and ferroptosis output, informing druggability assessments (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7, ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Target engagement and efficacy (preclinical): AS‑252424 directly engages ACSL4 at Q464 and prevents lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis across human and mouse cells; nanoparticle‑mediated delivery attenuated organ injury in murine kidney ischemia/reperfusion and acute liver injury models (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2). Quantitative effect sizes were model‑specific and not detailed in the excerpt; however, the study documents significant protective effects in vivo.
- Tissue expression context: Reviews document enriched ACSL4 expression in adrenal tissue and pronounced expression in adult human brain regions (cerebellum and hippocampus), aligning with disease‑specific vulnerability to ferroptosis (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12060864) (chen2023theacsl4network pages 2-4).

Mechanism, substrates, and pathway context
- Reaction: ACSL4 catalyzes ATP‑dependent activation of long‑chain PUFAs (PUFA + ATP + CoA → PUFA‑CoA + AMP + PPi), with strong selectivity for AA and AdA in human systems (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533; Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2, huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2).
- Lipid remodeling partners and species: ACSL4 couples to LPCAT3 to generate PE‑AA/PE‑AdA, which are substrates for 15‑LOX‑dependent peroxidation to ferroptotic hydroperoxy‑PEs; GPX4 counteracts this by reducing lipid hydroperoxides (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12060864) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5, chen2023theacsl4network pages 2-4).

Cellular and subcellular localization
- Predominantly endoplasmic reticulum (ER): ACSL4 operates at ER oxidation centers crucial for phospholipid remodeling and ferroptosis execution (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).
- Additional localizations: Distribution also reported at mitochondria, peroxisomes, and plasma‑membrane/ER–mitochondria contact regions, consistent with roles in lipid metabolism and organelle‑proximal redox signaling (Aug 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1594419; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12060864) (jiang2025acsl4atthe pages 2-3, chen2023theacsl4network pages 2-4).

Genetic and disease associations
- X‑linked intellectual disability: Genetic association between ACSL4 and X‑linked non‑specific intellectual disability is noted in human studies (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- CNS injury and neurodegeneration: ACSL4 is indispensable for neuronal ferroptosis via AA/AdA‑PE oxidation; reducing ACSL4 protects in ischemic brain models, suggesting therapeutic potential in stroke and CNS injuries (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).
- Organ injury (kidney/liver): Direct ACSL4 inhibition with AS‑252424 confers protection in mouse kidney ischemia/reperfusion and acute liver injury models, arguing for clinical exploration in ferroptosis‑driven organ pathologies (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2).

Regulation of ACSL4
- Transcriptional: Sp1, CREB, TEAD4/YAP, and PPARδ have been implicated in regulating ACSL4 expression in specific contexts, linking lipid metabolic cues and growth factor pathways to ferroptosis competence (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2).
- Post‑translational: Phosphorylation (including PKCβII at Thr328) activates ACSL4, while ubiquitin‑proteasome and lysosome‑dependent pathways modulate its abundance, integrating signaling and proteostasis control with ferroptosis sensitivity (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12060864) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5, chen2023theacsl4network pages 12-15, chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7).

Pharmacology and tool compounds
- Targeted inhibitor: AS‑252424 (AS) — direct binding to Q464; inhibits ACSL4 enzymatic activity; abrogates lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis; effective in vivo with nanoparticle delivery in murine organ injury models (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2).
- Genetic tools: ACSL4 siRNA/knockdown reduces ferroptotic death in neuronal/ischemic settings, enabling causal dissection (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).

Mandatory verification of target identity
- Gene/protein match: The literature explicitly treats ACSL4 as a human long‑chain acyl‑CoA synthetase with AMP/adenylate‑binding and catalytic domains consistent with the ATP‑dependent AMP‑binding enzyme family, matching O60488 annotations (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (ding2023acylcoasynthaseacsl4 pages 1-2, chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7).
- Organism: All cited mechanistic and inhibitor studies above are human‑centric or use human ACSL4 in conjunction with mouse models for in vivo validation (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adk1200; Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210021) (huang2024identificationofa pages 1-2, jia2023acsl4mediatedferroptosisand pages 3-5).
- Domains/family alignment: Described adenylate (AMP‑binding) and catalytic domains and membrane association place ACSL4 within the ATP‑dependent AMP‑binding enzyme superfamily, consistent with UniProt domain/family annotations (Jul 2023; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000002533) (chen2023theacsl4network pages 5-7).
