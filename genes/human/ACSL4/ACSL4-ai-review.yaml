description: 'ACSL4 (Long-chain-fatty-acid--CoA ligase 4) is a membrane-associated
  enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of long-chain polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) by ligating them to coenzyme A. The enzyme shows strong substrate
  preference for arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4) and adrenic acid (AdA, 22:4), forming
  AA-CoA and AdA-CoA. These PUFA-CoA products are incorporated into membrane phospholipids
  (particularly phosphatidylethanolamine) by LPCAT3, where they become substrates
  for lipid peroxidation. ACSL4 is a critical positive regulator of ferroptosis, an
  iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. ACSL4
  is localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, with additional presence
  at mitochondrial outer membrane, ER-mitochondria contact sites (MAM), plasma membrane,
  and lipid droplets. Mutations in ACSL4 cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID63).
  EC numbers: 6.2.1.3 (long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase) and 6.2.1.15 (arachidonate-CoA
  ligase).'

  review:
    summary: ACSL4 is directly involved in long-chain fatty acid metabolism by activating
      long-chain PUFAs through ATP-dependent ligation to CoA. This is a core function
      supported by extensive experimental evidence (PMID:9598324, PMID:21242590, PMID:22633490,
      PMID:24269233).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects ACSL4's core enzymatic role. The enzyme
      catalyzes the conversion of long-chain fatty acids to their active acyl-CoA
      forms, which is the first step in both lipid synthesis and degradation pathways
      (PMID:21242590).

      of action for lipid metabolism and ferroptosis-related PUFA-CoA generation.
      Cyberian deep research confirms ER as the predominant localization site, with
      the brain-specific variant 2 showing strong ER localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: ER localization is well-established and represents a core site for ACSL4
      function. The enzyme operates at ER oxidation centers crucial for phospholipid
      remodeling and ferroptosis execution. PMID:24269233 confirms ER localization.

  review:
    summary: ACSL4 mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID63), suggesting
      a role in neuronal function. However, neuron differentiation is likely a pleiotropic/peripheral
      function rather than a core enzymatic function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While ACSL4 is expressed in brain and mutations cause intellectual disability
      (PMID:11889465), the primary function of ACSL4 is fatty acid-CoA ligation. Neuronal
      effects are likely downstream consequences of altered lipid metabolism rather
      than direct involvement in differentiation pathways. The IBA annotation reflects
      phylogenetic inference from other family members.

  title: Cyberian deep research review on ACSL4 function
  findings:
  - statement: ACSL4 catalyzes ATP-dependent formation of fatty acyl-CoA esters with
      marked substrate preference for PUFAs (AA, AdA) over saturated fatty acids
    supporting_text: What distinguishes ACSL4 from other ACSL family members (ACSL1,
      ACSL3, ACSL5, and ACSL6) is its marked substrate preference for polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4) and adrenic acid
      (AdA, 22:4), rather than saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids
  - statement: ACSL4 operates through a two-step ping-pong mechanism involving an
      acyl-adenylate intermediate with kinetic triad of lysine-aspartate-cysteine
    supporting_text: The enzyme operates through a two-step ping-pong mechanism involving
      an acyl-adenylate intermediate. The catalytic center contains a conserved acylase
      kinetic triad of lysine-aspartate-cysteine residues
  - statement: ACSL4 localizes primarily to ER with additional presence at mitochondria,
      plasma membrane, and peroxisomes
    supporting_text: The enzyme localizes primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
      with additional presence at mitochondria, plasma membrane, and peroxisomes
  - statement: The two ACSL4 isoforms have distinct localizations - variant 1 at plasma
      membrane, variant 2 at ER and lipid droplets with brain-specific expression
    supporting_text: Variant 1 (ACSL4_v1), the shorter and more broadly expressed
      form, localizes to the inner side of the plasma membrane including microvilli
      and is also present in the cytosol. Variant 2 (ACSL4_v2), which contains an
      additional 41 N-terminal amino acids encoding a hydrophobic region, localizes
      to the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets and shows brain-specific expression
  - statement: ACSL4 acts coordinately with LPCAT3 in the Lands cycle to incorporate
      AA-CoA into phosphatidylethanolamine, the key ferroptosis substrate
    supporting_text: Free intracellular PUFAs are first converted to their acyl-CoA
      forms by ACSL4, then esterified into phospholipids by LPCAT3. Specifically,
      arachidonoyl-CoA and adrenoyl-CoA generated by ACSL4 are incorporated by LPCAT3
      into lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to
      form AA-containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)
  - statement: PKCbetaII phosphorylates ACSL4 at Thr328 to promote dimerization (the
      active form), creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies ferroptosis
    supporting_text: PKCbetaII functions as a sensor of initial lipid peroxides and
      amplifies lipid peroxidation by phosphorylating ACSL4 at threonine 328 (Thr328).
      This phosphorylation is critical for ACSL4 dimerization, which represents the
      active form of the enzyme
  - statement: ACSL4 mutations causing XLID reduce enzymatic activity by 80-88% with
      completely skewed X-inactivation in carrier females
    supporting_text: Meloni et al. (2002) identified mutations in FACL4 (ACSL4) in
      families segregating nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation, including two
      missense mutations (R529S and P375L) and one splice site mutation that reduce
      enzymatic activity by 80-88% compared to normal controls. All carrier females
      with point mutations or genomic deletions showed completely skewed X-inactivation
  - statement: Drosophila studies show ACSL4 controls BMP/Dpp signaling in brain affecting
      glial cells, neurons, and visual wiring
    supporting_text: dAcsl mutants exhibit diminished production of Decapentaplegic
      (Dpp), a BMP-like morphogen, specifically in the larval brain. This reduction
      in BMP signaling leads to decreased numbers of glial cells and neurons, with
      retinal axons misdirecting in the visual cortex

      preference

suggested_questions:
- question: What are the relative contributions of ACSL4 versus other ACSL family
    members to ferroptosis in different tissue contexts?
- question: Does ACSL4's role in neuronal function relate primarily to ferroptosis
    or to other lipid-dependent processes?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Lipidomic analysis comparing AA-CoA and AdA-CoA levels in ACSL4 knockout
    versus wild-type cells across different tissue types. This would quantify the
    specific contribution of ACSL4 to PUFA-CoA pools in different cellular contexts.
  hypothesis: ACSL4 is the primary source of AA-CoA and AdA-CoA in ferroptosis-sensitive
    tissues
- description: Structure-function analysis of ACSL4 disease-causing mutations to understand
    substrate specificity determinants. This would inform both disease mechanisms
    and potential therapeutic interventions.
  hypothesis: Disease mutations affect substrate binding or catalytic efficiency
