description: 'BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor protein that functions as a central
  hub for maintaining genomic stability. Its primary molecular function is as a RING-type
  E3 ubiquitin ligase (in complex with BARD1) that catalyzes K6-linked polyubiquitin
  chains. BRCA1 orchestrates the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks through
  multiple mechanisms: promoting homologous recombination repair via DNA end resection
  and RAD51 loading, regulating cell cycle checkpoints (particularly S-phase and G2/M),
  and maintaining centrosome stability. The protein contains three key domains: an
  N-terminal RING domain mediating E3 ligase activity, a large central region with
  nuclear localization signals and protein interaction sites, and C-terminal BRCT
  domains that bind phosphoproteins. BRCA1 forms at least four major complexes (BRCA1-A
  through BRCA1-D) that execute distinct functions in the DNA damage response. Germline
  pathogenic variants in BRCA1 cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,
  with carriers having approximately 66% risk of breast cancer and 41% risk of ovarian
  cancer by age 70.'

  review:
    summary: BRCA1 functions as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase in complex with BARD1,
      catalyzing the formation of K6-linked polyubiquitin chains. This enzymatic activity
      is essential for multiple stages of homologous recombination repair and represents
      the only known enzymatic function of BRCA1. The IBA annotation is well-supported
      by extensive experimental evidence across multiple species.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures BRCA1s core enzymatic function. Multiple
      studies have demonstrated that BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer possesses E3 ubiquitin
      ligase activity, forming unconventional K6-linked polyubiquitin chains [PMID:12890688].
      Recent work using ligase-null mutants (I26A/L63A/K65A) has definitively established
      this activity is required for homologous recombination [PMID:23007347]. The
      IBA annotation correctly identifies this conserved function across species.

  review:
    summary: BRCA1 has DNA binding activity, though this is a general annotation that
      could be more specific. BRCA1 binds to damaged DNA at double-strand breaks and
      associates with chromatin during the DNA damage response. The central region
      contains DNA-binding capability.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While BRCA1 does bind DNA, this annotation is too general and uninformative.
      BRCA1 specifically binds to damaged DNA and DNA structures at double-strand
      breaks. A more specific term like "damaged DNA binding" (GO:0003684) would better
      represent its actual function in the DNA damage response.

  review:
    summary: Duplicate annotation of BRCA1s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, this time
      from InterPro domain prediction. The annotation is correct as BRCA1 contains
      a RING domain that mediates E3 ligase activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IEA annotation correctly identifies BRCA1s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
      based on its RING domain. While redundant with the IBA annotation, it provides
      complementary evidence from protein domain analysis. The RING domain at the
      N-terminus is essential for BRCA1s E3 ligase function in complex with BARD1.

      about BRCA1. While BRCA1 does interact with many proteins including CstF-50

      annotations like "RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain binding" or annotations
      related to its core functions in DNA repair and ubiquitination. Generic protein

    summary: BRCA1 participates in p53-mediated apoptosis through interaction with
      IFI16, contributing to DNA damage-induced cell death.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly identifies BRCA1s role in DNA damage-induced
      apoptosis. BRCA1 interacts with IFI16 (a Pyrin family member) to promote p53-mediated
      apoptotic response to DNA damage. This apoptotic function complements BRCA1s
      DNA repair role by eliminating cells with irreparable damage, contributing to
      tumor suppression.

    summary: BRCA1 has DNA binding activity confirmed by author statement, though
      more specific terms would be preferable.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While BRCA1 does bind DNA, this generic term is uninformative. BRCA1 specifically
      binds to damaged DNA at double-strand breaks and DNA structures during repair.
      The annotation should use more specific terms like "damaged DNA binding" (GO:0003684)
      to better represent its function.

  review:
    summary: BRCA1 is essential for homologous recombination-mediated repair of DNA
      double-strand breaks. This is the core tumor suppressor function of BRCA1, with
      deficiency leading to genomic instability and cancer predisposition.
    action: NEW
    reason: This critical annotation for BRCA1s primary function in homologous recombination
      repair was missing from the GOA file. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate
      that BRCA1 orchestrates HR through DNA end resection, RAD51 loading, and regulation
      of repair pathway choice. Loss of HR function is the primary mechanism of BRCA1-associated
      cancer predisposition. This should be a core annotation.
