description: 'BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor protein that functions as a central
  hub for maintaining genomic stability. Its primary molecular function is as a RING-type
  E3 ubiquitin ligase (in complex with BARD1) that catalyzes K6-linked polyubiquitin
  chains. BRCA1 orchestrates the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks through
  multiple mechanisms: promoting homologous recombination repair via DNA end resection
  and RAD51 loading, regulating cell cycle checkpoints (particularly S-phase and G2/M),
  and maintaining centrosome stability. The protein contains three key domains: an
  N-terminal RING domain mediating E3 ligase activity, a large central region with
  nuclear localization signals and protein interaction sites, and C-terminal BRCT
  domains that bind phosphoproteins. BRCA1 forms at least four major complexes (BRCA1-A
  through BRCA1-D) that execute distinct functions in the DNA damage response. Germline
  pathogenic variants in BRCA1 cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,
  with carriers having approximately 66% risk of breast cancer and 41% risk of ovarian
  cancer by age 70.'

    review:
      summary: BRCA1 functions as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase in complex 
        with BARD1, catalyzing the formation of K6-linked polyubiquitin chains. 
        This enzymatic activity is essential for multiple stages of homologous 
        recombination repair and represents the only known enzymatic function of
        BRCA1. The IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive experimental 
        evidence across multiple species.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately captures BRCA1s core enzymatic 
        function. Multiple studies have demonstrated that BRCA1-BARD1 
        heterodimer possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, forming 
        unconventional K6-linked polyubiquitin chains [PMID:12890688]. Recent 
        work using ligase-null mutants (I26A/L63A/K65A) has definitively 
        established this activity is required for homologous recombination 
        [PMID:23007347]. The IBA annotation correctly identifies this conserved 
        function across species.

    review:
      summary: BRCA1 has DNA binding activity, though this is a general 
        annotation that could be more specific. BRCA1 binds to damaged DNA at 
        double-strand breaks and associates with chromatin during the DNA damage
        response. The central region contains DNA-binding capability.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While BRCA1 does bind DNA, this annotation is too general and 
        uninformative. BRCA1 specifically binds to damaged DNA and DNA 
        structures at double-strand breaks. A more specific term like "damaged 
        DNA binding" (GO:0003684) would better represent its actual function in 
        the DNA damage response.

      summary: Duplicate annotation of BRCA1s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, this
        time from InterPro domain prediction. The annotation is correct as BRCA1
        contains a RING domain that mediates E3 ligase activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This IEA annotation correctly identifies BRCA1s E3 ubiquitin 
        ligase activity based on its RING domain. While redundant with the IBA 
        annotation, it provides complementary evidence from protein domain 
        analysis. The RING domain at the N-terminus is essential for BRCA1s E3 
        ligase function in complex with BARD1.

      summary: BRCA1 interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase and affects lipid 
        synthesis. However, this is a peripheral function not related to tumor 
        suppression.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: While BRCA1 does interact with ACACA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and 
        can affect lipid metabolism, this is not a core function of the protein.
        The lipid metabolic role is tangential to BRCA1s primary tumor 
        suppressor function in DNA repair. This annotation likely represents an 
        over-annotation based on protein interaction data.
