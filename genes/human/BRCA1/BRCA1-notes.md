# BRCA1 Gene Review Notes

## 2025-01-14 - Term Label Update

**Issue**: Validation failure due to 1 GO term having an outdated label.

**Root Cause**: GO:0006301 had the label "DNA damage tolerance" but the current ontology uses "postreplication repair".

**Action Taken**: Updated the term label from "DNA damage tolerance" to "postreplication repair" to match the current GO ontology.

**Validation Status**: After fixing the term label, the gene now passes validation with only warnings about PENDING annotations.

**Note**: This represents a routine ontology term label update. BRCA1 is a critical DNA repair protein associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and the term "postreplication repair" more accurately describes one of its DNA repair functions.
