description: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 7 (ENPP7) is an alkaline sphingomyelin
  phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.12) that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine. Unlike
  other ENPP family members that degrade nucleotides, ENPP7 evolved specificity for phospholipid substrates
  through an aromatic box composed of tyrosine residues that recognize the choline headgroup. Expressed
  primarily in intestinal epithelium and human liver/bile, the enzyme requires specific bile salts (taurocholate,
  taurochenodeoxycholate) for activity. ENPP7 is anchored to the plasma membrane via a C-terminal hydrophobic
  domain with the catalytic domain extending extracellularly. The enzyme functions in dietary sphingomyelin
  digestion, generates anti-proliferative ceramide, inactivates pro-inflammatory platelet-activating factor
  (PAF), and regulates cholesterol absorption. Reduced ENPP7 activity is associated with colorectal cancer,
  cholangiocarcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease.

    summary: Phosphoric diester hydrolase activity based on phylogenetic inference. ENPP7 hydrolyzes the
      phosphodiester bond in sphingomyelin between ceramide and phosphocholine.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This correctly describes ENPP7's core enzymatic activity. The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis
      of the phosphodiester bond in sphingomyelin. While sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase activity (GO:0004767)
      is more specific, this parent term is appropriate.

  review:
    summary: Negative regulation of cell proliferation through ceramide generation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This is an indirect, downstream effect of ENPP7 activity. The ceramide product of sphingomyelin
      hydrolysis is a well-characterized anti-proliferative lipid. Reduced ENPP7 activity is associated
      with colorectal cancer, consistent with loss of ceramide-mediated growth suppression.

      supporting_text: The primary therapeutic interest in ENPP7 derives from its capacity to generate
        ceramide, a well-characterized bioactive lipid that inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptotic
        cell death across diverse cell types

  review:
    summary: General membrane localization - overly broad term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This is an overly general term. ENPP7 specifically localizes to plasma membrane and microvillus
      membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. More specific terms (GO:0005886 plasma membrane, GO:0005902
      microvillus) are already annotated.
