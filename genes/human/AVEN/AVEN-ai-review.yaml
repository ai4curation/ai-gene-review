description: >-
  AVEN is an anti-apoptotic regulator that inhibits the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through two
  complementary mechanisms. First, it binds Apaf-1 and interferes with Apaf-1 self-association,
  thereby blocking apoptosome assembly and caspase-9 activation. Second, it binds and stabilizes
  the anti-apoptotic BCL-xL protein, potentiating its pro-survival function. AVEN contains a
  predicted BH3-like motif (aa 141-153) that mediates BCL-xL interaction. The full anti-apoptotic
  potential of AVEN is unleashed by cathepsin D cleavage that removes an inhibitory N-terminal
  domain. AVEN also participates in the DNA damage response, where ATM phosphorylates it at
  Ser135/Ser138 to promote G2/M checkpoint arrest. AVEN is overexpressed in hematologic
  malignancies and contributes to chemotherapy resistance.

    summary: >-
      AVEN participates in the DNA damage response and promotes G2/M checkpoint arrest. ATM
      phosphorylates AVEN at Ser135 and Ser138 upon DNA damage, and these phosphorylation
      sites are required for AVEN-driven checkpoint function. This IBA annotation is
      phylogenetically inferred and is consistent with experimental evidence showing AVEN's
      role in DNA damage checkpoint signaling.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While AVEN does contribute to G2/M checkpoint arrest via ATM-dependent phosphorylation,
      this represents a secondary/modulatory function rather than AVEN's core anti-apoptotic
      role. The primary function of AVEN is inhibition of apoptosome assembly and BCL-xL
      stabilization. The checkpoint function is mechanistically distinct and should be
      retained as a non-core annotation.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is based on the UniProt keyword 'Apoptosis'. AVEN is indeed involved
      in apoptosis, but as a negative regulator. The term 'apoptotic process' is too general
      and does not capture AVEN's specific anti-apoptotic function. AVEN inhibits the intrinsic
      apoptosis pathway by binding Apaf-1 and preventing apoptosome assembly, and by stabilizing
      BCL-xL.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The annotation is not wrong (AVEN is involved in the apoptotic process), but it lacks
      specificity. AVEN specifically negatively regulates apoptosis through direct inhibition
      of apoptosome assembly and BCL-xL stabilization. A more informative annotation would be
      'negative regulation of apoptotic process' (GO:0043066), which is already annotated
      with IDA evidence.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is based on UniProt subcellular location mapping. UniProt states AVEN
      is "Associated with intracellular membranes" and is a peripheral membrane protein of the
      endomembrane system. The original Chau et al. 2000 paper showed AVEN localizes to light
      membrane/vesicular fractions with diffuse nuclear and reticular cytoplasmic staining.
      Later work showed AVEN co-localizes with cathepsin D in vesicular compartments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is consistent with experimental evidence showing AVEN association with
      intracellular membranes and vesicular compartments. This localization is functionally
      relevant as cathepsin D processing of AVEN in vesicular compartments releases its
      anti-apoptotic potential.

  original_reference_id: PMID:10949025
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation reflects AVEN's binding to APAF1 (O14727) and BCL2L1/BCL-xL (Q07817).
      While the interactions are well-documented (AVEN was discovered through yeast two-hybrid
      screen for BCL-xL interactors), the term 'protein binding' is uninformative. More specific
      molecular function terms should be used.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The term 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) is too generic to be informative. AVEN has
      specific, characterized binding partners (Apaf-1 and BCL-xL) with defined functional
      consequences. The binding to Apaf-1 inhibits apoptosome assembly, while BCL-xL binding
      stabilizes and potentiates this anti-apoptotic protein. More specific terms like
      'BH domain binding' (GO:0051400) for BCL-xL interaction would be more appropriate,
      though the core function is better captured by process annotations.

  original_reference_id: Reactome:R-HSA-6805507
  review:
    summary: >-
      This TAS annotation from Reactome reflects AVEN localization in the cytosol where it
      can interact with Apaf-1 to inhibit apoptosome assembly. Apoptosome formation occurs
      in the cytosol following cytochrome c release from mitochondria, so cytosolic
      localization of AVEN is required for its anti-apoptotic function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytosolic localization is consistent with AVEN's function as an inhibitor of
      apoptosome assembly. The Reactome pathway 'APAF1 binds AVEN' documents this
      interaction in the cytosol. AVEN also associates with membrane fractions, but
      cytosolic AVEN is the pool that interacts with Apaf-1 to prevent caspase activation.

    summary: >-
      This IDA annotation indicates AVEN associates with membranes. The original Chau et al.
      paper showed AVEN localizes to light membrane fractions by subcellular fractionation.
      UniProt describes AVEN as a peripheral membrane protein of the endomembrane system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The membrane localization is experimentally validated and functionally relevant.
      AVEN co-localizes with cathepsin D in vesicular/membrane compartments where
      proteolytic processing removes the N-terminal inhibitory domain to unleash AVEN's
      full anti-apoptotic activity. Both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools of AVEN
      are physiologically relevant.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the core functional annotation for AVEN. AVEN negatively regulates apoptosis
      through two mechanisms: (1) binding Apaf-1 and interfering with its self-association,
      thereby blocking apoptosome assembly and caspase-9 activation; (2) binding and
      stabilizing BCL-xL to potentiate its anti-apoptotic function. Chau et al. demonstrated
      that AVEN inhibited caspase proteolytic activation in cell-free extracts and suppressed
      apoptosis induced by Apaf-1 plus caspase-9. AVEN also protected against death in a
      mouse Sindbis virus infection model.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately captures AVEN's core function as an anti-apoptotic regulator.
      The IDA evidence from the original discovery paper is strong, demonstrating both
      biochemical inhibition of caspase activation and cellular protection from apoptosis.
      This is a legitimate, evolved anti-apoptotic function, not a downstream metabolic effect.

      This term (GO:1905101) more precisely describes AVEN's mechanism of action than
      the broader 'negative regulation of apoptotic process'. AVEN binds Apaf-1 and
      interferes with its oligomerization, which is required for apoptosome formation.
      This is the proximal step that AVEN inhibits to block caspase activation.
