description: NFE2L2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, also known as NRF2) is the master transcription factor regulating cellular antioxidant and cytoprotective responses. As a CNC-bZIP family member, NRF2 heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins (MAFG, MAFK, MAFF) to bind antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes including phase II detoxifying enzymes (NQO1, GSTA), glutathione synthesis genes (GCLC, GCLM), heme oxygenase (HMOX1), and the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by KEAP1, which serves as a substrate adaptor for the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting NRF2 for proteasomal degradation with a half-life of approximately 15 minutes. Upon oxidative stress or electrophile exposure, reactive KEAP1 cysteines are modified, disrupting NRF2 ubiquitination and allowing newly synthesized NRF2 to accumulate in the nucleus. NRF2 also plays a critical role in protection against 
  ferroptosis by inducing genes that maintain iron and lipid homeostasis. Constitutive NRF2 activation via somatic mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 is common in lung cancers and promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance.

  review:
    summary: NRF2 contains a bZIP DNA-binding domain (residues 497-560) that enables sequence-specific binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs). This molecular function is well-established through structural studies (PMID:16888629) and ChIP experiments (PMID:20452972).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of NRF2 as a bZIP transcription factor. The phylogenetic inference is sound and supported by extensive experimental evidence across species.

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
  description: NRF2 functions as the master transcription factor for the antioxidant response, binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in target gene promoters via its bZIP domain. Upon stabilization by oxidative stress or electrophile exposure, NRF2 translocates to the nucleus, heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins, and activates transcription of cytoprotective genes.

    label: RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding
  description: NRF2 contains a CNC-bZIP DNA-binding domain (residues 497-560) that enables sequence-specific recognition of AREs with the core sequence 5'-TGACnnnGC-3'. Structural studies demonstrate the basis for DNA recognition by NRF2-MAF heterodimers.
