## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q16236
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11035812}; Short=NF-E2-related factor 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11035812}; Short=NFE2-related factor 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11035812}; Short=Nrf-2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11256947}; AltName: Full=Nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:33009401, ECO:0000303|PubMed:7937919};
- **Gene Information:** Name=NFE2L2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:29018201, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:7782}; Synonyms=NRF2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:33009401, ECO:0000303|PubMed:7937919};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the bZIP family. CNC subfamily. .
- **Key Domains:** bZIP. (IPR004827); bZIP_Maf. (IPR004826); bZIP_sf. (IPR046347); NFE2-like. (IPR047167); TF_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR008917)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NFE2L2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NFE2L2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NFE2L2** (gene ID: NFE2L2, UniProt: Q16236) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan overview
Objective 1 (verify identity) is complete: NFE2L2 encodes human NRF2 (UniProt Q16236), a Cap ‘n’ Collar (CNC) basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor with hallmark Neh domains and KEAP1-binding motifs, consistent with the user-provided UniProt description (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27). Objectives 2–5 (evidence gathering and synthesis) are completed with curated, recent sources. Objective 6 (final report) is fulfilled below.

> Identity: NFE2L2 (NRF2), UniProt Q16236; organism: Homo sapiens; CNC‑bZIP family; key domains Neh1–Neh7 (Neh2 contains ETGE/DLG; Neh1 = CNC‑bZIP DNA‑binding/leucine zipper; Neh6 harbors β‑TrCP degrons) (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27).

> Canonical mechanism: KEAP1–CUL3–RBX1 adaptor E3 ligase mediates cytoplasmic ubiquitin‑dependent NRF2 degradation; KEAP1 cysteine sensors detect electrophiles/ROS, inhibiting NRF2 ubiquitylation and allowing newly synthesized NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus, heterodimerize with small MAFs, bind AREs and activate target genes (ex.: NQO1, HMOX1/HO‑1, GCLC/GCLM, SLC7A11) (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

> Subcellular localization: predominantly cytoplasmic when bound to KEAP1 under basal conditions; stress/electrophile exposure stabilizes NRF2 and drives nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

> Clinical relevance: recurrent activating NFE2L2 mutations cluster in exon 2 (disrupting DLG/ETGE motifs), with high prevalence in squamous lung cancers (LUSC/LUAD subsets) and context‑dependent effects on prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes (altered anti‑PD1 responses reported); therapeutic modulation includes approved NRF2 activators (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, omaveloxolone) and mixed clinical results for agents like bardoxolone (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).


*Blockquote: A concise, citable summary of human NFE2L2/NRF2 identity, domains, canonical mechanism, localization, and clinical relevance with supporting citations for rapid reference.*

Comprehensive research report: NFE2L2 (NRF2) — human (UniProt Q16236)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and family: NRF2 (gene symbol NFE2L2) is a human CNC-bZIP transcription factor that heterodimerizes with small MAF proteins to bind antioxidant response elements (AREs) and regulate cytoprotective gene expression (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4). Neh1 contains the CNC-bZIP DNA-binding/leucine-zipper region; Neh2 harbors two KEAP1-binding degrons, DLG and ETGE; Neh6 encodes β-TrCP-responsive phosphodegrons; additional Neh3/4/5 transactivation and Neh7 RXRα-repressor interfaces complete the regulatory topology (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 18-22).
- Canonical regulation: Under homeostasis, cytosolic KEAP1 (an obligate homodimer and CUL3–RBX1 E3 ligase adaptor) binds NRF2 via ETGE (high-affinity “hinge”) and DLG (low-affinity “latch”) motifs and targets lysines in Neh2 for polyubiquitination and rapid proteasomal turnover (half-life ~15 min), keeping NRF2 levels low (panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2). Electrophiles/ROS modify reactive KEAP1 cysteines, suppressing NRF2 ubiquitination; newly synthesized NRF2 accumulates, translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with small MAFs, and binds AREs to induce target genes (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4). KEAP1-independent control includes GSK3→β-TrCP/CUL1-mediated degradation via Neh6 and autophagy-driven p62/SQSTM1 sequestration of KEAP1, among other post-translational and epigenetic inputs (hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).
- Subcellular localization: NRF2 is predominantly cytoplasmic when tethered to KEAP1 and accumulates in the nucleus upon stress or electrophile exposure to execute transcriptional programs (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).
- Core transcriptional program: NRF2 induces phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes including NQO1, HMOX1 (HO-1), GCLC/GCLM (glutathione synthesis), and SLC7A11 (cystine/glutamate antiporter), among >200 ARE-bearing targets; it impacts glutathione/NADPH metabolism, redox buffering, xenobiotic detoxification, and proteostasis (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Structural/functional updates in regulation: Recent reviews synthesize domain-resolved behavior: Neh2/Neh7 segments display intrinsic disorder favoring dynamic recognition by KEAP1 and repressors, while Neh4/5 present structured transactivation interfaces (2024) (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 18-22). Mechanistic refinements emphasize the 2:2:1 CUL3:KEAP1:NRF2 stoichiometry and multi-cysteine sensing by KEAP1 that toggles NRF2 stability (Oncogene, 2025; mechanistic framing remains current) (panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2). KEAP1 cysteine-centered electrophile sensing and p97-facilitated extraction of ubiquitylated NRF2 from the complex continue to be cited as core features (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4).
- Crosstalk with other pathways: Updated analyses highlight bidirectional interactions of NRF2 with NOTCH signaling in lung cancer, influencing metabolic reprogramming and tumor microenvironment (2025 update; mechanistic themes are continuous with prior literature) (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4). Reviews in 2024–2025 also synthesize KEAP1-independent control via β-TrCP and autophagy (p62) and transcriptional control by inflammatory regulators (hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).
- Immuno-oncology insights: NRF2 hyperactivation associates with immune evasion and attenuated anti-PD-1 responses across several tumor types; emerging work dissects how NRF2 remodeling of metabolism and stress defenses suppresses cytotoxic immune activity (Oncogene, 2025) (panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Approved NRF2 activators: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF; Tecfidera) is an approved electrophilic NRF2 activator in multiple sclerosis; omaveloxolone is approved for Friedreich’s ataxia, reflecting clinical utility of NRF2 induction in neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative contexts (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4). These approvals operationalize the KEAP1-cysteine sensing mechanism to engage NRF2.
- Mixed outcomes in CKD: Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), a potent NRF2 activator, produced increases in eGFR but raised safety concerns (e.g., fluid retention, blood pressure), leading to mixed or negative outcomes in some kidney disease settings; contemporary reviews emphasize the need for disease- and stage-tailored modulation (summarized mechanistically and contextually) (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4).
- Nutritional/electrophile approaches: Human dietary electrophiles (e.g., isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane) and other thiol-reactive small molecules activate NRF2 via KEAP1 cysteine modification; these strategies are being explored in prevention/adjunct settings and clinical trials (mechanism consolidated across KEAP1–NRF2 reviews) (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- Dual-role paradigm: Authorities emphasize NRF2’s protective role in normal cells versus its proto-oncogenic potential when chronically hyperactivated, where it enhances proliferation, anabolic metabolism, and therapy resistance—particularly in tumors with KEAP1/NFE2L2 pathway alterations (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2). The Oncogene 2025 perspective underscores lack of approved NRF2 inhibitors and advocates context-specific strategies, including combination therapies to counter tumor dependencies created by NRF2 activation (panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).
- Regulatory complexity: Recent syntheses detail multi-layered control—KEAP1 cysteine code, CUL3 neddylation, β-TrCP/GSK3 axis, p62/autophagy, microRNA/epigenetic regulation, and stress-integrated PTMs—highlighting why pharmacological modulation requires precision and biomarker guidance (hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27).

5) Relevant statistics and disease data (recent studies)
- Somatic mutation hotspots and prevalence: NFE2L2 gain-of-function mutations cluster in exon 2 affecting DLG/ETGE motifs, conferring KEAP1-evasion; across TCGA lung cohorts, squamous cancers exhibit high pathway alteration burdens, with reported frequencies on the order of ~20–30% across KEAP1/NFE2L2 in LUSC and notable, though lower, rates in LUAD; KEAP1 and NFE2L2 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive (recent reviews summarizing TCGA analyses) (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4, oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4). These alterations often correlate with poor prognosis in lung and other cancers, though effects can be context-dependent (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).
- Immunotherapy associations: Mechanistic and translational analyses indicate constitutive NRF2 activity is associated with impaired responses to anti-PD1 therapy across multiple tumors, via metabolic reprogramming and suppression of cytotoxic immune responses; this motivates biomarker-driven combination approaches (Oncogene, 2025) (panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).

Molecular mechanism and pathway positioning (precision details)
- KEAP1–NRF2–CUL3 axis: KEAP1’s BTB domain recruits CUL3–RBX1; its Kelch domain recognizes NRF2’s ETGE/DLG in Neh2; stress modifies KEAP1 cysteines (e.g., Cys151, Cys273, Cys288 among many), abrogating ubiquitination and enabling NRF2 nuclear action (hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2). The hinge-and-latch model explains differential affinity of ETGE vs DLG sites; electrophiles can shift KEAP1 conformation and E3 geometry (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4).
- KEAP1-independent regulation: GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of Neh6 DSGIS/DSAPGS motifs recruits β-TrCP for CUL1-mediated degradation; PI3K–AKT through GSK3 inhibition stabilizes NRF2. p62/SQSTM1 (phospho-STGE) competes with NRF2 for KEAP1, promoting KEAP1 autophagic turnover and NRF2 stabilization (hasan2025moleculartargetsof pages 2-4, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).
- Target gene programs: Antioxidant/detoxification (NQO1, HMOX1, GCL genes), glutathione and NADPH metabolism, proteostasis/autophagy support, and adaptive stress resistance; ARE consensus typically TGACnnnGC in sMAF:NRF2-bound promoters/enhancers (shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 18-22).

Subcellular localization and site of action
- Basal state: cytoplasmic NRF2 tethered to KEAP1–CUL3–RBX1 and rapidly degraded (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).
- Activated state: stabilized NRF2 accumulates in the nucleus to drive ARE-dependent transcription with small MAF partners (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

Therapeutic landscape and implementation notes
- Activators in the clinic: DMF (MS) and omaveloxolone (Friedreich’s ataxia) validate therapeutic NRF2 activation; development of non-electrophilic modulators and delivery/formulation strategies continues, but selective inhibition of NRF2 in cancer remains an unmet need (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).
- Safety and context: In kidney disease, potent NRF2 activation has shown renal hemodynamic effects and safety trade-offs, arguing for precision dosing and disease-stage tailoring; oncology settings require strategies that mitigate NRF2-driven resistance (oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2).

Verification of identity and domain/family alignment
- The literature consistently describes human NRF2 (NFE2L2) as a CNC-bZIP transcription factor with Neh1–Neh7 domains, KEAP1-binding ETGE/DLG motifs in Neh2, and β-TrCP degrons in Neh6, fully aligning with the UniProt-provided identity, organism (Homo sapiens), and domain annotations (chen2024keap1nrf2pathwaya pages 4-5, shakya2024targetingnrf2driven pages 22-27, sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 2-4).

Notes on evidence limits
- Where precise numerical frequencies or interventional outcomes are needed (e.g., per-cancer mutation rates or trial statistics), the above reviews summarize TCGA and clinical experiences; figures should be re-verified directly in the primary TCGA or trial publications when making decisions. Nonetheless, the cited sources consolidate the most recent mechanistic and translational consensus (sparaneo2025decodingthenrf2–notch pages 4-5, panda2025nrf2immunobiologyin pages 1-2, oskomic2025keap1nrf2interactionin pages 2-4).
