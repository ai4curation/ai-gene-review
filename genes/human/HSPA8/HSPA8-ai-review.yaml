description: HSPA8 (also known as HSC70 or HSP73) is a constitutively expressed member of the HSP70 family of molecular chaperones.
  It functions as an ATP-dependent foldase chaperone that uses nucleotide-driven conformational changes to bind and release
  unfolded or misfolded substrate proteins, promoting their correct folding. HSPA8 plays central roles in protein quality
  control, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) where it recognizes KFERQ motifs on substrate proteins for lysosomal degradation,
  clathrin coat disassembly, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), protein disaggregation, and as a component of the spliceosomal
  PRP19-CDC5L complex. Unlike the stress-inducible HSPA1A, HSPA8 is constitutively expressed and is the primary HSP70 family
  member involved in housekeeping chaperone functions.

  review:
    summary: Signal transduction is overly broad for HSPA8. While HSPA8 modulates some signaling pathways (e.g., HSF1 regulation,
      NLRP3 inflammasome), its primary role is as a chaperone, not a signaling molecule.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: HSPA8 is a molecular chaperone, not a signaling protein. The IEA annotation to signal transduction is too broad
      and does not capture the specific mechanistic role of HSPA8.

    reason: GO:0051082 is being obsoleted as part of the unfolded protein binding obsoletion project. The correct replacement
      for HSPA8 is GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) since HSPA8/HSC70 binds client polypeptides to assist their folding,

    id: GO:0140662
    label: ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
  description: HSPA8/HSC70 is a constitutive ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that binds unfolded/misfolded
    client polypeptides through its substrate-binding domain (SBD) and assists their folding through
    iterative cycles of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD).
    This is the primary molecular function of HSPA8.
