id: A0A087WWA1
gene_symbol: P3R3URF
product_type: PROTEIN
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: Putative uncharacterized protein encoded by P3R3URF locus. Function unknown. May be non-coding
  or encode small peptide. Limited experimental characterization. Predicted to be involved in regulation
  of transcription based on sequence features, but this requires experimental validation.
