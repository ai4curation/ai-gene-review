  label: Homo sapiens
description: Putative uncharacterized protein encoded by P3R3URF locus. Function unknown.
  May be non-coding or encode small peptide. Limited experimental characterization.
  Predicted to be involved in regulation of transcription based on sequence features,
  but this requires experimental validation.
