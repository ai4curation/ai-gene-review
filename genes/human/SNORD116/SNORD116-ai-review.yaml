gene_symbol: SNORD116
product_type: SNORNA
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: SNORD116 is a small nucleolar RNA located in the SNHG14 host gene that plays a critical role in neurodevelopment. Loss of SNORD116 expression is a major contributor to Prader-Willi syndrome, affecting hypothalamic function, cognition, and metabolism.
