description: GPC6 encodes Glypican-6, a GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that functions as a cell surface
  co-receptor for Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways. GPC6 is tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via
  a C-terminal GPI anchor and bears heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains near its C-terminus. In Hedgehog signaling,
  GPC6 binds Hh ligand via its core protein domain and interacts with PTCH1 via its HS chains, promoting Hh-PTCH1 engagement
  at the primary cilium. Upon Hh stimulation, GPC6 translocates into the cilium. GPC6 also binds Wnt5a with high affinity
  (KD ~1.4 nM) and activates non-canonical Wnt signaling through ROR2-DVL pathways, promoting JNK and p38 MAPK activation.
  The protein plays essential roles in skeletal development and endochondral ossification, and biallelic loss-of-function
  mutations cause autosomal recessive omodysplasia type 1 (OMOD1), characterized by rhizomelic limb shortening and craniofacial
  abnormalities. GPC6 also regulates intestinal elongation by coordinating Hh and non-canonical Wnt signaling. In cancer cells,
  NFAT-induced GPC6 expression promotes invasive migration through Wnt5A signaling.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from glypican family orthologs. Supported by direct experimental
      evidence showing GPC6 promotes breast cancer cell invasive migration through Wnt5A signaling (PMID:21871017). Gpc6-null
      mice also show reduced mesenchymal proliferation during intestinal development.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cell migration is a well-documented function of GPC6. PMID:21871017 demonstrates that GPC6 promotes invasive migration
      in breast cancer cells, and silencing GPC6 with shRNA potently blocks this phenotype. The IBA annotation is consistent
      with experimental evidence.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation suggesting GPC6 localizes to extracellular matrix based on phylogenetic inference. However, GPC6
      is primarily a GPI-anchored cell surface proteoglycan. While HSPGs can interact with ECM components, the primary localization
      is the plasma membrane cell surface.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GPC6 is a GPI-anchored protein localized to the cell surface/plasma membrane, not the extracellular matrix proper.
      UniProt describes it as "Cell membrane; Lipid-anchor, GPI-anchor; Extracellular side." A more accurate annotation would
      be cell surface (GO:0009986) which is already present as an IBA annotation.

    label: regulation of neurotransmitter receptor localization to postsynaptic specialization membrane
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference. While glypicans are expressed in neural tissues and some family members
      (particularly GPC4) have documented synaptic roles, specific evidence for GPC6 in neurotransmitter receptor localization
      is limited. GPC6 expression in the brain is relatively low compared to other tissues.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IBA inference may reflect a conserved glypican family function, but GPC6-specific evidence for synaptic receptor
      localization is lacking. The core functions of GPC6 are in Hedgehog and Wnt signaling for skeletal and intestinal development.
      UniProt notes that GPC6 is "not detected in peripheral blood leukocytes" and is most abundant in ovary, liver, kidney,
      small intestine and colon.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While the IBA inference may be valid based on family conservation, GPC6-specific synaptic localization is not
      strongly supported. GPC6 core functions are in Hedgehog/Wnt signaling for skeletal and intestinal development. The synapse
      localization may be a minor or tissue-specific function.

  description: GPC6 functions as a cell surface co-receptor for Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways. It binds Hh ligand
    via its core protein domain and interacts with PTCH1 via its heparan sulfate chains, promoting Hh-PTCH1 engagement at
