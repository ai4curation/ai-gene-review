## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9Y625
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Glypican-6; Contains: RecName: Full=Secreted glypican-6; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GPC6; ORFNames=UNQ369/PRO705;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glypican family. .
- **Key Domains:** Glypican. (IPR001863); Glypican_CS. (IPR019803); Glypican (PF01153)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GPC6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GPC6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GPC6** (gene ID: GPC6, UniProt: Q9Y625) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification. We verified the target: human GPC6 (UniProt Q9Y625) encodes glypican‑6, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)‑anchored heparan‑sulfate (HS) proteoglycan of the glypican family (GPC1–GPC6), localized at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane; glypicans feature a compact core with conserved cysteines and HS attachment sites near the C‑terminus, with potential furin-like cleavage and shedding yielding soluble forms (Nov 2023) (xie2023globalimpactof pages 2-4). We next assembled pathway- and disease-level evidence, prioritized 2023–2024 studies, extracted quantitative details, and compiled an artifact table to embed in this report.

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains. GPC6 is a cell‑surface HS proteoglycan tethered by a GPI anchor; glypicans have ≈14 conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds and HS chains usually clustered near the C‑terminus. Glypicans can be processed by furin-like convertases and shed, creating soluble/secreted forms that retain regulatory activity (Nov 2023; review) (xie2023globalimpactof pages 2-4).
- Cellular localization. GPC6 resides at the plasma membrane and, in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling contexts, can be recruited to the primary cilium where Hh signaling is initiated (Sep 2017) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72). Biochemical detections of core vs glycanated forms and medium-associated species support membrane anchoring with potential shedding (Jun 2020) (shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 11-16).
- Post-translational modification. HS glycosaminoglycan chains on GPC6 facilitate binding and stabilization of ligand–receptor complexes, modulating morphogen gradients and signaling (Nov 2023) (xie2023globalimpactof pages 2-4).

Function and pathways (precise roles)
- Hedgehog signaling. GPC6 stimulates Hh signaling in the growth plate. In Gpc6−/− mouse embryos, Hh pathway readouts are reduced in long bones, and GPC6 binds Hh ligand via its core and interacts with PTCH1 via its HS chains, promoting Hh–PTCH1 engagement at the primary cilium. Upon Hh addition, GPC6 translocates into the cilium (Sep 2017). These data mechanistically link GPC6 to Hh pathway activation and endochondral ossification (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72).
- Non‑canonical Wnt signaling. Purified GPC6 binds Wnt5a with high affinity by surface plasmon resonance (SPR): ka ≈ 4.65×10^5 M−1s−1 and kd ≈ 6.82×10−4 s−1 (KD ≈ 1.4 nM). A ΔGAG variant altered binding kinetics, highlighting contribution of GAG chains. Cell and tissue proximity ligation assays demonstrated GPC6 proximity to PTCH1 and EGFR, and cell assays monitored non-canonical Wnt components (Ror2, Dvl3), supporting a role for GPC6 in Wnt5a/ROR2‑DVL signaling and tissue morphogenesis (Jun 2020) (shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 23-29, shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 11-16).
- Broader glypican context. Glypicans modulate Wnt, Hh, BMP, and growth factor signaling as co‑receptors; while detailed RSPO enhancement is established for other glypicans, the family‑level mechanisms are relevant to GPC6’s HS‑dependent co‑receptor function (Nov 2023) (xie2023globalimpactof pages 2-4).

Experimental evidence in development and tissues
- Skeletal development. Gpc6-null mice display shortened long bones with diminished Hh signaling in growth plates (Sep 2017) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72). During intestinal development, GPC6 regulates intestinal elongation by coordinating Hh and non‑canonical Wnt signaling; Gpc6-null neonates have shortened small intestines with reduced mesenchymal proliferation, and GPC6 directly binds Wnt5a (KD ~1.4 nM) (Jun 2020) (shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 23-29, shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 11-16).

Disease and human genetics (with statistics where available)
- Mendelian disease: autosomal‑recessive omodysplasia (OMOD1). Biallelic loss‑of‑function GPC6 mutations cause OMOD1, characterized by rhizomelic limb shortening and craniofacial anomalies; human genetics established the causal link, and Gpc6-null embryos recapitulate skeletal defects (Jun 2009) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72).
- Common skeletal traits and osteoporosis genetics. GPC6 was prioritized as a determinant at heel eBMD loci in a large UK Biobank GWAS (N≈142,487) that identified 203 loci explaining ~12% variance; functional follow‑up in mice supported a role for GPC6 in bone biology (Sep 2017) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72).
- Osteoarthritis (OA): cellular dysregulation. In 2024, a clinical/ex vivo study measured glypicans and Notum in plasma (25 OA vs 24 controls) and BM‑MSCs (8 OA vs 8 donors) over 21 days. OA BM‑MSCs showed baseline downexpression of GPC6, and during osteogenic differentiation GPC6 mRNA increased in OA cells; plasma alterations mainly implicated GPC5 and Notum (May 2024). These data connect GPC6 dysregulation to OA‑related osteogenic responses (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).

Recent developments and applications (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Cardiovascular biomarker exploration. A 2023 prospective ED study (65 HF patients, 20 controls) reported serum GPC6 discriminated HF with 58.46% sensitivity and 75% specificity at 390 pg/mL; combining GPC6 with NT‑proBNP improved classification (Sep 2023) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).
- Colorectal cancer ctDNA methylation (MRD). A 2024 clinical assay (AMUSE) using methylated promoter regions of FGD5, GPC6, and MSC detected postoperative minimal residual disease in stage III CRC. Among 28 recurrent and 19 recurrence‑free patients, sensitivity was 78.6% and specificity 89.5%; recurrence was detected a median ~208 days before radiologic diagnosis (Mar 2024) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and context
- An iScience 2023 review highlights glypicans (including GPC6) as GPI‑anchored HS proteoglycans that act as co‑receptors in Wnt, Hh, and BMP signaling and are relevant to development and disease, with HS chains stabilizing ligand–receptor complexes (Nov 2023) (xie2023globalimpactof pages 2-4).

Relevant statistics and data
- Wnt5a–GPC6 binding: KD ≈ 1.4 nM, ka ≈ 4.65×10^5 M−1s−1, kd ≈ 6.82×10−4 s−1 (SPR; triplicate) (Jun 2020) (shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 11-16).
- UK Biobank heel‑eBMD GWAS: N ≈ 142,487; 203 loci; total variance explained ≈ 12%; GPC6 implicated and functionally supported (Sep 2017) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72).
- OA cohorts: plasma 25 OA vs 24 controls; BM‑MSCs 8 OA vs 8 donors; baseline GPC6 downexpression in OA BM‑MSCs; osteogenic differentiation increased GPC6 mRNA in OA (May 2024) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).
- HF biomarker performance: GPC6 sensitivity 58.46%, specificity 75% at 390 pg/mL; NT‑proBNP sensitivity 89.23%, specificity 70% at 122 pg/mL; N=65 HF, 20 controls (Sep 2023) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).
- CRC MRD ctDNA assay (AMUSE): sensitivity 78.6% (22/28), specificity 89.5% (17/19), median lead time ~208 days (Mar 2024) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).

Current applications and implementations
- Diagnostic/prognostic exploration: serum GPC6 as adjunct biomarker in HF triage (ED setting) and as part of a methylation ctDNA panel (AMUSE) to monitor MRD in stage III CRC (Sep 2023; Mar 2024) (gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).
- Research tools and models: Gpc6-null mice for skeletal and intestinal development mechanisms; biochemical/PLA assays for Hh and Wnt interactions; BM‑MSC osteogenic differentiation models in OA (2017–2024) (kaurUnknownyearidentificationofnovel pages 69-72, shi2020glypican6stimulatesintestinal pages 11-16, gonzalezguede2024dysregulationofglypicans pages 1-2).
