  MAP7 (also known as Ensconsin or E-MAP-115) is a microtubule-associated protein predominantly
  expressed in epithelial cells. It functions as a structural adaptor that binds and stabilizes
  microtubules through its N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (MTBD, residues ~59-170), and
  recruits/activates kinesin-1 motors via its C-terminal region. MAP7 promotes kinesin-1-dependent
  plus-end-directed cargo transport while inhibiting kinesin-3 and having minimal effect on dynein.
  By competing with tau for lattice occupancy, MAP7 shapes the local microtubule environment to
  favor specific motor transport. It plays important roles in epithelial cell polarization,
  microtubule cytoskeleton organization, and Wnt5a-Dishevelled signaling for cortical polarity.

      MAP7 plays a well-established role in microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The original
      characterization paper (PMID:8408219) demonstrated that MAP7 is a microtubule-stabilizing
      protein important during reorganization of microtubules during polarization and differentiation
      of epithelial cells. Recent structural studies (Adler et al., 2024) confirmed the MTBD binds
      across the lattice beyond a single tubulin dimer.

      While MAP7 can localize to axons and affect axonal transport, its primary and original

      MAP7's C-terminal region binds and recruits kinesin-1 to microtubules, promoting
      plus-end-directed cargo transport. This distinguishes MAP7 from other MAPs and underlies
      its role in intracellular transport regulation.

      MAP7 provides structural support to microtubules by binding and stabilizing them against
      depolymerization (e.g., resistance to nocodazole). This is a core activity of the protein.
