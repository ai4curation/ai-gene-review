## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q14244
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ensconsin; AltName: Full=Epithelial microtubule-associated protein of 115 kDa; Short=E-MAP-115; AltName: Full=Microtubule-associated protein 7; Short=MAP-7;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MAP7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MAP7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** MAP7_domain-containing. (IPR051483); MAP7_fam. (IPR008604); MAP7 (PF05672)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MAP7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MAP7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MAP7** (gene ID: MAP7, UniProt: Q14244) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research Plan and Identity Verification
- We verified the target identity: Human MAP7 (gene symbol MAP7; UniProt Q14244) encodes Ensconsin/E-MAP-115, also called microtubule-associated protein 7. Literature consistently uses the synonyms Ensconsin, E-MAP-115, and MAP7 for the human protein, matching the UniProt description and confirming non-ambiguity. MAP7 belongs to the MAP7 family and contains a characteristic N-terminal microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and a C-terminal kinesin-binding region, consistent with MAP7 family/domain annotations. (adler2023resonanceassignmentsof pages 1-2, adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)

Executive Summary
MAP7 is a non-enzymatic, structural/adaptor microtubule-associated protein that binds the microtubule (MT) lattice via an N-terminal, largely alpha-helical MT-binding domain and promotes plus-end–directed cargo transport by recruiting/activating kinesin-1. MAP7 competes with tau for lattice occupancy, thereby shaping motor access: it enhances kinesin-1 engagement while inhibiting kinesin-3 and having little direct effect on dynein. Recent 2023–2024 studies resolved atomic-level features of the MAP7–MT interface and quantified its binding thermodynamics, advancing understanding of how MAP7 stabilizes MTs and modulates motor recruitment. MAP7 also acts in epithelial polarity and Wnt5a–Dishevelled signaling by positioning Dvl and MT plus ends at the cortex through a kinesin-1–dependent mechanism. Dysregulated MAP7 has been linked to several cancer contexts. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2, adler2023resonanceassignmentsof pages 1-2, monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2, monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2, adler2024astructuraland pages 13-14)

Key concepts and definitions
- Protein and domains: MAP7 (Ensconsin/E-MAP-115) is a human microtubule-associated protein with an N-terminal MTBD of ~112 residues (approx. 59–170) that is predominantly alpha-helical with a short hinge, and a C-terminal region that binds kinesin-1. This architecture underlies dual functions in MT binding/stabilization and kinesin-1 recruitment. Publication: Adler et al., Biomolecular NMR Assignments, April 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-023-10124-8. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2023resonanceassignmentsof pages 1-2, adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)
- Primary molecular role: MAP7 is a structural regulator/adaptor on MTs that both stabilizes/bundles MTs and recruits/activates kinesin-1 to the lattice to promote plus-end–directed transport. It is not an enzyme or transporter; instead, it modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and motor access. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)
- Motor-class specificity: MAP7 promotes kinesin-1 recruitment/landing and can inhibit kinesin-3 while having minimal direct effect on cytoplasmic dynein, defining a MAP-based code that biases motor traffic. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2, monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4)

Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Atomic-level interface on MTs: A 2024 structural study combined solution/solid-state NMR, electron microscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry to map how the MTBD engages the MT lattice. The MTBD is a long alpha-helix with a short hinge and binds across more than one tubulin dimer, with contributions from the negatively charged tubulin C-terminal tails. ITC reported KD ~0.94 µM for MAP7 MTBD with MTs and ~0.5 stoichiometry per tubulin tetramer context, supporting tight but reversible binding. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2, adler2024astructuraland pages 13-14)
- NMR assignments of MTBD in solution: Preceding the 2024 work, a 2023 NMR assignment paper showed the isolated MTBD is primarily alpha-helical with a central helix interrupted by a flexible four-residue hinge—informing subsequent structural interpretation on lattices. Publication: Adler et al., Biomolecular NMR Assignments, April 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-023-10124-8. (adler2023resonanceassignmentsof pages 1-2)
- Mechanistic impact on motor recruitment: Foundational single-molecule transport work quantified that MAP7 increases kinesin-1 landing rates by ~15-fold and decreases Km for MTs (KmMT from ~1.46 ± 0.21 µM to ~0.27 ± 0.04 µM for K560), modestly slowing velocity and slightly increasing processivity—consistent with a role in recruiting and tuning motor engagement. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4)
- MAP competition on the lattice: MAP7 displaces tau from MTs owing to higher affinity and longer dwell times (KD ~0.46 µM for MAP7 vs ~1.56 µM for tau; dwell ~82 s vs ~1.9 s), revealing how MAP7 can locally reprogram motor access by remodeling MAP occupancy. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)

Subcellular localization and cellular processes
- Localization: MAP7 decorates the MT lattice in diverse cells, including neurons and epithelia; in response to Wnt5a signaling, MAP7/MAP7D1–kinesin-1 complexes traffic toward MT plus ends and enrich Dishevelled (Dvl) at the cortex, supporting polarized epithelial organization. Publication: Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, June 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471. (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)
- Neuronal roles: Through tau competition and strong promotion of kinesin-1 microtubule engagement, MAP7 biases axonal transport toward kinesin-driven movement and has been implicated in axonal branching phenotypes when overexpressed. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4)
- Mitosis and spindle function: Structural and biophysical work notes roles for MAP7 family members in MT stabilization and spindle organization; 2024 structural data add mechanistic clarity to how the MTBD stabilizes the lattice through multi-dimer interactions and C-terminal tail contacts—features relevant to spindle microtubule stability. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)
- Epithelial polarity and Wnt5a–Dvl pathway: MAP7/MAP7D1 bind Dvl, promote Dvl cortical localization, and facilitate plus-end targeting of MTs via KIF5B, forming a feedback loop where Wnt5a also drives MAP7/7D1 movement to plus ends; Dishevelled stabilizes MAP7/7D1 in turn. Publication: Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, June 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471. (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)

Structural basis of function and motor specificity
- MTBD conformation and binding site: The MTBD is predominantly alpha-helical with a hinge and binds across the lattice beyond a single heterodimer, leveraging interactions with tubulin C-terminal tails; multiple datasets (NMR, EM, cryo-EM maps and models) underpin this view in 2023–2024. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. Publication: Adler et al., Biomolecular NMR Assignments, April 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12104-023-10124-8. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2, adler2024astructuraland pages 13-14, adler2023resonanceassignmentsof pages 1-2)
- Kinesin-1 recruitment and tuning: Single-molecule assays demonstrate that MAP7 increases kinesin-1 landing rates ~15-fold and decreases KmMT, reduces velocity modestly, and increases processivity slightly; MAP7’s negatively charged C-terminus contributes to displacing tau, further favoring kinesin-1 access. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4, monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)
- Specificity across motor classes: In vitro reconstitution indicates that MAP7 promotes kinesin-1, inhibits kinesin-3, and has little effect on dynein, highlighting a MAP-based mechanism that partitions motor traffic. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Reconstitution and mechanistic measurements: MAP7 is used in in vitro reconstitution systems to tune kinesin-1 motility parameters and to model MAP competition with tau, informing transport biases in axons. Quantitative parameters (landing rate increases, KD values, dwell times) enable model calibration for intracellular transport. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4, adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)
- Structural datasets for design: Cryo-EM maps and NMR assignments deposited by 2023–2024 studies provide resources for computational modeling of MAP7–MT binding and for designing mutants that test motor recruitment hypotheses. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 13-14)
- Cell polarity systems: In epithelial cell models, MAP7/7D1–KIF5B–Dvl modules are used to interrogate Wnt5a-driven planar polarity and cortical MT remodeling, offering a system-level handle on cytoskeletal signaling crosstalk. Publication: Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, June 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471. (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Structural biophysics view: The 2024 Nature Communications study emphasizes that MAP7’s interaction area extends beyond a single tubulin dimer and involves C-terminal tubulin tails, suggesting why MAP7 can stabilize the lattice and persist on MTs to shape motor access over long dwell times—consistent with a high-affinity, high-dwell MAP that reprograms lattice occupancy. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)
- Transport regulation principle: The 2018 Nature Communications study frames a general principle that competition among non-motor MAPs (MAP7 vs tau) dictates access of motors to the MT lattice, thereby directing the balance of transport (kinesin-1 vs kinesin-3 vs dynein). Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)
- Cytoskeletal signaling integration: MAP7/7D1 engagement with Dvl and kinesin-1 places MAP7 at the intersection of cytoskeletal dynamics and Wnt signaling, linking cortical polarity to motor-driven MT plus-end targeting. Publication: Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, June 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471. (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)

Statistics and quantitative data from recent studies

Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 1-2)
- Motor recruitment metrics: MAP7 increases K560 (kinesin-1) landing rate ~15-fold; lowers KmMT (1.46 ± 0.21 µM to 0.27 ± 0.04 µM); slightly increases processivity (~874 to ~984 nm) and decreases velocity (~434 to ~328 nm/s). Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 3-4)
- MAP competition: Affinity and dwell-time differences vs tau (MAP7 KD ~0.46 µM; dwell ~82.3 s) explain effective displacement of tau (KD ~1.56 µM; dwell ~1.9 s), reprogramming the local lattice. Publication: Monroy et al., Nature Communications, August 2018; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03909-2. (monroy2018competitionbetweenmicrotubuleassociated pages 1-2)

Disease associations
- Cancer links: The 2024 structural study’s discussion collates reports of MAP7 upregulation and associations with disease phenotypes (e.g., progression or prognosis in certain cancers and drug-response modulation), underscoring active investigation into MAP7 as a biomarker or modulator of chemoresponse. Publication: Adler et al., Nature Communications, March 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46260-5. (adler2024astructuraland pages 13-14)

Limitations and open questions
- While structural insights into the MTBD (2023–2024) are strong, higher-resolution mapping of the kinesin-1–interacting C-terminal region on the motor and its dynamics on the lattice in human systems remains a priority. How MAP7 integration with other MAPs (beyond tau) and PTM codes regulates selectivity for different kinesins in vivo is an active area of research.

Conclusion
Human MAP7 (Ensconsin/E-MAP-115) is a MAP7-family, MAP7-domain protein whose N-terminal alpha-helical MTBD binds and stabilizes the microtubule lattice and whose C-terminus recruits/tunes kinesin-1. By competing with tau and biasing motor access, MAP7 enhances kinesin-1 transport while inhibiting kinesin-3 and sparing dynein. Recent 2023–2024 structural biophysics established the MTBD’s helical lattice-binding mode and quantified MAP7–MT thermodynamics, refining mechanistic models of transport regulation, spindle stability, and epithelial polarity signaling. Disease links, especially in cancer, are emerging from expression/prognostic observations and merit further mechanistic study.
