description: Dual-function protein that acts both as a cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase
  (cPGES) catalyzing the isomerization of PGH2 to PGE2, and as an HSP90 co-chaperone
  (p23) that stabilizes the HSP90-client protein complex in the ATP-bound conformation.
  As part of the HSP90 chaperone machinery, PTGES3 participates in the maturation and
  stabilization of steroid hormone receptors, telomerase, and other HSP90 client proteins.
  It also localizes to genomic response elements and promotes disassembly of transcriptional
  regulatory complexes. Contains a CS domain (CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1 domain)
  in the N-terminal region and an unstructured acidic C-terminal tail important for its
  chaperone function.

      IBA annotation of PTGES3 to nucleus (GO:0005634) is phylogenetically inferred.
      PTGES3/p23 is predominantly cytoplasmic/cytosolic, but has been shown to localize
      to the nucleus, particularly when translocating with HSP90-client complexes such
      as steroid hormone receptors (PMID:12077419). Reactome documents multiple nuclear
      events involving PTGES3 (e.g., R-HSA-5618080 HSP90:ATP:p23:FKBP52:SHR:SH translocates
      to the nucleus). The HDA annotation from PMID:21630459 also detected PTGES3 in
      sperm nuclei by mass spectrometry.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is well supported. PTGES3 translocates to the nucleus as part
      of HSP90-steroid receptor complexes and also localizes to genomic response elements
      in a hormone-dependent manner (PMID:12077419). Multiple Reactome pathways place PTGES3
      in the nucleoplasm. The IBA annotation at the level of nucleus is appropriate.

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:12077419
  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is annotated to PTGES3 based on PMID:12077419
      (Freeman & Yamamoto, 2002), which demonstrated that p23 acts as a molecular chaperone
      that localizes to genomic response elements and promotes disassembly of transcriptional
      regulatory complexes. However, this paper does not directly demonstrate binding to
      unfolded proteins. The paper shows that p23 disrupts receptor-mediated transcriptional
      activation by promoting disassembly of multicomponent regulatory complexes, functioning
      as an HSP90 co-chaperone rather than independently binding unfolded substrates.
      Separate evidence from PMID:10543959 (Weikl et al., 1999) does demonstrate that p23
      has independent chaperone activity, showing that it "interacts specifically with
      non-native proteins" and prevents "non-specific aggregation." PMID:10811660 (Weaver
      et al., 2000) also confirmed the "passive chaperoning activity of p23 in assays
      measuring inhibition of heat-induced protein aggregation." However, this holdase-type
      activity is secondary to p23's primary role as an HSP90 co-chaperone, and the cited
      reference PMID:12077419 does not support "unfolded protein binding" as such.
      Furthermore, GO:0051082 is being obsoleted (go-ontology issue 30962) in favor of
      more specific terms such as GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone." Given that PTGES3
      already has annotations for Hsp90 protein binding (GO:0051879), protein folding
      (GO:0006457), protein-folding chaperone binding (GO:0051087), and membership in a
      protein folding chaperone complex (GO:0101031), the core chaperone functions are
      well-captured by existing annotations. The independent holdase activity demonstrated
      in PMID:10543959 and PMID:10811660 could be better represented by GO:0044183 "protein
      folding chaperone" if needed, but the current annotation to GO:0051082 based on
      PMID:12077419 is a misattribution of the cited evidence.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      The GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" annotation should be marked as
      over-annotated for three reasons. First, the cited reference PMID:12077419 does not
      demonstrate unfolded protein binding; it shows p23 promotes disassembly of
      transcriptional regulatory complexes as part of the HSP90 chaperone system.
      Second, while p23 does have a modest independent holdase-type chaperone activity
      preventing aggregation of non-native proteins (demonstrated in PMID:10543959 and
      PMID:10811660), this is secondary to its primary role as an HSP90 co-chaperone and
      is not the activity described in the cited reference. Third, GO:0051082 is being
      obsoleted (go-ontology issue 30962) because it conflates binding with chaperone
      activity. The core chaperone functions of PTGES3 are already well-represented by
      existing annotations to GO:0051879 (Hsp90 protein binding), GO:0006457 (protein
      folding), GO:0051087 (protein-folding chaperone binding), and GO:0101031 (protein
      folding chaperone complex). If the independent holdase activity needs representation,
      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" would be more appropriate than the
      soon-to-be-obsoleted GO:0051082.

      IDA annotation for telomerase activity from Chang et al. (PMID:12135483). The study
      identified p23 as one of six telomerase subunits and showed that antisense treatment
      against p23 abolished telomerase activity. However, PTGES3 does not itself have
      telomerase catalytic activity; hTERT is the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit.
      PTGES3 is a non-catalytic component of the holoenzyme complex.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0003720 (telomerase activity) implies catalytic reverse transcriptase activity,
      which is performed by hTERT, not by PTGES3/p23. PTGES3 is a structural/regulatory
      component of the telomerase holoenzyme, required for its assembly and activity, but
      does not contribute the catalytic function itself. The role of PTGES3 is better
      described by the existing annotations to telomerase holoenzyme complex assembly
      (GO:1905323) and telomerase holoenzyme complex (GO:0005697). Annotating PTGES3 to
      telomerase activity is an over-attribution of catalytic function to a non-catalytic
      subunit.

      TAS annotation for signal transduction from Johnson et al. (PMID:8114727), the
      original characterization of p23 as a component of unactive progesterone receptor

      through its association with steroid receptor complexes.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      PTGES3 participates in signal transduction indirectly through its role as an HSP90
      co-chaperone in steroid receptor maturation. However, signal transduction is very
      broad and PTGES3 is not a signaling molecule itself; it is a chaperone/enzyme.
      The annotation is not wrong but represents a downstream biological consequence
      rather than a core function. The specific chaperone functions (protein folding,
      chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly) better capture its role.
