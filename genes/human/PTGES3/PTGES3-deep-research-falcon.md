## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q15185
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Prostaglandin E synthase 3; EC=5.3.99.3 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10922363}; AltName: Full=Cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase; Short=cPGES; AltName: Full=Hsp90 co-chaperone; AltName: Full=Progesterone receptor complex p23; AltName: Full=Telomerase-binding protein p23;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PTGES3; Synonyms=P23, TEBP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).

- **Key Domains:** CS_dom. (IPR007052); HSP20-like_chaperone. (IPR008978); p23-like. (IPR045250); CS (PF04969)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PTGES3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PTGES3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PTGES3** (gene ID: PTGES3, UniProt: Q15185) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Report — Human PTGES3 (UniProt Q15185; p23/cPGES)

1. Target verification and nomenclature
Human PTGES3 encodes a 160-aa (~18.7 kDa) protein with UniProtKB accession Q15185, commonly referred to as p23 and also annotated as cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase (cPGES). (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 2-4, biringer2018theenzymesof media c64a4d06)
PTGES3/p23 belongs to the p23/WOS2 family and is described as a monomeric, glutathione-dependent cytosolic protein with an available structure (PDB 1EJF). (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6)
This target is distinct from PTGES (mPGES-1; inducible/microsomal) and PTGES2 (mPGES-2). PTGES3 is among glutathione-requiring PGE synthase isoforms. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 5-6)

2. Key concepts and current understanding (definitions and primary functions)
2.1 Enzymatic function in prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis (cPGES activity)
PTGES3/cPGES is annotated to catalyze the isomerization/conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2): PGH2 → PGE2. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 2-4, biringer2018theenzymesof media c64a4d06)
PTGES3 is described as glutathione-dependent in this enzymatic role. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 5-6)
Functional channeling/coupling is reported between PTGES3 and cyclooxygenase-1 (PTGS1/COX-1), with PGH2 generated by PTGS1 stated to be preferred for PTGES3-mediated PGE2 production and with PTGES3/PTGS1 coupling reported. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-8)

Interpretation: In current pathway models, PTGES3 functions as a constitutive, cytosolic PGE2 synthase whose activity can be shaped by cellular compartmentation and COX coupling, particularly favoring COX-1-derived PGH2 under certain contexts. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-8)

2.2 Non-enzymatic function as an HSP90 co-chaperone (p23)
PTGES3 is explicitly identified as the co-chaperone p23 in authoritative HSP90 machinery literature. (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3)
Mechanistically, p23 stabilizes an HSP90 closed conformational state (often referred to as “closed 2”) and inhibits/reduces HSP90 ATPase activity, thereby regulating progression of the HSP90 chaperone cycle. (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3, schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 3-4)
A 2024 review reiterates that PTGES3/p23 slows the HSP90 ATPase cycle by stabilizing the closed ATP-committed conformation. (albakova2024hsp90multifunctionalityin pages 1-2)

Interpretation: p23 is widely viewed as a late-stage HSP90 cycle regulator that biases HSP90 toward an ATP-bound closed state and modulates client maturation/release, consistent with its broad effects on the activity of many HSP90 clients. (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3, schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 3-4, albakova2024hsp90multifunctionalityin pages 1-2)

3. Subcellular localization and molecular complexes
3.1 Cytosolic localization and constitutive roles
PTGES3 is described as cytosolic/cytoplasmic in enzymatic and chaperone contexts. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6)

3.2 Nuclear translocation and transcriptional roles (context-dependent)
A 2023 Science Advances study reports prominent nuclear localization of p23/PTGES3 in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and demonstrates that p23 can act as an HSP90-independent transcription factor for COX-2 (PTGS2), with nuclear localization driven by succinate-dependent lysine succinylation (K7, K33, K79). (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2)
The same study reports that >90% of tumor tissues exhibited nuclear p23 expression compared with ~5% in adjacent tissues, connecting localization with clinical tumor context. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 2-3)

3.3 Client complexes and interaction partners
HSP90 co-chaperone role: p23/PTGES3 binds HSP90 and stabilizes closed states, regulating ATPase cycling. (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3, schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 3-4)
Eicosanoid pathway coupling: functional coupling to PTGS1/COX-1 is reported for efficient use of PTGS1-derived PGH2. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-8)
Steroid receptor/telomerase complexes: p23 is described as stabilizing HSP90 complexes with clients including estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and telomerase. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2)
Transcription factors/receptors (HSP90-independent interactions in cancer literature synthesis): PTGES3/p23 is described as interacting with transcription factor p53 independently of HSP90 and protecting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor from degradation. (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 12-13)

4. Pathway context
4.1 Prostaglandin biosynthesis
PTGES3 participates in the downstream prostanoid pathway by converting COX-derived PGH2 into PGE2. (biringer2018theenzymesof media c64a4d06, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 2-4)
PTGES3 is framed as a constitutive PGE2 synthase, in contrast to inducible microsomal PTGES (mPGES-1). (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 12-13, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 5-6)

4.2 Proteostasis and HSP90 client regulation
Within the HSP90 chaperone system, p23/PTGES3 is positioned as a co-chaperone that stabilizes the closed state and inhibits ATPase, shaping the HSP90 reaction cycle and affecting client maturation (including steroid receptor complexes). (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3, schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 3-4, albakova2024hsp90multifunctionalityin pages 1-2)

4.3 Cancer-associated metabolic–transcriptional axis (succinate–p23–COX-2)
In lung adenocarcinoma, intratumor succinate is reported to promote p23 succinylation that drives nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of COX-2 (PTGS2), linking PTGES3 to inflammatory signaling pathways and tumorigenesis via COX-2 induction. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2)

5. Recent developments (prioritized 2023–2024)
5.1 2023: p23/PTGES3 as an HSP90-independent transcription factor and druggable PTM axis
The 2023 Science Advances work reports a previously unidentified role for nuclear p23 as a transcription factor for COX-2, driven by succinate-induced succinylation at K7/K33/K79; the authors also report identification of a small-molecule inhibitor (M16) that inhibits p23 succinylation/nuclear translocation and suppresses tumor growth in a p23-dependent manner. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2)

5.2 2024: review-level synthesis of mechanistic placement in the HSP90 cycle
A 2024 review reiterates the mechanistic role of PTGES3/p23 in slowing the HSP90 ATPase cycle by stabilizing the closed ATP-committed conformation, emphasizing its function as a co-chaperone regulator of HSP90 conformational dynamics. (albakova2024hsp90multifunctionalityin pages 1-2)

6. Current applications and real-world implementations
6.1 Biomarker associations in oncology (research/translation)
A 2023 pan-cancer analysis reports that PTGES3 expression is upregulated in many cancers and associates with survival endpoints in multiple tumor types; in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), higher PTGES3 expression is reported to associate with worse survival and was validated as higher PTGES3 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 1-2, wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 9-11)
The same analysis reports PTGES3 association with immune infiltration patterns (for example, positive association with Th2 and MDSC signatures and negative association with Th1/NKT signatures in some analyses) and co-expression with immune checkpoint genes across cancers. (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 4-9)

6.2 Therapeutic hypotheses/targeting approaches
Mechanism-based targeting of p23/PTGES3 is supported by (i) small-molecule inhibition of succinylation-dependent nuclear p23 function in lung adenocarcinoma (M16) and (ii) literature synthesis noting that certain small molecules (e.g., gedunin) can bind p23 and block function in malignant cells (as discussed in the HCC/pan-cancer synthesis). (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2, wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 12-13)

6.3 Cardiovascular risk stratification (genetics)
In nephrosclerosis patients, PTGES3 tag-SNPs were evaluated as part of a COX/PGE2-pathway genetic risk model for cardiovascular events, suggesting potential use in refined risk prediction models (research-stage application). (gonzalez2023influenceofvariability pages 1-2, gonzalez2023influenceofvariability pages 2-3)

7. Quantitative data and statistics (recent studies)
7.1 Protein/structure metrics
PTGES3/cPGES is reported as 160 aa (~18.7 kDa) and has a solved structure (PDB 1EJF); a pathway table explicitly maps cPGES to UniProt Q15185 and the reaction PGH2→PGE2. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 2-4, biringer2018theenzymesof media c64a4d06)

7.2 Nuclear localization prevalence in lung adenocarcinoma (2023)
In lung adenocarcinoma tissue, nuclear p23 expression was reported in >90% of tumor tissues versus ~5% of adjacent tissues. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 2-3)

7.3 Cardiovascular outcomes genetics (Scientific Reports, 2023)
In a cohort of 493 nephrosclerosis patients (716 controls) followed for a median of 47 months with 41 cardiovascular events (8.3%), PTGES3 rs2958155 and rs11300958 were associated with cardiovascular event–free survival in adjusted Cox models (HR 2.41 (1.15–5.04), p=0.02 for rs2958155; HR 2.20 (1.16–4.18), p=0.016 for rs11300958). (gonzalez2023influenceofvariability pages 2-3, gonzalez2023influenceofvariability pages 1-2)
Adding variants including these two PTGES3 SNPs to a traditional risk-factor model increased AUC from 78.6% to 87.4% (p=0.0003) in the patient group and from 84.7% to 87.3% (p=0.031) in the full cohort analysis. (gonzalez2023influenceofvariability pages 2-3)

7.4 Pan-cancer outcomes and drug association statistics (Frontiers in Oncology, 2023)
A Cox-model association reported PTGES3 with overall survival in several cancers, including a reported hazard ratio of 5.131 for KIRP in the pan-cancer Cox analysis excerpt. (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 4-9)
Drug-sensitivity analyses described 11 top drugs with PTGES3-associated IC50 relationships; TGX221 and NPK76-II-72-1 were reported with correlations >0.2, and 106 drugs were reported as differing between high- and low-PTGES3 HCC groups in one comparison. (wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 4-9, wang2023comprehensivepancanceranalysis pages 3-4)

8. Expert interpretation and synthesis (authoritative perspectives)
8.1 Dual functional annotation is supported but context-dependent
An eicosanoid-pathway synthesis explicitly describes PTGES3 as a glutathione-dependent cytosolic PGE2 synthase and also notes its distinct (non-enzymatic) HSP90 co-chaperone functions, indicating that PTGES3 is commonly annotated as a bifunctional protein (enzyme + co-chaperone). (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6)
8.2 Mechanistic consensus on HSP90 regulation
High-authority HSP90 chaperone machinery literature positions p23/PTGES3 as a co-chaperone that stabilizes the HSP90 closed 2 state and inhibits HSP90 ATPase activity, and a 2024 review concurs with this conceptual placement. (schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 2-3, schopf2017thehsp90chaperone pages 3-4, albakova2024hsp90multifunctionalityin pages 1-2)
8.3 Emerging view: p23 can directly regulate transcription in cancer
The 2023 Science Advances study provides mechanistic evidence supporting a model in which post-translational modification (succinylation) triggers nuclear translocation and enables p23/PTGES3 to function as a COX-2 transcription factor, expanding PTGES3 functional annotation beyond its traditional enzyme/co-chaperone roles in a tumor-metabolic context. (yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 1-2, yu2023thep23cochaperone pages 3-4)

9. Limitations and evidence gaps relevant to functional annotation
While the reaction PGH2→PGE2 and glutathione dependence are explicitly documented for PTGES3/cPGES in curated pathway summaries, the retrieved evidence here does not provide detailed enzymatic kinetics (Km/kcat), residue-level substrate specificity beyond PGH2, or conditions determining relative contributions versus other PGE synthases in specific human tissues. (biringer2018theenzymesof pages 2-4, biringer2018theenzymesof pages 6-6)
Similarly, although nuclear transcription-factor function is well-supported in a lung adenocarcinoma context, it remains unclear from the provided evidence how broadly this mechanism generalizes across normal tissues or other disease settings.
