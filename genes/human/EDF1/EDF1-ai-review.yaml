description: 'EDF1 (Endothelial Differentiation-related Factor 1), also known as Multiprotein
  Bridging Factor 1 (MBF1), is a small (~16 kDa) evolutionarily conserved transcriptional
  coactivator. The protein acts as a molecular bridge between gene-specific transcription
  factors (including nuclear receptors NR5A1, NR1H3/LXRa, PPARg, and bZIP factors
  ATF1, ATF2, CREB1) and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) component of the general transcription
  machinery. EDF1 contains an N-terminal MBF1 domain with an IQ motif for calmodulin
  binding and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. Recent work
  has revealed a second major function: EDF1 is recruited to collided ribosomes where
  it coordinates ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) by recruiting the GIGYF2-eIF4E2
  translational repressor complex, and it is required for robust activation of the
  GCN2-mediated integrated stress response (ISR). In endothelial cells, cytoplasmic
  EDF1 sequesters calmodulin to regulate nitric oxide synthase activity. Subcellular
  localization is dynamic, with phosphorylation by PKA promoting nuclear accumulation.

    id: GO:0003713
    label: transcription coactivator activity
  description: EDF1 is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional coactivator that
    bridges gene-specific transcription factors (nuclear receptors NR5A1, NR1H3, PPARg;
    bZIP factors ATF1, ATF2, CREB1) to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) component of
    the general transcription machinery [PMID:10567391, PMID:12040021].
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0005516
    label: calmodulin binding
  description: EDF1 contains an IQ motif that mediates calcium- and phosphorylation-dependent
    binding to calmodulin. This regulates eNOS activity in endothelial cells by sequestering
    calmodulin in the cytoplasm [PMID:10816571, PMID:15112053].
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0001094
    label: TFIID-class transcription factor complex binding
  description: Direct binding to TBP and the TFIID complex is central to EDF1's bridging
    function between activators and the basal transcription machinery [PMID:10567391,
    PMID:12040021].
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0003723
    label: RNA binding
  description: EDF1 was identified as an mRNA-binding protein in two independent proteomics
    studies [PMID:22658674, PMID:22681889]. This is consistent with its role at collided
    ribosomes where structural studies show it contacts mRNA.
