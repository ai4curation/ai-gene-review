description: 'EDF1 (Endothelial Differentiation-related Factor 1), also known as Multiprotein Bridging
  Factor 1 (MBF1), is a small (~16 kDa) evolutionarily conserved transcriptional coactivator. The protein
  acts as a molecular bridge between gene-specific transcription factors (including nuclear receptors
  NR5A1, NR1H3/LXRa, PPARg, and bZIP factors ATF1, ATF2, CREB1) and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) component
  of the general transcription machinery. EDF1 contains an N-terminal MBF1 domain with an IQ motif for
  calmodulin binding and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. Recent work has revealed
  a second major function: EDF1 is recruited to collided ribosomes where it coordinates ribosome-associated
  quality control (RQC) by recruiting the GIGYF2-eIF4E2 translational repressor complex, and it is required
  for robust activation of the GCN2-mediated integrated stress response (ISR). In endothelial cells, cytoplasmic
  EDF1 sequesters calmodulin to regulate nitric oxide synthase activity. Subcellular localization is dynamic,
  with phosphorylation by PKA promoting nuclear accumulation.
