description: >-
  Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a secreted four-alpha-helix bundle cytokine of the IL-4/IL-13 family,
  produced primarily by Th2 cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), with additional
  contributions from mast cells and basophils. IL-13 signals through the type II IL-4 receptor
  (IL-13Ralpha1/IL-4Ralpha heterodimer) to activate JAK1/TYK2 kinases and predominantly STAT6
  transcription factor. It drives hallmark type-2 immune programs including mucus metaplasia
  (goblet cell hyperplasia, MUC5AC induction), IgE class switching (in cooperation with IL-4),
  subepithelial fibrosis, airway smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, and epithelial barrier
  dysregulation. IL-13 also binds IL-13Ralpha2, a high-affinity decoy/scavenger receptor that
  limits signaling. IL-13 is central to the pathogenesis of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and
  eosinophilic esophagitis, and is the target of therapeutic antibodies (tralokinumab, lebrikizumab)
  and the dual IL-4/IL-13 blocker dupilumab.

    summary: >-
      IL-13 cooperates with IL-4 and CD40 signaling to promote immunoglobulin class switching,
      particularly IgE and IgG4 production, in B cells. This is a well-established core function
      of IL-13 supported by multiple primary studies (PMID:7903680, PMID:8096327) and reviews.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      IBA annotation is well-supported. IL-13 is well-documented to promote immunoglobulin
      production, particularly IgE class switching, in cooperation with IL-4. UniProt function
      annotation states IL-13 "stimulates B-cell proliferation" (PMID:7903680). The deep research
      confirms that IL-13 cooperates with IL-4 for IgE biology.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Goblet cell metaplasia driven by IL-13 is one of its most characteristic and well-studied
      functions in the airway. This is a core function of IL-13 in the context of airway
      disease and type-2 immunity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA from BHF-UCL. The cited reference (PMID:20041150, Feng et al. 2009) is about MEFV gene
      mutations in fibromyalgia and IL-1beta levels. The paper measures IL-13 plasma levels as
      one of several cytokines in fibromyalgia patients, but it is primarily about the MEFV gene,
      not IL-13 localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the cited paper is not primarily about IL-13, the fact that IL-13 was measured in
      plasma does provide evidence that it is found in the extracellular region. The annotation
      is technically correct (IL-13 is indeed in the extracellular region), even if the
      supporting reference is incidental. This is also supported by multiple other annotations
      (TAS from Reactome, IBA, IEA, and ISS).

      ISS from UniProt based on mouse IL-13 (P20109). IL-13 is found in the extracellular
      space as a secreted cytokine.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct ISS annotation. IL-13 is a secreted cytokine found in the extracellular space.
      Consistent with IBA and IEA annotations.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TAS from PINC based on the original IL-13 discovery paper. IL-13 regulates inflammatory
      and immune responses.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct TAS annotation. The original paper by Minty et al. (1993) established IL-13 as
      a regulator of inflammatory responses. Redundant with IBA annotation for the same term
      but provides additional evidence support.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: >-
      IL-13 activates mast cells and promotes their degranulation. UniProt states IL-13
      stimulates "activation of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells" (PMID:8759755).
      This term is present in the UniProt GO annotations but was missing from the GOA
      tsv import. Adding for completeness.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      IL-13 promotes mast cell activation and degranulation. UniProt explicitly notes this
      function. This annotation was present in UniProt GO cross-references but not captured
      in the GOA download.

    IL-13 binds the type II IL-4 receptor complex (IL-13Ralpha1/IL-4Ralpha) with sequential
    assembly -- first binding IL-13Ralpha1, then recruiting IL-4Ralpha. Also binds the
    high-affinity decoy receptor IL-13Ralpha2, which mediates ligand clearance. This is the
    primary molecular function of IL-13 as a signaling ligand.
