## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P35225
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-13; Short=IL-13; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL13; Synonyms=NC30;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IL-4/IL-13 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 4_helix_cytokine-like_core. (IPR009079); IL-13. (IPR020470); IL-4/IL-13. (IPR001325); IL-4/IL-13_CS. (IPR018096); IL13 (PF03487)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL13" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL13' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL13** (gene ID: IL13, UniProt: P35225) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human IL13 (UniProt P35225)

Verification of target identity and family/domains
- Identity: Interleukin‑13 (IL‑13) is a secreted type 2 cytokine of the IL‑4/IL‑13 family produced primarily by Th2 cells and ILC2s. It is a prototypical four‑α‑helix bundle (short‑chain) cytokine, consistent with UniProt’s “4_helix_cytokine‑like_core” and IL‑4/IL‑13 family annotations (IPR009079, IPR001325). Multiple recent reviews identify IL‑13 as a four‑helix cytokine central to type‑2 immunity in skin and airways (Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 2-3). Structural/biophysical work in 2023 further characterizes the human IL‑13 four‑helix scaffold and its conformational dynamics (Frontiers in Immunology, Jul 2023) (walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 1-2, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 7-9, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 9-10).

Key concepts and current mechanistic understanding
- Receptors and assembly logic: IL‑13 signals via the type II IL‑4 receptor composed of IL‑13Rα1 and IL‑4Rα. In contrast to IL‑4, IL‑13 first binds IL‑13Rα1 to form a binary complex that then recruits IL‑4Rα to make the signaling‑competent ternary complex. 2023 NMR/biophysical mapping confirms this sequential assembly and shows that IL‑13 has low affinity for IL‑4Rα alone but gains high IL‑4Rα affinity after binding IL‑13Rα1 (Frontiers in Immunology, Jul 2023) (walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 1-2, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 2-3, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 9-10).
- Decoy/scavenger receptor: IL‑13Rα2 binds IL‑13 with very high affinity and often functions as a decoy or scavenger, limiting signaling through the type II receptor; it may also internalize ligand and has been linked to TGF‑β1 induction in some contexts. Selective anti‑IL‑13 antibodies that block IL‑13:IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα signaling do not necessarily displace IL‑13 from IL‑13Rα2, underscoring its scavenger role (JID Innovations, Sep 2023) (tollenaere2023tralokinumabeffectivelydisrupts pages 13-13). Additional AD‑focused reviews concur that IL‑13Rα2 generally acts as a high‑affinity decoy on skin and other tissues (Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 3-4).
- Intracellular signaling: Engagement of the type II receptor activates JAK1/TYK2 and predominantly STAT6, with context‑dependent STAT3/STAT1 activation reported in non‑hematopoietic cells. STAT6‑dependent transcription orchestrates typical type‑2 programs including chemokine induction, mucus metaplasia, and pro‑fibrotic remodeling (Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 2-3).
- Cellular sources and targets: IL‑13 is released by Th2 cells and ILC2, with contributions from mast cells and basophils. Principal target cells include epithelial cells (airway and epidermal keratinocytes), fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, airway smooth muscle, and B cell compartments via synergy with IL‑4 (e.g., class switch support). In skin, IL‑13 reduces barrier proteins (e.g., filaggrin) and antimicrobial peptides, promotes dysbiosis, and contributes to pruritus by sensitizing sensory neurons (Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 3-4, napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 2-3).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Structural/biophysical advances: 2023 NMR studies reveal that free human IL‑13 populates at least two interconverting conformational states, only one of which is receptor‑competent. A single‑domain antibody (VHH204) allosterically stabilizes a receptor‑incompetent conformation and fully inhibits signaling. A 19F‑fragment screen identified the first reported small‑molecule fragment binders to IL‑13, mapping to allosteric pockets that could modulate inter‑helical angles and receptor engagement (Frontiers in Immunology, Jul 2023; DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1216967) (walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 1-2, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 7-9, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 9-10, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 3-5, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 5-5).
- Mechanisms of selective anti‑IL‑13 antibodies: Tralokinumab biophysically disrupts the IL‑13/IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα signaling complex but does not displace IL‑13 from IL‑13Rα2, aligning with α2’s high‑affinity decoy role and influencing ligand clearance (JID Innovations, Sep 2023; DOI: 10.1016/j.xjidi.2023.100214) (tollenaere2023tralokinumabeffectivelydisrupts pages 13-13).
- Regulatory/approval landscape updates: Lebrikizumab (anti‑IL‑13) progressed through global approvals in late 2023; the “Antibodies to Watch 2024” update lists lebrikizumab among first approvals granted in 2023, summarizing pivotal ADvocate trials that met primary endpoints (mAbs, Jan 2024; DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2023.2297450) ().
- Guidelines and pediatric EoE milestone: GINA 2024 recommends dupilumab (IL‑4Rα blockade, inhibiting IL‑4/IL‑13 signaling) for severe pediatric asthma ≥6 years; a 2024 real‑world pediatric cohort mirrors biomarker and lung function improvements (BMC Pulm Med, Dec 2024; DOI: 10.1186/s12890-024-03414-x) (shi2024theassessmentof pages 1-2). For eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), 2024 pediatric updates summarize NEJM evidence extending dupilumab efficacy to children 1–11 years, with long‑term histologic and symptomatic benefits reported across 2022–2024 program parts (Current Treatment Options in Pediatrics, Dec 2024; DOI: 10.1007/s40746-023-00289-8) ().

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Atopic dermatitis (AD): Expert consensus positions IL‑13 as a central driver of barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and dysbiosis in AD, and recommends IL‑13 pathway biologics (dupilumab [IL‑4Rα], tralokinumab/lebrikizumab [IL‑13]) as rapid, durable, and safe systemic options for moderate‑to‑severe disease (Dermatology Online Journal, Sep 2025) (debusk2025theroleof pages 3-4). Real‑world, 52‑week data from China show dupilumab produced sustained improvements with EASI‑75 achieved by 42.7% at week 16 and 41.9% at week 52; adverse events were infrequent and mostly mild (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1419164) (wang2024longtermefficacyand pages 1-2, wang2024longtermefficacyand pages 9-10).
- Asthma: Targeting the IL‑13/IL‑4 axis reduces exacerbations, improves FEV1, and favorably modulates airway structure in subsets. Dupilumab consistently reduced exacerbations and improved FEV1 by ~200–320 mL across phase II/III programs; biomarker‑guided enrichment (e.g., FeNO) enhances IL‑13‑selective antibody signal but broader trials were mixed for IL‑13 monotherapy (Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology, Apr 2025) (sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 15-16, sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 14-15). Adolescent lebrikizumab reduced annualized exacerbation rates by ~40–64% in eosinophil‑high groups in selected trials (Pharmaceuticals, Jul 2025; DOI: 10.3390/ph18071021) (varut2025targetedbiologictherapies pages 18-20). GINA 2024 identifies dupilumab as an add‑on for severe T2 asthma, reflected in pediatric clinical practice (BMC Pulm Med, Dec 2024) (shi2024theassessmentof pages 1-2).
- Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Updates highlight dupilumab’s clinical implementation, including extension to pediatric age groups with histologic and endoscopic improvements sustained over 52 weeks in program parts (Current Treatment Options in Pediatrics, Dec 2024) ().

Expert opinions and authoritative guidance
- Dermatology expert consensus (2025) emphasizes IL‑13‑centric pathogenesis in AD and supports selective IL‑13 inhibitors (lebrikizumab, tralokinumab) and IL‑4Rα blockade (dupilumab) for fast onset, durable control, and favorable safety, including limited infection signal and manageable ocular AEs (Dermatology Online Journal, Sep 2025) (debusk2025theroleof pages 3-4).
- Asthma guidance: Real‑world pediatric analysis cites GINA 2024 recommendations for dupilumab in severe asthma ≥6 years and documents significant improvement in type‑2 biomarkers (tIgE, FeNO) and lung function after 24 weeks (BMC Pulm Med, Dec 2024) (shi2024theassessmentof pages 1-2).

Relevant quantitative statistics and data (2023–2024 priority)
- AD outcomes
  • Lebrikizumab (with topical corticosteroids) at week 16: IGA 0/1 in 41.2% vs 22.1% placebo; EASI‑75 in 69.5% vs 42.2% placebo; common AEs included conjunctivitis (4.8%) and injection‑site reactions (2.8%). Trial details and counts reported in 2023 review (Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 4-5).
  • Dupilumab real‑world 52‑week cohort (China, n=124): EASI‑75 in 42.7% at week 16, 53.2% at week 24, and 41.9% at week 52; total AE incidence 14.5% with mostly mild events (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1419164) (wang2024longtermefficacyand pages 1-2, wang2024longtermefficacyand pages 9-10).
- Asthma outcomes
  • Dupilumab: phase II showed an 87% reduction in exacerbations vs placebo and >200 mL FEV1 improvement; later phase III reported ~320 mL FEV1 gains (Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology, Apr 2025) (sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 15-16).
  • Tralokinumab: 44% exacerbation reduction in FeNO‑high subgroups in STRATOS‑1; inconsistent results in broader populations (Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology, Apr 2025) (sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 15-16).
  • Lebrikizumab: adolescent trial arms showed 40–51% overall AER reduction (dose‑dependent) and 59–64% AER reduction in eosinophil‑high subgroups (Pharmaceuticals, Jul 2025; DOI: 10.3390/ph18071021) (varut2025targetedbiologictherapies pages 18-20).
- EoE outcomes
  • Pediatric/long‑term program summaries indicate sustained histologic response and clinical benefit with dupilumab through 52 weeks (Current Treatment Options in Pediatrics, Dec 2024) ().

Pathway‑specific functional roles (concise)
- Primary function: IL‑13 is a secreted signaling cytokine (not an enzyme or transporter). In target epithelia and stromal cells it activates JAK/STAT6 to drive mucus metaplasia (goblet cell hyperplasia, MUC5AC), subepithelial fibrosis, airway hyperresponsiveness, and epithelial barrier dysregulation; it cooperates with IL‑4 for IgE biology through IL‑4–dominant class‑switch signals while IL‑13 predominantly modulates structural cells (Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology, Apr 2025; Frontiers in Medicine, Apr 2023) (sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 15-16, napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 2-3).
- Localization of action: IL‑13 functions extracellularly as a secreted cytokine that binds cell‑surface type II receptors (IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα). IL‑13Rα2 acts primarily as a cell‑surface decoy/scavenger and influences ligand clearance and, in some contexts, TGF‑β–linked fibrosis (JID Innovations, Sep 2023) (tollenaere2023tralokinumabeffectivelydisrupts pages 13-13).

Implications for functional annotation
- Structure/function inference: The four‑helix bundle architecture, shared family with IL‑4, and 2023 conformational mapping explain the receptor‑first assembly via IL‑13Rα1 and allosteric avenues to inhibit signaling by stabilizing receptor‑incompetent IL‑13 states (Frontiers in Immunology, Jul 2023) (walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 1-2, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 7-9, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 9-10).
- Therapeutic selectivity: Antibodies that block IL‑13’s interaction with IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα (e.g., tralokinumab, lebrikizumab) disable canonical signaling yet spare or leverage IL‑13Rα2’s scavenger function, with clinical consequences for exposure/clearance and efficacy (JID Innovations, Sep 2023) (tollenaere2023tralokinumabeffectivelydisrupts pages 13-13).
- Clinical translation and guidelines: Robust efficacy for dupilumab across AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and EoE stems from dual IL‑4/IL‑13 pathway blockade, and is reflected in GINA 2024 recommendations and pediatric real‑world data (BMC Pulm Med, Dec 2024) (shi2024theassessmentof pages 1-2).

Summary interpretation
Human IL‑13 (P35225) is a four‑helix cytokine that signals through a type II receptor (IL‑13Rα1/IL‑4Rα) to activate JAK1/TYK2→STAT6 and drive hallmark type‑2 programs in skin and airway structural cells. Recent 2023 structural studies reveal functionally relevant conformational equilibria and identify allosteric epitopes and fragment binders, opening a path for small‑molecule IL‑13 modulators. Clinically, selective anti‑IL‑13 antibodies and IL‑4Rα blockade (dupilumab) are implemented across AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and EoE. 2023–2024 evidence documents approvals for lebrikizumab, durable real‑world AD outcomes with dupilumab, GINA 2024 recommendations for severe pediatric asthma, and pediatric EoE expansions with dupilumab. These data collectively refine IL‑13’s functional annotation as a secreted signaling cytokine whose primary role is to orchestrate epithelial and mesenchymal remodeling and pruritus/barrier phenotypes via the JAK/STAT6 axis, with IL‑13Rα2 acting largely as a high‑affinity decoy that shapes ligand disposition and context‑dependent profibrotic signaling (walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 1-2, walker2023identificationandcharacterisation pages 7-9, tollenaere2023tralokinumabeffectivelydisrupts pages 13-13, napolitano2023thehiddensentinel pages 2-3, sahnoon2025targetingil13and pages 15-16, wang2024longtermefficacyand pages 1-2, shi2024theassessmentof pages 1-2).
