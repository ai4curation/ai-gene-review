description: SNORD116-1 is one of multiple tandem copies of the SNORD116 small nucleolar
  RNA located in the SNHG14 host gene on chromosome 15q11-q13. The SNORD116 cluster
  plays a critical role in neurodevelopment, and loss of the entire cluster is a major
  contributor to Prader-Willi syndrome, affecting hypothalamic function, cognition,
  and metabolism. Individual copies like SNORD116-1 are functionally equivalent within
  the cluster.
