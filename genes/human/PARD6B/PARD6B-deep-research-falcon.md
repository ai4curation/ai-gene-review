## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BYG5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Partitioning defective 6 homolog beta; Short=PAR-6 beta; Short=PAR-6B;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PARD6B; Synonyms=PAR6B;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PAR6 family. .
- **Key Domains:** PAR6_homolog. (IPR051741); PB1-like. (IPR053793); PB1_dom. (IPR000270); PB1_Par6. (IPR034868); PDZ. (IPR001478)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PARD6B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PARD6B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PARD6B** (gene ID: PARD6B, UniProt: Q9BYG5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

*Table: Compact evidence-backed summary of human PARD6B (Par6β/Q9BYG5) covering identity, domains, interactions, localization, pathways, disease links (including a 2025 COPD study), and key sources with quantitative notes for reported copy-number/expression findings.*

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- What PARD6B is: PARD6B encodes Par6β, an evolutionarily conserved scaffold that organizes the PAR polarity complex. It binds atypical PKC isoforms (PRKCI/PKCι, PRKCZ/PKCζ) and PAR3 to control apico–basal polarity, tight junction (TJ) assembly, and apical membrane identity in epithelia. Its PDZ domain engages polarity partners, its PB1-like domain binds aPKC, and a semi-CRIB region binds active CDC42, which activates the Par6–aPKC complex. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Primary molecular role: Par6β acts as a non-enzymatic scaffold that positions and regulates aPKC activity at apical junctions, enabling aPKC-mediated phosphorylation of apical substrates and coordination with PAR3 during TJ assembly and polarity establishment. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Core binding partners: PAR3 (PARD3), aPKC (PRKCI/PRKCZ), and CDC42-GTP. Par6 engages TGFβ receptor I in EMT contexts and links to RAC signaling via TIAM1 in certain epithelial systems. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12, cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Subcellular localization: Par6β concentrates at the apical membrane and apical–lateral border, co-localizing with tight junction markers (e.g., ZO-1) in polarized epithelia; in tumor tissues, Par6 immunolocalization can be apical/membranous or cytoplasmic and, in a subset of invasive cases, nuclear. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12, catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Human embryoid and preimplantation models: Human post-implantation embryoids recapitulate apical polarity marked by PARD6 and ZO-1 at the epiblast-like domain, highlighting conserved roles of PAR6 in human epithelial morphogenesis (Nature, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06368-y; published June 2023). (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2)
- Junctional complexes in early embryos: Reviews in 2023 emphasize PAR3–PAR6–aPKC and Crumbs–PALS–PATJ modules at the apical domain, connecting junction assembly to lineage specification in mammalian embryos, and note that Pard6b perturbation compromises polarity in early development models. (Frontiers in Endocrinology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1150017; April 2023). (wang2025thepar6bprkcipar3complex pages 5-8)
- Rho GTPase control of polarity in development: 2024 work shows loss of Cdc42 disrupts expression of PRKCZ and PARD6 proteins and apical junctional organization during mouse optic cup morphogenesis, underscoring CDC42–PAR6–aPKC interdependence in vivo (Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2024.1474010; November 2024). (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2)
- Polarity modules and disease: Analyses of CRB/Par polarity complexes in retina and organoid systems (2023) reinforce apical localization of PARD3–PARD6–aPKC and implicate polarity pathways (TGFβ, Hippo) in developmental disease mechanisms. (The Journal of Pathology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/path.6056; February 2023). (cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Cancer biology and biomarker context: PARD6B is within the 20q13 region co-amplified in subsets of breast cancers, and Par6 protein levels/localization correlate with polarity loss, grade, and nodal metastasis, supporting its use in research pathology to assess polarity status and epithelial organization. Functional studies indicate Par6 (including Par6β) can drive MAPK-dependent proliferation in breast models, highlighting the Par6–aPKC axis as a research target. (nolan2008thepolarityprotein pages 6-7, cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)
- Epithelial regeneration: In alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), a PAR3–PARD6B–PRKCI complex promotes proliferation and alveolar organoid growth; reduced complex abundance associates with the emphysema subtype of COPD, suggesting translational relevance for regenerative strategies in lung disease (Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-025-04189-6; February 2025). (wang2025thepar6bprkcipar3complex pages 5-8)

4) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Breast cancer polarity reviews and analyses: A systematic interrogation of polarity genes in breast cancer concluded that polarity disruption is pervasive in invasive disease; PARD6B is among frequently amplified polarity genes with significant expression–outcome associations. Localization heterogeneity (including nuclear Par6 in invasive cancers) underscores that function depends on localization as much as abundance. (catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)
- Mechanistic frameworks: Contemporary syntheses describe how Cdc42 binding to Par6 conformationally activates aPKC to phosphorylate apical targets; aPKC then transitions from PAR3 to CRUMBS complexes via Par6, reinforcing apical identity and TJ maturation—a framework that integrates signaling (e.g., TGFβ, DDR1, Hippo via AMOT–aPKC) with polarity remodeling. (wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- Copy-number and expression in breast cancer: PARD6B lies in a focal amplicon on 20q13.13; in one study, amplicons encompassing PARD6B were present in 5 of 11 breast cancer cell lines with copy number ranging approximately 7–27, correlating with mRNA and protein overexpression. Par6 overexpression was observed in pre-malignant breast lesions and retained in many ER-positive tumors. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, nolan2008thepolarityprotein pages 6-7)
- Clinical association signals: In a breast cancer cohort analysis, PARD6B showed one of the strongest survival associations among amplified polarity genes; paradoxically, lower PARD6B expression associated with worse overall survival (median 22 vs 55 months), suggesting context-dependent roles and the importance of localization. (catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)
- TJ formation dependence: siRNA knockdown of PARD6B in mammary models disrupts tight junction assembly and prevents membrane localization of activated PKCζ, phenocopying CDC42 knockdown; adherens junctions are comparatively spared, indicating a specific requirement for the PAR3–PAR6–aPKC–CDC42 module in TJ maturation. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12)
- Developmental polarity markers: Human embryoid models show apical PARD6 and ZO-1 at epiblast-like surfaces during post-implantation-like morphogenesis (Nature 2023; published June 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06368-y). (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2)

Mechanistic roles and pathways
- Core PAR module: Par6β scaffolds PAR3 and aPKC at the apical-lateral border; CDC42•GTP binding to Par6 triggers aPKC activation that drives apical-substrate phosphorylation, TJ maturation, and apical identity. Activated aPKC subsequently associates with CRUMBS complexes via Par6 to reinforce apical domain specification. (wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37, cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2)
- Signaling integration: Par6 complexes intersect with TGFβ signaling (Par6–TGFβRI reported in EMT), RAC/TIAM1 pathways, and can affect MAPK output and epithelial plasticity; in cancer, misexpression or mislocalization of Par6 perturbs tissue architecture and proliferation control. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12, nolan2008thepolarityprotein pages 6-7, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Hippo/YAP cross-talk: Polarity modules at the apical junctional belt, including PAR and CRUMBS complexes, influence Hippo signaling through AMOT/aPKC and related interfaces, with disease-relevant consequences in epithelia and developing retina reported in recent systems analyses. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)

Subcellular localization and dynamics
- Epithelia: Par6β colocalizes with TJs and apical-lateral junctions, is required for recruitment/localization of activated aPKC at the plasma membrane, and shows epithelial-enriched expression; in poorly differentiated tumors, staining diminishes and/or becomes cytoplasmic. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12)
- Developmental systems: Human embryoids and embryo-focused reviews consistently mark PARD6 at apical surfaces during early morphogenesis, consistent with conserved apical polarity function. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2025thepar6bprkcipar3complex pages 5-8)
- Tissue pathology: In breast cancer specimens, Par6 shows membrane, cytoplasmic, and occasionally nuclear staining; nuclear Par6 appears in invasive cases and not in pre-invasive lesions, suggesting altered trafficking or interactions during progression. (catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)

Human disease relevance
- Breast cancer: Genomic and expression alterations of PARD6B (amplification/overexpression) are recurrent in subsets of breast cancer and correlate with polarity loss and clinical features; Par6 overexpression can drive proliferation through MAPK in mammary models. (nolan2008thepolarityprotein pages 6-7, cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)
- Epithelial cancers and EMT: Par6 has been implicated mechanistically in TGFβ-driven EMT and epithelial remodeling, consistent with roles in invasion/metastasis in polarity-disrupted tumors. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequireda pages 11-12, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Lung disease (COPD/emphysema): In human AEC2s, a PAR3–PARD6B–PRKCI complex supports proliferation and regenerative capacity; reduced complex abundance associates with emphysema-type COPD, and restoring PARD6B rescues proliferation defects in injury models (Stem Cell Research & Therapy, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-025-04189-6). (wang2025thepar6bprkcipar3complex pages 5-8)

Notes on regulation
- Activation and assembly: CDC42-dependent conformational activation of Par6–aPKC is required for TJ assembly; Par3 recruitment and subsequent aPKC transitions underlie apical domain maturation. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)
- Post-translational pathways: Evidence indicates aPKC phosphorylation cycles modulate complex composition and substrate recognition; while classical 14-3-3 and ubiquitin linkages to polarity proteins are known in the field, the citations here specifically support aPKC- and CDC42-dependent regulation for Par6β. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2021identificationandcharacterization pages 33-37)

Limitations and open questions
- Isoform specificity: Many studies examine Par6 family collectively; PARD6B-specific roles are supported by breast epithelial and AEC2 data, but broader in vivo human evidence remains limited. (cunliffe2012par6bisrequired pages 1-2, wang2025thepar6bprkcipar3complex pages 5-8)
- Context dependence: Associations between PARD6B expression and outcomes may be non-linear and dependent on localization and co-alterations (e.g., HER2, SRC, PRKCI), necessitating careful interpretation in translational settings. (catterall2021characterizationofapicalbasal pages 52-59)

Summary
PARD6B (Par6β) is a human polarity scaffold that assembles the PAR3–PAR6–aPKC complex at the apical–lateral border, integrates CDC42 signaling to activate aPKC, and drives tight junction assembly and apical identity. Recent human embryoid and developmental studies reaffirm Par6’s apical role and CDC42 dependence. In disease, PARD6B is recurrently amplified/overexpressed in subsets of breast cancer with complex expression–outcome relationships and mislocalization in invasive disease, and it forms a pro-regenerative complex with PAR3 and PRKCI in alveolar epithelial cells with relevance to COPD. These functions underscore Par6β as a non-enzymatic organizer of epithelial architecture and signaling interfaces with implications for cancer biology and epithelial regeneration.
