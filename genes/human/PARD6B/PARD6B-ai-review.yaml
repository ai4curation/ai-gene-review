description: >-
  PARD6B encodes PAR-6 beta (partitioning defective 6 homolog beta), an evolutionarily
  conserved
  scaffold protein that is a core component of the PAR polarity complex. PAR-6B contains
  a PB1
  domain for interaction with atypical PKC (PRKCI/PRKCZ), a pseudo-CRIB domain for
  binding
  activated CDC42/RAC1, and a PDZ domain for interaction with PAR-3 and PALS1. The
  protein
  functions as a non-enzymatic adaptor that links small GTPases (CDC42, RAC1) to atypical
  protein kinase C, thereby coordinating the assembly of the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC polarity
  complex
  at tight junctions and the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. PARD6B
  is essential
  for the establishment and maintenance of apico-basal cell polarity, tight junction
  formation,
  and asymmetric cell division. CDC42-GTP binding to PAR-6B conformationally activates
  aPKC to
  phosphorylate apical substrates, driving tight junction maturation and apical identity.

    description: >-
      PARD6B functions as a non-enzymatic scaffold/adaptor that links activated small
      GTPases (CDC42, RAC1) to atypical protein kinase C (PRKCI/PRKCZ), enabling
      coordinated signaling in the cell polarity pathway. The protein brings together
      GTPases (via CRIB-like motif) and aPKC (via PB1 domain) in a ternary complex
      that
      is essential for polarity establishment.

      context-specific roles in polarity establishment

      activate aPKC
