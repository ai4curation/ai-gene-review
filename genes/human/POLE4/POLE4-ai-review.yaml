description: 'DNA Polymerase Epsilon Subunit 4 (POLE4/p12/CHRAC15, ~12 kDa), smallest
  accessory subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon (Pol ε) - one of core replicative polymerases
  responsible for leading-strand DNA synthesis during S-phase. Pol ε is tetrameric
  complex: catalytic subunit POLE1 (DNA polymerase and 3''-5'' exonuclease activities),
  POLE2 (links Pol ε to CMG helicase), and two small histone-fold accessory subunits
  POLE3 and POLE4. POLE4 contains H2A-like histone fold; POLE3 has H2B-like fold -
  together form stable POLE3-POLE4 heterodimer analogous to H2A-H2B in nucleosomes.
  This heterodimer docks onto POLE1, enhancing Pol ε stability and DNA-binding capacity.
  Critical for Pol ε complex integrity - Pole4 knockout causes destabilization of
  entire complex with loss of POLE3 and reduced POLE1/POLE2 levels. Required for normal
  mammalian development - loss causes embryonic lethality or severe growth defects
  with genomic instability. While yeast homologs (Dpb3/Dpb4) are not essential, mammalian
  POLE4 became crucial due to increased demands on replication fidelity. Functions
  in high-fidelity leading-strand DNA synthesis, though POLE4 itself lacks catalytic
  activity. Enhances Pol ε processivity by binding dsDNA sequence-independently via
  histone fold. Required for efficient replication origin firing - Pole4-deficient
  cells show abnormally large inter-origin distances and compensatory increase in
  fork speed. Critical role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly - POLE3-POLE4
  heterodimer functions as bona fide histone H3-H4 chaperone, binding core histones
  and facilitating tetrasome formation. Escorts histones during replication, ensuring
  timely chromatin restoration behind fork. Deficiency causes defective nucleosome
  reassembly, evidenced by persistent RPA accumulation and prolonged PCNA retention
  (indicating unprocessed ssDNA and delayed chromatin maturation). Loss triggers replication
  stress: slower fork progression, accumulation of post-replicative ssDNA gaps, elevated
  ATR/p53 checkpoint signaling. POLE4-null cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors
  due to catastrophic DNA gap accumulation. Also component of CHRAC (Chromatin Accessibility
  Complex) chromatin remodeling complex where POLE3/POLE4 help organize nucleosomes.
  Nuclear protein localizing to nucleoplasm and replication foci during S-phase. Connects
  enzymatic DNA synthesis to structural chromatin assembly, preventing replication
  stress and maintaining genome stability. Essential for coupling Pol ε polymerase
  activity with nucleosome deposition, sister chromatid cohesion (via Ctf18-RFC interaction),
  and DNA damage response signaling.'
