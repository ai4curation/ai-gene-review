## Question

Research the TTC28 (Q96AY4) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **TTC28 (Q96AY4)** gene in humans encodes the **tetratricopeptide repeat domain 28** protein, which plays a critical role in mitosis, chromosomal stability, and is implicated in cancer biology. Below is a comprehensive overview based on current research and authoritative databases.

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Gene Name:** TTC28 (Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain 28)
- **Protein ID:** Q96AY4
- **Location:** Chromosome 22q12.1[7][9]
- **Protein Length:** 2481 amino acids[5]

---

### 2. Molecular Function

- **Kinase Binding:** TTC28 enables kinase binding activity, notably interacting with Aurora kinase B (AURKB), a key regulator of mitosis[1][2].
- **Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) Substrate:** TTC28 is a substrate for HSPA8-mediated CMA/microautophagy, which regulates its degradation and links it to protein quality control and cellular homeostasis[2][4].
- **Mitotic Regulation:** TTC28 is essential for the condensation of spindle midzone microtubules and the formation of the midbody during mitosis, directly impacting cytokinesis[1][11][16].

---

### 3. Biological Processes

- **Regulation of Mitotic Cell Cycle:** TTC28 is involved in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, particularly in spindle midzone formation and cytokinesis[1][11][16].
- **Chromosomal Stability:** TTC28 is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability. Its downregulation leads to increased genome instability, a hallmark of many cancers[2][4].
- **CMA and Genome Maintenance:** By interacting with HSPA8, TTC28 is involved in CMA, which is necessary for proper mitosis and genome integrity[2].

---

### 4. Cellular Localization

- **Cytoplasmic (Perinuclear):** TTC28 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, especially in the perinuclear region, as confirmed by confocal microscopy[2].
- **Midbody During Mitosis:** TTC28 localizes to the midbody during cell division, consistent with its role in cytokinesis[1][16].
- **Nucleolar Presence:** A minor fraction of endogenous TTC28 is detected in nucleoli[2].

---

### 5. Protein Domains

- **Tetratricopeptide Repeat (TPR) Motifs:** TTC28 contains 25 TPR motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions and are essential for its function in mitosis and interaction with HSPA8[11][2].
- **TPR Domain Function:** The TPR domains facilitate binding to the PTIEEVD motif of HSPA8, mediating its role in CMA and protein complex assembly[2].

---

### 6. Known Interactions

- **HSPA8 (Heat Shock Cognate 71 kDa Protein):** TTC28 directly interacts with HSPA8, which is central to CMA and protein degradation pathways[2][4].
- **Aurora Kinase B (AURKB):** TTC28 binds AURKB, influencing mitosis and cytokinesis[2].
- **Vimentin and DDX41:** Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirm interactions with vimentin (a cytoskeletal protein) and DDX41 (a DEAD-box helicase), suggesting roles in cytoskeletal organization and RNA processing[2].
- **Extensive Interactome:** Mass spectrometry identified 222 candidate interacting proteins, indicating TTC28’s involvement in multiple cellular pathways[2].

---

### 7. Disease Associations

- **Cancer:** TTC28 is frequently mutated and downregulated in various human cancers. Its reduced expression correlates with poor overall survival in lung cancer and is associated with increased genomic instability[2][4].
- **Cholestasis, Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic, Type 2:** TTC28 is listed as associated with this rare liver disorder, though the mechanistic link is not well characterized[1].
- **Genome Instability:** Downregulation of TTC28 contributes to chromosomal instability, a driver of tumorigenesis[2][4].

---

### 8. Recent Developments and Latest Research (2023–2024)

- **2024 Study (Zhang et al.):** Demonstrated that TTC28 is essential for CMA-mediated maintenance of chromosomal stability, directly interacts with HSPA8 and AURKB, and that its loss leads to increased genome instability in cancer cells[2][4].
- **Expression Analysis:** TTC28 mRNA and protein levels are significantly decreased in many cancers, with a strong correlation between mRNA and protein abundance across cancer cell lines and tissues[2].

---

### 9. Expert Opinions and Analysis

- **Essential for Mitosis and Cytokinesis:** Multiple studies and database entries converge on TTC28’s critical role in cell division, particularly in spindle midzone formation and midbody assembly[1][11][16].
- **Cancer Biology:** Experts highlight TTC28 as a potential tumor suppressor due to its role in maintaining genome stability and its frequent downregulation in cancer[2][4].

---

### 10. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Interactome:** 222 candidate proteins identified as potential interactors via mass spectrometry[2].
- **Correlation Coefficient:** Spearman R = 0.78 (protein vs. mRNA in cell lines), R = 0.43 (in pancancer tissues), indicating a strong relationship between TTC28 expression at the transcript and protein levels[2].

**Summary:**  
TTC28 is a large, TPR-containing protein essential for mitosis, chromosomal stability, and CMA, with a cytoplasmic and midbody localization. It interacts with key mitotic and chaperone proteins, is downregulated in many cancers, and is associated with increased genomic instability when lost or mutated[1][2][4][11][16].
