description: Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 28, a large protein (2481 AA) containing
  multiple TPR repeats that localizes to centrosomes, spindle poles, and the midbody
  during cell division. TPR domains mediate protein-protein interactions and TTC28
  functions as a scaffold protein in the mitotic machinery. The protein localizes
  to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and concentrates at spindle poles and the
  midbody during mitosis/cytokinesis, suggesting roles in spindle organization, chromosome
  segregation, and cytokinesis. TTC28 exhibits kinase binding activity and is involved
  in regulation of the mitotic cell cycle. The specific molecular mechanisms and binding
  partners remain to be fully characterized, but the protein is implicated in proper
  spindle assembly and cell division progression.
