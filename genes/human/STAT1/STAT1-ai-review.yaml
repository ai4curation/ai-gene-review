description: STAT1 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that serves as a central
  mediator of cytokine signaling, particularly interferon responses. Upon cytokine
  stimulation, STAT1 becomes phosphorylated on Y701 by JAK kinases, forms homodimers
  or heterodimers (e.g., with STAT2), and translocates to the nucleus where it binds
  specific DNA elements to regulate gene expression. STAT1 is essential for antiviral
  and antimicrobial immunity, mediating both type I (IFN-α/β, forming ISGF3 complex)
  and type II (IFN-γ, forming GAF complex) interferon responses. Knockout studies
  demonstrate STAT1's non-redundant role in host defense against viruses, bacteria,
  and fungi.
