  label: Homo sapiens
description: STAT1 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that serves as a central
  mediator of cytokine signaling, particularly interferon responses. Upon cytokine
  stimulation, STAT1 becomes phosphorylated on Y701 by JAK kinases, forms homodimers
  or heterodimers (e.g., with STAT2), and translocates to the nucleus where it binds
  specific DNA elements to regulate gene expression. STAT1 is essential for antiviral
  and antimicrobial immunity, mediating both type I (IFN-α/β, forming ISGF3 complex)
  and type II (IFN-γ, forming GAF complex) interferon responses. Knockout studies
  demonstrate STAT1's non-redundant role in host defense against viruses, bacteria,
  and fungi.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: STAT1 binds to specific DNA regulatory elements including GAS (gamma-activated
      sites) and ISRE sequences in gene promoters. This IBA annotation accurately
      reflects STAT1's well-established function as a sequence-specific transcription
      factor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotations represent high-quality phylogenetically-inferred annotations
      that have undergone extensive review. STAT1's sequence-specific DNA binding
      to cis-regulatory regions is a core molecular function well-supported by structural
      and biochemical evidence.

    summary: This is STAT1's core molecular function. STAT1 is a bona fide transcription
      factor that activates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of interferon-stimulated
      genes and other cytokine-responsive genes. IBA annotation is well-supported.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: While STAT1 does bind DNA, this term is overly general. STAT1's DNA binding
      is sequence-specific and is better captured by more specific terms like GO:0000981
      or GO:0043565.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Generic DNA binding (GO:0003677) provides insufficient functional specificity
      for a well-characterized transcription factor like STAT1. The more specific
      terms 'RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding'
      and 'DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific'
      better capture STAT1's functional specificity.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0000981 is more specific and preferred, this broader term still
      accurately describes STAT1's transcriptional function. Both terms can coexist

suggested_questions:
- question: How does STAT1 achieve gene-specific transcriptional regulation and what
    determines its chromatin binding specificity?
- question: What are the molecular mechanisms that distinguish STAT1 homodimer from
    STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer function?
- question: How do post-translational modifications of STAT1 regulate its nuclear
    translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity?
- question: What role does STAT1 play in balancing immune activation versus immunosuppression
    in different disease contexts?
