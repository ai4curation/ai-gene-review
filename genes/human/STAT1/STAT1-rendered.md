|description[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/description)|STAT1 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that serves as a central mediator of cytokine signaling, particularly interferon responses. Upon cytokine stimulation, STAT1 becomes phosphorylated on Y701 by JAK kinases, forms homodimers or heterodimers (e.g., with STAT2), and translocates to the nucleus where it binds specific DNA elements to regulate gene expression. STAT1 is essential for antiviral and antimicrobial immunity, mediating both type I (IFN-α/β, forming ISGF3 complex) and type II (IFN-γ, forming GAF complex) interferon responses. Knockout studies demonstrate STAT1's non-redundant role in host defense against viruses, bacteria, and fungi.|
