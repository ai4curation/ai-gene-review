# STAT1 Gene Review Notes

## 2025-01-14 - Retired Annotation Fix

**Issue**: Validation failure due to 1 annotation not found in the current GOA file.

**Root Cause**: PMID:16257975 that was referenced in one annotation (GO:0046427 - positive regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT) has been removed from the current GOA database.

**Action Taken**: Marked the annotation with PMID:16257975 as `retired: true` to exclude it from GOA validation while preserving the annotation review work.

**Validation Status**: After marking the retired annotation, the gene now passes validation with only warnings about PENDING annotations and an invalid PMID:34521819 that couldn't be fetched.

**Outstanding Issues**:
- PMID:34521819 cannot be verified - may need manual checking or correction
- Large number of PENDING annotations require review

**Note**: STAT1 is a key transcription factor in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, particularly important for interferon signaling and immune responses. The single retired annotation represents ongoing curation changes in the GOA database.
