## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q14165
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Malectin {ECO:0000305}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MLEC {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:28973}; Synonyms=KIAA0152;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the malectin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Malectin_dom. (IPR021720); MLEC. (IPR039155); Malectin (PF11721)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MLEC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MLEC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MLEC** (gene ID: MLEC, UniProt: Q14165) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: MLEC (Malectin; UniProt Q14165) — functional annotation and current understanding

Verification of identity and nomenclature
- Target identity: MLEC encodes human malectin (UniProt Q14165), a type I membrane-anchored lectin resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, originally identified as a novel ER carbohydrate‑binding protein with a luminal malectin domain, single-pass transmembrane segment, and short cytosolic tail. This matches the provided UniProt identity and domain annotations and places MLEC within the malectin family (PF11721/IPR021720) (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2).
- Organism: Homo sapiens (human), as in the foundational primary studies that characterized human malectin expression, binding, and function (chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2, schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2).
- Domain/family concordance: Literature describes a conserved ER lumenal carbohydrate‑binding malectin domain with specificity for di‑glucosylated N‑glycans, consistent with Malectin_dom and malectin family annotations (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, ringler2020structuralandfunctional pages 1-13, ringler2020structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Topology and localization: Malectin is a type I ER membrane lectin with a lumenal glycan‑binding domain. It resides predominantly in the ER, often concentrated in ER subdomains. ER retention depends on complex formation with ribophorin I (RPN1), an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) subunit; under ER stress or RPN1 knockdown, malectin can redistribute toward the Golgi, but RPN1 overexpression restores ER localization (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 5-9, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 1-5).
- Ligand specificity: Malectin recognizes the di‑glucosylated high‑mannose N‑glycan intermediate Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 (G2M9), binding minimally to Glc1 or Glc3 forms. Its epitope centers on the Glcα1‑3Glc disaccharide (nigerose) motif. Quantitatively, frontal affinity chromatography/biochemical assays reported Ka ≈ 1.97 × 10^5 M−1 for G2M9; ITC with small disaccharides showed Kd ≈ 26.3 ± 7 µM for nigerose, ≈ 50 ± 0.5 µM for maltose, and ≈ 210 ± 6 µM for kojibiose, with stronger binding to the full G2 N‑glycan than to nigerose alone (chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2, ringler2020structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).
- Structural insights: X‑ray and biophysical analyses identify a defined binding pocket adapted to two glucose rings, with key residues S80, E102, Y104, Y131, D201 (and structured waters) mediating specificity. Tyr104/Tyr131 contribute stacking to the first/second glucose, respectively; D201 contacts both glucose moieties, rationalizing preference for the Glc2 form (ringler2020structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).
- Placement in ER glycoprotein quality control: The G3→G2→G1 trimming sequence by ER glucosidases I/II sets the stage for lectin-mediated folding/triage. Malectin recognizes G2 immediately after glucosidase I action and before complete glucosidase II trimming, positioning it upstream/early relative to the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, which preferentially recognizes G1 glycoforms (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, d’alessio2015glucosidaseiiand pages 1-3, alonzi2017iminosugarantiviralsthe pages 1-3).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- ERAD network context (2023): Contemporary work on ER proteostasis in mammalian cells emphasizes SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD as the dominant degradative arm for misfolded ER proteins and shows how chaperones/lectins and ER‑phagy interface under stress and in specialized tissues (adipocytes). Within these networks, malectin and ER lectins are repeatedly noted as ERQC components that shape substrate fate decisions under physiological ER stress and remodeling, although explicit malectin-centric datasets are limited in these excerpts (alonzi2017iminosugarantiviralsthe pages 1-3, d’alessio2015glucosidaseiiand pages 1-3, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 5-9).
- Viral infection and proteostasis interactome (2024 preprint): A quantitative proteomics and functional genetic screen identified malectin as a conserved proteostasis interactor for coronavirus nsp2/nsps and as a host factor promoting viral replication. siRNA knockdown of MLEC in the MHV model produced the largest reduction in infectious titers among screened interactors, with ~80% reduction of endogenous MLEC protein and no major toxicity. The malectin interactome stabilized association with OST components during infection. The preprint also reports that malectin promotes SARS‑CoV‑2 replication, suggesting potential for host‑targeted antiviral strategies (bioRxiv; posted 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.02.597051) (davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 1-4, davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 4-6).

Functional roles, pathways, and mechanisms
- ERQC/ERAD triage: Malectin binds G2M9 on nascent glycoproteins, especially misfolded variants, and can route them toward degradation. In human cells, malectin stably associates with misfolded α1‑antitrypsin (ATNHK) via G2M9; malectin overexpression enhances ER‑associated degradation (ERAD) of ATNHK and reduces its secretion, while wild-type AT is not similarly affected. These data position malectin as an early recognition/retention factor for misfolded glycoproteins, acting prior to or in parallel with entry to the calnexin/calreticulin cycle (chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2).
- Interaction with OST components: Endogenous ER localization and functional retention depend on ribophorin I (RPN1), an OST subunit, with experimental evidence showing RPN1 knockdown redirects malectin to Golgi and RPN1 overexpression rescues ER localization under stress. These findings support a model where malectin collaborates with RPN1 to link glycan recognition (G2) with misfolded polypeptide sensing, aiding selective retention of misfolded glycoproteins (yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 5-9, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 1-5).
- Relationship to the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and MRH lectins: Malectin acts on the G2 intermediate upstream of classical calnexin/calreticulin (which bind G1). MRH-domain lectins OS‑9 and XTP3‑B act later to escort mannose‑trimmed, terminally misfolded glycoproteins to SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD. Thus, malectin can be viewed as an early gatekeeper that biases substrate fate by stabilizing G2‑bearing misfolded clients and promoting ERAD when folding defects are detected (d’alessio2015glucosidaseiiand pages 1-3, schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2).

Cellular localization and regulation
- Steady-state and stress responses: Under basal conditions, malectin resides in ER subdomains. ER stress (tunicamycin or thapsigargin) upregulates malectin (mRNA/protein) and can shift its distribution toward the Golgi. RPN1 protein decreases under stress despite mRNA induction, and restoring RPN1 expression re‑localizes malectin to the ER. These dynamics suggest that ER stress alters the malectin:RPN1 ratio and therefore compartmental localization, potentially tuning ERQC capacity (yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 5-9, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 1-5, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 18-24).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Virology/antivirals: Inhibitors of ER α‑glucosidases I/II block proper trimming, reduce G1 formation, and thereby impair calnexin engagement; this host-targeting antiviral approach has shown broad activity in preclinical models. Because glucosidase inhibition increases G2 abundance, it can increase ligands for malectin, potentially altering the balance between folding and ERAD for viral glycoproteins. The 2024 preprint implicating malectin as pro‑viral supports the idea that ERQC lectins, including malectin, influence viral glycoprotein biogenesis and replication outcomes (alonzi2017iminosugarantiviralsthe pages 1-3, davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 1-4, davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 4-6).
- Biomarker discovery: Proteomics studies in tumors have reported malectin among differentially expressed proteins; for example, in papillary thyroid carcinoma, MLEC was identified and immunohistochemistry showed overexpression compared with normal tissue, nominating MLEC as a candidate biomarker. While mechanistic links to pathogenesis were not delineated in that study, such datasets motivate follow‑up translational research (source described in search; details not extracted in evidence blocks; see foundational malectin biology for context) (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Foundational primary studies (MBoC 2008, 2011) and peer‑reviewed reviews (2015 Current Protein & Peptide Science; 2017 Biochem Soc Trans) consistently place malectin as an ER‑resident lectin recognizing G2 intermediates at an early decision point in glycoprotein folding quality control. These sources underscore its distinct niche upstream of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and its potential bifunctionality (glycan binding plus misfolded‑substrate retention in collaboration with OST components like RPN1) (schallus2008malectinanovel pages 1-2, chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2, d’alessio2015glucosidaseiiand pages 1-3, alonzi2017iminosugarantiviralsthe pages 1-3).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Binding and structural metrics: Ka for G2M9 ≈ 1.97 × 10^5 M−1; minimal binding to G1/G3. ITC Kd values for disaccharide mimics: nigerose ≈ 26.3 ± 7 µM; maltose ≈ 50 ± 0.5 µM; kojibiose ≈ 210 ± 6 µM (chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2, ringler2020structuralandfunctional pages 38-42).
- Functional perturbation (virology; preprint): ~80% knockdown of endogenous malectin protein via siRNA reduced coronavirus titers and replication readouts, outperforming other tested interactors; viability effects were modest (≤17%) in the reported assays (davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 4-6).
- ER stress and localization: Quantified ER stress manipulations (e.g., thapsigargin 3 μM, tunicamycin 5 μg/ml, 24 h) increased stress markers (CHOP/BiP) and induced malectin expression while reducing RPN1 protein, with statistical significance reported by the authors (Student’s t‑test, p < 0.01) (yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 18-24).

Open questions and limitations
- While strong evidence supports malectin’s role in recognizing G2 glycoforms and triaging misfolded clients like ATNHK, the scope of endogenous substrates, the full interactome dynamics with OST subunits, and quantitative contributions relative to calnexin/calreticulin across cell types remain active areas. The 2024 coronavirus study is a preprint; further peer‑reviewed validation will be important for translational targeting of MLEC in infection (chen2011roleofmalectin pages 1-2, yang2018subcellulardistributionof pages 5-9, davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 1-4, davies2025theglycoproteinquality pages 4-6).
