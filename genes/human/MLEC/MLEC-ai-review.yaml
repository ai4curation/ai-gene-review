description: >-
  Malectin is an ER-resident type I membrane lectin that specifically recognizes
  di-glucosylated high-mannose N-glycans (Glc2Man9GlcNAc2, G2M9) on nascent
  glycoproteins. It functions in the early steps of ER glycoprotein quality
  control, acting upstream of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. Malectin forms
  a stable complex with ribophorin I (RPN1), an oligosaccharyltransferase
  subunit, which enhances its association with misfolded glycoproteins and
  promotes their retention for ERAD. The protein contains a lumenal
  carbohydrate-binding malectin domain with specificity for the Glc-alpha-1,3-Glc
  (nigerose) disaccharide motif, with binding affinity Ka of approximately
  1.97 x 10^5 M^-1 for G2M9.

        Malectin itself functions more as a lectin recognizing glycan
        intermediates on misfolded proteins rather than binding to classical
        chaperones. A more accurate annotation would be misfolded protein

        malectin may transiently appear at the plasma membrane during

    title: Malectin forms a complex with ribophorin I for enhanced association 
      with misfolded glycoproteins.
    findings:
      - statement: Malectin forms stable complex with ribophorin I (RPN1)
        supporting_text: "we found that malectin formed a stable complex with an endoplasmic
          reticulum-resident transmembrane protein, ribophorin I"

          glycoproteins
        supporting_text: "Co-expression of malectin and ribophorin I significantly
          enhanced the association between malectin and a folding-defective alpha1-antitrypsin
          variant (null Hong Kong)"
      - statement: RPN1 may function as a chaperone recognizing misfolded 
          proteins
        supporting_text: "ribophorin I preferentially interacted with misfolded ribonuclease
          A but not with the native form, suggesting that ribophorin I may function
          as a chaperone that recognizes misfolded proteins inside cells"
