description: 'CASP9 (Caspase-9) is the initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative splicing produces 4 isoforms with
  ANTAGONISTIC functions: (1) Caspase-9L (isoform 1, P55211-1, Alpha) is the full-length
  ACTIVE enzyme that binds Apaf-1 in the apoptosome and cleaves effector caspases
  to INDUCE APOPTOSIS; (2) Caspase-9S (isoform 2, P55211-2, Beta) lacks the catalytic
  domain and acts as a DOMINANT-NEGATIVE INHIBITOR that competes with 9L for Apaf-1
  binding [PMID:10070954]. UniProt states "Isoform 2: Lacks activity is an dominant-negative
  inhibitor of caspase-9". All current GOA apoptosis annotations refer to the pro-apoptotic
  function - MISSING the anti-apoptotic isoform 2 function.'

    summary: Caspase-9 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as an 
      inactive monomer in non-stressed cells [PMID:12782307, deep research]. The
      IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is well-supported. Both 
      isoforms would be cytoplasmic as neither has specific targeting signals.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytoplasmic localization is well-established for procaspase-9. The 
      deep research confirms "In non-stressed cells, caspase-9 predominantly 
      localizes to the cytosol as an inactive monomer lacking typical 
      mitochondrial targeting sequences." This applies to both isoforms as the 
      CARD domain (retained in both) does not contain targeting signals.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Caspase-9 is central to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The IBA 
      annotation correctly identifies involvement in apoptosis, which is the 
      canonical function of isoform 1. However, isoform 2 (Caspase-9S) INHIBITS 
      apoptosis as a dominant-negative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The GO term "apoptotic process" is a broad BP term that applies to 
      proteins involved in apoptosis regardless of whether they promote or 
      inhibit it. The term definition includes regulation. Isoform 1 induces 
      apoptosis while isoform 2 inhibits it - both are involved in the apoptotic
      process. The IBA inference from phylogenetic conservation is sound for the
      canonical pro-apoptotic function.

    summary: 'Cysteine-type endopeptidase activity is the core enzymatic function

      as it is missing the catalytic domain (residues 140-289). UniProt explicitly
      states "Isoform 2: Lacks activity".'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is correct for the canonical isoform 1 (P55211-1). 
      The IBA phylogenetic inference is valid because the catalytic activity is 
      the defining feature of caspase-9 orthologs. The catalytic dyad (Cys-287 
      and His-237) is conserved across the family. Note that isoform 2 would NOT
