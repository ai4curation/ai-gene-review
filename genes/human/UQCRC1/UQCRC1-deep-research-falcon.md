## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P31930
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=Complex III subunit 1; AltName: Full=Core protein I; AltName: Full=Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex core protein 1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=UQCRC1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase M16 family. UQCRC1/QCR1 subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Metalloenz_LuxS/M16. (IPR011249); MPP/UQCRC_Complex. (IPR050361); Pept_M16_N. (IPR011765); Peptidase_M16_C. (IPR007863); Peptidase_M16 (PF00675)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "UQCRC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'UQCRC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **UQCRC1** (gene ID: UQCRC1, UniProt: P31930) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human UQCRC1 (UniProt: P31930)

Verification of Target Identity and Scope
We verified the gene/protein identity prior to analysis. UQCRC1 encodes ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase core protein 1 (Complex III core protein I), a non-catalytic, matrix-facing core subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III, CIII2) in Homo sapiens. It belongs to the supernumerary/core subunits organizing the CIII2 dimer and engages in the matrix-side interface with Complex I within respirasomes; these placements are consistent with UniProt P31930 annotations (peptidase M16-like domains) and contemporary structural reviews (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition and localization: UQCRC1 is a structural core subunit of mitochondrial Complex III (CIII2), residing on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and participating in higher-order assemblies (CI–CIII2–CIV respirasomes) (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, rakosnikova2023studyofetiopathology pages 22-27).
- Functional role in electron transport: While not catalytic, UQCRC1 stabilizes CIII2 architecture and contributes to the matrix-facing contact between Complex I and III. Complex III catalyzes the Q cycle, oxidizing ubiquinol (CoQH2) at the Qo site and reducing cytochrome c via the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (UQCRFS1) and cytochrome c1 (CYC1); UQCRC1 supports this by maintaining structural integrity and supercomplex contacts rather than executing redox chemistry (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13).
- Interaction partners: Within CIII, UQCRC1 associates with UQCRC2 (core II), UQCRB, UQCRQ, UQCRH, CYC1, UQCRFS1, UQCR10 and UQCR11. In respirasomes, it forms a matrix-side interface with Complex I subunits NDUFB4 and NDUFB9, while additional CI–CIII interfaces involve NDUFA11 and CIII subunits UQCRB/UQCRQ/UQCRH on the membrane side (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3).
- Protein family/domains: UQCRC1 belongs to the peptidase M16-like (MPP/UQCRC complex) family with Peptidase_M16_N and _C domain architecture inferred from annotation; in Complex III, it acts as a non-enzymatic scaffold/core protein (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Supercomplex function and architecture: A 2023 EMBO Reports review synthesizes cryo-EM and functional studies, placing UQCRC1 at the matrix-side CI–CIII interface and emphasizing dynamic respirasome organization with context-dependent functional benefits; dedicated factors like SCAF1 regulate CIII2–CIV association, and multiple conformational states (“loose/tight”) exist (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 9-10, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 13-14).
- In vivo constraints on supercomplex necessity: A 2023 mouse Uqcrc1 knock-in study showed profoundly reduced respirasomes by BN-PAGE and cross-linking MS but preserved respiratory capacity and normal physiological performance, tempering claims that high respirasome levels are universally required (quantitative cross-link signal >50% decrease in respirasome-compatible links) (milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 12-15, milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 45-48, milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 48-50). Preprint URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.19.545560.
- Broader 2023–2024 supercomplex advances: Reviews highlight plant and yeast high-resolution I–III2 and III2–IV structures and emerging views that supercomplexes may serve structural/stability roles rather than strict catalytic substrate channeling, with evidence for 2D diffusion of cytochrome c at III–IV interfaces (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 13-14).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Disease modeling and therapeutic modulation: In an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model study, hippocampal UQCRC1 was downregulated; AAV-mediated UQCRC1 overexpression rescued lysosomal dysfunction and cognitive deficits via an AMPK-dependent mechanism, positioning UQCRC1 as a putative therapeutic target (peer-reviewed, 2025; included here for translational context) (zhang2025uqcrc1isa pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05171-2; Publication date: June 2025.
- Quality control and mitophagy: PD-focused work (search through September 2024; published 2026) links UQCRC1 deficiency to impaired PINK1-dependent mitophagy, suggesting that maintaining CIII integrity via UQCRC1 is relevant to mitochondrial quality control pathways implicated in neurodegeneration (li2026uqcrc1deficiencyimpairs pages 16-19). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-026-01262-6; Publication date: January 2026.

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Supercomplex plasticity and function: Authoritative review consensus in 2023 argues that supercomplexes are dynamic and their functional advantages (electron transfer efficiency, ROS modulation) are context- and tissue-dependent; rigorous structural mapping places UQCRC1 among the supernumerary subunits mediating CI–CIII matrix-side contacts (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 9-10, rakosnikova2023studyofetiopathology pages 22-27). This perspective aligns with in vivo Uqcrc1 KI findings indicating that reduced respirasomes do not necessarily compromise whole-organism physiology (milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 12-15, milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 45-48).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Respirasome abundance vs. function: In Uqcrc1 knock-in mice, respirasome-compatible cross-links decreased by more than 50% relative to wild type, yet metabolic cage measurements (VO2, VCO2, RER), exercise performance, and respiratory chain capacity were preserved, indicating maintained bioenergetic function despite diminished supercomplex stability (milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 12-15, milenkovic2023preservedrespiratorychain pages 45-48).
- Neurodegeneration models: In AD models, AAV-UQCRC1 overexpression reversed lysosomal enlargement and cognitive impairments; mechanistically, rescue required AMPK signaling (quantitative behavioral and histological improvements reported; see article for effect sizes and statistical tests) (zhang2025uqcrc1isa pages 1-2). In PD-focused analyses, UQCRC1 deficiency is connected to PINK1-dependent mitophagy impairment; genetic-association evidence is mixed across populations, reflecting ongoing debate (li2026uqcrc1deficiencyimpairs pages 16-19).

Pathway and mechanistic context
- Oxidative phosphorylation: UQCRC1 contributes structurally to Complex III function within the OXPHOS pathway, supporting the Q cycle and electron flow from ubiquinol to cytochrome c via its role in stabilizing subunits and interfaces; UQCRC1 is non-catalytic and does not perform redox chemistry (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13).
- Supercomplexes: UQCRC1 participates in CI–CIII2–CIV supercomplexes; CI–CIII matrix-side contacts include NDUFB4/NDUFB9 to UQCRC1, while membrane-side contacts involve NDUFA11 to CIII subunits UQCRB/UQCRQ/UQCRH. Supercomplex prevalence and functional necessity vary across physiological states and tissues (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 9-10).

Enzymatic activity and substrate specificity
- UQCRC1 has no demonstrated enzymatic activity within Complex III. It is a structural core protein; catalytic chemistry (Q cycle) is executed by cytochrome b, Rieske (UQCRFS1), and cytochrome c1 (CYC1). Thus, there is no substrate specificity attributable to UQCRC1; its contribution is architectural and organizational (kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 2-3, kohler2023thefunctionalsignificance pages 12-13).

Limitations and notes
- While 2023–2024 reviews and in vivo mouse data provide up-to-date structural and functional insights, some disease-model findings are from 2025–2026 and are included to illustrate translational directions; association studies in PD remain mixed and population-dependent (li2026uqcrc1deficiencyimpairs pages 16-19, zhang2025uqcrc1isa pages 1-2).
