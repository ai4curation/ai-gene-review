description: >-
  UQCRC1 encodes Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1 (Core protein I), one of
  two large structural/core subunits of mitochondrial Complex III (cytochrome
  bc1 complex, CIII2). It resides on the matrix side of the inner
  mitochondrial membrane, forming part of the obligate CIII dimer interface
  and contributing to matrix-side contacts with Complex I in respiratory
  supercomplexes (PMID:28844695). UQCRC1 belongs to the peptidase M16 family
  and is homologous to beta-MPP (the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial
  processing peptidase), but in mammals the catalytic residues required for
  metallopeptidase activity are not conserved and UQCRC1 has no demonstrated
  intrinsic peptidase activity (PMID:8407948, Kohler et al. 2023 EMBO Rep).
  In yeast, the homologous Cor1/Mas1 retains MPP processing activity within
  Complex III, but this function is less established in mammals where a
  separate MPP complex exists. UniProt notes the processing of UQCRFS1 as
  "probable" based on similarity. UQCRC1 does not participate directly in
  Q-cycle redox chemistry; its role is structural, stabilizing the CIII2 dimer
  and supporting supercomplex/respirasome formation. Mutations in UQCRC1 cause
  autosomal dominant parkinsonism with polyneuropathy (PKNPY, OMIM:619279)
  (PMID:33141179). The deep research review (UQCRC1-deep-research-falcon.md)
  confirms UQCRC1 as a non-catalytic structural core protein of CIII2.

      IBA annotation placing UQCRC1 as part_of the mitochondrial processing
      peptidase (MPP) complex. This is phylogenetically inferred based on
      homology to beta-MPP across the M16 peptidase family (PANTHER
      PTN000220169). In yeast, the Complex III core proteins Cor1 (UQCRC1
      homolog) and Cor2 (UQCRC2 homolog) have been shown to retain MPP-like
      processing activity within the assembled complex. However, in mammals,
      UQCRC1 and UQCRC2 have diverged from their MPP ancestors and there is
      no direct experimental evidence that mammalian UQCRC1 is part of an MPP
      complex or retains peptidase activity (PMID:8407948). UniProt describes
      this function as "Probable" based on similarity to yeast. Reactome
      R-HSA-9906017 notes that the peptidase responsible for cleaving UQCRFS1
      in humans is "unknown" with UQCRC1/UQCRC2 listed only as "possible
      candidates." The IBA inference from yeast is phylogenetically reasonable
      but likely does not accurately reflect mammalian biology.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The phylogenetic inference from yeast MPP is sound, but in mammals the
      catalytic residues for metallopeptidase activity are not conserved in
      UQCRC1. There is no direct experimental evidence that mammalian UQCRC1
      functions as part of an MPP complex. The Reactome entry R-HSA-9906017
      explicitly states the peptidase that cleaves UQCRFS1 in humans is
      "unknown." While the IBA annotation reflects evolutionary history, it
      may not reflect current mammalian function. Marking as UNDECIDED because
      this is an active area of investigation and the MPP activity in the
      context of CIII has not been definitively ruled out in mammals.

      UQCRC1 is a structural subunit of Complex III which is part of the
      respiratory electron transport chain. While UQCRC1 does not itself
      perform electron transfer chemistry, it is an integral structural
      component of the complex that does. This is a broader parent of the
      more specific GO:0006122 (mitochondrial electron transport, ubiquinol
      to cytochrome c) which is also annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Valid biological process annotation. As a structural core subunit of
      Complex III, UQCRC1 is involved in the respiratory electron transport
      chain, even though it does not directly participate in redox chemistry.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping (IPR011249,
      Metalloenz_LuxS/M16). The M16 peptidase family to which UQCRC1 belongs
      is characterized by a zinc-binding metallopeptidase active site.
      However, in mammalian UQCRC1, the catalytic zinc-binding residues are
      not conserved and there is no evidence that human UQCRC1 actually binds
      metal ions. The InterPro domain annotation reflects the evolutionary
      origin of the fold rather than the current function of the human protein.
      UniProt does not annotate any metal binding sites for UQCRC1, and the
      cryo-EM structures (PDB:5XTE) do not show bound metal ions at the
      ancestral active site.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is based on the M16 peptidase domain architecture, but
      mammalian UQCRC1 has lost the catalytic metal-binding residues that
      define active M16 family peptidases. There is no experimental evidence
      for metal ion binding by human UQCRC1, and UniProt does not annotate
      any metal binding sites. This represents a case where domain-based
      inference incorrectly transfers an ancestral function that has been
      lost in the mammalian lineage.

      IPI annotation for protein binding from the mitolamban (Mtlbn) study
      (Makarewich et al. 2022). WITH/FROM indicates P0DP99 (STMP1/mitolamban).
      Mtlbn is a small inner mitochondrial membrane microprotein that
      interacts with Complex III subunits and regulates complex assembly.
      The interaction with UQCRC1 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation
      and mass spectrometry. This is a meaningful interaction relevant to
      Complex III assembly and regulation.

    reason: >-
      While the UQCRC1-mitolamban interaction appears genuine and
      functionally relevant (mitolamban regulates Complex III assembly),
      "protein binding" is an uninformative term. A more appropriate
      annotation would capture the complex assembly context. Per curation

      IPI annotation for ubiquitin protein ligase binding from a Parkin

      cells with inducible Parkin expression and identified UQCRC1 as one of
      14 potential Parkin interactants. Nine of these interactants were
      directly involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Parkin is an E3
      ubiquitin ligase involved in mitophagy, and its interaction with
      mitochondrial OXPHOS subunits including UQCRC1 is consistent with
      Parkin's role in mitochondrial quality control. This is relevant to

      identified as one of multiple mitochondrial proteins interacting with
      Parkin. While not a core molecular function of UQCRC1, this
      interaction is biologically relevant, especially given the association
      of UQCRC1 mutations with parkinsonism (PMID:33141179). The term

      TAS annotation for quinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity from the
      original gene cloning paper (Hoffman et al. 1993). This is the
      molecular function of Complex III as a whole. UQCRC1 is a structural
      core subunit that does not itself catalyze the Q-cycle reaction but
      is required for complex integrity. For OXPHOS complex subunits, the
      GO convention is to use "contributes_to" qualifier for the
      complex-level molecular function. The GOA TSV shows this with an
      "enables" qualifier, which may be too strong for a non-catalytic
      subunit.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The quinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity (GO:0008121) is the

      non-catalytic structural core subunit that does not directly
      participate in the Q-cycle redox chemistry; the catalytic subunits
      are cytochrome b, UQCRFS1 (Rieske), and CYC1. For non-catalytic
      subunits of enzyme complexes, the appropriate qualifier should be
      "contributes_to" rather than "enables." The annotation itself is
      appropriate at the complex level but the qualifier should be changed
      to contributes_to if not already. Additionally, this annotation
      could be retained with that qualifier adjustment, recognizing that
      UQCRC1 contributes structurally to the activity without directly
      performing catalysis.
