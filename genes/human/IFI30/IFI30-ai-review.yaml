description: >-
  IFI30 encodes GILT (gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase), the primary
  lysosomal thiol reductase responsible for reducing disulfide bonds in the endocytic pathway.
  GILT contains a thioredoxin-like CXXC active site motif (Cys-72 and Cys-75 in human) essential
  for its catalytic activity. The protein is synthesized as a ~35 kDa precursor with mannose-6-phosphate
  targeting signals, enabling delivery to lysosomes where it is processed to a ~28 kDa mature form.
  GILT functions optimally at acidic pH (pH 4-5) and facilitates MHC class II antigen processing
  by reducing disulfide bonds in internalized antigens, enabling their unfolding and subsequent
  proteolytic processing. GILT is constitutively expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells
  (macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells) and is inducible by IFN-gamma in other cell types via
  STAT1 signaling (CIITA-independent). The protein can also form disulfide-linked dimers that
  retain enzymatic activity. Beyond its role in MHC class II antigen presentation, GILT also
  facilitates MHC class I cross-presentation of exogenous antigens containing disulfide bonds.

      PMID:3136170 provided early evidence for lysosomal localization of GILT,
      showing punctate fluorescence pattern in monocytes consistent with a
      vesicular subcellular location. While this was suggestive rather than
      definitive, it was later confirmed by PMID:10639150 which demonstrated
      mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated delivery to lysosomes.

          Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy reveals a punctate fluorescence
          pattern in monocytes consistent with a vesicular subcellular location.
          These data are consistent with IP-30 being a novel IFN gamma-inducible
          protein which may be lysosomal in location.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0015035 (protein-disulfide reductase activity) is more specific than GO:0016671
      because it specifies that the substrates are proteins. GILT specifically reduces
      disulfide bonds in endocytosed protein antigens to facilitate their unfolding
      and proteolytic processing.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This term is a more precise annotation than GO:0016671 because GILT's established
      physiological substrates are proteins - endocytosed antigens that require disulfide
      bond reduction for processing. PMID:10639150 demonstrated that GILT catalyzes
      disulfide bond reduction in proteins both in vivo and in vitro. The study showed
      efficient denaturation and reduction of internalized proteins is required for
      proteolysis in the lysosome. The child terms of GO:0015035 specify cofactors
      (glutathione, NAD(P)H), but GILT uses free cysteine transported into the lysosome
      as its electron donor, so the parent term GO:0015035 is most appropriate.

          GILT is a lysosomal thiol reductase that enzymatically reduces disulfide
          bonds of endocytosed proteins, facilitating antigen processing. Known
          GILT-dependent substrates include disulfide-rich model antigens (e.g.,
          hen egg lysozyme) and melanocyte differentiation antigens such as
          tyrosinase/TRP1.

      GILT is a lysosomal thiol reductase that catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds
      in proteins internalized into the endocytic pathway. It contains a thioredoxin-like
      CXXC active site motif (Cys-72 and Cys-75) essential for catalytic activity. The
      enzyme shows optimal activity at acidic pH (pH 4-5), consistent with its lysosomal
      localization.
