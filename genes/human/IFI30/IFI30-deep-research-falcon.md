## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P13284
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase; EC=1.8.-.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10639150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10852914}; AltName: Full=Gamma-interferon-inducible protein IP-30; AltName: Full=Legumaturain; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IFI30; Synonyms=GILT, IP30;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GILT family. .
- **Key Domains:** Interferon-induced_GILT. (IPR004911); GILT (PF03227)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IFI30" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IFI30' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IFI30** (gene ID: IFI30, UniProt: P13284) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan overview
- Verify identity and nomenclature to avoid gene symbol ambiguity and confirm Homo sapiens IFI30 (GILT) with correct domains/family. (hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2)
- Synthesize key concepts and definitions: enzymatic class, reaction chemistry, substrates, localization, induction, and pathway role. (hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)
- Incorporate quantitative and mechanistic details from focused primary/authoritative reviews and studies; highlight applications and clinical relevance. (macy2022roleofgilt pages 17-19, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 4-6)
- Provide citations with URLs and publication years. Embed an evidence table artifact summarizing key facts.

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Target: IFI30 encodes gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT; historically IP30), a member of the GILT family; the protein is an interferon-inducible lysosomal reductase with a thioredoxin-like CXXC active site. These attributes match the UniProt record P13284 for Homo sapiens. (hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2)
- Organism and family/domain context: Human GILT is an IFN-γ–inducible lysosomal enzyme localized to late endosomes/lysosomes, consistent with membership in a conserved family of lysosomal thiol reductases. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)

Key concepts and definitions
- Enzyme class and reaction: GILT is a lysosomal thiol reductase that reduces intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds in endocytosed proteins within the acidic endolysosomal pathway. This reduction exposes epitopes for subsequent proteolysis and loading onto MHC class II, and can facilitate cross-presentation to MHC class I. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)
- Active site and structural features: GILT contains a thioredoxin-like CXXC motif; both active-site cysteines are essential for catalysis and antigen processing, as demonstrated by mutational analyses. (hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)
- Maturation, trafficking, and pH dependence: GILT is synthesized as a ~35-kDa precursor with mannose-6-phosphate–dependent trafficking to endosomes, proteolytically processed to a ~28-kDa mature form that resides in late endosomes/lysosomes and exhibits maximal activity at acidic pH. A minor disulfide-linked dimeric precursor can be secreted by activated macrophages and retains activity. (hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 4-6)
- Cellular expression and induction: Constitutively expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs; monocytes/macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells), inducible in non-APC cell types by IFN-γ via STAT1; induction is CIITA-independent. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β can also upregulate GILT in certain contexts. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 6-7, macy2022roleofgilt pages 15-17)

Pathways and substrates
- Antigen processing (MHC II): By reducing disulfide bonds, GILT promotes unfolding and proteolysis of antigens, enabling peptide loading onto MHC class II. Known GILT-dependent substrates include disulfide-rich model antigens (e.g., hen egg lysozyme) and melanocyte differentiation antigens such as tyrosinase/TRP1. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, hastings2006functionalrequirementsfor pages 1-2)
- Cross-presentation (MHC I): Reduction by GILT can enhance transfer of endocytosed disulfide-containing antigens into the cytosol for class I cross-presentation in certain settings. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)
- Pathogen/toxin modulation: GILT reduces and thereby activates the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) of Listeria monocytogenes; trapping mutants capture GILT–LLO adducts, demonstrating substrate engagement in vivo. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 8-9)

Quantitative findings and statistics
- Self-peptidome effects: Quantitative MHC II peptidomics indicates a limited but detectable remodeling of the class II peptide repertoire by GILT; approximately 5% of peptides show higher abundance with GILT and ~2% are uniquely indicative of GILT status in certain analyses. (macy2022roleofgilt pages 17-19)
- Expression frequencies in melanoma lesions: Reported data show GILT+ malignant melanocytes in ~70% of primary and ~58% of metastatic melanoma samples; infiltrating APCs were uniformly GILT+, and halo nevi displayed GILT+ melanocytes in ~86% of cases. (macy2022roleofgilt pages 17-19)

Cellular and systems-level effects
- Redox homeostasis: GILT influences cellular redox, including glutathione balance (GSH/GSSG), mitochondrial function, and ROS production; it stabilizes SOD2 and can reduce inducible ROS in macrophages, linking lysosomal redox to broader cellular metabolism. (west2013expandingrolesfor pages 4-6, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 8-9)
- Secretion and inflammation: Activated macrophages can secrete an enzymatically active, disulfide-linked GILT precursor dimer; serum levels of precursor rise in systemic inflammatory settings, suggesting extracellular roles. (west2013expandingrolesfor pages 4-6)

Clinical and translational relevance
- Cancer immunology: High GILT expression and an intact MHC class II antigen presentation pathway associate with improved overall survival in melanoma cohorts; inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β) correlate with and can induce GILT in melanoma cells. These findings support GILT as a favorable biomarker for MHC II pathway competence and potential responsiveness to immune surveillance. (macy2022roleofgilt pages 17-19)
- Therapeutic concepts and applications: Induction or ectopic expression of GILT in tumor cells enhances generation of antigenic peptides for CD4+ T-cell recognition, motivating strategies (e.g., whole-cell vaccines or IFN-γ–based conditioning) to boost tumor immunogenicity. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10)
- Infectious disease: Because GILT can activate bacterial hemolysins like LLO, it emerges as a host factor in intracellular pathogen biology; conversely, GILT’s role in antigen processing may enhance adaptive responses to disulfide-rich pathogen antigens. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 8-9, hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2)

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews by Hastings & Cresswell and West & Cresswell establish GILT as the principal endocytic thiol reductase governing disulfide reduction in antigen processing and influencing cross-presentation and cellular redox, with broad implications across immunity to cancer and pathogens. (hastings2011disulfidereductionin pages 1-2, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 7-10, west2013expandingrolesfor pages 4-6)

Recent developments (note on 2023–2024 priority)
- While the foundational enzyme biochemistry and pathway role derive from earlier studies, recent translational observations captured in compiled sources emphasize the association of higher IFI30 expression with improved survival and with inflammatory cytokine signatures in melanoma, and document lesion-level frequencies of GILT positivity (primary/metastatic/halo nevi). Direct 2023–2024 human studies were limited in the retrieved evidence set, so the most current quantitative clinical links here derive from recent prior work. (macy2022roleofgilt pages 17-19)

Limitations and open questions
- Structural biophysics beyond the CXXC motif (e.g., redox potential values, high-resolution structures specific to human GILT) and definitive 2023–2024 human clinical datasets were not available in the retrieved context. Future research should refine substrate scope/kinetics at lysosomal pH, quantify redox network interactions, and evaluate IFI30 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy.

*Table: A concise evidence table summarizing verified identity, biochemical function, structural features, localization, regulation, pathway roles, substrates, quantitative effects, clinical associations, and applications of human IFI30/GILT with citations to source excerpts (context IDs).*

Conclusions
Human IFI30 encodes GILT, the interferon-γ–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase that catalyzes disulfide bond reduction in the endolysosomal pathway. Its CXXC active site and acidic pH optimum support reduction of disulfide-rich antigens, enabling MHC class II presentation and sometimes cross-presentation. GILT is produced as a M6P-targeted 35-kDa precursor and processed to a 28-kDa lysosomal enzyme; it is constitutively expressed in APCs and inducible by IFN-γ (STAT1, CIITA-independent) and other inflammatory cytokines. Quantitatively, GILT modestly reshapes the MHC II peptidome and is detected in a majority of primary melanoma lesions, with higher expression associating with improved survival and with inflammatory cytokines. These properties motivate applications as a biomarker of intact MHC II antigen processing and as a lever to enhance tumor immunogenicity, while its roles in cellular redox and pathogen toxin activation underscore broader immunobiology.
