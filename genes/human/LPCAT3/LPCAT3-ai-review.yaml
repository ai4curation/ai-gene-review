description: Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 5 (LPCAT3/MBOAT5) is an ER-localized
  membrane-bound O-acyltransferase that catalyzes the reacylation step of the Lands
  cycle, preferentially incorporating polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially arachidonic
  acid) into the sn-2 position of lysophospholipids. LPCAT3 shows broad substrate
  specificity, acting on lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine
  (LPE), and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), with highest activity toward LPC. The enzyme
  is highly expressed in liver, intestine, and adipose tissue. LPCAT3 plays critical
  roles in phospholipid remodeling for membrane composition, VLDL and chylomicron
  assembly, SREBP-1c signaling regulation, and contributes to the ferroptosis pathway
  through generation of PUFA-containing phospholipids that serve as substrates for
  lipid peroxidation.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This is the core enzymatic activity of LPCAT3 (LPCAT = lysophosphatidylcholine
      acyltransferase). LPCAT3 catalyzes the transfer of acyl groups from acyl-CoA
      to 1-acyl-lysophosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidylcholine. This activity
      has been demonstrated directly in multiple biochemical studies (PMID:18195019,
      PMID:18772128, PMID:18782225).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary named enzymatic activity of LPCAT3. Multiple independent
      studies have demonstrated this activity experimentally. Zhao et al. 2008 showed
      that "Membranes from HEK293 cells overexpressing LPCAT3 showed significantly
      increased LPCAT activity" (PMID:18195019). Gijon et al. 2008 confirmed "MBOAT5
      prefers lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-PS to incorporate linoleoyl and arachidonoyl
      chains" (PMID:18772128). The IBA annotation is phylogenetically supported and
      consistent with all biochemical evidence.

  review:
    summary: Reactome annotation for AGPAT-like activity. However, LPCAT3 acts on

    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: This term refers to activity on 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic

      activity (PMID:18782225). The Reactome pathway may be capturing a related reaction

  title: Identification and characterization of a major liver lysophosphatidylcholine
    acyltransferase.
  findings:
  - statement: Identified LPCAT3 as the major hepatic lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase.
      LPCAT3 belongs to the MBOAT family, is ER-localized, and shows substrate preference
      for unsaturated fatty acids. Knockdown in Huh7 cells virtually eliminates membrane
      LPCAT activity.
    supporting_text: we report here the identification of a novel LPCAT, which we
      named LPCAT3. LPCAT3 belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT)
      family... In a human hepatoma Huh7 cells, RNA interference-mediated knockdown
      of LPCAT3 resulted in virtually complete loss of membrane LPCAT activity

  title: Lysophospholipid acyltransferases and arachidonate recycling in human neutrophils.
  findings:
  - statement: Characterized substrate specificity of MBOAT5/LPCAT3 using MS-based
      assays. MBOAT5 prefers LPC and lyso-PS with linoleoyl and arachidonoyl acyl-CoA
      donors. Activity is thimerosal-sensitive. Implicates MBOAT5 in arachidonate
      recycling and regulation of free AA for leukotriene synthesis.
    supporting_text: MBOAT5 prefers lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-PS to incorporate
      linoleoyl and arachidonoyl chains. MBOAT7 is a lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase
      with remarkable specificity for arachidonoyl-CoA. MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 are particularly
      susceptible to inhibition by thimerosal.

  title: Member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family encodes a lysophospholipid
    acyltransferase with broad substrate specificity.
  findings:
  - statement: Demonstrated that MBOAT5/LPCAT3 is a lysophospholipid acyltransferase
      acting on LPC, LPS, and LPE. Knockdown reduced PUFA incorporation into PC, PS,
      and PE. Overexpression increased LPC, LPS, and LPE acyltransferase activities
      but not LPIAT or LPAAT activities.

      acyltransferase acting preferentially on LPC, LPS and LPE.

  title: Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 knockdown-mediated liver lysophosphatidylcholine
    accumulation promotes very low density lipoprotein production by enhancing microsomal
    triglyceride transfer protein expression.
  findings:
  - statement: Demonstrated that LPCAT3 is the major hepatic isoform. Knockdown increases
      LysoPC, decreases certain PC species, and reduces hepatic triglycerides. Paradoxically,
      knockdown increases plasma TG and apoB through enhanced VLDL secretion via increased
      MTP expression.
    supporting_text: we found that LPCAT3 is the major hepatic isoform, and its knockdown
      significantly reduces hepatic LPCAT activity... these results indicate that
      hepatic LPCAT3 modulates VLDL production by regulating LysoPC levels and MTP
      expression

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the relative contribution of LPCAT3 vs other LPCAT isoforms in
    different tissues and cell types?
- question: How does the CEPT1-LPCAT3 interaction regulate ferroptosis sensitivity
    in different disease contexts?
- question: Are there human genetic variants in LPCAT3 associated with metabolic disease,
    NASH, or ferroptosis-related conditions?
suggested_experiments:
- description: CRISPR knockout studies in human hepatocytes to directly assess LPCAT3
    contribution to ferroptosis sensitivity
  hypothesis: LPCAT3 knockout will confer resistance to ferroptosis inducers by reducing
    PUFA-PE substrate availability for lipid peroxidation.
- description: Lipidomics profiling of AA-PE/AdA-PE species in LPCAT3 knockdown cells
    to quantify the ferroptosis substrate pool
  hypothesis: LPCAT3 knockdown will specifically reduce AA-PE and AdA-PE species that
    serve as ferroptosis substrates.
- description: Structural studies with different lysophospholipid substrates to understand
    headgroup selectivity
  hypothesis: The substrate binding pocket geometry determines preference for LPC
    over LPE and LPS substrates.
