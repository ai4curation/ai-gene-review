description: AIP (AH receptor-interacting protein, also known as XAP2/ARA9) is an
  FKBP-type immunophilin homolog that functions as a co-chaperone in the HSP90-AHR
  (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) complex and as a cytosolic factor mediating mitochondrial
  preprotein import via interaction with the import receptor TOMM20. It contains an
  N-terminal PPIase-like domain (lacking catalytic PPIase activity) and C-terminal TPR
  repeats that mediate interactions with HSP90 and TOMM20. AIP exhibits chaperone-like
  (holdase) activity, suppressing thermal aggregation of substrate proteins. Germline
  mutations in AIP predispose to pituitary adenomas (PITA1).

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation was inferred by logical inference from AIP having
      transcription coactivator activity (GO:0003713). AIP/XAP2 was shown by Meyer et al.
      (PMID:9447995) to enhance AhR-driven transcription from a dioxin-responsive element
      by about twofold. This is an indirect consequence of AIP stabilizing the AHR-HSP90
      complex in the cytosol, not a direct transcriptional activation function. The
      annotation is logically consistent with the coactivator annotation but represents
      a secondary downstream effect rather than a core function of AIP.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: AIP does enhance AhR-driven transcription, but this is an indirect effect
      of its co-chaperone function in stabilizing the AHR-HSP90 complex, not a direct
      transcriptional regulatory activity. The annotation is technically correct as an
      inference from the coactivator annotation, but represents a downstream biological
      consequence rather than core function.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation was automatically assigned based on InterPro domain
      IPR001179 (FKBP-type PPIase domain). While AIP does contain an FKBP-type PPIase-like
      domain, multiple studies have shown this domain is catalytically inactive. Laenger
      et al. (PMID:19375531) explicitly demonstrated that the PPIase-like region of XAP2
      is enzymatically inactive. The domain has diverged from catalytically active FKBP
      family members and lacks key residues for PPIase catalysis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: AIP contains an FKBP-type PPIase-like domain that is catalytically inactive
      (PMID:19375531). The InterPro domain match is structurally correct but the functional
      annotation of PPIase activity is incorrect for this protein. This is a well-documented
      case of a domain homolog that has lost enzymatic activity.

      AIP functioning as a cytosolic co-chaperone in the AHR-HSP90 complex and as a
      cytosolic factor in mitochondrial preprotein import.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation of GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) was assigned
      by ARBA machine learning models. GO:0051082 is being obsoleted (go-ontology issue
      30962). While AIP does have experimentally demonstrated chaperone-like activity
      that prevents thermal aggregation of substrate proteins (PMID:14557246), the
      appropriate replacement term is GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which
      better captures the holdase/chaperone function rather than implying simple binding
      to unfolded proteins. The IEA annotation here is redundant with the IDA annotation
      from the same gene also annotated to GO:0051082 based on PMID:14557246.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. The experimental data from PMID:14557246
      demonstrates genuine chaperone-like (holdase) activity for AIP, including suppression
      of thermal aggregation of rhodanese and citrate synthase in vitro. The replacement
      term GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) accurately captures this function.
      Additionally, this IEA annotation is redundant with the experimentally supported
      IDA annotation from PMID:14557246 on the same gene.

    summary: This IPI annotation records the interaction between AIP (XAP2) and PDE2A
      (UniProtKB:O00408). De Oliveira et al. (PMID:17329248) identified XAP2 as a major
      PDE2A-interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid screening and mapped the binding
      site to the GAF-B domain of PDE2A. This is a functionally significant interaction
      as PDE2A binding to XAP2 inhibits TCDD- and cAMP-induced nuclear translocation of
      AhR in hepatocytes. The interaction is relevant to AIP function in cAMP signaling
      regulation. However, protein binding is uninformative; the more specific annotation
      GO:0036004 (GAF domain binding) already captures this interaction.

    summary: This IPI annotation records the interaction between AIP (XAP2) and HSP90AB1

      Hsp90 through its TPR motif and that this interaction is required for XAP2 to
      inhibit glucocorticoid receptor activity. The AIP-HSP90 interaction is one of the

      binding to the MEEVD motif at the C-terminus of HSP90. This is a core interaction

      (UniProtKB:P00533) from a study on HDAC6 regulation of EGFR trafficking

      and EGFR is likely detected in a high-throughput context and may represent an
      indirect interaction mediated through the HSP90 chaperone machinery, since EGFR
      is a known HSP90 client. Without more specific evidence for a direct, functional

      which is known to interact with various signaling proteins) or may represent a

  review:
    summary: This IDA annotation to GO:0051604 (protein maturation) cites Yano et al.
      (PMID:14557246). The paper demonstrates that AIP functions as a cytosolic factor
      mediating mitochondrial preprotein import. AIP maintains preproteins in an
      import-competent conformation and facilitates their import into mitochondria via
      interaction with TOMM20. Overexpression of AIP enhanced mature OTC production
      (processing of pOTC to mature OTC by mitochondrial import and cleavage), and
      depletion reduced it. While the end result is maturation of mitochondrial
      preproteins (signal peptide cleavage), AIP does not directly participate in the
      proteolytic processing. A more accurate annotation would be GO:0070585 (protein
      localization to mitochondrion), which is already annotated.

  review:
    summary: This IDA annotation to GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is based on
      Yano et al. 2003 (PMID:14557246), which demonstrated that AIP has genuine
      chaperone-like (holdase) activity. The key evidence is from thermal aggregation
      suppression assays (Figure 6 of the paper). AIP suppressed thermal aggregation
      of rhodanese at 55C and citrate synthase at 43C in a dose-dependent manner. At
      equimolar concentrations, GST-AIP suppressed rhodanese aggregation at early time
      points, and completely suppressed citrate synthase aggregation. This activity was
      additive or synergistic with Hsc70. The paper also showed AIP binds specifically
      to mitochondrial preproteins via their presequences, maintaining them in an
      import-competent (unfolded) conformation. The chaperone activity is mechanistically
      linked to AIP's role in mitochondrial import, keeping preproteins unfolded for
      translocation through the TOM complex. GO:0051082 is being obsoleted
      (go-ontology issue 30962), and the activity described is better captured by
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which describes binding to proteins to
      assist the folding process, encompassing holdase activity that prevents
      aggregation of unfolded substrates.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. The experimental evidence from PMID:14557246
      clearly demonstrates a chaperone-like holdase activity for AIP, not merely passive
      binding to unfolded proteins. AIP actively prevents thermal aggregation of model
      substrates (rhodanese and citrate synthase) and maintains mitochondrial preproteins
      in import-competent conformations. The replacement term GO:0044183 (protein folding
      chaperone) is the appropriate successor, capturing the active nature of this
      chaperone function. The evidence is robust -- the aggregation suppression assays
      used purified GST-AIP protein with proper GST-only controls, showed dose-dependent
      effects, and the physiological relevance was confirmed by in vivo import assays
      showing AIP maintains preprotein import competency.

      as a classical transcription coactivator. AIP enhances AhR signaling indirectly by
      stabilizing the cytosolic AHR-HSP90 complex, improving AhR receptivity for ligand
      and/or nuclear targeting. AIP does not directly contact DNA or recruit
      transcriptional machinery. The term "transcription coactivator activity" implies
