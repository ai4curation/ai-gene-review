# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q12857
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Nuclear factor 1 A-type; Short=NF1-A; Short=Nuclear factor 1/A; AltName: Full=CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor; Short=CTF; AltName: Full=Nuclear factor I/A; Short=NF-I/A; Short=NFI-A; AltName: Full=TGGCA-binding protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NFIA; Synonyms=KIAA1439;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the CTF/NF-I family. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-
- **Key Domains:** CTF/NFI. (IPR000647); CTF/NFI_DNA-bd-dom. (IPR020604); CTF/NFI_DNA-bd_CS. (IPR019739); CTF/NFI_DNA-bd_N. (IPR019548); MAD_homology1_Dwarfin-type. (IPR003619)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NFIA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NFIA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NFIA** (gene ID: NFIA, UniProt: Q12857) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human NFIA (UniProt Q12857)

Target identity verification
- Gene/protein: NFIA (Nuclear factor I A-type; NFI-A), Homo sapiens. NFIA belongs to the classical NFI/CTF transcription factor family. Family members share a conserved N‑terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain and a C‑terminal transactivation domain, consistent with the UniProt annotation for Q12857 (CTF/NFI family). NFIA functions as a nuclear, chromatin-associated transcription factor that interfaces with major co-regulatory complexes (e.g., Mediator, SWI/SNF) (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 49-52, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 39-42, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114).

Key concepts and definitions
- DNA-binding and motif specificity: NFI proteins (including NFIA) bind the palindromic consensus TTGGC(N5)GCCAA, with tolerance for spacer variation. Binding occurs as homodimers or heterodimers among NFI paralogs, mediated by the conserved N‑terminal DBD. Structural modeling and literature synthesis identify multiple conserved DNA-contact regions within the DBD (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 130-133).
- Dimerization and paralog interplay: NFIA can form homo- and heterodimers with other NFI proteins and participates in extensive TF–TF networks. NFIA exhibits numerous experimentally supported physical interactions with other TFs and co-regulators, including Mediator; NFI motifs are enriched at enhancers, consistent with enhancer-centric regulation (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 49-52).
- Subcellular localization and interactome: Proximity-labeling proteomics in human cell lines identified NFIA as a nuclear/chromatin-associated factor with a large cell type–specific interactome (total 602 high-confidence interactors across two lines; 421 unique to HEK293, 75 unique to U251 glioma, 53 shared). NFIA associates with SWI/SNF/BAF, INO80, SAGA and other remodeling complexes, supporting roles in chromatin organization and transcriptional control (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114).

Mechanisms and biological roles (current understanding)
- Regulation of other TFs and genome occupancy: NFIA modulates the genomic binding landscape of SOX2. siRNA-mediated NFIA depletion led to a redistribution of SOX2 sites (loss of 6,921 sites, 362 unchanged, 1,341 gained), and reduced SOX2 reporter activity, indicating NFIA’s influence on TF engagement and enhancer logic (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 114-116).
- Gliogenesis and CNS development: NFIA is a central regulator of gliogenesis, promoting astrocyte lineage commitment and coordinating with SOX factors (e.g., SOX9). Family-level evidence supports antagonistic programs between NFIA and SOX10 shaping astrocyte versus oligodendrocyte trajectories. NFIA (with NFIB/NFIX) is expressed in neural progenitors and supports glial differentiation programs (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 39-42, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 141-143).
- Glioblastoma dependencies and core programs: Integrated single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic analyses reveal a shared NFIA/NFIB-mediated core transcriptional program across glioma cell states; functional silencing of NFIA or NFIB inhibits glioblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo, indicating tumor-state dependencies despite heterogeneity (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 46-49).
- Adipocyte thermogenesis and inflammation: NFIA acts as a key transcriptional regulator of brown and beige adipocyte gene programs. In mouse adipocytes, genetic activation of NFIA upregulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, enhances thermogenic programs, and represses inflammatory cytokine genes (e.g., Ccl2), improving glucose homeostasis and protecting against diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance (PNAS, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2308750120) (hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Systems-level TF networks and NFIA interactome: Recent interactomics and modeling work elaborated NFIA’s extensive and context-specific interactome, its interactions with chromatin remodelers, and its role in shaping the genomic occupancy of other TFs (SOX2). The work quantified differential interactors across lines and provided specific counts and redistribution metrics for SOX2 upon NFIA perturbation (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 114-116).
- Glioma single-cell multi-omics: 2023 integrative studies defined a conserved NFIA/B-driven core program in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytoma, with perturbations showing growth inhibition, strengthening the case for NFIA as a disease-relevant dependency (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 46-49).
- Adipose biology and metabolism: 2023 mouse studies demonstrated therapeutic potential of augmenting NFIA in adipocytes to concurrently elevate mitochondrial/thermogenic programs and suppress inflammation, with systemic metabolic benefits under high-fat diet (hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology research use cases: NFIA/NFIB core program mapping is informing candidate dependencies in GBM preclinical models, with functional knockdown showing growth inhibition. This supports inclusion of NFI-directed perturbation in glioma target-validation pipelines and potentially in combination strategies that drive differentiation (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 46-49).
- Metabolic disease models: In vivo proof-of-concept that increasing adipocyte NFIA activity improves glucose tolerance and resists diet-induced obesity in mice suggests a route to therapeutic modulation of adipose thermogenesis and inflammation; translation will require cell type–specific targeting and safety studies (hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- TF regulatory logic and chromatin context: The observed large, cell type–specific NFIA interactome and its effects on another master TF (SOX2) position NFIA as a higher-order regulator of enhancer usage and cell identity. Interaction with SWI/SNF/BAF and Mediator is consistent with a role in nucleosome remodeling and enhancer-promoter communication, as seen for lineage TFs in development and cancer (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 114-116, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 49-52).
- CNS development and gliogenesis: Convergent developmental and tumor data indicate that NFIA’s canonical role in glial fate is co-opted in gliomas, where it contributes to progenitor-like and differentiated-like states; dependency on NFIA/NFIB highlights the potential vulnerability of this axis, though context-specific oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles necessitate careful biomarker-guided strategies (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 39-42, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 46-49, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 49-52).
- Metabolism: The capacity of NFIA to reprogram adipocyte enhancer landscapes to favor oxidative and thermogenic gene expression while suppressing inflammatory enhancers suggests that selective pharmacologic modulation of NFIA activity could offer a dual anti-inflammatory and pro-thermogenic approach in metabolic syndrome, pending translational validation (hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Interactome size and specificity: 602 high-confidence NFIA interactors (421 unique in HEK293; 75 unique in U251-MG; 53 shared) from proximity labeling proteomics; extensive association with SWI/SNF/BAF, SAGA, INO80 (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114).
- TF occupancy remodeling: NFIA knockdown redistributed SOX2 genomic binding, with 6,921 lost, 362 unchanged, and 1,341 gained sites; SOX2 reporter activity was significantly reduced (p<0.001) after NFIA depletion (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 114-116).
- Metabolic protection in vivo: Adipocyte-specific NFIA activation in mice increased oxidative phosphorylation gene expression and protected against high-fat diet–induced obesity and glucose intolerance while repressing inflammatory cytokine genes in adipocytes (study-level finding; see URL) (hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).

Open and partially supported areas (scope constraints)
- Because the present evidence set does not include citable context IDs for specific clinical genetics/events (e.g., 1p31–p32 NFIA microdeletion phenotypes; RAF1–NFIA fusions in pilocytic astrocytoma; Müller glia reprogramming upon Nfia/b/x deletion), these topics are not detailed here. They warrant separate sourcing and validation in future updates when primary literature can be incorporated with explicit citations.

Where NFIA functions in the cell
- Localization: NFIA functions in the nucleus on chromatin, partnering with chromatin remodelers and co-activator complexes to regulate enhancer activity and transcription programs (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 112-114, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 49-52).
- Pathways: In neural lineages, NFIA cooperates with SOX factors and other gliogenic regulators; in gliomas, it contributes to a core transcriptional program across states; in adipocytes, NFIA promotes thermogenic/mitochondrial gene programs while repressing inflammatory gene expression, interacting with lineage-determining nuclear receptors and co-regulators (pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 39-42, pinar2024istanbultechnicaluniversity★ pages 46-49, hiraike2023nfiainadipocytes pages 1-2).
