description: 'NFIA (Nuclear Factor I A-type) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription
  factor belonging to the CTF/NF-I family. It binds the palindromic TGGCA motif (consensus
  TTGGC(N5)GCCAA) as a homodimer or heterodimer with other NFI family members. NFIA
  functions as a nuclear transcriptional activator critical for gliogenesis and astrocyte
  differentiation. In developing CNS, NFIA promotes the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis
  transition and astrocyte fate specification, cooperating with SOX9 and STAT3 signaling.
  NFIA has extensive cell type-specific interactomes including SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
  complexes and Mediator, and modulates the genomic binding landscape of other transcription
  factors like SOX2. Beyond neural development, NFIA regulates thermogenic gene programs
  in adipocytes and is involved in diverse developmental processes including limb morphogenesis
  and urinary tract development.'

    label: regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: NFIA is a well-established RNA polymerase II transcription factor that
      regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating
      transcription. This IBA annotation is supported by experimental evidence showing
      NFIA activates transcription through RNA polymerase II machinery and is phylogenetically
      conserved across NFI family members.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents a core molecular function of NFIA. The deep research confirms
      NFIA functions as a nuclear transcriptional activator that regulates RNA polymerase
      II-dependent transcription. Experimental studies including PMID:17010934 demonstrate
      direct transcriptional activation activity.

        factors for adenovirus DNA replication"
core_functions:
- description: NFIA functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor
    that binds the palindromic TTGGC(N5)GCCAA motif in gene regulatory regions and
    activates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. It operates as a homodimer
    or heterodimer to positively regulate target gene expression.

suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: NFIA directly regulates astrocyte-specific gene expression programs during
    gliogenesis
  description: While the role of NFIA in astrocyte differentiation is well-documented
    in the literature (GO:0048711 positive regulation of astrocyte differentiation,
    GO:0014015 positive regulation of gliogenesis, GO:0021780 glial cell fate specification),
    additional ChIP-seq and functional validation experiments could identify direct
    NFIA target genes in astrocyte differentiation and map the complete NFIA regulatory
    network during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition.
  experiment_type: ChIP-seq, RNA-seq in NFIA knockout/overexpression models, functional
    reporter assays
