description: ISCA2 is a mitochondrial A-type iron-sulfur cluster assembly 
  protein of the HesB/IscA family that functions in the late-stage maturation of
  mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins. It works in concert with ISCA1 and IBA57 to 
  assemble [4Fe-4S] clusters by reductive fusion of two [2Fe-2S] clusters 
  donated by GLRX5. The electron input for this fusion reaction is provided by 
  ferredoxin FDX2 via FDXR. ISCA2 forms homodimers and heterodimers with ISCA1 
  (the ISCA1:ISCA2 complex), and also forms an oxidation-resistant 
  [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterocomplex with IBA57 (the ISCA2:IBA57 complex). Biallelic
  loss-of-function mutations in ISCA2 cause Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions 
  Syndrome type 4 (MMDS4), characterized by early-onset leukodystrophy, 
  hyperglycinemia, impaired protein lipoylation, and mtDNA depletion.

    review:
      summary: ISCA2 is confirmed to localize to mitochondria based on 
        phylogenetic inference (IBA) and multiple experimental studies. The 
        protein functions in the mitochondrial matrix as part of the late-stage 
        ISC assembly pathway (PMID:22323289, PMID:25347204).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Mitochondrial localization is well-established for ISCA2. The IBA 
        annotation is consistent with experimental evidence showing ISCA2 
        functions in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly. Direct 
        experimental evidence (IDA from PMID:22323289) also confirms this 
        localization.

    review:
      summary: ISCA2 is directly involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly, 
        specifically in the late-stage [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly pathway. The 
        IBA annotation appropriately captures this core function 
        (PMID:25347204).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While ISCA2's role is specifically in [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly, 
        the general term iron-sulfur cluster assembly is still correct and 
        appropriate. The ISCA1:ISCA2 heterodimeric complex receives [2Fe-2S] 
        clusters from GRX5 and assembles them into [4Fe-4S] clusters 
        (PMID:25347204). The IBA annotation from PANTHER is valid.

    review:
      summary: ISCA2 binds iron ions as part of its [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] 
        cluster-binding capacity. The iron binding is integral to its function 
        in Fe-S cluster assembly.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Iron ion binding is inherent to ISCA2's function as an Fe-S 
        cluster assembly protein. The protein coordinates iron through conserved
        cysteine residues (Cys79, Cys144, Cys146) as documented in UniProt and 
        structural studies. This is a valid but somewhat generic annotation that
        is subsumed by the more specific cluster binding annotations.

      summary: Direct experimental evidence that ISCA2 is part of the

        assembles [4Fe-4S] clusters.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a key annotation capturing ISCA2's core function. The

        functional unit for [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly.
