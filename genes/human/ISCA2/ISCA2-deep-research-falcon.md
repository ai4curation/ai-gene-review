## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q86U28
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Iron-sulfur cluster assembly 2 homolog, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=HESB-like domain-containing protein 1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ISCA2; Synonyms=HBLD1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HesB/IscA family. .
- **Key Domains:** FeS_biogenesis. (IPR000361); FeS_cluster_insertion. (IPR016092); FeS_cluster_insertion_CS. (IPR017870); HesB-like_dom_sf. (IPR035903); Fe-S_biosyn (PF01521)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ISCA2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ISCA2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ISCA2** (gene ID: ISCA2, UniProt: Q86U28) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: ISCA2 matches UniProt Q86U28. Literature consistently identifies human ISCA2 as a mitochondrial A-type iron–sulfur (Fe–S) assembly protein of the HesB/IscA family that functions in late steps of [4Fe-4S] cluster biogenesis, partnering with ISCA1 and IBA57 (IUBMB Life 2022, doi:10.1002/iub.2597; Trends Biochem Sci 2020, doi:10.1016/j.tibs.2020.02.001). The organism is Homo sapiens, mitochondrial localization is established by functional studies and disease phenotypes linked to mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] maturation defects (Human Mutation 2018, doi:10.1002/humu.23396). These align with the FeS_biogenesis/HesB-like domain context provided. (maio2020outliningthecomplex pages 10-12, alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 1-5)

Comprehensive research report on human ISCA2 (Q86U28)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- ISCA2 is a mitochondrial A-type Fe–S assembly factor in the HesB/IscA family. It acts as a late-acting “secondary carrier” in the ISC pathway, coordinating with ISCA1 and IBA57 to assemble [4Fe-4S] clusters from [2Fe-2S] precursors initially built on ISCU and transferred via GLRX5. Review articles position ISCA2 within this late maturation module and link ISCA2 variants to Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunction Syndrome type 4 (MMDS4; OMIM #616370). URLs: IUBMB Life (Jan 2022) https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2597; Trends in Biochemical Sciences (May 2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2020.02.001. (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2, maio2020outliningthecomplex pages 10-12)
- Cellular localization: ISCA2 functions in the mitochondrial matrix, evidenced by its role in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] client maturation and the mitochondrial bioenergetic defects observed upon loss-of-function. URL: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 1-5, alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21)
- Functional definition: ISCA2 participates in reductive coupling of two [2Fe-2S] units into [4Fe-4S] clusters in conjunction with ISCA1 and IBA57, using electrons from ferredoxin FDX2 via FDXR, with GLRX5 as the physiological [2Fe-2S] donor. URL: PNAS (Aug 2020) https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1)

2) Mechanism and current understanding (with recent developments)
- Late ISC reconstitution: A fully reconstituted system showed that GLRX5 delivers [2Fe-2S] to the ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57 module, which requires electron input from mitochondrial FDX2 (not FDX1) via FDXR to drive reductive fusion to [4Fe-4S]. This reconstitution activated mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] aconitase without artificial reductants, establishing physiological specificity and the necessity of IBA57 in the reaction. URL: PNAS 2020 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1)
- Structural/organizational insights: SAXS and integrative modeling indicate ISCA2 is dimeric (apo) and forms a [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterocomplex with monomeric IBA57 that is oxidation-resistant and capable of reactivating apo-aconitase. The ISCA2–IBA57 complex shares a [2Fe-2S] cluster but, with only four cysteines, is not itself a [4Fe-4S] assembly site; conversely, an ISCA2 homodimer with “facing cysteines” could support [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly, suggesting alternative routes and repair roles. URL: Scientific Reports (Dec 2019) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55313-5. (nasta2019structuralpropertiesof pages 7-8, nasta2019structuralpropertiesof pages 10-11)
- GLRX5 vs direct [2Fe-2S] delivery: The same reconstitution work showed rapid, spontaneous transfer of [2Fe-2S] from GLRX5 to [2Fe-2S] apoproteins without additional ISC factors, highlighting that ISCA2’s primary role is not direct [2Fe-2S] delivery but participation in [4Fe-4S] cluster formation. URL: PNAS 2020 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1)
- Context-dependent essentiality debate: Reviews highlight mixed in vivo data—some knockdowns in mouse skeletal muscle and neurons suggest ISCA1 is essential for [4Fe-4S] biogenesis, whereas ISCA2/IBA57 are less critical in those specific contexts, implying tissue- or pathway-specific roles. These analyses reinforce that ISCA1/ISCA2/IBA57 form a dynamic late ISC network whose precise client spectrum is still being resolved. URLs: Trends Biochem Sci (May 2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2020.02.001; IUBMB Life (Jan 2022) https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2597. (maio2020outliningthecomplex pages 10-12, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2)
- 2023–2024 updates: A 2024 review aggregates MMDS insights and reaffirms the ISCA2–IBA57 heterocomplex and MMDS4 phenotype; it also notes decreased lipoylation as a consistent biochemical sign of failed [4Fe-4S] incorporation in LIAS-dependent pathways. URL: 2024 review (Bargagna 2024; review DOI not provided in excerpt). (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysforb pages 16-20, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 16-20)

3) Pathways and substrates/clients
- Upstream: [2Fe-2S] synthesis on ISCU and relay to GLRX5.
- Late-acting module: ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57 uses GLRX5-donated [2Fe-2S] and FDX2/FDXR electrons for reductive fusion to [4Fe-4S]; this step is differentiated from [2Fe-2S] delivery, which does not require the ISCA module. URL: PNAS 2020 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1)
- Clients: [4Fe-4S]-dependent mitochondrial enzymes such as aconitase and lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) are impacted when ISCA2 is deficient, leading to reduced protein lipoylation and downstream defects in PDH, KGDH, and the glycine cleavage system. URLs: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396; Biomedicines (Aug 2021) https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9080989. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2)

4) Disease associations, clinical phenotypes, and biomarkers
- MMDS4 due to ISCA2: Bi-allelic ISCA2 missense variants, notably c.229G>A (p.Gly77Ser), cause an infantile-onset leukodystrophy characterized by developmental regression, hypotonia, spasticity, optic atrophy, and white-matter disease, with biomarkers including hyperglycinemia, elevated lactate/pyruvate, and low CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; loss of protein lipoylation is characteristic. URL: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396; Biomedicines (Aug 2021) https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9080989. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 1-5, alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2)
- Mitochondrial and bioenergetic deficits: Patient fibroblasts and ISCA2 knockdown models show decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired basal and maximal respiration, reduced ATP production (~50% of control), diminished spare respiratory capacity (~25% of control), and decreased activities/proteins of ETC complexes—particularly complex II and IV (to ~60–70% of control)—with mitochondrial network fragmentation and mtDNA depletion (~25% of control). URL: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 13-17, alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21)
- Case counts and 2024 update: A 2024 review reports approximately 24 MMDS4 patients described to date, with consistent early-onset neurological phenotypes and decreased levels of lipoylated proteins. 2015 reports identified homozygous p.Gly77Ser in seven patients; the accumulated total is summarized in 2024. URL: 2024 review (Bargagna 2024; DOI not provided in excerpt). (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysforb pages 16-20, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 16-20)

5) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: The ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57 node is required for assembling [4Fe-4S] clusters in mitochondria; GLRX5 is the [2Fe-2S] donor; electrons are supplied by the FDX2–FDXR system; [2Fe-2S] transfer to [2Fe-2S] targets proceeds without this late module. This delineates a mechanistic division of labor in Fe–S biogenesis. URL: PNAS (Aug 2020) https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1)
- Tissue/context specificity: Reviews emphasize a dynamic, context-dependent network, with some models indicating ISCA1 prioritization in certain tissues, and ISCA2/IBA57 forming an oxidation-resistant complex likely supporting specific clients or stress conditions. URLs: Trends Biochem Sci 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2020.02.001; IUBMB Life 2022 https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2597; Scientific Reports 2019 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55313-5. (maio2020outliningthecomplex pages 10-12, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2, nasta2019structuralpropertiesof pages 7-8)

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostics: Recognition of the MMDS biochemical signature—elevated CSF glycine and lactate/pyruvate, defective protein lipoylation, and characteristic MRI features—guides genetic testing (targeted panels/WES) for ISCA2 variants. Systematic reviews consolidate these markers and support standardized diagnostic workflows. URL: Biomedicines (Aug 2021) https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9080989. (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2)
- Functional validation: Cell-based assays of lipoylation status, respiratory complex activities, and mtDNA copy number in patient-derived fibroblasts or knockdown lines are used to validate pathogenicity and define the mechanistic consequences of ISCA2 variants. URL: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21)
- Research tools: The reconstituted late ISC system and oxidation-resistant ISCA2–IBA57 complexes enable mechanistic dissection of client maturation and stress responses. URLs: PNAS (Aug 2020) https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003982117; Scientific Reports (Dec 2019) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55313-5. (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1, nasta2019structuralpropertiesof pages 7-8)

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- MMDS4 prevalence in literature: ~24 patients summarized by 2024, most with homozygous or compound-heterozygous ISCA2 variants, notably Gly77Ser as a recurrent founder allele; early onset (first year) with psychomotor impairment, spasticity, optic atrophy; decreased lipoylation common. 2015 initial series: seven patients with Gly77Ser. URL: 2024 review (Bargagna 2024; DOI not provided in excerpt). (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysforb pages 16-20, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 16-20)
- Quantitative cellular phenotypes in ISCA2 deficiency: In patient fibroblasts, ATP production ~50% of control, spare respiratory capacity ~25% of control; ETC complex II and IV activities reduced to ~60–70% of control; mtDNA copy number ~25% of control; robust loss of protein lipoylation. URL: Human Mutation (Jan 2018) https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.23396. (alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 13-17, alaimo2018loss‐of‐functionmutationsin pages 17-21)

8) Open questions and debates
- Essentiality and client specificity: The ISCA1 vs ISCA2 essentiality discrepancy in specific tissues suggests specialization and/or redundancy under certain physiological conditions; defining exact client sets for the ISCA2–IBA57 vs ISCA1–ISCA2 routes remains a priority. URLs: Trends Biochem Sci (May 2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2020.02.001; IUBMB Life (Jan 2022) https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.2597. (maio2020outliningthecomplex pages 10-12, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2)
- Structural resolution: The ISCA2–IBA57 complex is characterized by SAXS and modeling; higher-resolution structures in human mitochondria and direct visualization of [4Fe-4S] assembly on ISCA dimers in situ would refine mechanistic models.

*Table: Concise table summarizing primary studies and reviews on human ISCA2 (Q86U28), highlighting structural, mechanistic, and clinical findings relevant to late mitochondrial Fe–S ([4Fe-4S]) biogenesis and MMDS4; citations link to gathered evidence (context IDs).*

Conclusions
Human ISCA2 (Q86U28) is a mitochondrial A-type ISC protein of the HesB/IscA family that cooperates with ISCA1 and IBA57 to assemble [4Fe-4S] clusters from GLRX5-derived [2Fe-2S] units, driven by electrons from FDX2/FDXR. It does not appear to be required for direct [2Fe-2S] delivery to [2Fe-2S] clients. Structural work supports an oxidation-resistant [2Fe-2S]-bridged ISCA2–IBA57 complex and suggests alternative assembly/repair routes via ISCA2 homodimers. Pathogenic ISCA2 variants cause MMDS4 with early-onset leukodystrophy, loss of protein lipoylation, bioenergetic failure, and mtDNA depletion. Recent reviews (2024) tally ~24 reported cases and consolidate a consistent biomarker/phenotypic spectrum.
