  Thrombospondin-1 is a secreted matricellular glycoprotein that mediates cell-matrix
  interactions and modulates key signaling pathways (angiogenic, TGF-beta, NO/cGMP) in
  the extracellular environment. It functions as a negative regulator of angiogenesis
  via CD36 receptor engagement, an activator of latent TGF-beta1, and an inhibitor of
  nitric oxide signaling via CD47. TSP1 is stored in platelet alpha granules and
  released upon activation, where it promotes hemostasis and vasoconstriction.

        TSP1 is a well-established component of the extracellular matrix. The deep research
        confirms that TSP1 is "secreted into the ECM or circulation" and "associates with
        the ECM and cell surfaces by binding to proteoglycans and integrins" [PMID:6341993].
        This is a core localization for TSP1.

        Strong phylogenetic and experimental evidence supports TSP1 localization to the

        Negative regulation of angiogenesis is one of the best-documented core functions
        of TSP1. The protein was first identified as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor in 1990.
        TSP1 suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, migration, survival, and can induce
        endothelial apoptosis via CD36 receptor engagement [PMID:10613822].

        This represents a core function of TSP1. The IBA annotation is well-supported by

      summary: >
        TSP1 is involved in angiogenesis, though primarily as a negative regulator. The
        broader term "angiogenesis" is appropriate as TSP1 modulates this process. However,
        a more specific term (negative regulation of angiogenesis) better captures its function.

        While the more specific term "negative regulation of angiogenesis" is more accurate,
        this broader term is not incorrect. TSP1 is indeed involved in angiogenesis as a
        key regulator. The IEA annotation from keyword mapping is acceptable.

        TSP1 has complex effects on the immune system. Evidence suggests TSP1 primarily
        has immunosuppressive effects - negatively regulating cytokine production through

        This annotation is too broad and somewhat misleading. TSP1's predominant role is

        through CD47/CD36 signaling and limits T-cell/NK cell activation. While TSP1 can

        TSP1 binds latent TGF-beta1 through its type-1 repeats (TSRs), which is

        TGF-beta binding is a core molecular function of TSP1. The type-1 repeats

      TSP1 inhibits plasmin and other serine proteases through its type-1 repeats. This
      antiplasmin activity protects the forming blood clot from premature fibrinolysis
      and is important for TSP1's hemostatic function.
