description: OLA1 (Obg-like ATPase 1) is a universally conserved P-loop NTPase belonging
  to the YchF subfamily of the Obg family. Despite evolutionary relationship to GTPases,
  OLA1 is biochemically an ATPase that preferentially hydrolyzes ATP over GTP due
  to a mutation in its G4 motif. OLA1 acts as a critical regulator of translation
  through ribosome binding and interaction with eIF2, modulates cellular stress responses
  including heat shock and oxidative stress, and interacts with BRCA1/BARD1 at centrosomes
  for genome stability maintenance.
