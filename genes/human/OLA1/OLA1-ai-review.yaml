description: OLA1 (Obg-like ATPase 1) is a universally conserved P-loop NTPase belonging to the YchF subfamily of the Obg family. Despite evolutionary relationship to GTPases, OLA1 is biochemically an ATPase that preferentially hydrolyzes ATP over GTP due to a mutation in its G4 motif. OLA1 acts as a critical regulator of translation through ribosome binding and interaction with eIF2, modulates cellular stress responses including heat shock and oxidative stress, and interacts with BRCA1/BARD1 at centrosomes for genome stability maintenance.

  review:
    summary: Phylogenetically inferred cytoplasmic localization is strongly supported by experimental evidence showing OLA1 is predominantly a cytosolic protein that performs its ribosome binding and translation regulatory functions in the cytoplasm.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is well-supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence. OLA1 functions primarily in the cytoplasm where it interacts with ribosomes, eIF2, and performs its core ATPase and translation regulatory activities.
