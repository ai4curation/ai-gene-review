### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IFIT3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IFIT3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IFIT3** (gene ID: IFIT3, UniProt: O14879) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity/domain verification: The target is human IFIT3 (UniProt O14879), an interferon-stimulated member of the IFIT family characterized by multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that mediate protein–protein interactions. Recent literature confirms IFIT3’s TPR-driven assembly with IFIT1/IFIT2 and its cytoplasmic role in antiviral responses, consistent with the UniProt description and IFIT family/domain annotations (TPR-like helical repeats) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report on human IFIT3 (O14879)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Definition and family: IFIT3 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3) is a non-enzymatic, cytoplasmic interferon-stimulated protein in the IFIT family (IFIT1/2/3/5). It contains multiple TPR motifs that enable specific hetero-oligomerization with other IFITs, especially IFIT1 and IFIT2 (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).
- Primary functional context: IFIT3 functions as an adaptor/regulator within IFN-driven antiviral programs. It assembles with IFIT1 and IFIT2 to tune recognition of non-self RNA caps and to inhibit translation of viral RNAs lacking appropriate cap modifications (Geng et al., RNA, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124; published Jul 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).

2) Molecular function and mechanisms
- Assembly with IFIT1/IFIT2 and consequences for cap recognition: Biophysical analysis shows IFIT1 binds IFIT3 with nanomolar affinity via C-terminal motifs, while IFIT1–IFIT2 and IFIT2–IFIT3 interactions are weaker (one order of magnitude), yet IFIT2/IFIT3 form a stable heterodimer capable of recruiting IFIT1 to generate IFIT1/2/3 complexes (~150–200 kDa). These assemblies shape the selectivity and avidity of cap0 RNA recognition by IFIT1 (Geng et al., RNA, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124; published Jul 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).
- Discrimination of self vs non-self caps: Kinetic binding studies demonstrate that the cap-adjacent m6Am (m7Gpppm6Am) is an especially strong “self” signature—more effective than cap1 alone—at blocking IFIT complex binding, whereas internal 5′UTR m6A is not recognized and does not contribute to IFIT-mediated translation repression. IFIT1 recognition relies on the triphosphate bridge and cap-proximal 2′-O methylation status, integrating with CMTR1-dependent cap1 formation on host transcripts (Geng et al., RNA, 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).
- IFIT3 control of IFIT1 stability and specificity: Experimental depletion/KO shows that IFIT3 is required for IFIT1 protein accumulation after IFN stimulation without altering IFIT1 mRNA; in the absence of IFIT3, IFIT1 becomes ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded. Direct binding to IFIT3 protects IFIT1 from degradation, and a C-terminal IFIT3 mutant defective in IFIT1 binding fails to rescue IFIT1 stability. Functionally, IFIT3 complexing prevents off-target inhibition of certain self ISG mRNAs by IFIT1, indicating IFIT3 tunes IFIT1 specificity to favor non-self RNA restriction (Fleith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.17.688928; posted Nov 2025) (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 1-4, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 8-11, fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 21-23).

3) Pathways and signaling integration
- RIG-I/MDA5–MAVS axis: Review synthesis indicates IFIT3 binds components of the RLR pathway, promoting RIG-I structural rearrangements, stabilizing MAVS–TBK1 interactions, and enhancing early IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN-β expression. This places IFIT3 as a positive modulator of RLR-driven antiviral signaling (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).
- cGAS–STING and NF-κB cross-talk: The same synthesis links IFIT3 to enhanced responsiveness within cGAS–STING signaling and to promotion of NF-κB–dependent cytokine outputs (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β), suggesting broader integration beyond translational control (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).

4) Subcellular localization and regulation
- Localization: IFIT3 is a cytoplasmic protein and can associate with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling complex (MAVS), consistent with roles at the mitochondria-associated antiviral hub (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).
- Induction/regulation: IFIT3 is robustly induced downstream of IFNAR–JAK–STAT/ISGF3 following type I interferon stimulation and viral sensing. It may influence STAT1 phosphorylation dynamics and sustains IFN transcription via IRF3/IRF7 interactions, creating a positive feedback loop (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4).
- Proteostatic control of IFIT1 by IFIT3: Proteasome inhibition (MG132) rescues IFIT1 in IFIT3-deficient settings, and IFIT3–IFIT1 binding reduces IFIT1 ubiquitination, demonstrating post-translational regulation by IFIT3 (Fleith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.17.688928; posted Nov 2025) (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 8-11).

5) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Cap-structure specificity refined: 2024 biophysical work delineates how cap-proximal m6Am and 2′-O methylation modulate IFIT1/IFIT3/IFIT2 complex binding, emphasizing that m6Am is a particularly strong “self” mark preventing IFIT engagement. This adds nuance to the classical cap0 vs cap1 model and quantifies complex assembly and RNA-binding kinetics (Geng et al., RNA, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124; published Jul 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).
- Proteome-level IFN responses: High-resolution proteomics comparing IFN-β vs IFN-γ responses in distinct cell types include IFIT3 among induced ISGs and delineate distinct interaction networks and antiviral impacts by IFN class (context for IFIT3 induction patterns), complementing transcript-level studies (Journal of Proteome Research, 2024). While not IFIT3-specific mechanistic work, it situates IFIT3 within validated IFN response signatures (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Cancer biology and potential biomarker/therapeutic relevance:
  • Colorectal cancer (CRC): ETV7 is upregulated in CRC and transcriptionally activates IFIT3; ETV7 overexpression promotes proliferation, migration, and cell-cycle progression while decreasing apoptosis in CRC cells. Knockdown of IFIT3 reverses ETV7-driven phenotypes, and IFIT3 overexpression rescues the effects of ETV7 silencing, establishing an ETV7→IFIT3 axis that drives CRC progression. TCGA analyses corroborate clinical relevance (Chai et al., Functional & Integrative Genomics, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10142-023-01282-y; published Jan 2024) (chai2024etv7promotescolorectal pages 1-2).
  • Broader tumor-immunity links: Review synthesis highlights IFIT3’s modulatory roles in the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and inflammation-mediated tumor growth, nominating IFIT3 as a potential immunotherapy target (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic synthesis: Frontiers in Immunology 2025 provides an expert synthesis positioning IFIT3 as a central adaptor/regulator that (i) stabilizes IFIT1 and modulates its specificity, (ii) enhances RLR–MAVS signaling, and (iii) participates in cGAS–STING and NF-κB cross-talk, integrating detection and effector arms of innate immunity (Wu et al., 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).
- Experimental mechanistic advances: Biophysical dissection of IFIT complex assembly and cap-structure selectivity in 2024 provides quantitative grounding for how IFIT3 tunes IFIT1’s RNA recognition in human cells (Geng et al., RNA, 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 10-11).

8) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- IFIT complex interactions and kinetics: IFIT1–IFIT3 binding occurs with nanomolar affinity; IFIT1–IFIT2 and IFIT2–IFIT3 are approximately an order of magnitude weaker. The presence of cap-proximal m6Am on RNA substantially reduces binding by IFIT complexes compared with cap1 alone, whereas internal 5′UTR m6A has no effect on IFIT binding or translation repression by IFITs (Geng et al., RNA, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.080011.124; published Jul 2024) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).
- Post-translational stabilization of IFIT1 by IFIT3: Loss of IFIT3 increases IFIT1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; IFIT3 mutants that cannot bind IFIT1 fail to protect IFIT1, whereas proteasome inhibition (MG132) rescues IFIT1 levels in IFIT3-deficient conditions (Fleith et al., bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.17.688928; posted Nov 2025) (fleith2025ifit3controlsifit1 pages 8-11).
- CRC disease model data: Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human CRC cells establish that IFIT3 mediates ETV7-driven proliferation and migration, with reciprocal rescue upon IFIT3 manipulation, and TCGA analysis supports upregulation and correlation in patient samples (Chai et al., Functional & Integrative Genomics, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10142-023-01282-y; published Jan 2024) (chai2024etv7promotescolorectal pages 1-2).

9) Subcellular site of action and biochemical role
- Site: Cytoplasm with functional association to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling hub (MAVS) for RLR signaling, and cytosolic complexes with IFIT1/IFIT2 for RNA recognition and translation repression (Wu et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1515718; published Feb 2025) (wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2, geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2).
- Biochemical role: IFIT3 functions as a TPR-based adaptor/regulator that stabilizes IFIT1, enhances its cap0 RNA recognition and specificity within IFIT assemblies, and integrates upstream sensing (RLR/cGAS–STING) with downstream effectors (translation blockade of non-self RNAs) (Geng et al., RNA, 2024; Wu et al., 2025) (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).

Limitations and open questions
- While 2024 work refines RNA cap recognition rules and complex stoichiometry, the relative contributions of IFIT2–IFIT3 vs IFIT1–IFIT3 complexes against diverse viruses and the full landscape of post-translational regulation (beyond IFIT1 stabilization) remain active areas of research. Some pathway-integration details cited are from 2025 expert syntheses and should be complemented with additional 2023–2024 primary studies as they become available (geng2024caprelatedmodificationsof pages 1-2, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 2-4, wu2025ifit3acrucial pages 1-2).
