description: >-
  IFIT3 (ISG60/RIG-G) is an interferon-stimulated gene encoding a TPR domain-containing
  protein that serves as a scaffold and regulatory component in innate antiviral immunity.
  IFIT3 functions primarily by forming heterocomplexes with IFIT1 and IFIT2: it stabilizes
  IFIT1 protein, enhances IFIT1's cap-0 RNA binding specificity, and negatively regulates
  IFIT2's pro-apoptotic function. The IFIT2-IFIT3 heterodimer specifically targets viral
  mRNAs with short 5' UTRs (<50 nucleotides). IFIT3 also amplifies interferon signaling
  through MAVS-TBK1 stabilization and STING pathway activation. The protein localizes to
  cytoplasm and mitochondria. Unlike IFIT2, which promotes apoptosis, IFIT3 negatively
  regulates apoptosis and has been implicated in tumor progression through PD-L1 upregulation.
