## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O95257
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 gamma; AltName: Full=Cytokine-responsive protein CR6; AltName: Full=DNA damage-inducible transcript 2 protein; Short=DDIT-2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GADD45G; Synonyms=CR6, DDIT2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GADD45 family. .
- **Key Domains:** GADD45. (IPR024824); Ribosomal_eL30-like_sf. (IPR029064); Ribosomal_eL8/eL30/eS12/Gad45. (IPR004038); Ribosomal_L7Ae (PF01248)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GADD45G" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GADD45G' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GADD45G** (gene ID: GADD45G, UniProt: O95257) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan overview
- Objective 1 (identity verification): Completed. Target is human GADD45G (GADD45γ; aliases CR6/DDIT2), UniProt O95257, a small (~18 kDa) member of the GADD45 family. Literature retrieved refers to the same human gene/protein and roles (publication URLs and details below) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).
- Objectives 2–3 (evidence gathering and extraction): Completed. Recent primary work (2024) and authoritative reviews (2008; 2025) support mechanistic roles, localization, pathways, regulation, and disease links. Key findings are summarized below and in the embedded evidence table.
- Objectives 4–6: Addressed within the report (applications, synthesis, submission).

Gene/protein identity and family context
- Name and aliases: Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 gamma (GADD45G; CR6; DDIT2). Member of the GADD45 family of small, acidic stress-response proteins that function as nuclear stress sensors (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3). Recent human and mouse work in hematologic malignancy explicitly investigates GADD45G (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Stress sensor and adaptor: GADD45G integrates stress signals to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints, apoptosis/survival decisions, and stress-activated kinase pathways through protein–protein interactions (PCNA, p21, CDK1/cyclin B1, and MAPK components) (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3, liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 3-4).
- Cell-cycle checkpoint control: GADD45G inhibits CDK1/cyclin B1 kinase activity, contributing to S and G2/M checkpoint control following genotoxic stress, without necessarily dissociating the complex (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 3-4).
- MAPK pathway coupling: GADD45G can activate the upstream MAP3K4/MTK1 (MEKK4) to stimulate p38 and JNK MAPK signaling, especially in immune contexts (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).

Molecular mechanisms and biochemical function
- Direct and inferred interactions:
  - CDK1/cyclin B1: Inhibition of kinase activity (checkpoint enforcement) (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 3-4).
  - MAP3K4/MTK1: Activation linking GADD45G to p38/JNK signaling (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).
  - PCNA and p21: Nuclear interaction partners aligning with roles in DNA replication/repair coordination and growth arrest (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3).
- Hematopoietic mechanism (2024): In MPN models, GADD45G haploinsufficiency engages a RAC2–PAK1–PI3K–AKT axis. Co-immunoprecipitation identified RAC2 as a direct GADD45G interactor (not RAC1), with perinuclear colocalization; pathway readouts showed increased p-PI3K and p-AKT(Ser473) upon GADD45G loss (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 3-4, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).

Subcellular localization
- Predominantly nuclear stress sensor with nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution inferred by interactions with nuclear proteins (PCNA, p21) and perinuclear colocalization with RAC2 in hematopoietic cells (review and 2024 study) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008, https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15; Nature Communications, Apr 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 3-4).

Upstream regulation of GADD45G
- Stress and cytokines: Induced by genotoxic stress and cytokine signaling; can be p53-dependent or independent (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3, liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).
- Hematologic disease regulators: In MPN patient cells, the JAK2V617F driver mutation and histone deacetylation contribute to reduced GADD45G expression (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).

Pathway placement
- p38/JNK MAPK: GADD45G sits upstream of stress-activated MAPKs via MTK1/MEKK4, connecting to cytokine responses and T-cell signaling (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).
- PI3K–AKT: In hematopoiesis, GADD45G loss activates PI3K–AKT via RAC2–PAK1, with biochemical and genetic evidence in mice and human MPN cell lines (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 3-4, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).
- NF-κB/inflammatory cross-talk: Family-level evidence places GADD45 proteins at the intersection of stress MAPKs and inflammatory signaling, shaping cytokine outputs in immune cells (Frontiers in Immunology, Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069; Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 15-15, liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN):
  - Human evidence: GADD45G expression is significantly reduced (~twofold lower) in bone marrow mononuclear cells and CD34+ cells from essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera patients relative to healthy controls; JAK2V617F mutation and histone deacetylation are implicated in this repression (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).
  - Mouse genetics: Gadd45g haploinsufficiency alone increases growth and self-renewal of myeloid-biased HSCs, drives myeloid-skewed differentiation, and produces transplantable MPN-like disease; reintroduction of Gadd45g prolongs survival (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 3-4).
  - Mechanism and quantitative omics: In c-kit+ bone marrow cells from Gadd45g+/− MPN mice, RNA-seq identified 7,098 differentially expressed genes (3,665 up; 3,433 down), with enrichment for PI3K–AKT signaling; Westerns showed increased p-PI3K and p-AKT(Ser473) in mouse HSPCs and human MPN cell lines upon GADD45G knockdown (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).
  - Pharmacologic modulation: The allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 improved disease metrics in Gadd45g-deficient MPN models, with representative between-group p-values reported (e.g., p≈0.010–0.022 for selected comparisons), supporting targetable downstream signaling (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Hematologic malignancy: The 2024 work provides a functional rationale that reduced GADD45G acts as a pathogenic factor in MPNs and that PI3K–AKT pathway inhibition (e.g., MK-2206) can mitigate phenotypes in preclinical models; these data suggest translational avenues for patient stratification (low GADD45G expression) and pathway-targeted therapy (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).
- Renal injury and nephrology biomarkers: Family-level analyses show GADD45 genes (including GADD45G) upregulated in renal ischemia–reperfusion injury, and urinary GADD45γ has been associated with IgA nephropathy progression, pointing to potential clinical biomarker applications (Frontiers in Immunology, Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 15-15).
- Immune modulation and oncology: GADD45G participates in T-cell cytokine responses and anti-tumor immunity in model systems via MAPK signaling, informing immuno-oncology hypotheses (review) (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Foundational model: Liebermann and Hoffman (2008) propose that outcome selection (cell-cycle arrest vs apoptosis vs survival) depends on the degree of stress and on which GADD45 family member engages specific partners (PCNA, p21, CDK1/cyclin B1, MAPKs), providing a framework for GADD45G’s context-dependent effects (Journal of Molecular Signaling, Sep 2008; https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-2187-3-15) (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3).
- Inflammation-focused review (2025): Ma et al. synthesize evidence that GADD45 proteins modulate innate/adaptive immunity, regulating cytokines and apoptosis in injury models, and highlight disease-relevant regulation of AKT and MAPKs. Within this, GADD45G is discussed in renal disease and cytokine regulation contexts (Frontiers in Immunology, Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1513069) (ma2025growtharrestand pages 12-13, ma2025growtharrestand pages 15-15).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Reduction in patient samples: Approximately twofold lower GADD45G mRNA in CD34+ and BMMNCs from MPN patients vs controls; protein levels similarly reduced (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).
- Differential expression: 7,098 DEGs (3,665 up; 3,433 down) in c-kit+ BM from Gadd45g+/− MPN mice, with enrichment for PI3K–AKT signaling (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).
- Biochemical signaling: Increased p-PI3K and p-AKT(Ser473) with GADD45G knockdown in human MPN lines and in Gadd45g+/− mouse HSPCs (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).
- Pharmacologic rescue: AKT inhibition with MK-2206 produced statistically significant improvements in selected disease endpoints in Gadd45g-deficient MPN models (example p-values ~0.010–0.022 reported in figures) (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47297-2) (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11).

*Table: Concise, source-linked summary table of human GADD45G (UniProt O95257) covering identity, molecular functions, localization, upstream regulators, pathway placement, disease associations, and translational applications, with citations to the contextual evidence used (context IDs).*

Notes on symbol ambiguity and organism
- The symbol “GADD45G” in all cited sources refers to the human or mouse ortholog of the GADD45γ protein consistent with UniProt O95257 identity; aliases CR6/DDIT2 are concordant. No conflicting symbols or non-human genes with the same symbol were used to support claims (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 1-3, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).

Open questions and limitations
- Direct, human-protein biochemical structures and high-resolution domain–partner interfaces for GADD45G remain limited in the surveyed sources; many mechanistic insights come from family-level reviews and functional assays. While classic evidence supports MTK1/MEKK4 coupling and CDK1/cyclin B1 inhibition, further 2023–2024 structural or proteomic mapping specific to human GADD45G would sharpen targetability. Family-level inflammatory roles implicate NF-κB/MAPK crosstalk; precise, GADD45G-specific upstream regulators beyond JAK2V617F/HDAC repression in MPN warrant additional contemporary validation (liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7, ma2025growtharrestand pages 15-15, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2).

Conclusion
Human GADD45G (GADD45γ/CR6/DDIT2) is a stress-inducible adaptor that enforces cell-cycle checkpoints (via CDK1/cyclin B1 inhibition), couples to stress MAPK cascades (via MTK1/MEKK4 → p38/JNK), and, in hematopoiesis, constrains a RAC2–PAK1–PI3K–AKT axis critical for myeloproliferative disease control. In MPNs, GADD45G is downregulated in patient hematopoietic compartments, with JAK2V617F and histone deacetylation implicated in repression; genetic and pharmacologic data position PI3K–AKT as a tractable downstream node. Family-level evidence links GADD45G to inflammatory signaling and kidney injury biomarkers, with ongoing translational potential in oncology and nephrology (zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 1-2, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 3-4, zhang2024gadd45ginsufficiencydrives pages 10-11, liebermann2008gadd45instress pages 6-7, ma2025growtharrestand pages 15-15).
