description: GADD45G (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible protein GADD45 gamma) is a stress-inducible
  protein that functions as an activator of the MTK1/MEKK4 (MAP3K4) kinase, leading to downstream p38
  and JNK MAPK pathway activation. The protein is induced by genotoxic stress (UV radiation, chemical
  mutagens) and mediates G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest through inhibition of the cdc2/cyclin B1 complex.
  GADD45G forms homodimers through a central four-helix bundle interface, which is essential for its growth-inhibitory
  function. The protein also interacts with PCNA and p21, coordinating DNA damage responses with cell
  cycle control. Beyond stress responses, GADD45G plays essential roles in male sex determination (via
  regulation of SRY expression through p38/GATA4), thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (via p38/ERRgamma
  pathway), and neurite outgrowth during brain development (via p38/CDC25B pathway). GADD45G functions
  as a tumor suppressor and is frequently epigenetically silenced in cancers including lymphomas and hepatocellular
  carcinoma.

  review:
    summary: ACCEPT. The seminal paper by Takekawa and Saito (1998) demonstrated nuclear localization
      of GADD45G. The crystal structure (PDB:3FFM) confirms nuclear function through homodimerization
      and interaction with nuclear proteins like PCNA. This is consistent with its role in DNA damage
      response pathways and cell cycle checkpoint control.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is well-established for GADD45G based on direct experimental evidence
      and is consistent with its interactions with nuclear proteins (PCNA, p21, cdc2/cyclin B1) and its
      role in DNA damage checkpoints.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytoplasmic localization is consistent with GADD45G's role in activating cytoplasmic MTK1/MEKK4
      kinase to stimulate p38 and JNK MAPK cascades. The protein functions in both nuclear (DNA damage
      checkpoint) and cytoplasmic (MAPK signaling) compartments.

    summary: ACCEPT. Core function. Takekawa and Saito (1998) showed that expression of GADD45-like genes

      suppressed by coexpression of a dominant inhibitory MTK1 mutant.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Pro-apoptotic function is a core activity of GADD45G, mediated through activation of the stress-responsive
      p38 and JNK MAPK pathways via MTK1/MEKK4. This is supported by deep research evidence from the falcon
      review noting the role in apoptosis/survival decisions.

    reason: p38 MAPK cascade activation is a core function of GADD45G with multiple physiological roles

  review:
    summary: ACCEPT. Well-characterized function. Gantner et al. (2014) showed that Gadd45g knockout mice
      have defects in UCP1 induction and thermogenic response to cold. GADD45G is rapidly induced by cold/norepinephrine
      in BAT and activates p38 MAPK, which then activates ERRbeta/gamma to induce UCP1 and oxidative capacity.
      This ISS annotation from mouse data is well-supported.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Thermogenesis regulation is a specialized physiological function of GADD45G acting through
      the conserved p38 MAPK pathway. The mouse knockout phenotype provides strong evidence that this
      function is conserved in mammals.

  title: GADD45γ regulates the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue.
  findings:

      which then activates ERRbeta/gamma transcriptional function.

      and ERRgamma transcriptional function.

  title: Crystal structure of human Gadd45γ [corrected] reveals an active dimer.
  findings:
  - statement: GADD45G forms homodimers through a four-helix bundle interface involving conserved helices
      alpha2 and alpha3.
    supporting_text: a unique dimer formed via a bundle of four parallel helices, involving the most conserved
      residues among the Gadd45 isoforms.
  - statement: Dimerization is required for growth-inhibitory activity and apoptosis.
    supporting_text: dimerization of Gadd45γ
  - statement: The central region of the GADD45G dimer contains a highly acidic patch that mediates interactions
      with PCNA, cdc2, and p21.
    supporting_text: a conserved and highly acidic patch on the dimer surface, including the important
      residues Glu87 and Asp89, is a putative interface for binding proteins related to the cell cycle,
      DNA repair and apoptosis.
core_functions:
- description: GADD45G binds to the N-terminal region of MTK1/MEKK4 (MAP3K4) near its autoinhibitory domain,
    relieving autoinhibition and allowing MTK1 to interact with and phosphorylate its substrate MKK6.
    This activation leads to downstream p38 and JNK MAPK pathway activation.

      in vivo and in vitro.
- description: GADD45G inhibits cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase activity through direct binding to cdc2 (not cyclin
    B1), stabilizing an inactive conformation of the complex without disrupting the complex structure.
    This leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.
