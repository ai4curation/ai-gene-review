description: >-
  GADD45G (Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible protein GADD45 gamma) is a
  stress-inducible protein that functions as an activator of the MTK1/MEKK4
  (MAP3K4) kinase, leading to downstream p38 and JNK MAPK pathway activation.
  The protein is induced by genotoxic stress (UV radiation, chemical mutagens)
  and mediates G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest through inhibition of the
  cdc2/cyclin B1 complex. GADD45G forms homodimers through a central four-helix
  bundle interface, which is essential for its growth-inhibitory function.
  The protein also interacts with PCNA and p21, coordinating DNA damage
  responses with cell cycle control. Beyond stress responses, GADD45G plays
  essential roles in male sex determination (via regulation of SRY expression
  through p38/GATA4), thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (via p38/ERRgamma
  pathway), and neurite outgrowth during brain development (via p38/CDC25B
  pathway). GADD45G functions as a tumor suppressor and is frequently
  epigenetically silenced in cancers including lymphomas and hepatocellular
  carcinoma.
