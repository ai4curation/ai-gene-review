## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8WW22
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 4; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DNAJA4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** DnaJ. (IPR012724); DnaJ_C. (IPR002939); DnaJ_domain. (IPR001623); DnaJ_domain_CS. (IPR018253); DNJA1/2-like. (IPR044713)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DNAJA4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DNAJA4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DNAJA4** (gene ID: DNAJA4, UniProt: Q8WW22) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene research report: Human DNAJA4 (UniProt Q8WW22; gene DNAJA4)

1. Target identity verification (critical disambiguation)

DNAJA4 in this report refers to the human gene DNAJA4 encoding “DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 4,” a class A HSP40/J-domain protein (JDP) that functions as a co-chaperone of Hsp70/Hsc70 systems. Across independent human-focused sources, DNAJA4 is consistently discussed as a mammalian class A HSP40/JDP and not as an unrelated or non-human protein; it is also placed in the cytoplasmic Hsp70–JDP network by systematic interactome mapping, aligning with UniProt’s domain expectations for a DnaJ/Hsp40 family member. (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

Evidence constraints: In the retrieved full-text snippets, no source explicitly spells out the UniProt accession Q8WW22; therefore, the UniProt-to-literature mapping is supported indirectly by concordant gene symbol (DNAJA4), organism context (human/mammals), and class-A JDP domain architecture/localization described in authoritative reviews and interaction mapping studies. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

2.1. What DNAJA4 is (protein class and core biochemical function)

DNAJA4 is a class A HSP40/J-domain protein (JDP). Class A JDPs are characterized by the canonical domain architecture: an N-terminal J-domain (containing the conserved HPD motif that stimulates Hsp70 ATPase activity), a Gly/Phe-rich region, C-terminal substrate-binding β-barrel domains, a dimerization region, and a class-A-specific zinc-finger insertion in the C-terminal substrate-binding region. This domain organization underlies the core biochemical role of JDPs as Hsp70 co-chaperones: they help recruit substrates (misfolded or nascent proteins) to Hsp70 and stimulate Hsp70’s ATPase cycle to drive client binding and processing. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

A neurodegeneration-focused review situates DNAJA4 within the DNAJA subfamily and depicts the DNAJA subfamily’s domain composition (J-domain, G/F region, Zn-binding region, and C-terminal client-binding/dimerization-related region), reinforcing that DNAJA4 belongs to the canonical class A JDP group. (zarouchlioti2018dnajproteinsin pages 2-3)

2.2. Subcellular localization

A compiled table of mammalian DNAJA-family proteins reports DNAJA4 localization as cytosolic (“Cyt”). (teo2020dnaja3acochaperone pages 1-4)

Additionally, systematic proximity-labeling and affinity-purification mapping of the human Hsp70 network assigns DNAJA4 to the cytoplasmic class A JDP set and shows its proximity/interaction patterns cluster with other cytoplasmic chaperone-system components, consistent with a primarily cytoplasmic role. (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

2.3. Pathway context: The Hsp70–JDP–NEF proteostasis system

Large-scale interactome profiling of the human Hsp70 network demonstrates that many JDPs (including class A JDPs) form a connected system involving Hsp70s and nucleotide-exchange factors (NEFs), and that JDP–Hsp70 interactions can be transient, meaning interaction maps may undercount some true functional pairings. DNAJA4 is positioned in the dense core of this cytoplasmic JDP network, supporting its role within the general proteostasis machinery. (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

3. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

3.1. Heat/proteotoxic stress response in human neuronal models (2023)

In a 2023 study of heat-induced proteotoxic stress models in human neuronal cell systems, DNAJA4 is identified as part of a shared set of stress-induced chaperone/co-chaperone genes upregulated across three neuronal models after heat stress. The study used a targeted RT-qPCR array platform (Qiagen RT2 Profiler Human Heat Shock Proteins and Chaperones PCR Array; 84 genes) and defined upregulation using statistical significance p<0.05 and a log2 fold-change cutoff (≥1.5). DNAJA4 was among the genes common to all three models meeting these criteria. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 7-9)

In this same work, DNAJA4 is described as an overexpressed co-chaperone/cofactor with a reported log-fold increase range of ~1.5–5 at the maximal response timepoint (1 h post–heat stress), placing DNAJA4 within acute stress-induced proteostasis remodeling. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 9-11)

Note on interpretation: While this study includes DNAJA4 in stress-induced expression signatures, it does not provide DNAJA4-specific p-values or exact fold-change per cell type in the available excerpt, so DNAJA4’s quantitative effect size beyond the stated log-fold range cannot be independently recalculated from the retrieved text. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 9-11, alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 7-9)

3.2. DNAJA4 as an epigenetically regulated suppressor of EMT/metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (2023)

A 2023 mechanistic study reports DNAJA4 promoter hypermethylation and downregulation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), supported by analysis of methylation-array datasets and validation cohorts. Functional experiments show that DNAJA4 overexpression suppresses NPC cell migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, and reduces lymph node metastasis and lung metastatic colonization in vivo without affecting viability or proliferation. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 1-2, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 3-6)

Mechanism: DNAJA4 promotes ubiquitin–proteasome–dependent degradation of MYH9 (non-muscle myosin IIA), without changing MYH9 mRNA levels, consistent with post-translational control. DNAJA4 increases MYH9 ubiquitination and accelerates MYH9 turnover; the effect is rescued by proteasome inhibition (MG132) but not lysosome inhibition (CQ), supporting proteasome dependence. PSMD2, a proteasome 26S non-ATPase subunit, binds both DNAJA4 and MYH9, and DNAJA4 recruits PSMD2 to mediate MYH9 ubiquitination/degradation. Domain mapping indicates the DnaJ domain of DNAJA4 and a Pfam domain in PSMD2 are required for these interactions. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 6-9, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 3-6)

Causal linkage to phenotype: MYH9 overexpression reverses DNAJA4-mediated suppression of migration, invasion, and EMT, supporting MYH9 as a key downstream effector. The authors propose a “DNAJA4–PSMD2–MYH9” axis as a metastasis-regulatory pathway in NPC, while noting that the E3 ligase responsible for MYH9 ubiquitination in the complex remains to be identified. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 1-2, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 13-14)

Quantitative epigenetic and cohort details: the NPC study reports a hypermethylated CpG island with multiple CpG sites, and pyrosequencing validation at cg16358679 comparing 6 NPC vs 6 normal tissues. The demethylating agent DAC increased DNAJA4 levels by at least 15-fold in NPC cell lines (but not in a normal nasopharyngeal cell line). Transcriptomic cohort analysis referenced includes 113 NPC tissues (GSE102349) for gene-set enrichment comparisons of low vs high DNAJA4 expression. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 2-3, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 3-6)

3.3. Systems-biology and method papers implicating DNAJA4 in cancer subtype divergence (2024)

A 2024 NAR Genomics & Bioinformatics paper introducing the CWGCNA method reports DNAJA4 as a “driver gene” mediating a gene-module effect on Luminal A vs non-Luminal A breast cancer subtype divergence in a TCGA BRCA multi-omics case study. The authors state DNAJA4 correlated with patient survival only within Luminal A samples, and they use this as supporting evidence that DNAJA4 might contribute to subtype divergence. The case study includes 752 TCGA BRCA samples (reported as 411 Luminal A and 341 non-Luminal A after grouping), and a highlighted module ME1 with 888 genes. However, DNAJA4-specific hazard ratios or p-values for survival are not provided in the excerpt. (liu2024cwgcnaanr pages 11-12)

4. Interaction partners and pathway placement (experimentally supported)

4.1. Placement in the human Hsp70/JDP network

Systematic interactome profiling of the human Hsp70 network (AP-MS and BioID) identifies DNAJA4 as a cytoplasmic class A JDP with robust interactions with other class A JDPs DNAJA1 and DNAJA2 and with DNAJB1, and additional connectivity to class B JDPs (e.g., DNAJB4, DNAJB6, DNAJB12). This places DNAJA4 among the densely connected JDP core that is expected to support broad proteostasis functions (client recognition/transfer and potentially disaggregation cooperation). (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

4.2. DNAJA4 interactions beyond generic chaperoning: metastasis/EMT axis in NPC

In NPC, DNAJA4 is experimentally shown to associate with and promote degradation of MYH9 via a PSMD2-linked ubiquitin–proteasome mechanism. This is a DNAJA4-specific pathway-level mechanism beyond generic “co-chaperone” labeling and provides a concrete client/effector (MYH9) and pathway output (EMT/metastasis suppression). (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 6-9, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 1-2)

5. Current applications and real-world implementations

5.1. Prognostic biomarker / epigenetic biomarker in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

The 2023 NPC study provides direct clinical association evidence: low DNAJA4 expression correlates with worse outcomes and a higher fraction of distant metastasis. Figure-based results show that low DNAJA4 expression is associated with a higher percentage of distant metastasis (p=0.0088), and high DNAJA4 expression corresponds to better relapse-free survival (p=0.0023), distant metastasis-free survival (p=0.0044), and overall survival (p=0.0003). Multivariate Cox regression analyses identify DNAJA4 expression as an independent prognostic indicator with p=0.001 for relapse-free, distant metastasis-free, and overall survival in the displayed forest plots. Collectively, these data support DNAJA4 (and its methylation-associated downregulation) as a potential prognostic and metastasis-risk biomarker and the DNAJA4–PSMD2–MYH9 axis as a candidate therapeutic target pathway. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal media 8986c757, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 1-2)

5.2. Prognostic association in glioma datasets

A glioma network/survival analysis reports that higher DNAJA4 expression associates with longer survival in glioma. A Kaplan–Meier panel for DNAJA4 (Figure 8) shows p=0.004 with group sizes low expression N=8 and high expression N=69. This supports DNAJA4 as a candidate prognostic marker in glioma, though external validation and mechanistic studies would be required for clinical implementation. (sun2020networkanalysesof media b1c2ca08)

5.3. Broader cancer epigenetic context (review synthesis)

A 2021 review of HSP40/JDPs in p53/cancer signaling notes that DNAJA4 can be epigenetically silenced: reduced DNAJA4 mRNA expression due to gene methylation correlates with poorer disease-free survival in stomach adenocarcinoma, and DNAJA4 hypermethylation has been observed in pediatric embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The review also notes that little is known about DNAJA4’s association with p53, indicating a gap in mechanistic understanding in the p53 context despite epigenetic observations. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

5.4. Stress-response biology as an application context

The 2023 neuronal heat-stress profiling suggests DNAJA4 participates in core heat/proteotoxic stress response programs, a context relevant to heat injury and potentially neurodegeneration-related proteostasis, although this is an experimental model and not yet a clinical implementation. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 7-9, alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 9-11)

6. Expert opinions and authoritative analysis

6.1. DNAJA4 as a class A JDP (consensus view)

Authoritative reviews position DNAJA4 within mammalian class A HSP40/JDPs and emphasize that JDPs are first-line detectors/handlers of misfolded proteins and aggregates, acting via the J-domain/HPD motif to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity and drive client processing. These reviews provide the accepted conceptual framework for interpreting DNAJA4 function even when DNAJA4-specific biochemical assays are limited in the retrieved corpus. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)

6.2. Network biology perspective

High-quality interactome mapping in Molecular Cell emphasizes that Hsp70 machinery is organized as an interconnected network whose localization patterns and transient interactions complicate direct mapping of all functional contacts; DNAJA4’s position in the cytoplasmic network core implies broad system-level importance rather than a single dedicated pathway. (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

8. Functional annotation summary (what DNAJA4 does, where it acts, and pathway context)

Primary molecular function: DNAJA4 is a cytoplasmic class A Hsp40/J-domain co-chaperone that acts in the Hsp70 system to regulate client-protein binding and processing, consistent with JDP stimulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity via the J-domain/HPD motif and class-A substrate-binding domains. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

Cellular location: evidence supports a predominantly cytosolic/cytoplasmic localization for DNAJA4 in human cells. (teo2020dnaja3acochaperone pages 1-4, piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)

Biological processes (supported by recent and mechanistic studies):

• Proteostasis/stress response: DNAJA4 is induced in heat/proteotoxic stress programs in human neuronal models and is embedded in a cytoplasmic Hsp70/JDP network. (alharbi2023profilingthehsp70 pages 9-11, piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5)
• Cancer metastasis regulation in NPC: DNAJA4 suppresses EMT and metastasis by promoting PSMD2-mediated ubiquitin–proteasome degradation of MYH9, linking a chaperone-family protein to cytoskeleton-associated EMT control. (zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 1-2, zhang2023dnaja4suppressesepithelialmesenchymal pages 6-9)

9. Gaps and uncertainties (important for functional annotation)

• UniProt accession mapping: Q8WW22 was not explicitly recoverable from the retrieved paper texts; mapping rests on consistent gene symbol/organism/domain context. (piette2021comprehensiveinteractomeprofiling pages 4-5, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)
• Client specificity: Outside NPC (MYH9) and stress-expression signatures, many DNAJA4 functional claims in older reviews (e.g., cholesterol biosynthesis, hERG quality control, viral interactions) are referenced but not mechanistically detailed in the retrieved excerpts; direct primary data for these topics would require pulling and reading the original cited primary studies. (teo2020dnaja3acochaperone pages 4-8)
• Some disease associations are observational (correlation with survival or methylation), and causality/therapeutic targetability will require prospective validation. (sun2020networkanalysesof media b1c2ca08, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4)
