description: >-
  DNAJA4 is a class I J-domain protein (HSP40 co-chaperone) belonging to the DNAJA
  subfamily. It contains an N-terminal J-domain that stimulates the ATPase activity
  of HSP70 family members, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich region, a cysteine-rich
  zinc finger domain (CR-type, with four CXXCXGXG repeats coordinating two zinc ions),
  and a C-terminal peptide-binding domain. As a co-chaperone, DNAJA4 binds unfolded
  or misfolded client proteins and delivers them to HSP70 (HSPA) partners for
  ATP-dependent protein folding. Hageman et al. (2011) demonstrated that DNAJA4
  supports luciferase refolding and suppresses polyQ aggregation when co-expressed
  with HSP70 partners (PMID:21231916). The protein is farnesylated and membrane-associated,
  and is also found in the cytosol. DNAJA4 participates in the HSP90 chaperone cycle
  for steroid hormone receptors via the HSP70-HSP40-HOP-HSP90 relay pathway.

      HSP70 ATPase activity through their conserved J-domain, which directly

      cochaperones (HSP40s)." This is a core molecular function of all J-domain
