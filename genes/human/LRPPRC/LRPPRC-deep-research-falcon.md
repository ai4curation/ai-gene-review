## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P42704
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=130 kDa leucine-rich protein; Short=LRP 130; AltName: Full=GP130; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=LRPPRC; Synonyms=LRP130;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** LRP130. (IPR033490); Pentatricopeptide_rpt. (IPR002885); PROP1-like_PPR_dom. (IPR033443); TPR-like_helical_dom_sf. (IPR011990); PPR (PF01535)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "LRPPRC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'LRPPRC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **LRPPRC** (gene ID: LRPPRC, UniProt: P42704) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity: The target is human LRPPRC (gene symbol LRPPRC; UniProt P42704), also known as LRP130/GP130. It is a large mitochondria-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that forms a complex with SLIRP and functions in mitochondrial mRNA metabolism (stability, polyadenylation, delivery to the mitoribosome). This matches the UniProt description and domain architecture (multiple PPR-like helical repeats) and is the human protein (Homo sapiens) (sasarman2010lrpprcandslirp pages 6-7, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2).

Executive summary
LRPPRC is a Metazoa-specific, mitochondria-localized PPR protein that binds mitochondrial mRNAs in complex with SLIRP to stabilize them, promote polyadenylation, and recruit/deliver transcripts to the human mitoribosome via interactions with mS39 and mS31. Recent cryo-EM and multi-omic studies (2023–2024) establish LRPPRC–SLIRP as an mRNA “holdase” and delivery factor that modulates transcript-specific translation efficiency, with strongest effects on COX1/COX2. Pathogenic LRPPRC variants cause the French-Canadian form of Leigh syndrome (LSFC) and multisystem mitochondrial disease; tissue- and transcript-specific effects are common, and founder allele enrichment supports population screening in Quebec. Quantitative studies show broad decreases in mt-mRNA steady-state levels and specific translation changes upon LRPPRC loss; kinetic measurements indicate copy numbers of 6,000–51,000 mt-mRNA molecules per cell and half-lives of ~68–231 minutes that correlate with stabilization by LRPPRC–SLIRP (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4, chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 1-2, sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein family and domains: LRPPRC is a large leucine-rich PPR protein containing multiple helical PPR-like repeats; it forms a stable ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the RNA recognition motif (RRM)-containing protein SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA-binding protein). The proteins are interdependent for stability (SLIRP stabilizes LRPPRC via an RRM–PPR interface) (sasarman2010lrpprcandslirp pages 6-7, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2).
- Primary molecular functions:
  • Global mRNA stabilization: LRPPRC–SLIRP binds mature mt-mRNAs cotranscriptionally/early and protects them from 3′→5′ decay by the mitochondrial degradosome (PNPase/SUV3) (chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2).
  • Promotion of polyadenylation: LRPPRC promotes mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (MTPAP)-mediated polyadenylation in vitro and is required for maintaining polyadenylated mt-mRNAs in vivo (exceptions include ND6) (chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2).
  • mRNA folding/holdase activity: LRPPRC acts as an RNA chaperone that maintains mt-mRNA secondary structure conducive to translation (holdase), revealed by in-organelle DMS-based structurome mapping (moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4).
  • mRNA delivery to the mitoribosome: Cryo-EM shows LRPPRC docks on the small mitoribosomal subunit via mS39 and the N-terminus of mS31, forming a corridor with SLIRP-bound mRNA for handoff into the decoding center (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 8-9, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8).
- Subcellular localization: LRPPRC–SLIRP operate in the mitochondrial matrix, engaging mt-mRNAs and the mitoribosome; they are not implicated in antisense mtRNA metabolism (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, sasarman2010lrpprcandslirp pages 6-7, moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4, olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Structural basis for delivery to mitoribosome (2024): Cryo-EM of human LRPPRC–SLIRP in complex with mRNA and the mitoribosome demonstrates direct association of LRPPRC with mS39 and mS31, with SLIRP directly holding mRNA; loss of LRPPRC yields transcript-specific translation efficiency (TE) changes: COX1/COX2 TE decrease >2-fold, while ND6 TE increases >2-fold (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01365-9 (Aug 2024).
- mt-mRNA structurome and holdase role (2024): In-organelle DMS-MaPseq and mitoribosome profiling show LRPPRC maintains mt-mRNA folding and efficient translation; LRPPRC deficiency alters the mt-mRNA structurome and translation programs, supporting its “holdase” function (moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adm9238 (Jul 2024).
- In vivo synergy and translational control (2024): Mouse knock-in/knockout studies demonstrate LRPPRC–SLIRP are required through the mt-mRNA life cycle; SLIRP loss lowers complex I levels; disruption of LRPPRC–SLIRP reduces translation broadly but can increase ATP8 synthesis in liver, illustrating transcript- and tissue-specific control (rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae662 (Aug 2024).
- Kinetic control of mt-mRNA metabolism (2024): Global kinetic analyses highlight distinct kinetics of mitochondrial vs nuclear gene expression; these data, together with older quantitative work, support a central role of LRPPRC in setting mt-mRNA stability and translational competence (chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.02.028 (Apr 2024).
- Degradation vs stabilization landscape (2024): Review synthesizes that LRPPRC–SLIRP stabilize sense mt-mRNAs (polyadenylation/translation), while the SUV3–PNPase degradosome primarily targets antisense RNA; LRPPRC–SLIRP have no obvious role in antisense RNA metabolism (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddae043 (May 2024).
- RNA maturation overview (2024): Concise review reinforces mutual dependence of LRPPRC and SLIRP, their global effects on mt-mRNA stability/polyadenylation, and roles in mitoribosome recruitment (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2024.2414157 (Oct 2024).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical genetics and diagnostics: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) continues to identify pathogenic LRPPRC variants globally; a 2023 case report described a novel homozygous splice donor variant (c.469+2T>A) causing Leigh syndrome with epilepsy in a Saudi family, validating WES for diagnosis and extended genotype–phenotype re-evaluation (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2023.1288542 (Nov 2023).
- Population screening/founder effect: The Quebec French-Canadian founder mutation (c.1061C>T; p.Ala354Val) underlies LSFC; enriched frequency of known pathogenic founder alleles, including LRPPRC, supports targeted carrier screening in this population (sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2) (sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu468 (Jan 2015). Additional enrichment evidence: medRxiv (Jul 2025) (clapatiuc2024caractérisationdurole pages 159-162).
- Disease management research: Tissue- and transcript-specific effects downstream of LRPPRC loss inform counseling and potential management strategies; mouse models reveal compensatory OXPHOS assembly adjustments despite severe COX deficiency, highlighting potential therapeutic avenues (supercomplex stabilization, biogenesis, mitoribosome capacity) (sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu468 (Jan 2015).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural biology consensus: The 2024 NSMB cryo-EM study establishes a consensus mechanism in which LRPPRC–SLIRP functions as an mRNA chaperone/delivery factor to the mitoribosome, interacting with mS39/mS31 to form an mRNA corridor; SLIRP’s direct mRNA binding and LRPPRC stabilization are emphasized (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 8-9, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8).
- RNA metabolism experts: Reviews and quantitative studies converge that LRPPRC–SLIRP primarily stabilizes sense mt-mRNAs, promotes polyadenylation (MTPAP), and counters degradosome activity, whereas mt antisense RNA decay is largely mediated by SUV3–PNPase (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13, chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2).
- Mitochondrial gene expression community: In-organelle structurome and kinetic studies (Science 2024; Mol Cell 2024) argue LRPPRC shapes the folding and availability of mt-mRNAs to the mitoribosome, directly influencing translation efficiency and pausing patterns, with quantitative TE changes particularly at COX1/COX2 (moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Transcript-specific translation changes (LRPPRC loss): COX1 and COX2 translation efficiency reduced by >2-fold; ND6 translation efficiency increased by >2-fold (mitoribosome profiling) (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01365-9 (Aug 2024).
- mt-mRNA quantitative kinetics: In HeLa cells, individual mt-mRNA copy numbers ranged from ~6,000 to 51,000 molecules per cell; mt-mRNA half-lives ranged ~68–231 minutes and positively correlated with abundance (R^2 ≈ 0.60), with LRPPRC–SLIRP suppressing PNPase/SUV3 3′→5′ decay and promoting MTPAP polyadenylation in vitro (chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks506 (May 2012).
- Protein level reductions in LSFC tissues/cells: LSFC founder mutation A354V reduces LRPPRC steady-state levels to ~20–30% of control in patient muscle cells; SLIRP levels drop to ~10–20%; further depletion below ~10% produces generalized OXPHOS defects (sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu468 (Jan 2015).
- Epidemiology/founder mutation: In a series, 55/56 French-Canadian LS patients were homozygous for LRPPRC c.1061C>T (p.Ala354Val), supporting strong founder effect (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awv291 (Oct 2015).

Mechanistic synthesis: pathway/localization, partners, and roles
- Localization and pathway context: LRPPRC–SLIRP acts in the mitochondrial matrix within the mitochondrial gene expression pathway (transcription processing → mRNA stabilization/polyadenylation → mRNA delivery/translation). It bridges post-transcriptional handling to translation initiation by docking on the small mitoribosomal subunit (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13).
- Complex membership and partners: LRPPRC–SLIRP forms a ~250 kDa RNP, co-precipitating with mt-mRNAs; SLIRP is required to stabilize LRPPRC (RRM–PPR interface). On the mitoribosome, LRPPRC contacts mS39 and mS31; SLIRP directly binds the mRNA within the corridor (sasarman2010lrpprcandslirp pages 6-7, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 8-9).
- Functional roles at each step:
  • Stabilization/polyadenylation: LRPPRC–SLIRP protects mt-mRNAs and promotes MTPAP polyadenylation, ensuring proper 3′ ends and translation-competence (chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2).
  • Folding/holdase: Maintains mt-mRNA conformational ensembles favorable for translation (moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4).
  • Recruitment/delivery: Docks transcripts to the mitoribosome (mS39/mS31 corridor), modulating transcript-specific translation efficiency (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8).

Clinical spectrum and real-world implications
- Disease associations: Recessive LRPPRC mutations cause LSFC and multisystem mitochondrial disease with isolated COX deficiency and tissue-specific phenotypes; outside Quebec, diverse LRPPRC variants present with early-onset neurodevelopmental disease and lactic acidosis (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 1-2, sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2, olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awv291 (Oct 2015); https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu468 (Jan 2015).
- Global expansion of cases (2023): Novel splice donor variant (c.469+2T>A) causing Leigh syndrome with epilepsy in a Saudi family highlights worldwide distribution and supports WES as first-line testing with subsequent phenotype re-evaluation (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2023.1288542 (Nov 2023).
- Founder screening: The high frequency of the Quebec founder allele (p.Ala354Val) in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean population underpins carrier screening programs and informs counseling; enrichment of LSFC alleles in French-Canadian exomes further supports population-level screening strategies (sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2, clapatiuc2024caractérisationdurole pages 159-162). URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu468 (Jan 2015).

Open questions and caveats
- Although LRPPRC is strongly implicated in polyadenylation control, poly(A) lengths may not be universally altered in all patient contexts, suggesting complex regulation and tissue specificity (olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 12-13). Continued 2023–2024 studies refine the transcript-specific and structural bases but do not yet fully resolve all kinetic parameters or sub-mitochondrial spatial dynamics under stress.

Conclusion
Human LRPPRC (UniProt P42704) is a mitochondria-localized PPR protein that, together with SLIRP, stabilizes and polyadenylates sense mt-mRNAs and delivers them to the mitoribosome by engaging mS39 and mS31. Recent structural, kinetic, and transcriptome-folding studies define its “holdase” and delivery roles and quantify transcript-specific effects on translation, particularly for COX1/COX2. Pathogenic variants cause LSFC and other multisystem mitochondrial diseases with tissue-specific respiratory phenotypes; founder enrichment in Quebec supports targeted screening. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for diagnostics and for exploring therapeutic strategies that modulate mitochondrial mRNA handling and translation (singh2024structuralbasisof pages 1-2, singh2024structuralbasisof pages 7-8, rubalcavagracia2024lrpprcandslirp pages 1-2, moran2024thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-4, chujo2012lrpprcslirpsuppressespnpasemediated pages 1-2, olahova2015lrpprcmutationscause pages 1-2, sasarman2015tissuespecificresponsesto pages 1-2).
