description: >-
  LRPPRC (Leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein) is a mitochondrial PPR protein
  that functions
  as a key regulator of mitochondrial mRNA metabolism. It forms a stable ribonucleoprotein
  complex
  with SLIRP (SRA stem-loop interacting RNA-binding protein) and performs three core
  functions:
  (1) stabilization of mitochondrial mRNAs by protecting them from 3'-5' exonucleolytic
  degradation
  by the PNPase/SUV3 degradosome, (2) promotion of polyadenylation of mt-mRNAs via
  MTPAP, and
  (3) delivery of mRNAs to the mitoribosome through direct interaction with mS39 and
  mS31.
  Cryo-EM structures (2024) reveal LRPPRC acts as an mRNA "holdase" that maintains
  proper mRNA
  folding for efficient translation. Loss of LRPPRC causes the French-Canadian form
  of Leigh
  syndrome (LSFC) with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. While predominantly mitochondrial,
  a
  fraction localizes to the nucleus where it may participate in nuclear mRNA export
  via EIF4E.

        LRPPRC regulates mitochondrial translation through its role in mRNA delivery
        to the mitoribosome.
        Cryo-EM studies (Singh et al., 2024) show LRPPRC-SLIRP docks on the small
        mitoribosomal subunit
        via mS39 and mS31, forming a corridor for mRNA delivery to the decoding center.
        Loss of LRPPRC
        causes transcript-specific translation efficiency changes, with COX1/COX2
        translation reduced
