description: >-
  SSR2 encodes the beta subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex,
  also known as signal sequence receptor subunit beta (SSR-beta/TRAP-beta). TRAP is
  a heterotetrameric complex (SSR1/alpha, SSR2/beta, SSR3/gamma, SSR4/delta) that
  associates with the Sec61 translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The
  complex assists in co-translational protein translocation, particularly for nascent
  polypeptides with weak or suboptimal signal peptides. SSR2/TRAP-beta is a type I
  single-pass membrane glycoprotein with its N-terminus facing the ER lumen, where it
  contributes to the lumenal crescent structure that contacts nascent chains exiting
  the Sec61 pore. The TRAP complex also coordinates with the oligosaccharyltransferase
  (OST) complex to facilitate N-glycosylation of nascent proteins. SSR2 has been shown
  to interact with STING1, suggesting potential roles in innate immune signaling pathways.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping. While correct that
      SSR2 is a membrane protein, this term is too general compared to the more specific
      GO:0005789 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane) annotation that is also present.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a valid but general annotation. Given that the more specific term
      GO:0005789 (ER membrane) is already annotated, this broader term provides
      redundant but not incorrect information. Accept as it doesn't violate any rules
      and is consistent with the protein's membrane localization.

      This IPI annotation is based on the interaction between SSR2/TRAP-beta and STING1,
      demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation in PMID:18724357.
      The study identified SSR2 as a STING1 interactor and showed that TRAP-beta ablation
      reduced STING's ability to induce interferon-beta.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The generic term "protein binding" is uninformative for GO annotation purposes.
      While the STING1 interaction is experimentally validated (yeast two-hybrid and
      co-IP), the biological significance and mechanism of this interaction are not
      fully characterized. However, a more informative annotation would be to the
      specific complex (TRAP complex) or to Sec61 translocon complex binding, which
      represents the core function of SSR2.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This NAS annotation suggests SSR2/TRAP-beta is involved in post-translational
      protein translocation. However, the TRAP complex is primarily associated with
      co-translational translocation, assisting the Sec61 translocon during ribosome-
      associated protein synthesis and membrane insertion.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The TRAP complex is predominantly associated with co-translational (SRP-dependent)
      protein translocation, not post-translational translocation. While the Sec61
      translocon can function in both pathways, TRAP specifically associates with
      ribosome-bound translocons and facilitates translocation of nascent chains with
      weak signal peptides during active translation [file:human/SSR2/SSR2-deep-research-falcon.md].
      GO:0006613 (cotranslational protein targeting to membrane) is the more appropriate

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: TRAP complex
    proposed_definition: >-
      A heterotetrameric protein complex composed of TRAP-alpha (SSR1), TRAP-beta (SSR2),
      TRAP-gamma (SSR3), and TRAP-delta (SSR4) subunits that associates with the Sec61
      translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The TRAP complex facilitates
      co-translational protein translocation, particularly for substrates with weak
      or suboptimal signal peptides.
    justification: >-
      There is currently no specific GO term for the translocon-associated protein
      (TRAP) complex. This heterotetrameric complex (SSR1-4/TRAP-alpha,beta,gamma,delta)
      is distinct from the Sec61 translocon core and functions as a co-factor for
      protein translocation. A dedicated cellular component term would improve
      annotation precision for all TRAP subunit genes.
suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the precise mechanism by which the TRAP complex modulates Sec61 lateral
      gate dynamics to facilitate translocation of weak signal peptide substrates?
      Recent structural and MD studies suggest TRAP influences gate conformations
      but the detailed mechanism remains incompletely characterized.
  - question: >-
      What is the functional significance of the SSR2/TRAP-beta interaction with STING1?
      Is this interaction related to TRAP's role in protein translocation or does it
      represent a distinct function in innate immune signaling? The STING1 interaction
      was identified in a focused study on innate immunity, but whether this represents
      a core or peripheral function of SSR2 is unclear.
