## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P43308
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Translocon-associated protein subunit beta; Short=TRAP-beta; AltName: Full=Signal sequence receptor subunit beta; Short=SSR-beta; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SSR2; Synonyms=TRAPB; ORFNames=HSD25;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TRAP-beta family. .
- **Key Domains:** TRAP_beta. (IPR008856); TRAP_beta (PF05753)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SSR2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SSR2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SSR2** (gene ID: SSR2, UniProt: P43308) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and approach
We verified gene/protein identity and then synthesized recent structural and mechanistic literature (emphasizing 2023–2024 cryo-EM/ET) together with authoritative reviews to annotate human SSR2 (TRAP-β) within the ER translocon. We prioritized precise functional roles, localization/topology, pathways (Sec61/TRAP/OST), disease links, viral-host relevance, and applications, and we include URLs and publication dates.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and nomenclature: SSR2 (synonyms: TRAPB; signal sequence receptor subunit beta) encodes the β subunit of the mammalian Translocon-Associated Protein (TRAP) complex, a heterotetramer at the ER translocon. This subunit is termed TRAP‑β/SSR‑β and is an integral ER membrane protein (UniProt P43308). SSR2 is part of the canonical SSR1/SSR2/SSR3/SSR4 complex that associates with Sec61 during co-translational protein translocation (Open Biology, 2020; doi:10.1098/rsob.190244, published May 13, 2020). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 2-4)
- Topology and family: TRAP‑β is a single-pass, type I membrane glycoprotein with an N‑lumenal domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytosolic C-terminus; it belongs to the TRAP‑beta family. Structural/topological placement of β within the lumenal TRAP crescent has been resolved in human ribosome–Sec61–TRAP complexes (Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)
- TRAP composition and architecture: TRAP is a heterotetramer of SSR1 (α), SSR2 (β), SSR3 (γ), SSR4 (δ). High-resolution cryo‑EM (2023) shows a seven‑TM helix bundle formed by TRAP‑γ plus one C‑terminal helix each from α/β/δ; the N‑terminal lumenal domains of α/β/δ form a crescent facing the Sec61 pore. TRAP‑γ anchors to 28S rRNA and ribosomal protein L38 and contacts Sec61α/γ, stabilizing the ribosome–Sec61–TRAP assembly (Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)

Mechanistic role and pathways (with recent advances)
- Sec61 gating and signal-peptide selectivity: TRAP modulates Sec61 lateral-gate conformations and facilitates translocation/insertion of precursors with weak/low‑hydrophobicity or Pro/Gly‑rich signal peptides. Cryo‑EM combined with atomistic MD indicates TRAP interactions bias gate conformations favorable for these challenging clients (EMBO Reports, November 20, 2023; doi:10.15252/embr.202357910; Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, karki2023molecularviewof pages 1-2, karki2023molecularviewof pages 3-5)
- Coupling to N‑glycosylation (OST): TRAP frequently coexists with the oligosaccharyltransferase (OSTA) complex in the ribosome–translocon megacomplex; TRAPα’s lumenal domain lies immediately below the Sec61 pore and near OSTA, positioning nascent chains for cotranslational N‑glycosylation. Structural analyses and in situ tomography link TRAP to OST proximity and nascent‑chain handling; deficiency in TRAP subunits leads to aberrant N‑glycosylation (EMBO Reports, November 20, 2023; doi:10.15252/embr.202357910; eLife preprint, May 2, 2024; doi:10.1101/2023.12.22.572959). (karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3, karki2023molecularviewof pages 1-2, lewis2024structuralanalysisof pages 9-11)
- ER membrane remodeling: MD simulations and cryo‑ET reveal that the Sec61/TRAP assembly locally thins and curves the ER membrane, which may lower the energetic barrier for lateral gate opening and integration of transmembrane segments. This physical remodeling is proposed to aid insertion of weak SP/TMD clients (EMBO Reports, November 20, 2023; doi:10.15252/embr.202357910; Life Science Alliance, June 12, 2024; doi:10.26508/lsa.202302496). (karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3, gemmer2024exploringthemolecular pages 1-3)
- Localization and interactions: TRAP is an ER-resident, ribosome-associated complex stably bound to the “back” of Sec61 with multiple TRAP–ribosome and TRAP–Sec61 contact points. TRAPα likely contacts the Sec61 hinge; TRAPβ participates in the lumenal crescent near the nascent‑chain exit (Open Biology, 2020; doi:10.1098/rsob.190244; Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797; eLife preprint, May 2, 2024; doi:10.1101/2023.12.22.572959). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lewis2024structuralanalysisof pages 9-11)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)
- Atomic models of human ribosome–Sec61–TRAP resolve TRAP subunit positioning and contacts, including the seven‑helix TM bundle and a dynamic, crescent‑shaped lumenal α/β/δ core that adjusts across translation stages (Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)
- Mechanistic hypotheses supported by cryo‑EM and MD: TRAP stabilizes the ribosome exit tunnel, prevents nascent‑chain back‑diffusion, and biases Sec61 toward a translocation‑competent state for weak signal peptides; local lipid thinning by TRAP/Sec61 complex further facilitates insertion (EMBO Reports, November 20, 2023; doi:10.15252/embr.202357910). (karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3, karki2023molecularviewof pages 1-2, karki2023molecularviewof pages 3-5)
- Native membrane cryo‑ET reveals variable association of auxiliary factors in multipass translocons, with TRAP substoichiometric and enriched in Sec61 variants bound to non‑translating ribosomes; TRAP lumenal domains contact a “back‑of‑Sec61” factor tentatively modeled as a nodal modulator linking nicalin to TRAPα (Life Science Alliance, June 12, 2024; doi:10.26508/lsa.202302496). (gemmer2024exploringthemolecular pages 1-3)

Primary function and substrate scope
- Primary role: SSR2 (TRAP‑β) contributes to the structural core of TRAP that, together with the other subunits, assists Sec61-mediated co‑translational translocation of secretory and membrane proteins with suboptimal/weak signal peptides and helps coordinate access to OSTA for N‑glycosylation. This is a structural/adaptor role, not enzymatic catalysis (Open Biology, 2020; doi:10.1098/rsob.190244; Science Advances, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)
- Substrate bias: Clients with low hydrophobicity or Pro/Gly‑rich signal sequences show TRAP dependence; structural data and MD support this bias via gate-opening and membrane remodeling mechanisms (Science Advances, 2023; EMBO Reports, 2023) (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3)

Subcellular localization and topology
- SSR2 is ER membrane-resident; type I topology (N lumen, C cytosol) with a single TM helix; embedded within the TRAP lumenal crescent facing the Sec61 pore (Open Biology, 2020; doi:10.1098/rsob.190244; Science Advances, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

Coupling to glycosylation machinery
- TRAP–OST coordination: In the prevalent ER translocon variant, Sec61, TRAP, and OSTA are present together; TRAP lumenal domains (especially α adjacent to β/δ) are positioned below the pore and near OSTA active sites, enabling nascent chain capture and early N‑glycosylation. In situ analyses report OSTA association in ~40–70% of complexes, while TRAP is consistently present in the major co‑translational translocon (Open Biology, 2020; eLife preprint, 2024) (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, lewis2024structuralanalysisof pages 9-11)

Disease links and real-world implementations
- Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG): TRAP integrity is required for proper N‑glycosylation; loss-of-function in SSR4 (TRAP‑δ) causes a CDG phenotype with hypoglycosylation and ER stress, and destabilizes other TRAP subunits (review synthesis). Human genetic observations and structural comparisons in patient-derived contexts underscore the dependence of glycoprotein biogenesis on the intact complex (Open Biology, 2020; EMBO Reports, 2023) (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3)
- ER stress and proteostasis: TRAP levels can be modulated during ER stress, and the complex is implicated in ER homeostasis and ERAD coupling in the ribosome-translocon complex (Open Biology, 2020; review) (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, russo2019themammaliantransloconassociated pages 27-35)
- Viral host dependency: TRAP’s role in co‑translational translocation and glycoprotein maturation places it within pathways exploited by enveloped viruses; structural work and reviews integrate TRAP within the mammalian translocon machinery that is targeted in functional screens and by translocon inhibitors (Science Advances, 2023; review) (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 1-2)

Applications: small-molecule modulation of the translocon
- Sec61 inhibitors: Cryo‑EM reveals that the cyclotriazadisulfonamide derivative CK147 binds the Sec61 channel, interacting with the plug from the lumenal side, and induces a partially open conformation; resistance mutations map around the inhibitor. These structures nominate a druggable site relevant to client‑selective inhibition strategies impacting secretory protein biogenesis (Science Advances, March 22, 2023; doi:10.1126/sciadv.adf0797). (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2)

Expert opinions and integrative analyses
- Reviews emphasize TRAP as a substrate‑selective auxiliary of Sec61 that stabilizes translocation of challenging signal peptides and coordinates with OSTA, integrating co‑translational modification and quality control. Recent structural studies consolidate TRAP’s position and contacts and propose mechanistic models involving membrane thinning and ribosome‑tunnel stabilization (Open Biology, 2020; Science Advances, 2023; EMBO Reports, 2023; eLife preprint, 2024; Life Science Alliance, 2024). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, karki2023molecularviewof pages 2-3, lewis2024structuralanalysisof pages 9-11, gemmer2024exploringthemolecular pages 1-3)

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Coexistence frequency: In ribosome–ER translocon assemblies, OSTA is present in roughly 40–70% of complexes, whereas TRAP is consistently found in the predominant co‑translational translocon; TRAP association varies with translational state in multipass translocons (Open Biology, 2020; eLife preprint, 2024; Life Science Alliance, 2024). (russo2020understandingthemammalian pages 5-6, lewis2024structuralanalysisof pages 9-11, gemmer2024exploringthemolecular pages 1-3)
- Structural placements: 2023 cryo‑EM resolves TRAP‑γ anchoring to 28S rRNA and L38 and a seven‑TM bundle incorporating α/β/δ C‑terminal helices; the lumenal α/β/δ crescent faces the Sec61 pore, consistent with direct nascent‑chain engagement (Science Advances, 2023). (pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, pauwels2023structuralinsightsinto pages 2-3)

Verification of identity and organism (MANDATORY)
- The gene symbol “SSR2” in this report refers to the human Signal Sequence Receptor subunit beta (TRAP‑β), UniProt P43308, within Homo sapiens. The protein is a member of the TRAP‑beta family and forms part of the ER TRAP complex alongside SSR1/SSR3/SSR4; the features, domains, topology and interactions reported here align with the TRAP‑β family and domain annotations. If alternative “SSR2” symbols exist in other organisms/pathways, they are not the subject of this analysis.

- Most SSR2-specific functional roles are supported at the complex level, with subunit‑resolved placement and contacts captured in 2023–2024 structures; direct SSR2‑unique disease reports are limited, but complex integrity (e.g., SSR4 deficiency) yields N‑glycosylation defects that infer importance of all subunits.
