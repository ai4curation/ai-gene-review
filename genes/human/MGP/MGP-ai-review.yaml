description: MGP encodes matrix Gla protein, a small (103 AA) secreted protein that
  inhibits calcification of cartilage and blood vessels. The protein is synthesized
  with a signal peptide and requires vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of glutamic
  acid residues (creating Gla residues) for its function as a calcification inhibitor.
  MGP associates with the organic matrix of bone and cartilage and acts to prevent
  aberrant mineralization. The protein is phosphorylated at three conserved serines
  (Ser-22, Ser-25, Ser-28) in Ser-X-Glu/Ser(P) sequences. MGP belongs to the osteocalcin/matrix
  Gla protein family and binds calcium ions through its Gla residues. Loss-of- function
  mutations in MGP cause Keutel syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
  by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, hearing loss,
  and midfacial hypoplasia. The protein functions in the extracellular matrix to regulate
  bone mineralization, vascular calcification, and skeletal development. MGP is expressed
  in cartilage, bone, heart, kidney, and vascular smooth muscle cells.

core_functions:
- description: MGP is a small secreted protein that functions as an inhibitor of calcification
    in cartilage, bone, and blood vessels. The protein binds calcium ions through
    its vitamin K-dependent gamma- carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and associates
    with the organic matrix of bone and cartilage in the extracellular matrix. MGP
    acts as a negative regulator of bone mineralization, preventing aberrant calcification
    in soft tissues. The protein belongs to the osteocalcin/matrix Gla protein family
    and requires vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation for its calcification-inhibitory
    function. MGP is phosphorylated at three conserved serines (Ser-22, Ser-25, Ser-28),
    which may modulate its activity. Loss-of-function mutations in MGP cause Keutel
    syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal cartilage
    calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, hearing loss, and midfacial hypoplasia,
    demonstrating MGP's essential role in preventing pathological mineralization.
    MGP functions both as an extracellular matrix structural constituent and as a
    regulatory protein, playing key roles in cartilage development, cartilage condensation,
    and skeletal system development. The protein is expressed in cartilage, bone,
    heart, kidney, and vascular smooth muscle cells.
