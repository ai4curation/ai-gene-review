description: MGP encodes matrix Gla protein, a small (103 AA) secreted protein that
  inhibits calcification of cartilage and blood vessels. The protein is synthesized
  with a signal peptide and requires vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of glutamic
  acid residues (creating Gla residues) for its function as a calcification inhibitor.
  MGP associates with the organic matrix of bone and cartilage and acts to prevent
  aberrant mineralization. The protein is phosphorylated at three conserved serines
  (Ser-22, Ser-25, Ser-28) in Ser-X-Glu/Ser(P) sequences. MGP belongs to the osteocalcin/matrix
  Gla protein family and binds calcium ions through its Gla residues. Loss-of- function
  mutations in MGP cause Keutel syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
  by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, hearing loss,
  and midfacial hypoplasia. The protein functions in the extracellular matrix to regulate
  bone mineralization, vascular calcification, and skeletal development. MGP is expressed
  in cartilage, bone, heart, kidney, and vascular smooth muscle cells.

  review:
    summary: MGP is a secreted protein that localizes to the extracellular matrix,
      specifically associating with the organic matrix of bone and cartilage where
      it functions to inhibit calcification. This is the primary cellular location
      for MGP function, supported by IBA phylogenetic evidence and extensive experimental
      data.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported by multiple lines of evidence. MGP is
      secreted and localizes to the ECM where it carries out its calcification-inhibitory
      function. The IBA annotation represents phylogenetically conserved localization.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: MGP participates in ossification by inhibiting aberrant bone formation
      and ectopic calcification. However, MGP also has positive regulatory roles in
      bone tissue, promoting osteoblast differentiation. The term "ossification" is
      appropriate but does not capture the complexity of MGP's dual role.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While MGP is best known as an inhibitor of ectopic calcification in soft
      tissues, it participates in the ossification process in bone. The Keutel syndrome
      phenotype demonstrates the importance of MGP in regulating proper bone formation.
      Recent evidence shows MGP also promotes osteoblast differentiation through Wnt
      signaling, suggesting context-dependent functions in ossification.

  review:
    summary: MGP binds calcium ions with high affinity through its five gamma-carboxyglutamic
      acid (Gla) residues, which are produced by vitamin K-dependent carboxylation.
      This calcium binding is essential for MGP's calcification-inhibitory function
      and represents the core molecular function of the protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Calcium ion binding through Gla residues is the fundamental molecular
      function that enables MGP's biological activity. The Gla domain contains five
      glutamic acid residues that undergo vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation,
      creating high-affinity calcium binding sites. This is supported by structural
      and functional studies showing calcium binding induces conformational changes

      has documented roles in promoting osteoblast differentiation via Wnt signaling

  review:
    summary: MGP is a critical negative regulator of mineralization, primarily functioning
      to inhibit ectopic calcification in soft tissues including cartilage and blood
      vessels. However, the term "bone mineralization" may be too narrow as MGP's
      primary role is preventing vascular and cartilage calcification rather than
      regulating bone mineralization per se.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While MGP does regulate mineralization processes, the current term focuses
      on "bone mineralization" which does not capture MGP's primary function of preventing
      ectopic calcification in soft tissues. MGP's most critical role is as an inhibitor
      of vascular calcification and inappropriate cartilage calcification. The more

    reason: This is a duplicate of the earlier IEA annotation but with stronger TAS
      evidence from PMID:9916809, the seminal paper identifying MGP mutations as
      the cause of Keutel syndrome. The TAS evidence code indicates a traceable author
      statement, which is more reliable than IEA computational inference. The annotation

  review:
    summary: Duplicate GO:0005201 annotation with TAS evidence from the Keutel syndrome
      paper. However, as with the RCA annotations, this represents an over-annotation
      of MGP's molecular function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While this TAS evidence from the authoritative Keutel syndrome paper provides
      strong support, it does not change the fundamental assessment that "extracellular
      matrix structural constituent" is an over-annotation of MGP's molecular function.
      MGP's primary molecular function is calcium ion binding (GO:0005509), not providing
      structural support to the ECM. The paper describes MGP as a "skeletal extracellular
      matrix (ECM) protein" because it is found in the ECM, not because it serves
      a structural role. As a small 11-15 kDa regulatory protein, MGP's function
      is to inhibit calcification, not to provide mechanical structure like collagens,
      elastin, or proteoglycans.

    label: structural constituent of bone
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9916809
  review:
    summary: This annotation assigns MGP a structural role specifically in bone. However,
      like GO:0005201, this represents an over-annotation. MGP's primary molecular
      function is calcium ion binding for calcification inhibition, not providing
      structural support to bone tissue.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While MGP associates with bone matrix and is found in bone tissue, this
      does not make it a "structural constituent" in the functional sense intended
      by this GO term. Structural constituents of bone include proteins like collagen
      type I, osteocalcin (in the mineralized phase), and osteonectin that provide
      mechanical properties and scaffolding. MGP is a small regulatory protein (11-15
      kDa) whose function is to inhibit inappropriate calcification through calcium
      binding, not to contribute to bone's structural integrity. Moreover, MGP functions
      primarily in cartilage and vascular tissues rather than being bone-specific.
      This annotation conflates presence in bone with structural function.

    reason: This is another duplicate of the GO:0031012 annotation, but with the
      strongest evidence type (TAS from the seminal Keutel syndrome paper). This
      provides definitive support for MGP's localization to the extracellular matrix.

  review:
    summary: MGP's primary and best-characterized function is inhibition of pathological
      mineralization in non-skeletal soft tissues, particularly vascular tissue and
      cartilage. This term precisely captures MGP's core biological function.
    action: NEW
    reason: This annotation should be added as it accurately describes MGP's primary
      biological function. While GO:0030500 (regulation of bone mineralization) exists
      in the current annotations, it does not accurately capture that MGP's main
      role is preventing ectopic calcification in soft tissues rather than regulating
      bone mineralization. The term GO:0140928 "inhibition of non-skeletal tissue
      mineralization" was created specifically for proteins like MGP that prevent
      inappropriate calcification outside of skeletal tissues. This is strongly supported
      by the MGP knockout mouse phenotype (massive arterial calcification leading
      to death) and the Keutel syndrome phenotype (abnormal cartilage and vascular
      calcification).
