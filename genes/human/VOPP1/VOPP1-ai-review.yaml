description: >-
  VOPP1 (Vesicular, Overexpressed in Cancer, Prosurvival Protein 1), also known as
  ECop
  (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein) and GASP, encodes a vesicle-associated
  membrane protein that functions as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor
  WWOX.
  VOPP1 contains a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region
  with
  a proline-rich PPPY motif that mediates interaction with the WW domain of WWOX.
  The
  protein localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes, where it sequesters WWOX, thereby
  impairing WWOX-dependent apoptosis and promoting cell survival. VOPP1 also enhances
  NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity, though the precise mechanism remains to be
  fully
  elucidated. VOPP1 is frequently overexpressed in cancers including glioblastoma,
  breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes tumorigenesis through
  its oncogenic pro-survival functions.
