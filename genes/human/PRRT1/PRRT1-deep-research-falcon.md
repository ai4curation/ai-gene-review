# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q99946
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Proline-rich transmembrane protein 1; AltName: Full=Dispanin subfamily D member 1; Short=DSPD1; AltName: Full=Synapse differentiation-induced protein 4 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35449}; Short=SynDIG4 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35449};
- **Gene Information:** Name=PRRT1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:13943}; Synonyms=C6orf31 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:13943}, NG5 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6MG82};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the CD225/Dispanin family. .
- **Key Domains:** CD225/Dispanin. (IPR051423); CD225/Dispanin_fam. (IPR007593); CD225 (PF04505)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PRRT1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PRRT1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PRRT1** (gene ID: PRRT1, UniProt: Q99946) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Target verification: Human PRRT1 (UniProt Q99946) encodes Proline-rich transmembrane protein 1, also known as Synapse differentiation-induced protein 4 (SynDIG4) and Dispanin subfamily D member 1 (DSPD1). It belongs to the CD225/Dispanin family and is distinct from PRRT2. All evidence cited below refers specifically to SynDIG4/PRRT1 in neurons. (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19, speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and domain family: PRRT1 encodes SynDIG4/PRRT1, a single-pass, type II transmembrane protein classified within the Dispanin/CD225 family. Type II topology indicates an intracellular N-terminus and an extracellular C-terminus. Recent mechanistic work aligns SynDIG4’s transmembrane helix near the GluA1 M4 helix within AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes, positioning SynDIG4 as an auxiliary AMPAR subunit. (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19, he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 46-52)
- Molecular role at excitatory synapses: SynDIG4/PRRT1 functions as an AMPAR auxiliary factor that regulates receptor trafficking, surface/synaptic availability, and gating properties, thereby contributing to basal synaptic transmission and activity-dependent plasticity (LTP/LTD). (plambeck2023syndig4isan pages 92-102, he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 46-52)

2) Molecular function and mechanism
- AMPAR association and gating: SynDIG4 co-purifies with native AMPAR complexes and modulates gating. Evidence indicates it slows deactivation of GluA1 homomers and GluA1/2 heteromers and reduces desensitization of GluA1, with potential synergy with TARPγ8; a C-terminal hydrophobic segment near AMPAR M4 is important for interaction. (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19)
- Endocytic sorting signal: SynDIG4 contains a canonical tyrosine-based endocytic motif, 178-YVPV-181 (YxxΦ), which binds the AP‑2 μ2 cargo-sorting subunit; mutating this motif to 178-AVPA-181 disrupts μ2 binding and causes aberrant plasma-membrane accumulation in heterologous cells and primary neurons, indicating a direct role for SynDIG4’s cytoplasmic tail in endocytic trafficking. (Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience; 23 Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2024.1526034) (speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)
- Endosomal trafficking and recycling: In hippocampal neurons, SynDIG4 localizes partially to early and recycling endosomes and regulates GluA1-containing AMPAR recycling under basal conditions. Knockout (KO) does not alter baseline endocytosis but reduces recycling of GluA1-containing receptors, leading to elevated intracellular GluA1/GluA2 and increased colocalization with Rab4-positive (rapid recycling) endosomes; Rab4–Rab11 overlap is increased and Rab11 endosomes enlarge, consistent with impaired trafficking/fission between Rab4 and Rab11 compartments. (Frontiers in Pharmacology; 21 May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1568908) (he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 1-2)

3) Subcellular localization
- Extrasynaptic enrichment and endosomes: SynDIG4 is largely intracellular and enriched outside the postsynaptic density, with localization to endosomal compartments and extrasynaptic AMPAR pools. Quantitatively, reported colocalization values in neurons include vGLUT1 15.6%, GluA1 41.2%, transferrin receptor ~20%, EEA1 ~25%, and Rab7 <10%, supporting enrichment in early/recycling pathways over late endosomes. (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19)
- Reduced synaptic surface AMPARs in KO: SynDIG4 KO neurons show reduced synaptic surface GluA1 at baseline, consistent with a deficit in maintaining AMPARs at or near synapses via endosomal recycling. (he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 1-2)

4) Role in synaptic plasticity and circuit function
- LTP and LTD: SynDIG4/PRRT1 is required for single-tetanus-induced LTP and is also implicated in NMDAR-dependent LTD; KO slices lose single-tetanus LTP and show impaired LTD while baseline transmission can be relatively intact. This has been linked to regulation of calcium-permeable AMPAR recruitment and endosomal recycling dynamics. (plambeck2023syndig4isan pages 92-102, he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 46-52, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 1-2)
- Behavior: SynDIG4 deficiency has been associated with deficits in hippocampal-dependent behaviors such as Morris water maze and novel object recognition, connecting SynDIG4-mediated AMPAR regulation to learning and memory. (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19)

5) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024, plus 2025 to capture latest mechanistic advances)
- 2023 doctoral work consolidated SynDIG4’s role as an AMPAR auxiliary subunit, with evidence for bidirectional clustering with GluA1/GluA2 and activity-dependent changes in extrasynaptic vs synaptic distribution; co-expression with GluA1 in oocytes altered AMPAR gating, supporting direct functional modulation. (plambeck2023syndig4isan pages 92-102, plambeck2023syndig4isan pages 1-9)
- 2024–2025 advances defined SynDIG4’s endocytic motif (YVPV) and its AP‑2 μ2 interaction, providing a direct sequence-level mechanism for SynDIG4 internalization and compartment targeting. (Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience; 23 Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2024.1526034) (speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)
- 2025 cell-biological studies pinpointed SynDIG4’s role in Rab4‑dependent rapid recycling and suggested SynDIG4 modulates Rab4↔Rab11 endosomal dynamics that maintain surface/synaptic AMPARs under basal conditions. (Frontiers in Pharmacology; 21 May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1568908) (he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 1-2)

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Mechanistic framework for AMPAR-targeted interventions: By specifying an AP‑2–dependent endocytic signal and a Rab4→Rab11 recycling checkpoint, recent work positions SynDIG4/PRRT1 as a defined node for modulating extrasynaptic and synaptic AMPAR availability—potentially relevant to disorders of plasticity and cognition where AMPAR trafficking is altered. (speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13)

7) Expert opinions and analysis
- Converging evidence supports SynDIG4 as a bona fide AMPAR auxiliary factor with a primary role in endosomal sorting/recycling rather than initial biosynthesis or global AMPAR expression. The YxxΦ/AP‑2 interaction explains its internalization dynamics, while Rab4-linked recycling explains reduced synaptic AMPARs and impaired LTP/LTD in KO contexts. Together, these mechanisms are sufficient to account for behavioral phenotypes tied to hippocampal plasticity. (speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13, he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 46-52)

8) Relevant statistics and data
- Localization (neurons): vGLUT1 15.6%, GluA1 41.2%, transferrin receptor ~20%, EEA1 ~25%, Rab7 <10% (colocalization/overlap). (he2025molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19)
- Recycling assays: Multiple independent dendrite stretches (~40/condition) across 3 biological replicates showed significant decreases in GluA1 recycling and increased Rab4–Rab11 overlap in SynDIG4 KO neurons (p < 0.01 to p < 0.0001). (Frontiers in Pharmacology; 21 May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1568908) (he2025lossofsyndig4prrt1 pages 9-13)

Gene/protein identification safeguards
- The evidence base consistently uses SynDIG4/PRRT1 (human ortholog) and distinguishes it from PRRT2, which is a different dispanin with separate disease implications. All mechanistic inferences relate to AMPAR trafficking/gating in excitatory neurons. (plambeck2023syndig4isan pages 92-102, speca2025functionalcharacterizationof pages 1-2)

Limitations and open questions
- While endocytic and recycling mechanisms are now better defined, quantitative rate constants for specific AMPAR cargo flows through Rab4 vs Rab11 in human neurons remain limited. Additional structural data resolving SynDIG4’s transmembrane contacts with AMPAR M4 in human complexes and in situ dynamics at synapses would refine models of auxiliary subunit cooperation with TARPs/CNIHs/GSG1L.
