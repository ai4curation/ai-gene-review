description: >-
  PRRT1 (Proline-rich transmembrane protein 1), also known as SynDIG4 (Synapse
  differentiation-induced protein 4), is a single-pass type II transmembrane protein
  that functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes. It belongs
  to the CD225/Dispanin family. PRRT1 regulates AMPAR trafficking, gating, and synaptic
  availability through mechanisms including: (1) direct modulation of AMPAR gating by
  slowing deactivation of GluA1 homomers and GluA1/2 heteromers and reducing desensitization;
  (2) regulation of AMPAR endocytic recycling via its YxxPhi endocytic motif (YVPV) that
  binds the AP-2 mu2 cargo-sorting subunit; and (3) maintaining extrasynaptic AMPAR pools
  through Rab4/Rab11-dependent endosomal recycling. Loss of SynDIG4 impairs basal AMPAR
  recycling, reduces synaptic surface GluA1, and abolishes single-tetanus-induced LTP
  and NMDAR-dependent LTD, leading to deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PRRT1/SynDIG4 directly modulates AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function as an auxiliary
      subunit. It binds to AMPAR complexes and regulates their gating properties,
      slowing deactivation and reducing desensitization. This constitutes regulation
      of a signaling receptor (AMPAR is an ionotropic glutamate receptor). The term
      is appropriate as PRRT1 modulates receptor activity rather than acting as the
      receptor itself (file:human/PRRT1/PRRT1-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT

      SynDIG4 functions as an AMPAR auxiliary factor that co-purifies with native

      Evidence shows it slows deactivation of GluA1 homomers and GluA1/2 heteromers
      and reduces desensitization of GluA1. IBA annotations have undergone phylogenetic
      review and this function is well-supported by the conserved role across orthologs.

      This is an over-annotation. The protein phosphorylation term (GO:0006468)

      AMPAR auxiliary subunit. Its effect on GRIA1 phosphorylation levels is indirect,
      mediated through its effects on AMPAR trafficking and complex assembly.

  title: Deep research report on PRRT1/SynDIG4 functional annotation
  findings:
  - statement: SynDIG4 is a type II transmembrane protein that functions as an AMPAR auxiliary subunit
  - statement: Modulates AMPAR gating by slowing deactivation and reducing desensitization
  - statement: Localized largely to intracellular and extrasynaptic compartments rather than PSD
  - statement: Required for single-tetanus LTP and NMDAR-dependent LTD
  - statement: Contains canonical YxxPhi endocytic motif (YVPV) that binds AP-2 mu2
  - statement: Regulates AMPAR recycling via Rab4/Rab11 endosomal dynamics

  description: >-
    PRRT1/SynDIG4 is an AMPAR auxiliary subunit that directly modulates receptor
    gating (slowing deactivation, reducing desensitization) and regulates receptor
    trafficking/recycling through its endocytic motif and effects on Rab4/Rab11
    endosomal dynamics. Functions as a signaling receptor regulator by binding to
    and modulating AMPA receptor activity.
