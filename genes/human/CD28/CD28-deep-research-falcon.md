### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P10747
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=T-cell-specific surface glycoprotein CD28; AltName: Full=TP44; AltName: CD_antigen=CD28; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CD28;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** CD28. (IPR008093); CTLA4/CD28. (IPR040216); Ig-like_dom_sf. (IPR036179); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783); Ig_V-set. (IPR013106)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CD28" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CD28' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CD28** (gene ID: CD28, UniProt: P10747) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: CD28 (human; UniProt P10747)

Plan and verification of target identity
- Verification. The target is human CD28 (CD28 gene; UniProt P10747), a T cell–specific surface glycoprotein. Recent authoritative reviews describe CD28 as a disulfide‑linked, homodimeric immunoglobulin superfamily receptor with an extracellular V‑set Ig domain containing the canonical MYPPPY motif for B7 ligand binding, consistent with the UniProt description and InterPro domain annotations (Ig-like_fold, Ig_V-set) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3, ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5). Organism is Homo sapiens; all sources cited are human-focused reviews or experimental studies.
- Family and domains. CD28 belongs to the CD28/CTLA‑4 family of Ig superfamily receptors that engage B7 ligands (CD80/CD86); structural and transmembrane determinants for dimerization have been mapped, aligning with the domain architecture noted in UniProt (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and expression. CD28 is a ~44 kDa disulfide‑linked Ig-domain homodimer on T cells. It is expressed on nearly all human CD4+ T cells (≈95–100%) and on a substantial subset of CD8+ T cells (≈30–50%), with estimates of ~60,000 molecules per T cell; the extracellular MYPPPY motif mediates ligand binding to CD80/CD86 (International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25021274) (ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5).
- Ligands and competition with CTLA‑4. The principal ligands for CD28 are CD80 (B7‑1) and CD86 (B7‑2). The inhibitory receptor CTLA‑4 shares these ligands and binds them with higher affinity, limiting CD28 co‑stimulation by outcompeting or removing B7 ligands (Nature Reviews Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization and immune synapse. Upon antigen recognition, CD28 co‑localizes with TCR microclusters within the immune synapse. Recent live-cell imaging demonstrates that CD28 co‑stimulation increases Lck recruitment to TCR microclusters, thereby accelerating ZAP70 recruitment/activation and effectively lowering the TCR activation threshold (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1503018) (raychaudhuri2024cd28shapest pages 1-2).
- Intracellular motifs and canonical signalling. CD28’s cytoplasmic tail contains three key motifs with distinct adaptor recruitment: YMNM (binds PI3K and GRB2), PRRP (recruits ITK leading to PLCγ1 and SLP‑76/GADS engagement), and PYAP (dominant for LCK binding and assembly of PKCθ at the synapse). These converge on NF‑κB, AP‑1, and NFAT transcriptional programs and mTOR‑dependent translation to drive IL‑2 production, survival, and proliferation (Nature Reviews Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Proximal signalling dynamics at microclusters. TIRF microscopy in 2024 demonstrated that CD28 costimulation specifically accelerates Lck recruitment and ZAP70 activation within TCR microclusters, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold-lowering of TCR activation by CD28 (Frontiers in Immunology, Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1503018) (raychaudhuri2024cd28shapest pages 1-2).
- Updated mechanistic map of CD28 signalling. A 2024 Nature Reviews Immunology article synthesized structural and proteomic insights: transmembrane dimerization motifs (e.g., GxxxA) influence homodimer assembly and signalling; membrane association of the cytoplasmic domain regulates Lck access; YMNM/PRRP/PYAP motifs recruit PI3K/GRB2, ITK–PLCγ1, and Lck/PKCθ respectively; and cis-signalling via B7 at invaginated membranes may sustain tonic signalling after trans‑engagement (Nature Reviews Immunology, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 19-20).
- Quantitative immunobiology of expression and ligand engagement. A 2024 review collated human expression estimates (CD4+ ≈95–100%; CD8+ ≈30–50%) and reiterated the MYPPPY motif requirement for CD80/CD86 binding, with dynamic modulation of CD28 surface expression upon ligand engagement (International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25021274) (ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Costimulation blockade with CTLA‑4–Ig biologics. Abatacept and belatacept are CTLA‑4–Ig fusion proteins that sequester CD80/CD86, preventing CD28 ligation. These agents are used clinically for autoimmunity and transplantation (belatacept as a calcineurin inhibitor–sparing regimen), reflecting the central role of the B7–CD28 axis in alloimmunity; translational reviews emphasize efficacy, trade‑offs (e.g., acute rejection risk), and the rationale for strategies that spare CTLA‑4 function (Nature Reviews Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3).
- CD28 in engineered cell therapies. Incorporating a CD28 intracellular domain in CAR constructs enhances proximal signalling and effector programs. In 2024, CAR‑NK cells with a CD28 costimulatory domain exhibited superior serial killing (≈25% serial killers vs ≈8% without CD28), improved in vivo tumor control across models, and increased persistence and tumor infiltration via an LCK/CD3ζ/ZAP70 axis (Cancer Discovery, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-24-0096) (acharya2024cd28costimulationaugments pages 6-8).
- Safety lessons for systemic CD28 agonism. The CD28 “superagonist” TGN1412 caused severe cytokine release syndrome in a 2006 first‑in‑human trial due to systemic activation of human effector memory T cells; contemporary reviews highlight tumor‑restricted or conditionally active CD28 agonists as safer avenues (Nature Reviews Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4).
- Small‑molecule CD28 antagonists (emerging). A 2025 preprint reported discovery of a small molecule (22VS) that binds CD28 (Kd ≈52 µM), disrupts CD28–CD80 engagement (ELISA IC50 ≈7.8 µM), and suppresses T cell cytokines in tumor/mucosal co‑cultures; while preclinical, it demonstrates feasibility beyond biologics (bioRxiv, Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.16.665260) (upadhyay2025smallmoleculebasedblockade pages 21-26).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Synthesis of CD28 structure–function–translation. A 2024 Nature Reviews Immunology perspective integrates biophysics (transmembrane dimerization, cytoplasmic membrane association), proximal signalling (Lck recruitment; YMNM/PRRP/PYAP networks), transcriptional outputs (NF‑κB/AP‑1/NFAT; mTOR), and translational strategies (CTLA‑4–Ig, tumor‑restricted CD28 agonists, CAR design), offering a consensus framework for CD28 biology and its therapeutic modulation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-024-01061-1) (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 19-20).
- Mechanistic proof of microcluster control. The 2024 imaging study provides direct, quantitative evidence that CD28 reprograms proximal TCR signalling kinetics by modulating Lck and ZAP70 dynamics at the immune synapse, a key expert insight for designing synapse‑proximal therapeutics (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1503018) (raychaudhuri2024cd28shapest pages 1-2).

Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- Human expression frequencies: CD28 on ≈95–100% of CD4+ and ≈30–50% of CD8+ T cells; ~60,000 molecules per T cell; MYPPPY motif mediates B7 binding (Jan 2024; URL above) (ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5).
- CAR‑NK functional gains with CD28 domain: serial killer fraction increased from ≈8% to ≈25%; enhanced in vivo tumor control with increased persistence and tumor infiltration (Jul 2024; URL above) (acharya2024cd28costimulationaugments pages 6-8).
- Small‑molecule antagonism: CD28–ligand disruption IC50 ≈7.8 µM (ELISA); binding Kd ≈52 µM (TRIC/MST); dose‑dependent suppression of IFN‑γ/IL‑2/TNF‑α in co‑cultures (Jul 2025; URL above) (upadhyay2025smallmoleculebasedblockade pages 21-26).

Mechanistic narrative: primary function, pathways, and localization
- Primary role. CD28 is the prototypic co‑stimulatory receptor (signal 2) that integrates with TCR signalling (signal 1) to enable full T cell activation. It stabilizes IL‑2 transcription and mRNA, promotes survival (e.g., Bcl‑xL upregulation), and drives clonal expansion and effector differentiation through PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and NF‑κB/AP‑1/NFAT programmes (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4, ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5).
- Subcellular site of action. CD28 operates at the T cell–APC immune synapse, co‑assembling within TCR microclusters. CD28 co‑stimulation increases recruitment of active Lck, which accelerates ZAP70 engagement on TCRζ, thus lowering activation thresholds and amplifying proximal signalling (raychaudhuri2024cd28shapest pages 1-2).
- Biochemical motifs and adapters. The YMNM motif recruits PI3K and GRB2 to support AKT and MAPK cascades; PRRP engages ITK to potentiate PLCγ1 and adaptor complexes (SLP‑76/GADS); PYAP binds Lck, nucleating PKCθ in the synapse to drive NF‑κB activation. Together these motifs explain CD28’s unique ability to couple membrane‑proximal events to transcriptional and translational programmes, including mTOR‑dependent metabolic reprogramming (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4).
- Metabolic integration. CD28 signalling promotes glycolytic flux and mTOR‑dependent translation, supporting rapid proliferation and effector function; recent syntheses connect sustained CD28 tone with maintenance and differentiation of effector programs, highlighting the importance of signal strength and duration (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4).

Translational landscape and safety
- B7–CD28 axis blockade. CTLA‑4–Ig biologics (abatacept, belatacept) clinically block CD28 ligation by sequestering CD80/CD86 and are used to prevent GVHD or as immunosuppression in transplantation; balancing efficacy with risks (e.g., acute rejection) motivates next‑generation approaches that spare CTLA‑4 function while limiting CD28 (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3).
- Engineered costimulation. Incorporating CD28 ICDs into CARs augments antitumor efficacy but also shapes metabolism, persistence, and toxicity risks; mechanistic data in 2024 demonstrate that adding CD28 to CAR‑NK cells engages an Lck/CD3ζ/ZAP70 axis, boosting serial killing, persistence, and tumor infiltration (acharya2024cd28costimulationaugments pages 6-8).
- Agonism cautions. The TGN1412 incident remains a sentinel safety case against systemic, unconditioned CD28 agonism; contemporary strategies emphasize tumor‑selective bispecifics and trispecifics that confine CD28 activation to the tumor microenvironment (lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4).
- Small molecules (future direction). First reports of CD28‑targeted small molecules indicate tractability of orthosteric/allosteric antagonism with measurable biochemical and functional potency in human cell models, expanding modalities beyond biologics (upadhyay2025smallmoleculebasedblockade pages 21-26).

Conclusion
Recent high‑resolution mechanistic work establishes that CD28 co‑stimulation shapes proximal TCR signalling by recruiting active Lck and accelerating ZAP70 activation within microclusters, while canonical YMNM/PRRP/PYAP motifs engage PI3K/GRB2, ITK/PLCγ1, and Lck/PKCθ pathways to drive NF‑κB/AP‑1/NFAT and mTOR‑dependent programs. These insights, together with quantitative human expression and ligand biology (CD80/CD86; CTLA‑4 competition), underpin the clinical success of costimulation blockade (CTLA‑4–Ig), inform rational costimulatory engineering in CAR and emerging CAR‑NK therapies, and caution against systemic agonism while motivating tumor‑restricted activation and small‑molecule antagonists (raychaudhuri2024cd28shapest pages 1-2, ciesielskafiglon2024theroleof pages 4-5, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 3-4, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 1-3, acharya2024cd28costimulationaugments pages 6-8, lotze2024cd28costimulationnovel pages 19-20, upadhyay2025smallmoleculebasedblockade pages 21-26).
