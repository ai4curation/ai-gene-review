description: >-
  CD28 is the prototypic T cell co-stimulatory receptor (signal 2) that synergizes with TCR engagement
  (signal 1) to enable full T cell activation. It is a ~44 kDa disulfide-linked homodimer of the
  immunoglobulin superfamily, containing an extracellular IgV-type domain with a conserved MYPPPY motif
  that mediates binding to its ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells. CD28 is
  expressed on nearly all human CD4+ T cells and a substantial fraction of CD8+ T cells. Upon ligation,
  the cytoplasmic tail recruits signaling molecules via three key motifs: YMNM (binds PI3K p85 subunit
  and GRB2), PRRP (recruits ITK leading to PLCgamma1 and SLP-76/GADS engagement), and PYAP (binds Lck
  and assembles PKC-theta at the synapse). These converge on NF-kB, AP-1, and NFAT transcriptional
  programs and mTOR-dependent metabolic reprogramming to drive IL-2 production, T cell survival,
  proliferation, and effector differentiation. The inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 competes for the same B7
  ligands with higher affinity, providing a critical negative regulatory checkpoint. Inherited CD28
  deficiency causes susceptibility to HPV-related verrucosis (IMD123). CD28 localizes to the immune
  synapse at the T cell-APC interface, where it accelerates Lck recruitment to TCR microclusters and
  lowers the TCR activation threshold.

      CD28 costimulation is one of the best-characterized drivers of T cell proliferation. Anti-CD28

      CD28 costimulation amplifies and modulates TCR signaling. The 2024 imaging study demonstrates
      that CD28 costimulation specifically accelerates Lck recruitment and ZAP70 activation within

    summary: >-
      Ensembl Compara transfer from mouse CD28 (P31041). CD28 localizes to the immunological
      synapse upon T cell-APC contact, where it co-assembles with TCR microclusters. The 2024
      TIRF microscopy study directly demonstrates CD28 costimulation shapes signaling within
      TCR microclusters at the immune synapse.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Immunological synapse localization is well established for CD28. This is where CD28
      carries out its costimulatory function by recruiting Lck to TCR microclusters. The
      IEA transfer from mouse is consistent with extensive experimental evidence.

      Ensembl Compara transfer from mouse. CD28 binds multiple protein kinases including
      PI3K (via p85 regulatory subunit, YMNM motif), Lck (via PYAP motif), ITK (via PRRP motif),
      and PKC-theta. This is a well-documented core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein kinase binding is well supported for CD28. The cytoplasmic tail recruits PI3K,
      Lck, ITK, and PKC-theta through distinct motifs. This IEA is consistent with extensive
      experimental evidence and is a far more informative MF term than generic protein binding.

      Schwartz et al. 2001 solved the crystal structure of the CTLA-4/B7-2 complex, providing
      structural basis for costimulation. The paper discusses both CD28 and CTLA-4 as
      transmembrane signaling receptors that engage B7 ligands. CD28 ligation with B7 ligands
      initiates intracellular signaling cascades.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Transmembrane signaling receptor activity is an appropriate MF for CD28. CD28 spans the
      membrane and upon ligand (CD80/CD86) binding, transmits signals intracellularly through
      its cytoplasmic YMNM/PRRP/PYAP motifs. This term is accurate but somewhat general;
      coreceptor activity (GO:0015026) is more precise.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IGI annotation for T cell activation with genetic interactor IL-4 (P05112). The referenced
      publication PMID:18337562 (Murooka et al. 2008) focuses on CCL5-mediated T cell chemotaxis
      and mTOR signaling, not directly on CD28. However, T cell activation is the defining
      biological process for CD28, supported by overwhelming evidence from multiple other
      publications and the IBA and IDA annotations for the same term. CD28 is the prototypic
      T cell costimulatory receptor; its role in T cell activation is beyond question
      (PMID:1650475, PMID:23918985, PMID:11279501).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although the specific publication (PMID:18337562) is about CCL5-mediated chemotaxis rather
      than CD28 per se, T cell activation is the single most well-established function of CD28.
      The IBA and IDA annotations for this same term are already accepted. CD28 is literally
      defined as the prototypic T cell costimulatory receptor, and T cell activation is its core
      function. The IGI evidence code with IL-4 as genetic interactor is consistent with the
      known role of CD28 costimulation in cytokine-dependent T cell activation programs.

      IMP annotation for positive regulation of gene expression. Publication not available.

      While CD28 signaling does regulate gene expression programs through NF-kB/NFAT/AP-1
      activation, this is a very broad downstream effect rather than a core molecular function
      of CD28 itself. The annotation is not wrong, but represents a downstream consequence of
      CD28 costimulatory signaling rather than a defining function. Publication not available

  description: >-
    CD28 is the prototypic T cell coreceptor. It cooperates with the TCR by binding B7 ligands
    (CD80/CD86) on APCs to provide signal 2 for T cell activation. This is the single most precise
    molecular function term for CD28.
