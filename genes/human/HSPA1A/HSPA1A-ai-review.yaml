description: Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (HSPA1A/HSP72/HSP70-1) is a major stress-inducible member of
  the HSP70 molecular chaperone family. It functions as an ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone implicated
  in a wide variety of cellular processes including protection of the proteome from stress, folding and
  transport of newly synthesized polypeptides, refolding of misfolded proteins, activation of proteolysis
  of misfolded proteins, and the formation and dissociation of protein complexes. HSPA1A has genuine foldase
  activity, demonstrated by luciferase refolding assays, and also suppresses protein aggregation. Its
  acetylation/deacetylation state determines whether it functions in protein refolding (via HOPX co-chaperone)
  or protein degradation (via STUB1/CHIP ubiquitin ligase). Additionally, HSPA1A has roles in regulating
  apoptosis, centrosome integrity during mitosis, TGF-beta signaling, and can function as an extracellular
  signaling molecule (receptor ligand activity). It also possesses ATP-dependent protein disaggregase
  activity.

  review:
    summary: HSPA1A nuclear localization is well-supported. During heat shock, Hsp70 translocates to the
      nucleus via Hikeshi (PMID:22024166), interacts with HSF1 transactivation domain to repress transcription
      (PMID:9499401), and localizes to nuclear speck-like structures (PMID:9553041). During erythropoiesis,
      Hsp70 accumulates in the nucleus where it protects GATA-1 from caspase-3 cleavage (PMID:17167422).
      Hsp70 also sequesters AUF1 in the perinucleus/nucleus during heat shock (PMID:10205060). IBA annotation
      is phylogenetically sound and experimentally confirmed by multiple IDA studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is well-established for HSPA1A under multiple conditions including heat
      stress (nuclear import via Hikeshi), transcriptional regulation (HSF1 repression), and erythropoiesis
      (GATA-1 protection). Supported by IDA evidence from PMID:17167422, PMID:10205060, PMID:9553041.

      binding domain (NBD) possesses intrinsic ATPase activity that is stimulated by J-domain co-chaperones
      (PMID:21231916). The ATPase cycle drives conformational changes between open (ATP-bound) and closed
      (ADP-bound) states of the substrate binding domain, which is essential for chaperone function. Directly
      demonstrated by IDA evidence (PMID:21231916, PMID:23921388). IBA annotation is phylogenetically

    summary: HSPA1A promotes proteasomal degradation of substrates via its interaction with the CHIP/STUB1
      ubiquitin ligase. Hsp70 delivers misfolded substrates to CHIP for ubiquitination and proteasomal
      degradation. Shang et al. (2014) showed Hsp70 enhances CHIP-induced ubiquitination and degradation
      of Smad3 (PMID:24613385). Imai et al. (2002) showed CHIP-Hsp70-Parkin complex promotes ubiquitination
      of Pael-R (PMID:12150907). The acetylation state of HSPA1A (by NAA10/ARD1) determines whether substrates
      are directed toward refolding or degradation (PMID:27708256). IBA annotation is well-supported.

  review:
    summary: HSPA1A binds ATP and ADP as part of its core chaperone cycle. The N-terminal nucleotide-binding
      domain (NBD) binds and hydrolyzes ATP, which drives the conformational changes essential for chaperone
      function (PMID:21231916, PMID:23921388). Nucleotide binding is a correct but very broad parent term;
      the more specific GO:0005524 ATP binding is already annotated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nucleotide binding is accurate for HSPA1A. While broader than GO:0005524 (ATP binding), it

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation likely derives from the Hsp70-Pael-R interaction described in PMID:12150907.
      Pael-R (GPR37) is a GPCR, and Hsp70 forms a complex with CHIP, Parkin, and unfolded Pael-R. However,
      Hsp70 binds the unfolded Pael-R as a chaperone substrate, not as a GPCR ligand engaging in canonical
      receptor binding. The term "G protein-coupled receptor binding" is misleading here.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Hsp70 binds unfolded Pael-R (a GPCR) in the context of chaperone-mediated quality control
      and CHIP/Parkin-directed ubiquitination (PMID:12150907), not as a functional GPCR binding partner.
      This is chaperone-substrate interaction, not receptor binding in the signaling sense.

    summary: HSPA1A can inhibit protein ubiquitination by competing with CHIP/STUB1 for substrate binding.
      In the CHIP-Hsp70-Parkin complex, Hsp70 can sequester substrates and prevent their ubiquitination
      until CHIP promotes Hsp70 dissociation (PMID:12150907). Confirmed by IDA (PMID:12150907).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Negative regulation of ubiquitination is a genuine property of Hsp70 chaperone triage. Hsp70
      binding to substrates can shield them from ubiquitin ligases until the appropriate signal triggers
      degradation (PMID:12150907).

      off substrates to HSP90 (PMID:10811660).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly is a genuine function of HSPA1A, particularly
      in the HSP70-HOP-HSP90 pathway for steroid receptor maturation. Confirmed by IDA (PMID:10811660).

    summary: GO:0031249 is under the same obsoletion discussion as GO:0051082 (go-ontology#30962). The
      PMID:21909508 data support HSPA1A recognition of non-native/disordered protein states, but the
      mechanistically informative molecular function for HSPA1A is ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
      activity rather than a generic denatured-protein binding label.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: For HSPA1A, denatured-protein recognition is part of the broader Hsp70 chaperone cycle. The
      annotation is better represented by GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which captures active
      substrate handling and folding support rather than passive binding alone.

      (PMID:12150907, Imai et al. 2002) describes CHIP-Hsp70-Parkin complex formation with unfolded Pael
      receptor as substrate, showing Hsp70 binds unfolded Pael-R in the context of ER stress and Parkin-mediated
      ubiquitination. While this demonstrates Hsp70 interacts with an unfolded substrate, the functional
      context is chaperone-mediated quality control, not merely binding. HSPA1A has well-characterized
      protein folding chaperone activity (PMID:21231916), so the annotation should be modified to GO:0044183.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. PMID:12150907 (Imai et al. 2002) demonstrates that Hsp70 forms

      the complex to facilitate ubiquitination. This is a chaperone triage function, not passive binding
      of unfolded proteins. HSPA1A is a genuine protein folding chaperone with foldase activity (PMID:21231916),
      so the annotation should be replaced with GO:0044183 which accurately captures its molecular function.

    label: protein folding chaperone
  description: >-
    HSPA1A is the major stress-inducible HSP70 chaperone. It functions as an ATP-dependent
    foldase that assists folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and refolding of
    stress-denatured proteins. HSPA1A binds unfolded/misfolded substrates via its C-terminal
    substrate-binding domain and undergoes iterative ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational
    cycles regulated by J-domain co-chaperones (DNAJB1, DNAJA1/2) and nucleotide exchange
    factors (BAG1/2/3, HSPH1). It triages substrates between refolding and proteasomal
    degradation via STUB1/CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligase. HSPA1A protected cells from heat-induced
    cell death and supported luciferase refolding in functional assays.

    label: ATP-dependent protein disaggregase activity
  description: >-
    HSPA1A works with DNAJ co-chaperones and HSPH1 nucleotide exchange factor to
    solubilize and disaggregate protein aggregates. This disaggregase activity uses
    the same ATP hydrolysis cycle as the foldase function but is directed toward
    pre-formed aggregates rather than nascent or stress-denatured monomers. This
    function is important for preventing accumulation of toxic protein aggregates
    and inclusion bodies under stress conditions.
