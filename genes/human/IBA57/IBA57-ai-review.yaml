description: IBA57 (Iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor IBA57, mitochondrial) is a
  nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that functions as a late-acting assembly factor
  in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis pathway. IBA57 operates
  in cooperation with ISCA1 and ISCA2 to convert 2Fe-2S clusters into 4Fe-4S clusters.
  Specifically, IBA57 forms a heterodimeric complex with ISCA2 that contains a bridging
  2Fe-2S cluster, which serves as an intermediate in the reductive coupling mechanism
  that generates 4Fe-4S clusters. The protein is essential for maturation of mitochondrial
  4Fe-4S-containing enzymes including respiratory complexes I and II, aconitase, and
  lipoic acid synthase (LIAS). Pathogenic variants in IBA57 cause multiple mitochondrial
  dysfunctions syndrome 3 (MMDS3) and spastic paraplegia 74 (SPG74), characterized
  by defects in respiratory chain complexes and impaired lipoylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The deep research review (IBA57-deep-research-falcon.md)
  confirms IBA57 functions downstream with ISCA1-ISCA2 during the late step that converts
  two GLRX5-derived 2Fe-2S clusters into a 4Fe-4S cluster.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA57 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix where it functions in
      the late-stage ISC machinery. This is well-supported by multiple lines of evidence
      including immunofluorescence microscopy (PMID:22323289) and the known mitochondrial
      targeting sequence (residues 1-39 per UniProt). The IBA phylogenetic inference
      is consistent with experimental data. The deep research (IBA57-deep-research-falcon.md)
      confirms mitochondrial matrix localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The mitochondrial matrix localization is strongly supported by experimental
      evidence. PMID:22323289 demonstrated mitochondrial localization using immunofluorescence,
      and the UniProt entry confirms a mitochondrial transit peptide. The IBA annotation
      from phylogenetic inference is concordant with experimental data.

    label: heme biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from UniProt keyword mapping. While there
      is indirect connection between iron-sulfur cluster assembly and heme biosynthesis
      (ferrochelatase is an Fe-S protein), IBA57 is not directly involved in heme
      biosynthesis. The primary role of IBA57 is in 4Fe-4S cluster assembly, not heme
      biosynthesis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This appears to be an over-annotation. IBA57 is specifically involved
      in 4Fe-4S cluster assembly, not heme biosynthesis. The UniProt keyword association
      is likely too broad. The literature consistently describes IBA57 as an Fe-S
      cluster assembly factor with no direct evidence for a role in heme biosynthesis.
      The primary pathway affected by IBA57 deficiency is Fe-S cluster biogenesis,
      not heme synthesis (PMID:22323289, PMID:23462291).

      study (PMID:31831856) characterized the structural properties of this complex
      using SAXS and biophysical methods. The R146A mutation abolishes this interaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the protein-protein interaction is experimentally validated, protein
      binding is too generic. The interaction is specifically with ISCA2 and is mediated
      by a 2Fe-2S cluster. A more informative annotation would capture this functional
      aspect, such as 2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding (GO:0051537) given the cluster-mediated
      nature of the complex.

  original_reference_id: PMID:22681889
  review:
    summary: This annotation comes from a high-throughput mRNA-bound proteome study
      that identified nearly 800 proteins in HEK293 cells. The study explicitly states
      that about one-third of identified proteins were not previously annotated as
      RNA binding. IBA57s primary established function is in Fe-S cluster assembly,
      with no other literature supporting an RNA binding function.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is likely a false positive from high-throughput data.
      The Baltz et al. (2012) study was a large-scale mRNA-bound proteome analysis
      that identified many proteins not previously known to bind RNA. IBA57 has no
      known or predicted RNA-binding domain, and its well-established function is
      in mitochondrial 4Fe-4S cluster assembly with ISCA1/ISCA2. There is no corroborating
      evidence from any other study for RNA binding activity of IBA57. The domain
      structure (GcvT family, CAF17/IBA57 subfamily) is not consistent with RNA binding
      function.
