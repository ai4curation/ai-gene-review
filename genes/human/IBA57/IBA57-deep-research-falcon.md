## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q5T440
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor IBA57, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=Iron-sulfur cluster assembly factor homolog; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IBA57; Synonyms=C1orf69;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GcvT family. CAF17/IBA57 subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** TrmE/GcvT_dom1. (IPR027266); YgfZ/GcvT. (IPR045179); YgfZ/GcvT_CS. (IPR017703); Beta-barrel_CAF17_C (PF25455)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IBA57" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IBA57' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IBA57** (gene ID: IBA57, UniProt: Q5T440) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- We verified the target as human IBA57, mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly factor (UniProt Q5T440), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein functioning in the ISC pathway. Literature confirms its mitochondrial localization and role as a late-acting assembly factor for [4Fe-4S] protein maturation, consistent with the user-provided identity and domains context (CAF17/IBA57 subfamily) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20).

Key concepts and definitions
- Primary function and biochemical role: IBA57 is a late-acting mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster assembly factor required for maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins; it is not a classical enzyme but acts within a protein network that converts [2Fe-2S] to [4Fe-4S] clusters (assembly factor rather than catalyst) (Bargagna 2024, Int. J. Mol. Sci., 28 Sep 2024, DOI: 10.3390/ijms251910466) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20).
- Pathway positioning: In the human mitochondrial ISC pathway, de novo [2Fe-2S] is formed upstream (ISCU2/NFS1/ISD11/ACP1/FXN) and transferred by GLRX5. IBA57 functions downstream with ISCA1–ISCA2 during the late step that converts two GLRX5-derived [2Fe-2S] clusters into a [4Fe-4S] cluster; electron input is provided by the mitochondrial ferredoxin system (FDX2–FDXR) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).
- Interaction partners and complex: (i) ISCA1–ISCA2 heterocomplex forms the scaffold for [4Fe-4S] assembly; (ii) IBA57 interacts directly with ISCA2 to form a heterocomplex bearing a [2Fe-2S] intermediate, supporting a reductive coupling mechanism; (iii) GLRX5 donates [2Fe-2S] to the ISCA scaffold; (iv) FDX2–FDXR supplies electrons. These relationships place IBA57 specifically at the late ISC conversion step (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).
- Subcellular localization: Mitochondria (matrix/inner compartment), functioning within the mitochondrial ISC machinery (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20).

Mechanistic models and structural/biophysical insights
- Reductive coupling on ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57: Biophysical data (NMR, SEC, CD) show IBA57 partners with ISCA2 in a [2Fe-2S]–ISCA2–IBA57 heterocomplex, consistent with handling of [2Fe-2S] intermediates en route to [4Fe-4S] assembly on ISCA1–ISCA2. Pathogenic IBA57 G104C does not abolish complex formation but weakens and destabilizes interactions, rationalizing loss of function (Bargagna 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms251910466) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 76-77, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).
- Specific residue context: Gly104 lies in a solvent-exposed loop of the IBA57 B-domain and is near Cys259 implicated in ligation within the [2Fe-2S]–ISCA2–IBA57 complex; substitution by Cys perturbs local interactions and reduces complex tightness despite preserving the overall fold (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 76-77, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).

Downstream targets and cellular phenotypes of IBA57 deficiency
- IBA57 depletion or pathogenic variants diminish activities of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S]–dependent proteins: respiratory chain complexes I and II, mitochondrial aconitase, and succinate dehydrogenase; they also impair lipoic acid synthase (LIAS), causing reduced lipoylation of PDH, KGDH, and GCSH (Bargagna 2024; Mandigers 2023, Front. Genet., 12 Jul 2023, DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1190222) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20, mandigers2023anoveliba57 pages 1-2).

Disease links and recent clinical data (2023–2024 priority)
- Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 3 (MMDS3; OMIM 615330): Autosomal recessive disorder due to biallelic IBA57 variants, characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes and leukoencephalopathy, biochemical deficits in complex I/II and lipoylation, and impaired [4Fe-4S] maturation; ≈36 pathogenic IBA57 variants reported through 2024 (Bargagna 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms251910466) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71).
- 2023–2025 cohort update: A 2025 cohort analysis aggregating literature and 11 Chinese patients (total ~61 patients) identified c.286T>C as a hotspot in Chinese patients (≈85.2% in that subgroup) and reported >90% 5‑year survival in this subgroup, indicating genotype–phenotype variability and relatively stable natural history for that allele (Jiang 2025; database search up to Dec 2023) (jiang2025phenotypicspectrumofa pages 1-5).
- Comparative in vivo evidence: A canine IBA57 missense variant (R147W) underlies necrotizing myelopathy; humanized complementation assays showed only partial rescue of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein defects with this variant, supporting pathogenic impairment of the late ISC step and reinforcing cross-species functional conservation (Front. Genet., 12 Jul 2023, DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2023.1190222) (mandigers2023anoveliba57 pages 1-2).

Current applications and implementations
- Diagnostics: Recognition of the IBA57 late-ISC role and its characteristic biochemical signature (complex I/II deficiency, decreased aconitase, hypo-lipoylation of PDH/KGDH) guides molecular testing panels for leukoencephalopathy/MMDS, variant interpretation (e.g., G104C), and prognosis stratification where genotype–phenotype data (e.g., c.286T>C hotspot) are available (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20, jiang2025phenotypicspectrumofa pages 1-5).
- Functional validation: Cell-based complementation in IBA57-depleted human cells is used to assess variant pathogenicity (e.g., partial rescue by R147W), linking genotype to mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] target activities (mandigers2023anoveliba57 pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative reviews
- Comprehensive review (2024): Bargagna et al. synthesize human mitochondrial/cytosolic Fe–S maturation, positioning IBA57 with ISCA1/2 in the late [4Fe-4S] assembly step, summarizing interaction evidence, variant effects, and disease phenotypes (Int. J. Mol. Sci., 28 Sep 2024, DOI: 10.3390/ijms251910466) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Variant catalog: ≈36 pathogenic IBA57 variants (as of 2024) (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20).
- Cohort genetics: In a Chinese cohort, c.286T>C represented ~85.2% of IBA57 variants; aggregated patient count ~61; subgroup 5‑year survival >90% (data compiled up to Dec 2023) (jiang2025phenotypicspectrumofa pages 1-5).
- Functional impact: IBA57 deficiency reduces activities of complex I/II, aconitase, and lipoylation-dependent enzymes in human cells and models (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, mandigers2023anoveliba57 pages 1-2, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20).

Notes on nomenclature and family/domains
- The literature consistently refers to human IBA57 as a mitochondrial late-ISC assembly factor that partners with ISCA1/2 for [4Fe-4S] maturation. Structural/biophysical analyses emphasize the ISCA2–IBA57 heterocomplex and pathogenic destabilization by G104C. While UniProt classifies IBA57 within the CAF17/IBA57 subfamily and notes homology to bacterial YgfZ/GcvT-like proteins, the gathered 2023–2024 sources above focus primarily on its mitochondrial ISC role; domain-specific assertions beyond these mechanistic data are therefore limited to avoid overreach (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 76-77).

Conclusion
Human IBA57 (Q5T440) is a mitochondrial late-acting Fe–S assembly factor that collaborates with ISCA1/2 to convert GLRX5-delivered [2Fe-2S] into [4Fe-4S] clusters, with FDX2–FDXR supplying electrons. Direct ISCA2–IBA57 complex formation underlies a mechanistic model of reductive coupling; pathogenic variants (e.g., G104C) destabilize this process. Deficiency impairs respiratory complexes I/II, aconitase, and lipoic acid synthesis, producing MMDS3 and related phenotypes. Recent reviews and studies (2023–2024) consolidate these insights and provide expanding variant catalogs and cohort statistics that inform diagnosis and prognosis (bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 70-71, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 63-70, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfor pages 76-77, bargagna2024molecularpathwaysfora pages 16-20, mandigers2023anoveliba57 pages 1-2, jiang2025phenotypicspectrumofa pages 1-5).
