description: 'Suppressor of cytokine signaling 4 (SOCS4, ~50 kDa), member of SOCS family serving as STAT-induced
  inhibitor and negative feedback regulator in cytokine and growth factor signaling. Contains central
  SH2 domain (binds phosphotyrosine) and C-terminal SOCS box (recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery).
  Long N-terminal region (~270 aa) characteristic of SOCS4-7 subfamily. Functions as E3 ligase adaptor:
  SH2 domain binds specific phosphotyrosine motifs on activated receptors/kinases, while SOCS box recruits
  Elongin B/C-Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting proteasomal degradation of bound substrates.
  Primary target is EGFR - binds phospho-Y1092 on activated EGFR, recruiting ubiquitin ligase for receptor
  degradation and blocking STAT3 binding site, thereby attenuating EGF-induced signaling. Acts as brake
  on growth factor receptor signaling by physically associating with and marking activated proteins for
  destruction. Also reported weak interactions with c-Kit receptor and JAK2. Critical role in limiting
  inflammatory responses during infection - SOCS4-knockout mice highly susceptible to influenza with exaggerated
  cytokine storm (excessive chemokines/cytokines causing tissue damage). Tempers initial wave of inflammation
  preventing immune-mediated damage. Human SOCS4 T266M mutation causes autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome
  via hyperactive EGFR-STAT3 signaling. Acts as tumor suppressor in some cancers (gastric, lung) where
  loss removes brake on EGFR/STAT3 oncogenic pathways. Cytosolic protein recruited to activated receptor
  complexes at plasma membrane or endosomes. Broadly expressed with inducible upregulation by cytokines/growth
  factors. Dispensable for baseline development but crucial during acute stress responses.'

  review:
    summary: SOCS4 is induced by cytokines and acts as a negative feedback regulator in cytokine signaling
      pathways. While SOCS4 is part of the SOCS family which regulates cytokine signaling, its primary
      characterized function is EGFR regulation rather than direct JAK/STAT inhibition like SOCS1/3. The
      deep research shows SOCS4 can modulate cytokine responses indirectly through EGFR/STAT3 cross-talk
      and is critical for preventing cytokine storms during infection.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SOCS4 clearly functions in cytokine-mediated signaling pathways as demonstrated by influenza
      infection studies showing SOCS4-KO mice have exaggerated cytokine storm and dysregulated chemokine
      production. IBA phylogenetic inference is well-supported by experimental data showing SOCS4 is induced
      by cytokines and regulates inflammatory responses. This is a core biological process for SOCS4.

        by excessive production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that led to tissue damage.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This term is too broad and uninformative. SOCS4 does negatively regulate signal transduction,
      but this annotation provides no specificity about which pathways or mechanisms. More specific terms
      like GO:0007175 (negative regulation of EGFR activity) or GO:0032436 (positive regulation of proteasomal
      degradation) better capture SOCS4's actual molecular function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct, this term is too general to be useful. SOCS4's specific mechanism
      is to promote ubiquitin-mediated degradation of activated receptors, particularly EGFR. The more
      specific child terms already present in the annotation set (GO:0007175, GO:0032436) provide better
      functional information. This should be replaced with more specific regulatory terms or removed as

  review:
    summary: SOCS4 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor. Its SOCS box domain recruits the Elongin
      B/C-Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex to targets bound by its SH2 domain (particularly phosphorylated
      EGFR), promoting their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This is well-established
      by structural studies and functional experiments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures SOCS4's core molecular mechanism. The crystal structure
      of SOCS4-Elongin B/C complex (PMID:17997974) demonstrates how SOCS box recruits ubiquitination machinery.
      Deep research confirms SOCS4 promotes EGFR degradation through this mechanism. This is a fundamental
      aspect of SOCS4 function and merits acceptance despite IEA evidence code.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This term is extremely broad and uninformative. While SOCS4 does participate in intracellular
      signal transduction by modulating receptor signaling, this high-level process term provides minimal
      functional information. More specific child terms already annotated (cytokine signaling, EGFR regulation)
      are far more informative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This annotation is at the wrong level of granularity - too general to be useful. SOCS4's role
      is specifically as a negative regulator targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (particularly EGFR)
      and modulating STAT signaling. The term "intracellular signal transduction" could apply to thousands
      of proteins. Should be replaced with more specific regulatory terms that capture SOCS4's actual
      mechanism and pathway involvement.

    label: protein ubiquitination
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000041
  review:
    summary: SOCS4 promotes protein ubiquitination by serving as an adaptor that recruits E3 ubiquitin
      ligase machinery (Elongin B/C-Cullin-5) to bound substrates like activated EGFR. This is a core
      aspect of SOCS4's mechanism of action.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is IEA (inferred from UniPathway), it accurately represents SOCS4's established
      molecular function. The SOCS box domain recruits ubiquitin ligase complexes to promote degradation
      of receptor targets. This is well-supported by structural and functional studies showing SOCS4-mediated
      EGFR ubiquitination and degradation. Core mechanism annotation that should be retained.

      supporting_text: The SOCS box domain mediates the interaction with the Elongin BC complex, an adapter
        module in different E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. This SOCS4–Elongin-Cullin complex catalyzes
        the polyubiquitination of the associated target protein, marking it for proteasomal degradation.

    label: negative regulation of epidermal growth factor-activated receptor activity
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:15590694
  review:
    summary: This is the primary, best-characterized function of SOCS4. PMID:15590694 experimentally demonstrates
      that SOCS4 and SOCS5 negatively regulate EGFR signaling. SOCS4's SH2 domain binds phospho-Y1092
      on activated EGFR, recruiting ubiquitin ligase machinery for receptor degradation while simultaneously
      blocking STAT3 binding to that site.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the gold-standard annotation for SOCS4 - experimental IDA evidence from the seminal
      paper characterizing SOCS4/5 function in EGFR regulation. Deep research confirms EGFR is the primary
      characterized target of SOCS4. UniProt function section emphasizes EGFR degradation. This represents
      SOCS4's core molecular function and should be retained as a cornerstone annotation. Well-supported
      by structural studies (PMID:17997974) and functional validation.

      supporting_text: A defining target of SOCS4 is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a receptor
        tyrosine kinase. SOCS4 was shown to bind directly to a particular phosphotyrosine site on the
        activated EGFR (tyrosine 1092 in the human EGFR cytoplasmic domain) via its SH2 domain.
