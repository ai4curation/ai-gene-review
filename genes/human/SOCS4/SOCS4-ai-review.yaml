description: 'Suppressor of cytokine signaling 4 (SOCS4, ~50 kDa), member of SOCS
  family serving as STAT-induced inhibitor and negative feedback regulator in cytokine
  and growth factor signaling. Contains central SH2 domain (binds phosphotyrosine)
  and C-terminal SOCS box (recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase machinery). Long N-terminal
  region (~270 aa) characteristic of SOCS4-7 subfamily. Functions as E3 ligase adaptor:
  SH2 domain binds specific phosphotyrosine motifs on activated receptors/kinases,
  while SOCS box recruits Elongin B/C-Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting
  proteasomal degradation of bound substrates. Primary target is EGFR - binds phospho-Y1092
  on activated EGFR, recruiting ubiquitin ligase for receptor degradation and blocking
  STAT3 binding site, thereby attenuating EGF-induced signaling. Acts as brake on
  growth factor receptor signaling by physically associating with and marking activated
  proteins for destruction. Also reported weak interactions with c-Kit receptor and
  JAK2. Critical role in limiting inflammatory responses during infection - SOCS4-knockout
  mice highly susceptible to influenza with exaggerated cytokine storm (excessive
  chemokines/cytokines causing tissue damage). Tempers initial wave of inflammation
  preventing immune-mediated damage. Human SOCS4 T266M mutation causes autoimmune/inflammatory
  syndrome via hyperactive EGFR-STAT3 signaling. Acts as tumor suppressor in some
  cancers (gastric, lung) where loss removes brake on EGFR/STAT3 oncogenic pathways.
  Cytosolic protein recruited to activated receptor complexes at plasma membrane or
  endosomes. Broadly expressed with inducible upregulation by cytokines/growth factors.
  Dispensable for baseline development but crucial during acute stress responses.'
