## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8WXH5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; Short=SOCS-4; AltName: Full=Suppressor of cytokine signaling 7; Short=SOCS-7;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SOCS4; Synonyms=SOCS7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** SH2. (IPR000980); SH2_dom_sf. (IPR036860); SOCS4/SOCS5_dom. (IPR022252); SOCS4_SH2. (IPR035864); SOCS4_SOCS. (IPR037342)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SOCS4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SOCS4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SOCS4** (gene ID: SOCS4, UniProt: Q8WXH5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification. We verified that the research target is human SOCS4 (UniProt Q8WXH5), a suppressor of cytokine signaling family member with a central SH2 domain and a C‑terminal SOCS box that binds ElonginB/C; SOCS4 belongs to the SOCS4/5 subgroup with a long N‑terminus containing an ESS/NTCR region. This matches the provided identity and domain architecture and avoids symbol ambiguity. The following report synthesizes structural and functional evidence, and recent (2024) expert perspectives.

Executive summary. SOCS4 is an SH2‑containing adaptor that recruits Cullin5–ElonginB/C RING E3 ligase machinery via its SOCS box to ubiquitylate phosphorylated targets, notably EGFR, thereby attenuating receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream STAT3 signaling. Unlike SOCS1/3, SOCS4 lacks a KIR motif and is not a direct JAK catalytic inhibitor; its function is primarily substrate recognition and degradation. Emerging reviews (2024) highlight limited but growing understanding of SOCS4’s immune roles and druggability, with mouse phenotypes indicating host‑defense relevance, although human clinical translation remains incomplete (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13, bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions.
- Identity and domains. SOCS4 is a human SOCS-family protein with: N‑terminal extended region/ESS; central SH2 domain for phosphotyrosine recognition; C‑terminal SOCS box that binds ElonginB/C and assembles CRL5 E3 ligase complexes (Cullin5–Rbx2) (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, bullock2007structureofthe pages 3-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016 (Nov 2007); URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397 (Nov 2024).
- Primary molecular role. SOCS4 acts as a substrate adaptor: its SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine motifs (e.g., EGFR pY1092), while its SOCS box recruits ElonginB/C–Cullin5 to catalyze substrate ubiquitination and degradation, down‑modulating signaling (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.
- Distinction from SOCS1/3. SOCS4 lacks the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) found in SOCS1/3 and is not a direct JAK active‑site inhibitor; it mainly controls signaling by docking to phosphorylated receptors/adaptors and promoting their turnover (keewan2021theemergingrole pages 4-6, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13164000 (Aug 2021); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397 (Nov 2024).

2) Mechanism, binding partners, pathways, and localization.
- EGFR recognition and downregulation. Structural/biophysical work shows SOCS4 binds EGFR pY1092 with high affinity (KD ~0.5 μM) via a hydrophobic SH2 pocket that prefers β‑branched residues at +1/+3 and hydrogen bonding at +2; this enables CRL5 recruitment and EGFR ubiquitination, decreasing receptor levels and attenuating STAT3 signaling, potentially by competing with STAT3 for the same site (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9, bullock2007structureofthe pages 3-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016 (Nov 2007); https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/630797 (Mar 2014).
- Additional phosphotyrosine ligands. SOCS4 can bind phosphopeptides from JAK2 (activation loop pY1007) and KIT (pY568) with lower affinity (low‑μM), consistent with broader SH2‑mediated recognition; functional consequences remain less defined (bullock2007structureofthe pages 6-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016 (Nov 2007).
- CRL5 assembly. The SOCS box of SOCS4 binds ElonginB/C and couples to Cullin5–Rbx2 to form a CRL5 E3 ligase that ubiquitinates bound substrates; this is demonstrated structurally and inferred functionally for receptor downregulation (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.
- Subcellular localization. Direct compartmental localization is not defined in the 2007 structure paper; mechanistically, SOCS4 is expected to act at the cytoplasmic face of activated receptors (e.g., EGFR at the plasma membrane/endosomes) where phosphotyrosines are accessible and CRL5 recruitment can promote receptor ubiquitination and trafficking to proteasomes/lysosomes (inferred from mechanism and EGFR context) (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9).
- JAK/STAT context. By competing for EGFR docking and promoting receptor turnover, SOCS4 indirectly reduces STAT3 activation downstream of EGFR; unlike SOCS1/3, SOCS4 does not utilize a KIR to directly inhibit JAK catalytic activity (sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/630797; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.

3) Recent developments (2023–2024) and expert perspectives.
- 2024 expert review (Frontiers in Immunology) synthesizes SOCS-family druggability and immunological roles, noting SOCS4’s involvement in EGF signaling and receptor tagging for degradation, its long N‑terminal region of uncertain function, and limited clarity on physiological roles; knockout mice exhibit influenza hypersusceptibility and autoimmune indications, suggesting roles in host defense, but mechanistic understanding remains incomplete (lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397 (Nov 2024).
- Structural/druggability insight. SOCS4 has published structural data (SOCS4–ElonginB/C complex), enabling hypotheses for intervention at SH2–phosphopeptide interfaces or SOCS box–Elongin interactions, and potential leveraging of CRL5 for targeted protein degradation; however, concrete SOCS4‑directed chemical matter remains nascent (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.

4) Current applications and implementations.
- Pathway modulation. The best‑defined application is mechanistic: SOCS4’s SH2‑dependent recruitment of CRL5 to EGFR suggests potential strategies to modulate EGFR/STAT3 signaling by enhancing or mimicking SOCS4 action (or conversely blocking SOCS4 where EGFR signaling is desired). Practical therapeutic implementations targeting SOCS4 specifically are not yet established (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.
- Research tools. Structural models define the EGFR pY1092 binding determinants in SOCS4’s SH2 pocket, enabling peptide/probe design to interrogate specificity and to study CRL5 assembly (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, bullock2007structureofthe pages 3-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016.

5) Expert opinions and authoritative analysis.
- Mechanistic consensus. Across structural and review sources, SOCS4 is positioned as a receptor‑proximal negative regulator that limits EGFR (and possibly other RTK) signaling via ubiquitin‑mediated downregulation, and indirectly dampens STAT3; it is mechanistically distinct from SOCS1/3 in lacking a KIR (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: 2007 Structure; 2014 Mol Biol Int; 2024 Front Immunol.
- Immunology perspective (2024). Expert review emphasizes that SOCS4’s physiological roles in immunity remain underdefined compared to SOCS1/3, with mouse susceptibility to influenza highlighting potential importance but limited translational clarity; druggability is plausible but early (lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1449397.

6) Statistics and data from recent and foundational studies.
- Binding affinity. SOCS4 SH2 binds EGFR pY1092 with KD ≈ 0.5 μM (isothermal titration/calorimetry); JAK2 pY1007 and KIT pY568 bind with markedly weaker affinities (low‑μM) (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, bullock2007structureofthe pages 6-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016 (Nov 2007).
- Structural resolution. SOCS4–ElonginB/C ternary complex resolved to 2.5 Å; structure reveals distinct SOCS box interface and ESS‑mediated interdomain packing unique to SOCS4/5 (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, bullock2007structureofthe pages 3-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2007.09.016.
- Cancer context. Reviews summarize associations of SOCS4 downregulation with aggressive behavior in some tumors and its role in EGFR pathway restraint; data are heterogeneous and largely correlative (keewan2021theemergingrole pages 4-6, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13164000 (Aug 2021); https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/630797 (Mar 2014).

Limitations and gaps. SOCS4 human subcellular localization under endogenous conditions and comprehensive interactomes remain under-characterized. There is a paucity of 2023–2024 SOCS4‑specific primary mechanistic papers; most recent insights come from family‑level reviews, with SOCS4’s precise physiological roles and druggability still emerging (lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3).

Embedded artifact with key facts.
| Topic | Key finding (1–2 sentences) | Mechanism/Details | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity and domains | Human SOCS4 (UniProt Q8WXH5) is an SH2-containing SOCS-family protein with a long N-terminal region and a C-terminal SOCS box. | Domain architecture: N-terminal ESS/NTCR region, central SH2 domain for phosphotyrosine recognition, and C-terminal SOCS box for ElonginB/C binding. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3) |
| SH2 specificity & EGFR pY1092 (affinity) | SOCS4 binds the EGFR phosphotyrosine site pY1092 with high affinity (reported KD ≈ 0.5 μM). | SH2 pocket preferences (hydrophobic +1/+3 residues) and specific contacts (e.g., +2 Asn hydrogen bonding) underlie the high-affinity EGFR pY1092 interaction. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9) |
| SOCS box & CRL5 (E3 ligase) assembly | SOCS4 recruits ElonginB/C and assembles with Cullin5–Rbx2 to form a CRL5-type E3 ubiquitin ligase scaffold. | The SOCS box mediates ElonginB/C binding, enabling Cullin5 recruitment and substrate ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3) |
| Structural insights (SOCS4–ElonginBC crystal) | The SOCS4–ElonginB/C crystal reveals a distinct SOCS-box interface, an ESS helix altering SH2–SOCS packing, and a defined SH2 substrate pocket. | Crystal structure explains subfamily-specific interdomain packing, unique hinge insertions, and SH2 pocket residues (e.g., L331, F324) shaping EGFR peptide recognition. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 3-6) |
| Interaction with JAK2 and KIT (lower affinity) | SOCS4 can bind phosphopeptides from JAK2 and KIT with lower (low-micromolar) affinity versus EGFR. | SH2-mediated recognition extends to some JAKs/RTKs, but affinities are weaker and functional consequences are less well defined. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 6-8) |
| Role in EGFR degradation & STAT3 competition | SOCS4 promotes EGFR downregulation and may compete with STAT3 for overlapping EGFR phosphotyrosine docking sites. | SH2 binding to EGFR pY1092 can both target EGFR for CRL5-mediated ubiquitination and sterically occlude STAT3 recruitment, reducing downstream STAT3 signaling. | (bullock2007structureofthe pages 8-9, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9) |
| Family context vs SOCS1/3 (no KIR) | Unlike SOCS1/3, SOCS4 lacks a kinase inhibitory region (KIR) and likely acts primarily via SH2-dependent substrate recruitment and ubiquitin ligase engagement. | Functional distinction: SOCS1/3 can directly inhibit JAK catalytic activity via KIR, whereas SOCS4 uses SH2 + SOCS box to direct ubiquitination of receptors/adaptors. | (keewan2021theemergingrole pages 4-6, lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 2-3) |
| Immune roles & knockout phenotypes (caution) | Mouse data suggest SOCS4 deficiency can cause hypersusceptibility to influenza and implicate roles in host defence, but physiological roles remain incompletely defined. | Evidence from knockout/phenotype studies is limited; immune effects appear context-dependent and require cautious interpretation. | (lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13) |
| Cancer associations (EGFR/GBM context) | SOCS4 expression is linked to modulation of EGFR-driven signaling and has reported associations with some cancers (e.g., renal, pancreatic, glioma contexts in reviews). | Downregulation or altered SOCS4 activity may increase RTK signaling, proliferation, and invasive phenotypes via reduced EGFR turnover; however, clinical evidence is heterogeneous. | (keewan2021theemergingrole pages 4-6, sasi2014theroleof pages 8-9) |
| Druggability & therapeutic potential | Structural data provide a basis for targeting SOCS4-mediated protein–protein interactions, but SOCS4-specific drug strategies remain nascent. | Potential approaches include disrupting SH2–phosphopeptide binding, modulating SOCS box–Elongin interactions, or exploiting CRL engagement for targeted degradation; evidence is currently limited/early. | (lynch2024unravellingthedruggability pages 12-13, bullock2007structureofthe pages 1-2) |
