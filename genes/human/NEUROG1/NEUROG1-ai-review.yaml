description: Neurogenin-1 (NEUROG1) is a proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
  transcription factor essential for neuronal fate commitment and glutamatergic 
  neuron specification. It forms heterodimers with E-proteins (e.g., TCF4/E12) 
  to bind E-box DNA motifs (CANNTG) and activate neuronal differentiation 
  programs. NEUROG1 is critical for the development of cranial sensory ganglia, 
  particularly the trigeminal (CN V) and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) nerves. 
  Loss of NEUROG1 causes congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder (CCDD) with 
  profound deafness, balance defects, oral motor dysfunction, and developmental 
  delay. NEUROG1 promotes neuronal over glial fate and drives glutamatergic 
  versus GABAergic neuron identity in the cortex.

      summary: Core molecular function of NEUROG1 as a bHLH transcription factor
        that binds DNA and activates transcription of neuronal differentiation 
        genes.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function of NEUROG1. The protein 
        functions as an RNA polymerase II-specific transcription factor. Strong 
        experimental support exists (IDA, TAS evidence) and phylogenetic 
        inference is appropriate for this well-conserved function among bHLH 
        factors.

        (IPR011598, IPR036638).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Accurate inference from domain composition. bHLH proteins require 
        dimerization for DNA binding. NEUROG1 forms heterodimers with E-proteins
        (TCF4/E12) as documented in UniProtKB and literature.

    review:
      summary: Direct experimental evidence that NEUROG1 bHLH domain can 
        homodimerize.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Legitimate experimental observation from biochemical studies. 
        However, note that in vivo, NEUROG1 primarily functions as a heterodimer
        with E-proteins (TCF4/E12), not as a homodimer. The homodimerization 
        activity is real but may not reflect the physiologically relevant state.

      summary: Generic cell differentiation term from keyword mapping.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While very broad, this is technically accurate - NEUROG1 drives 
        cell differentiation (specifically neuronal differentiation). The more 
        specific neuron differentiation term (GO:0030182) is more informative,

# Axon development

    review:
      summary: Axon development inferred by phylogenetic analysis across 
        neurogenin orthologs.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: NEUROG1 is expressed in neural progenitors and early 
        differentiating neurons. While NEUROG1-expressing cells will eventually 
        develop axons, axon development is a later differentiation event. This 
        may represent over-annotation or propagation from species where 
        neurogenins have been studied in axonal contexts. Mark as non-core since
        NEUROG1's primary function is fate commitment and early differentiation,
        not axon morphogenesis per se.

    review:
      summary: Sensory organ development inferred across neurogenin family 
        members.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Accurate and well-supported. NEUROG1 is essential for development 
        of cranial sensory ganglia (trigeminal, vestibulocochlear). Loss of 
        NEUROG1 causes profound defects in sensory organ development (inner ear,
        sensory nerve formation). This is a core developmental function.

    review:
      summary: Forebrain development inferred from limited phylogenetic support 
        (only 3 orthologs in WITH/FROM field).
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: NEUROG1 is expressed in forebrain progenitors and contributes to 
        cortical neurogenesis. However, this is one of multiple regional 
        contexts for NEUROG1 function (also hindbrain, cranial ganglia). The IBA
        evidence is weak (only 3 supporting orthologs suggests limited 
        phylogenetic support). Mark as non-core since forebrain is one 
        developmental context but not the defining feature of NEUROG1's 
        function.

    justification: NEUROG1 is a proneural factor that promotes neuronal over 
      glial fate. Like other proneural bHLH factors (ASCL1), NEUROG1 actively 
      suppresses gliogenesis. This reciprocal regulation of the neuron-glia fate
