### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O43633
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Charged multivesicular body protein 2a; AltName: Full=Chromatin-modifying protein 2a; Short=CHMP2a; AltName: Full=Putative breast adenocarcinoma marker BC-2; AltName: Full=Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 2-1; Short=Vps2-1; Short=hVps2-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CHMP2A; Synonyms=BC2, CHMP2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SNF7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Snf7_fam. (IPR005024); Snf7 (PF03357)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CHMP2A" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CHMP2A' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CHMP2A** (gene ID: CHMP2A, UniProt: O43633) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- We verified gene/protein identity (CHMP2A, UniProt O43633) and then gathered recent primary and review literature on ESCRT-III, with emphasis on 2023–2024 sources, to synthesize function, mechanism, partners, localization, regulation, disease links, and applications. Key quantitative and mechanistic findings were extracted where available (noting that CHMP2A-specific effect sizes are rarely reported).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and family: CHMP2A (Charged multivesicular body protein 2A) is a human ESCRT‑III subunit in the SNF7 family with a conserved α‑helical hairpin fold that polymerizes on membranes to mediate reverse‑topology membrane constriction and scission. Like other ESCRT‑III proteins, subunits are autoinhibited in the cytosol and are recycled by the AAA+ ATPases VPS4A/B after polymerization (threading/unfolding) (review synthesis) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).
- Primary biochemical role: ESCRT‑III—including CHMP2A—assembles into spirals/helices on membranes; VPS4 drives dynamic turnover and scission, enabling intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation, viral budding, cytokinetic abscission, autophagosome/phagophore closure, nuclear envelope sealing, and membrane/lysosome repair (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).
- Specific role in autophagy: CHMP2A is required for phagophore closure to generate sealed double‑membrane autophagosomes. Depletion leads to accumulation of unclosed autophagic membranes and impaired autophagic flux; dominant‑negative VPS4 phenocopies this, consistent with ESCRT‑III/VPS4‑dependent membrane abscission at the phagophore edge (primary) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7, hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).

2) Mechanism, structure and partners
- Polymerization and architecture: ESCRT‑III subunits (including CHMP paralogs) assemble into flat spirals and helical collars on membranes as primed states that transition during constriction. Structural work and reviews show ESCRT‑III polymers cause bilayer thinning and curvature; the N‑terminal amphipathic/membrane‑facing helices and basic residues contact acidic lipids (e.g., PIP2) (2023–2024) (moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2). Although CHMP1B/IST1 were the model in the cryo‑EM lipid studies, the principles of ESCRT‑III helix–lipid interactions and constriction apply to CHMP2A polymers (review integration) (moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).
- Assembly order and turnover: ESCRT‑III recruitment often proceeds from ESCRT‑0/I/II and/or ALIX (PDCD6IP), then polymerization of CHMPs including CHMP4B, CHMP2A/CHMP3, etc., followed by VPS4‑driven disassembly to power scission (reviews). ALIX and TSG101 are adaptors at several sites (midbody, viral buds), and CHMP7 can nucleate nuclear envelope recruitment (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- Key partners for CHMP2A function: CHMP3 (forms copolymers with CHMP2A), CHMP4B (initiator scaffold), ALIX/PDCD6IP (adaptor), VPS4A/B (disassembly ATPases), ESCRT‑II component VPS36 (via Arl4A, affecting CHMP2A’s ability to recruit USP8), and upstream ESCRT‑I/II (TSG101, VPS36). 2023 work shows endosomal Arl4A stabilizes VPS36–ESCRT‑III association and delays EGFR degradation by attenuating CHMP2A‑mediated USP8 recruitment in endosomal sorting (primary) ().

3) Cellular/localization context and pathways
- Sites of action: CHMP2A localizes to phagophores and autophagosomal membranes during autophagy; signals are adjacent to LC3‑positive structures and increase with starvation (primary). VPS4 inhibition causes accumulation of immature, unsealed autophagic membranes, consistent with ESCRT‑III at the phagophore neck (primary) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7, hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Endosome/MVB and signaling receptors: In the EGFR pathway, Arl4A–VPS36 association modulates ESCRT‑III function, affecting CHMP2A‑dependent USP8 recruitment and EGFR ubiquitin clearance/degradation, linking CHMP2A to receptor downregulation tempo (primary) ().
- Cytokinetic abscission and genome integrity: ESCRT‑III (including CHMP2A) forms cortical rings/spirals at the midbody to execute abscission. Reviews in 2024 summarize CHMP2A/CHMP4B/IST1 at the midbody and their role in the abscission checkpoint and genome integrity protection (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14).
- Nuclear envelope repair/reformation: ESCRT‑III is recruited to nuclear envelope gaps/ruptures to restore compartmentalization; CHMP7 helps nucleate ESCRT‑III at the inner nuclear membrane, with CHMP2A among recruited ESCRT‑III subunits (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14).

4) Regulation (post‑translational, lipid, dynamics)
- Autoinhibition and activation: CHMP proteins’ C‑termini autoinhibit polymerization; membrane binding and activation expose interfaces for filament assembly; VPS4 recycles subunits via MIT‑MIM interactions (review consensus) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2).
- Lipid dependence: ESCRT‑III constriction is stabilized by interactions with acidic phospholipids (e.g., PIP2) and by creation of local hydrophobic defects where polyunsaturated acyl chains accumulate at the outer leaflet surface; these features slow lipid diffusion in constricted tubules and support scission mechanics (2023 cryo‑EM + MD) (moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8).
- Cross‑pathway regulation: At endosomes, Arl4A binding to ESCRT‑II (VPS36) perturbs ESCRT‑III progression and CHMP2A‑dependent USP8 recruitment, linking small GTPases to ESCRT timing and deubiquitinase access (2023) (). Additional post‑translational regulation of ESCRT‑III is recognized broadly (e.g., methylation of CHMP2B at abscission), underscoring analogous regulatory logic across paralogs (review context) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2).

5) Disease links, applications, expert views, and data
- Neurodegeneration and membrane repair/autophagy failure: ESCRT‑III dysfunction contributes to autophagy and membrane repair defects implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Recent reviews emphasize ESCRT‑III roles in nuclear surveillance and endolysosomal trafficking in the CNS; altered ESCRT‑III function is linked to FTD/ALS and AD pathogenesis. While much genotype–disease data centers on CHMP2B, CHMP2A is included among ESCRT‑III factors required for autophagosome completion in neurons, and its depletion causes accumulation of unsealed autophagosomes and perturbs proteostasis (reviews, primary) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7, hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Autophagy–cell death crosstalk and oncology: CHMP2A loss stabilizes iDISCs on immature autophagosomal membranes and triggers noncanonical Caspase‑8 activation and apoptosis, connecting ESCRT‑III closure failure to death signaling. In vivo, CHMP2A depletion impaired neuroblastoma tumor growth while increasing apoptosis, suggesting context‑dependent therapeutic leverage of ESCRT‑III–autophagy interfaces (primary) (hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Receptor signaling and cancer relevance: By attenuating CHMP2A‑dependent USP8 recruitment, Arl4A–VPS36 slows EGFR deubiquitylation turnover and degradation, potentially prolonging signaling; given EGFR’s centrality in many malignancies, this places CHMP2A within an actionable endosomal sorting axis (primary, 2023) ().
- Expert consensus and translational notes: Contemporary reviews (2024–2025) underscore ESCRT‑III’s broad disease impact—from infections and immune disorders to cancer and neurological disease—and discuss targeting ESCRT adaptors or the disassembly ATPase VPS4 in specific contexts; ESCRT-III subunits themselves are scaffolds without catalytic activity, making direct small‑molecule targeting challenging (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).

6) Quantitative/statistical data where available
- Autophagosome closure assays (human cells) showed significant accumulation of unsealed autophagic membranes upon CHMP2A depletion; experiments typically quantified ≥50 cells per group with strong significance (e.g., **** p ≤ 0.0001), and dominant‑negative VPS4A (E228Q) phenocopied closure defects under basal and starved conditions (primary) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7).
- CHMP2A depletion in the Caspase‑8/iDISC study increased LC3‑II and p62 levels and activated Caspase‑8; genetic epistasis showed ATG7 deletion prevented Caspase‑8 activation after CHMP2A loss, supporting a mechanistic linkage (primary). In vivo, CHMP2A knockdown reduced neuroblastoma tumor growth (quantitative tumor growth curves reported in the paper) (hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2).
- Structural/biophysical: ESCRT‑III constriction remodels leaflet organization and slows lipid diffusion in outer leaflets of constricted tubules; cryo‑EM with brominated lipids revealed protein‑localized lipid asymmetries and defects enabling accumulation of polyunsaturated tails in the outer leaflet (2023) (moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8).

7) Current applications and real‑world implementations (2023–2024 highlights)
- Mechanistic reconstitution and structural advances continue to refine ESCRT‑III models of scission that inform antiviral and anticancer strategies where ESCRT is hijacked or rate‑limiting (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).
- Endosomal EGFR sorting modulation via Arl4A–VPS36–CHMP2A/USP8 provides a concrete regulatory node with implications for tuning receptor downregulation kinetics in cancer models (primary, 2023) ().
- Neurodegeneration: Expert reviews in 2024 emphasize ESCRT‑III’s roles in neuronal nuclear envelope integrity and endolysosomal trafficking, informing therapeutic hypotheses that aim to bolster ESCRT‑mediated repair and autophagy completion (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).

8) Verification checklist (per request)
- Symbol and description match: CHMP2A matches “Charged multivesicular body protein 2a,” human ESCRT‑III. Literature consistently places CHMP2A in ESCRT‑III/SNF7 family (reviews) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2).
- Organism: Homo sapiens, as in all cited primary human‑cell studies (e.g., Takahashi 2018; Lin 2023) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7).
- Domains/family: SNF7/ESCRT‑III fold and dynamics align with reviews and structural studies (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9, moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8).
- Ambiguity: No conflicting gene symbol usage detected in the cited 2023–2024 literature; CHMP2A is distinct from CHMP2B (noted explicitly where assays discriminate them) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2).

While 2025, it provides authoritative mechanistic synthesis relevant to CHMP2A (hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 8-9).

Conclusion
- CHMP2A is a bona fide human ESCRT‑III/SNF7‑family subunit that copolymerizes with CHMP3 and functions with CHMP4B, ALIX, and VPS4 to execute membrane scission across endosomal sorting, autophagosome closure, cytokinetic abscission, and nuclear envelope repair. Its role in phagophore closure is supported by direct human‑cell experiments; its regulatory and disease connections (EGFR trafficking, neurodegeneration‑relevant autophagy and membrane repair) are reinforced by 2023–2024 primary and review literature. ESCRT‑III’s structural principles (polymerization into spirals/helices, lipid engagement, VPS4‑driven turnover) underpin CHMP2A’s functional annotation and suggest translational nodes (e.g., endosomal sorting modulation, ESCRT‑VPS4 axis) (takahashi2018anautophagyassay pages 6-7, hattori2021targetingtheescrtiii pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, moss2023brominatedlipidprobes pages 7-8, hurley2025theexpandingrepertoire pages 1-2).
