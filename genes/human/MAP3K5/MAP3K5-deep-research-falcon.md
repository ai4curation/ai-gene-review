## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q99683
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5; EC=2.7.11.25 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26095851}; AltName: Full=Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; Short=ASK-1; AltName: Full=MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 5; Short=MEK kinase 5; Short=MEKK 5;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MAP3K5; Synonyms=ASK1, MAPKKK5, MEKK5;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. STE Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** DRHyd-ASK. (IPR046872); HisK-N-like. (IPR046873); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); MAP3K_PH. (IPR043969); MAP3K_TRAF-bd. (IPR025136)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MAP3K5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MAP3K5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MAP3K5** (gene ID: MAP3K5, UniProt: Q99683) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
Objective 1 confirmed: Human MAP3K5 encodes apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1; UniProt Q99683), a serine/threonine MAPKKK (EC 2.7.11.25) that activates the JNK and p38 modules. Core regulatory features and domains in recent literature align with the UniProt description, including a TRAF-binding region, thioredoxin-binding inhibitory interface, activation-loop Thr838, and a 14-3-3 regulatory site at Ser966 (Aug 2022; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07783-6; 2024 structural overview) (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).

Comprehensive research report: MAP3K5 (ASK1) in human

1. Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and catalytic role: ASK1 is a stress-responsive MAP3K that phosphorylates and activates MAP2Ks MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 to drive JNK and p38 MAPK cascades, respectively, mediating cellular responses to oxidative, ER, and inflammatory stress (2022 review) (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8). The kinase domain adopts the canonical bilobal fold; autophosphorylation at Thr838 in the activation loop is essential for activation (2024 structural notes) (honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
- Activation mechanisms:
  - Redox/thioredoxin: Under basal conditions, cytosolic Trx1 and mitochondrial Trx2 bind ASK1 and keep it inactive; oxidative stress oxidizes Trx and promotes dissociation, allowing ASK1 oligomerization and activation (2022 review; 2024 structural/mechanistic overview) (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
  - TRAF-mediated signalosome: TRAF2/6 interact with ASK1 (residues ~384–655) to promote oligomerization and activation; this assembly integrates TNF-family signals and stress cues (2024 structural notes) (honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
  - ER-stress axis: IRE1α recruits TRAF2, which scaffolds ASK1 to form an IRE1α–TRAF2–ASK1 complex that activates JNK/p38 and apoptosis during chronic ER stress in ischemic brain models (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-024-01989-5) (kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9).
  - Post-translational regulation: Inhibitory 14-3-3 binding at phospho-Ser966 and AKT-mediated Ser83 phosphorylation restrain ASK1; activation involves autophosphorylation at Thr838 and other sites (2022; 2024 structural notes) (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31). Ubiquitination/deubiquitination and arginine methylation further tune stability and signaling output (2022) (lu2022theroleand pages 9-10).
  - Biophysical context: Intracellular pH modulates ASK1 condensation; pHi elevation enhances optogenetically induced ASK1 clustering and augments JNK signaling, linking biophysical state to stress-kinase output (Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50638-w) (honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
- Localization: ASK1 functions primarily in the cytosol but is functionally coupled to mitochondria via Trx2 and can assemble into stress-induced condensates/signalosomes. In tissues, ASK1 activation is detected in stressed hepatocytes and neurons, where it drives p38/JNK outputs (2024 mechanistic/structural; Feb 2024 hepatology and inflammation studies) (honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9).

2. Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Senescence and SASP: ASK1 is activated during cellular senescence and drives the SASP via p38, promoting expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. ASK1-deficient mice show impaired immune clearance of senescent cells and increased tumorigenesis; conversely, ASK1 deficiency attenuates age-associated p38 activation, inflammation, and glomerulosclerosis (Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06386-0) (odawara2024apoptosissignalregulatingkinase pages 1-3).
- Inflammasome/pyroptosis licensing: JNK signaling is biphasic; MAP3K5-containing complexes contribute to downstream steps of inflammasome activation. Inhibition of MAP3K5 after priming suppresses IL-1β release, propidium iodide uptake, and GSDMD processing, and MAP3K5/JNK2 complexes associate with GSDMD, implying a licensing role near GSDMD-dependent permeabilization (May 2023; conference report; https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.210.supp.167.01) (bradfield2023biphasicjnksignaling pages 3-6).
- Liver disease and oncology: In murine cholestatic and toxic fibrosis models, pharmacologic ASK1 inhibition (GS-444217) reduced phosphorylated p38, hepatocyte death, and fibrosis by up to ~50% in the short term, limited bridging fibrosis by ~25% in the long term, prevented progression to cirrhosis (portal pressure ~6.07 vs 8.53 mm Hg), and cut liver tumor number/size by ~50% after 44 weeks. Mechanistically, ASK1/p38 inhibition blocked the release of mitochondrial DAMPs (mtDNA) from dying hepatocytes (Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1097/hep.0000000000000801) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25).
- Neuroinflammation/ischemia: Targeting the IRE1α–TRAF2–ASK1–JNK axis with ER-stress modulators and ASK1 inhibition reduced neuronal apoptosis in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion models (Feb 2024) (kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9).
- Structural and systems updates: Recent structural work consolidated the roles of NCC-mediated oligomerization, TRAF binding, TRX inhibitory binding, activation-loop Thr838, and 14-3-3/Ser966, while systems studies linked intracellular pH to ASK1 condensates and JNK/p38 output (2024) (honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).

3. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical-stage ASK1 inhibitors: Selonsertib (GS-4997) has been evaluated in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and NASH. Mechanistically, GS-4997 and related ASK1 inhibitors suppress ER-stress–ASK1–JNK/p38 signaling and apoptosis in preclinical models (2014–2015 trials registered; mechanistic 2024 ischemia study) (kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9). A 2022 liver-disease review notes phase 2 efficacy signals and subsequent phase 3 programs in NASH, contextualizing lessons learned for indication selection and endpoints (Aug 2022) (lu2022theroleand pages 9-10). Preclinically, GS-444217 yields robust antifibrotic and anti-tumor effects in liver disease models (Feb 2024) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25).
- Biomarker-guided development: Preclinical liver studies quantified reductions in mtDNA DAMPs, p21+ hepatocytes, serum ammonia, and portal pressure as pharmacodynamic readouts of ASK1 inhibition (Feb 2024) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25).
- Drug discovery: Novel small-molecule chemotypes beyond selonsertib (e.g., benzoheterocyclic-substituted amides) are being developed, with sub-100 nM biochemical potency reported, supporting continued medicinal chemistry around ASK1 (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1039/d3md00663h) (lu2022theroleand pages 9-10).

4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: Authoritative reviews and structural analyses converge on ASK1 as a redox-gated stress MAP3K controlled by TRX, TRAFs, 14-3-3, and activation-loop autophosphorylation. This architecture enables integration of ROS, ER stress, and cytokine signaling to tune JNK/p38 outputs (2022 review; 2024 structural overview) (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
- Therapeutic positioning: The 2024 hepatology study frames ASK1 inhibition as a means to prevent progression to cirrhosis/HCC by curbing hepatocyte DAMP release and fibrogenic signaling, advocating clinical reevaluation with appropriate endpoints and timing (Feb 2024) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25). Concurrently, the 2024 senescence paper proposes ASK1 as a SASP driver and potential target for age-related inflammatory conditions, while warning that inhibiting ASK1 could impair immune clearance of senescent cells and theoretically influence tumor surveillance (Jun 2024) (odawara2024apoptosissignalregulatingkinase pages 1-3).
- Innate immunity: New data suggest ASK1-containing MAP3K complexes contribute to inflammasome effector stages, indicating that ASK1 modulation may affect pyroptotic responses and IL-1β release in myeloid cells (May 2023) (bradfield2023biphasicjnksignaling pages 3-6).

5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Liver disease models with ASK1 inhibition (GS-444217):
  - Short-term therapy reduced hepatocyte death and fibrosis up to ~50%; blocked p38 phosphorylation and mtDNA release from hepatocytes (Feb 2024) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2).
  - Long-term therapy reduced bridging fibrosis by ~25%, decreased p21+ hepatocytes by 72%, serum ammonia by 46%, and portal pressure from 8.53 to 6.07 mm Hg; 44-week treatment reduced tumor number and size by ~50% (Feb 2024) (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25).
- Senescence/aging models: ASK1 deficiency diminished age-associated p38 activation and inflammation and attenuated glomerulosclerosis; ASK1 is required for efficient immune clearance of senescent hepatocytes, with deficiency increasing tumorigenesis (Jun 2024) (odawara2024apoptosissignalregulatingkinase pages 1-3).
- ER-stress/ischemia: ER-stress blockade and ASK1 inhibition lowered IRE1α/TRAF2/ASK1–JNK pathway activation and neuronal apoptosis in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion models (Feb 2024) (kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9).

Methodological notes and limitations
- Clinical trials of selonsertib (DKD, NASH) provide translational context; our mechanistic claims about selonsertib rely on recent preclinical and disease-mechanism studies and on a 2022 clinical review (kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9, lu2022theroleand pages 9-10). Where precise trial outcomes are needed, consult the trial publications/records directly; here we emphasized 2023–2024 primary research and high-quality reviews. The liver disease study (Hepatology, 2024) supplies quantitative preclinical metrics supporting antifibrotic and anti-tumor potential via ASK1/p38 axis inhibition (peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25).

Conclusion
Human MAP3K5/ASK1 is a redox- and stress-gated MAP3K integrating thioredoxin status, TRAF-scaffolded assemblies, and ER-stress signaling to activate JNK and p38. Recent work highlights its roles in SASP regulation, inflammasome effector licensing, and organ-specific pathology, with compelling preclinical evidence that ASK1 inhibition reduces hepatocyte DAMP release, fibrosis progression, and tumor burden. Together with evolving structural insights and medicinal chemistry, these data refine ASK1’s therapeutic positioning while underscoring context-dependent trade-offs in immunity and senescence biology (lu2022theroleand pages 7-8, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 1-2, odawara2024apoptosissignalregulatingkinase pages 1-3, kang2024inhibitionofendoplasmic pages 7-9, lu2022theroleand pages 9-10, peng2024ask1p38axisinhibition pages 17-25, bradfield2023biphasicjnksignaling pages 3-6, honzejkova2024structuralstudiesof pages 28-31).
