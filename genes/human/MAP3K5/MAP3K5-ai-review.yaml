description: MAP3K5 (ASK1, Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) is a 
  serine/threonine MAP kinase kinase kinase (EC 2.7.11.25) that functions as a 
  master regulator of cellular stress responses. It directly phosphorylates and 
  activates MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 (activating the JNK pathway) and 
  MAP2K3/MKK3 and MAP2K6/MKK6 (activating the p38 MAPK pathway). ASK1 is 
  activated by oxidative stress through dissociation from its inhibitor 
  thioredoxin, by ER stress via formation of the IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex, and by
  TNF-alpha signaling via TRAF2/TRAF6-mediated signalosome formation. Activation
  requires autophosphorylation at Thr-838 in the activation loop. ASK1 is 
  negatively regulated by 14-3-3 protein binding at phospho-Ser966 and by 
  AKT-mediated phosphorylation at Ser83. The protein forms homodimers through 
  its C-terminal coiled-coil domain when inactive. ASK1 plays essential roles in
  stress-induced apoptosis, innate immune responses, and cellular senescence.

    review:
      summary: ASK1 is a well-established upstream activator of the JNK cascade.
        The original discovery paper (Ichijo et al., 1997, PMID:8974401) 
        demonstrated that ASK1 "activated two different subgroups of MAP kinase 
        kinases (MAPKK), SEK1 (or MKK4) and MKK3/MAPKK6 (or MKK6), which in turn
        activated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also known as JNK)." 
        Multiple subsequent studies confirm ASK1 involvement in JNK cascade 
        activation via MKK4/MKK7 phosphorylation. The IBA annotation is 
        phylogenetically supported and represents a core function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: JNK cascade involvement is the core function of ASK1. The IBA 
        annotation is well-supported by extensive literature showing ASK1 
        directly phosphorylates MKK4/MKK7 to activate JNK.

    review:
      summary: ASK1 is a key mediator of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. 
        Under basal conditions, thioredoxin (TXN) binds to and inhibits ASK1. 
        Oxidative stress causes oxidation of thioredoxin, leading to its 
        dissociation from ASK1 and subsequent ASK1 activation. This mechanism is
        well-documented (PMID:9564042, PMID:10688666). The UniProt record 
        confirms "Mediates signaling for determination of cell fate such as 
        differentiation and survival. Plays a crucial role in the apoptosis 
        signal transduction pathway through mitochondria-dependent caspase 
        activation."
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling is a well-established
