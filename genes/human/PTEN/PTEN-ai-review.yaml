description: PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) is a critical tumor 
  suppressor encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase with both lipid and protein
  phosphatase activities. Its primary and essential tumor suppressor function is
  as a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) 3-phosphatase that 
  dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2, thereby antagonizing PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. 
  PTEN also exhibits protein phosphatase activity against serine, threonine, and
  tyrosine residues, though the lipid phosphatase activity is the critical 
  determinant of tumor suppression. Nuclear PTEN contributes to genomic 
  stability and cell cycle control. PTEN localizes to the plasma membrane, 
  cytosol, and nucleus, with membrane localization mediated by its C2 domain and
  PDZ-binding motif interactions with scaffold proteins like MAGI-2. Germline 
  mutations cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS/Cowden disease), while 
  somatic mutations occur frequently across many cancer types.

      summary: PTEN localizes to the apical plasma membrane in polarized 
        epithelial cells, stabilized by NHERF1/EBP50 interaction.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The publication demonstrates that PTEN localizes apically in 
        polarized epithelial cells through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif 
        interaction with NHERF1. This apical localization is important for 
        maintaining PIP2/PIP3 distribution and epithelial polarity.

      reason: This is a highly specialized cell type-specific localization in

      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: PMID:10760291 describes PTEN binding to MAGI-2 at tight junctions
