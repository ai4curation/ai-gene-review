## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P60484
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and dual-specificity protein phosphatase PTEN {ECO:0000305|PubMed:9256433, ECO:0000305|PubMed:9811831}; EC=3.1.3.16 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9256433}; EC=3.1.3.48 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9187108, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9256433}; EC=3.1.3.67 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16824732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9811831}; AltName: Full=Inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphatase {ECO:0000305|PubMed:11418101, ECO:0000305|PubMed:9593664}; EC=3.1.3.- {ECO:0000305|PubMed:11418101, ECO:0000305|PubMed:9593664}; AltName: Full=Mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1; AltName: Full=Phosphatase and tensin homolog;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PTEN; Synonyms=MMAC1, TEP1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the PTEN phosphatase protein family.
- **Key Domains:** Bifunc_PIno_P3_Pase/Pase_PTEN. (IPR017361); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); Dual-spec_lipid-protein_phosph. (IPR051281); Prot-tyrosine_phosphatase-like. (IPR029021); PTP_PTEN. (IPR045101)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PTEN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PTEN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PTEN** (gene ID: PTEN, UniProt: P60484) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human PTEN (UniProt P60484)

Verification of target identity and domain architecture
- Gene/protein identity: The requested target is human PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), a 403–amino-acid dual-specificity phosphatase that belongs to the PTEN phosphatase family. Canonical domains include an N‑terminal phosphoinositide-binding region, the catalytic phosphatase domain containing the active site (approx. residues 123–130), a C2 domain that mediates membrane association, and a C‑terminal tail with a PDZ-binding motif. Noncanonical, N‑terminally extended isoforms (PTEN‑L/α and PTEN‑β) exist and retain the canonical PTEN core. These features align with the UniProt P60484 description and the stated family/domains. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa127, Jun 2020) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 4-5, yehia2020ptenhamartomatumour pages 5-6)

Key concepts and definitions: catalytic activities and biochemical specificity
- Enzymatic class and reaction: PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase with a primary lipid phosphatase activity that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP3) to PIP2 at the D3 position, thereby antagonizing PI3K signaling. PTEN also has protein phosphatase activity toward select protein substrates, but recent functional dissection in melanoma indicates the lipid phosphatase function predominates for tumor suppression in vivo. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)
- Substrate context and site of action: PTEN’s lipid phosphatase function requires membrane engagement via the C2 domain and N‑terminal phosphoinositide interactions, positioning the catalytic site to dephosphorylate PIP3 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2)

Pathway roles and current understanding
- Core signaling: By converting PIP3→PIP2, PTEN reduces AKT recruitment/activation and downstream mTOR signaling, restraining cell growth, survival, metabolism, and translation. Loss or inactivation of PTEN elevates AKT/mTOR signaling and alters transcriptional and metabolic programs. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)
- 2024 mechanistic update: In melanoma models, restoration of PTEN’s lipid phosphatase activity suppressed proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth primarily through inhibition of an AKT/mTOR/FRA1 axis; phosphoproteomics supported the dominance of lipid phosphatase–mediated network changes over other proposed noncanonical functions. (https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)

Subcellular localization and nuclear functions
- Cytosol/membrane: PTEN localizes to cytosol and the inner plasma membrane for lipid dephosphorylation that opposes PI3K. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2)
- Nuclear functions: Nuclear PTEN contributes to genomic stability, DNA double-strand break repair, cell-cycle control, chromosomal architecture, and regulation of rDNA transcription. Nuclear localization is regulated by post‑translational modifications (PTMs) and ubiquitin-dependent trafficking. (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa127, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (yehia2020ptenhamartomatumour pages 5-6, li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8)

Regulation, post-translational modifications, and interactors
- Phosphorylation: C‑terminal tail phosphorylation regulates PTEN’s conformation, membrane association, and catalytic activity, generally modulating stability and activity in a context-dependent manner. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8)
- Ubiquitination and nuclear import: Mono- and polyubiquitination control PTEN stability and subcellular localization; specific ubiquitin machinery promotes nuclear import, where PTEN contributes to chromosome stability (e.g., interactions with centromeric proteins). (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8, li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 5-6)
- Oxidation: Reactive oxygen species can oxidize PTEN, disrupting membrane association and lipid phosphatase function; antioxidant systems (e.g., peroxiredoxins) can preserve PTEN activity. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 5-6)
- SUMOylation/neddylation: SUMO and NEDD8 modifications further influence PTEN localization and activity, including promoting nuclear entry under certain metabolic conditions. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8)
- Scaffolding and membrane recruitment: PDZ-domain scaffolds (e.g., MAGI proteins) recruit PTEN to junctional complexes and membrane subdomains to efficiently deplete PIP3. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8)

Disease relevance: germline and somatic
- Germline: Pathogenic germline PTEN variants cause PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), an autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition and overgrowth spectrum with elevated risks of breast, thyroid, endometrial, and other cancers; large germline deletions account for an estimated 3–10% of PHTS. Identification warrants enhanced surveillance and genetic counseling. (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa127, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019) (yehia2020ptenhamartomatumour pages 5-6, yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 4-5, yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2)
- Somatic: PTEN is among the most frequently altered tumor suppressors across sporadic cancers; functional analyses confirm that loss of lipid phosphatase activity drives AKT/mTOR activation and oncogenesis in several settings, including melanoma. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)

Recent developments (emphasis 2023–2024) and expert perspectives
- Functional dominance of lipid phosphatase activity in melanoma (2024): Genetic rescue and phosphoproteomics demonstrate that PTEN’s lipid phosphatase activity is the principal mediator of tumor suppression via AKT/mTOR/FRA1 control, informing expectations for pathway-directed therapies in PTEN-deficient melanomas. (https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)
- PTEN proteoform and PTM-centric regulation (2024): Mechanistic review highlights how multi-site phosphorylation, ubiquitination, oxidation, SUMOylation, and neddylation dynamically tune PTEN’s abundance, conformation, localization (including nuclear import), and activity. This regulatory complexity underlies variable PTEN function across tissues and disease states. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8, li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 5-6)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic assessment: PTEN status is commonly assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect mutations and copy-number loss. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used in clinical practice to gauge PTEN protein loss as a pragmatic screening tool when NGS material is limited, with confirmatory molecular testing where appropriate. These uses are framed within gene‑informed management for PHTS and pathway‑informed therapy considerations in sporadic cancers. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8)
- Therapeutic implications: PTEN loss indicates upregulated PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling. Although direct PTEN restoration is not a current therapy, pathway inhibitors (e.g., AKT/mTOR inhibitors) are of interest; however, network feedback and context‑specific dependencies necessitate careful clinical evaluation. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 8-9, yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Functional evidence rather than frequency summary: 2024 functional cancer research demonstrates that PTEN lipid phosphatase restoration can suppress melanoma growth and invasion via AKT/mTOR/FRA1, supporting the centrality of PI3K pathway dependence in PTEN‑deficient tumors. (https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)
- Germline structural variant contribution in PHTS: Reviews report that large PTEN deletions comprise approximately 3–10% of PHTS cases, underscoring the need for copy‑number assessment in genetic testing workflows. (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa127, Jun 2020) (yehia2020ptenhamartomatumour pages 5-6)

Expert analysis
- Mechanistic consensus: Across authoritative sources, PTEN’s tumor suppressor function is primarily mediated by its lipid phosphatase activity restraining PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling, with additional nuclear roles stabilizing the genome and regulating transcriptional programs. This duality explains both the metabolic/proliferative phenotypes of PTEN deficiency and the genomic instability seen in PHTS spectrum disorders. (https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI121277, Jan 2019; https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa127, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-23-1730, Jan 2024) (yehia2019ptenopathiesfrombiological pages 1-2, yehia2020ptenhamartomatumour pages 5-6, xu2024ptenlipidphosphatase pages 23-30)
- Regulatory layers shape phenotype: PTMs (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, oxidation, SUMO/neddylation) and scaffolding interactions modulate PTEN’s localization, stability, and conformational state, providing plausible mechanistic bases for tissue‑specific effects and variable penetrance in disease. (https://doi.org/10.3389/or.2024.1430237, Jul 2024) (li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 8-8, li2024posttranslationalmodificationof pages 5-6)

Notes on scope and limitations of the present synthesis
- The report prioritizes 2023–2024 peer‑reviewed sources and authoritative recent reviews. We focused on sources available in the provided context with accessible URLs and publication dates. Some pan‑cancer frequency statistics from large clinicogenomic cohorts are beyond the scope of the included evidence set; where high‑level prevalence statements are made, they derive from consensus reviews (2019–2020) rather than a specific 2023–2024 frequency table.
