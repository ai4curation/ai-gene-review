description: >-
  NTN3 (Netrin-3) is a secreted extracellular matrix protein belonging to the netrin/laminin family.
  Netrins are chemotropic factors that guide axon migration during neural development. NTN3 contains
  a laminin N-terminal domain, three laminin EGF-like domains, and a netrin (NTR) domain. The protein
  is secreted and localized to the extracellular matrix where it functions as an axon guidance cue,
  binding to netrin receptors such as DCC and UNC5 family members on growth cones. NTN3 has restricted
  expression, predominantly in spinal cord. It is NOT a transcription factor despite erroneous IBA
  annotations suggesting transcription factor activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is ERRONEOUS. NTN3 is a secreted extracellular axon guidance protein with NO
      transcription factor activity. The IBA annotation was propagated from a PANTHER phylogenetic
      tree node (PTN000180816) that incorrectly grouped NTN3 with POU domain transcription factors
      (e.g., P14859/POU2F1/OCT1). The WITH/FROM column lists multiple POU domain transcription factors
      as evidence sources, indicating a phylogenetic tree construction error. NTN3 belongs to the
      NETRIN/LAMININ-RELATED family (PTHR10574), not a transcription factor family. NTN3 has a signal
      peptide, is secreted to the extracellular matrix [UniProt O00634], and contains laminin/netrin
      domains incompatible with nuclear localization or DNA binding.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Erroneous phylogenetic propagation. NTN3 is a secreted axon guidance cue with no DNA-binding
      domains, no nuclear localization, and no transcription factor activity. The protein contains
      a signal peptide (residues 1-27), laminin N-terminal domain, laminin EGF-like domains, and
      netrin domain [UniProt O00634]. UniProt clearly states function: "Netrins control guidance
      of CNS commissural axons and peripheral motor axons" and subcellular location: "Secreted,
      extracellular space, extracellular matrix". No literature supports any transcription factor
      activity for any netrin family member.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is ERRONEOUS for the same reason as GO:0000981. NTN3 is not a transcription
      factor and does not regulate transcription. This biological process annotation was propagated
      from the same erroneous phylogenetic tree node (PTN000180816) that incorrectly associated
      NTN3 with POU domain transcription factors. The WITH/FROM column lists POU transcription
      factors including POU2F1 (P14859), confirming this is erroneous propagation from unrelated
      proteins.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Erroneous phylogenetic propagation. NTN3 is a secreted extracellular protein that functions
      in axon guidance, not transcriptional regulation. No experimental evidence supports any
      role for NTN3 in transcription regulation. The annotation derives from incorrect grouping
      with POU domain transcription factors in the PANTHER phylogenetic tree.

      This annotation is ERRONEOUS. NTN3 has no DNA-binding domains and is a secreted extracellular

      that incorrectly grouped NTN3 with POU domain transcription factors which do have DNA-binding

      homeodomain or helix-turn-helix motifs.
    action: REMOVE

      Erroneous phylogenetic propagation. NTN3 lacks any recognizable DNA-binding domain. Domain
      architecture shows: signal peptide, laminin N-terminal domain, laminin EGF-like domains,
      and netrin (NTR) domain - none of which confer DNA binding. The protein is secreted to the
      extracellular matrix and cannot access nuclear DNA.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is likely over-general or misleading. While NTN3 may transit through the
      cytoplasm during biosynthesis before secretion via the ER-Golgi pathway, its functional
      localization is extracellular. The ARBA machine learning annotation is technically not wrong
      but does not reflect the protein's primary functional location.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      NTN3 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transits through the secretory pathway, so transient
      cytoplasmic presence during biosynthesis is expected. However, the mature functional protein
      is secreted to the extracellular matrix. This annotation is not incorrect but is not
      informative about the core function or localization of NTN3.

      This annotation is appropriate but could be more specific. NTN3 is a netrin family member
      that functions in axon guidance, which is a subprocess of axonogenesis. The ARBA annotation
      captures a relevant biological process for this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Netrins are well-established axon guidance cues that regulate axonogenesis by guiding the
      growth and direction of axons during neural development. While GO:0007411 (axon guidance)
      is more specific, axonogenesis is an appropriate broader term. The annotation aligns with
      established netrin family function.

      This annotation is supported by experimental evidence from PMID:26190107 showing NTN3
      interacts with DRAXIN. However, "protein binding" is uninformative. A more specific term

      appropriate for the functional role of netrins.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While the experimental evidence (IPI from PMID:26190107) demonstrates protein-protein
      interaction between NTN3 and DRAXIN, the term "protein binding" is too general and
      uninformative. NTN3 functions by binding to netrin receptors (DCC, UNC5 family).
      A more specific molecular function term should be used.

      This annotation is appropriate. NTN3 is a secreted ligand that binds to netrin receptors
      (DCC, UNC5 family members) on target cells to mediate axon guidance. The annotation

      NTN3 functions as a secreted signaling molecule that binds to cell surface receptors

      function of netrin family proteins. The annotation appropriately captures the receptor
      binding activity, transferred from mouse ortholog (UniProtKB:Q9R1A3).

    reason: >-
      As a secreted protein, NTN3 passes through the Golgi apparatus during biosynthesis and
      maturation. While this is not the final functional localization, it is a valid component
      of the secretory pathway that NTN3 uses. The annotation is not incorrect but represents
      transient localization rather than core function.

      axon guidance. This is well-supported by the literature on netrin family function.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Has NTN3-specific receptor binding been characterized, or is receptor binding
      inferred from netrin-1 studies? Most functional studies focus on NTN1 (Netrin-1).
      Direct evidence for NTN3-receptor interactions would strengthen annotations.
  - question: >-
      What is the functional relationship between NTN3 and DRAXIN in axon guidance?
      PMID:26190107 shows netrin-DRAXIN interaction. Understanding if this applies
      specifically to NTN3 would inform annotation.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Receptor binding assays to confirm NTN3 binds DCC and UNC5 receptors directly.
      This would provide direct evidence for GO:1990890 annotation specific to NTN3.
  - description: >-
      Axon guidance assays in NTN3 knockout or knockdown models to confirm NTN3
      specifically functions in axon guidance rather than relying on family membership inference.
