## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P21359
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Neurofibromin; AltName: Full=Neurofibromatosis-related protein NF-1; Contains: RecName: Full=Neurofibromin truncated;
- **Gene Information:** Name=NF1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ARM-type_fold. (IPR016024); CRAL-TRIO_dom. (IPR001251); CRAL-TRIO_dom_sf. (IPR036865); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_NF1. (IPR054071)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "NF1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'NF1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **NF1** (gene ID: NF1, UniProt: P21359) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan summary: We verified identity and domains for human NF1 (UniProt P21359), gathered recent evidence on structure–function, localization, and pathway roles; compiled 2023–2024 developments on tumor single-nuclei profiling, proteomics, and genotype–phenotype/mosaicism; summarized current applications and approvals (MEK inhibitors), and created a concise artifact summarizing the core facts.

Gene/protein verification and key concepts
- Identity: NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a large (~2,818 aa) human tumor suppressor with a central Ras GTPase-activating (GAP) domain (GAP-related domain, GRD). Neurofibromin accelerates hydrolysis of RAS-bound GTP to GDP, thereby restraining RAS effector signaling (RAF–MEK–ERK; PI3K–AKT–mTOR). Mutations affecting GRD residues (e.g., R1276) cause dramatic (>1000-fold) loss of GAP activity and hyperactivate downstream signaling (MAPK, PI3K/mTOR). (botero2024unravelingneuronaland pages 3-4)
- Domains: Beyond the GRD, neurofibromin includes adjacent Sec14/CRAL-TRIO lipid-binding and PH-like modules (often referenced jointly as SecPH), consistent with UniProt annotations, and ARM-type fold features. These modules modulate neurofibromin stability and function. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 4-6, botero2024unravelingneuronaland pages 3-4)
- Cellular localization: Neurofibromin is predominantly cytoplasmic, associates functionally with Ras at the inner plasma membrane, and has been detected in nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, with cell type- and isoform-specific distribution.

*Table: Concise, cited summary of human NF1 (UniProt P21359): identity, domains, molecular functions, localization, pathway roles, recent research developments, and clinical applications (2023–2025). Useful as a quick-reference map linking claims to recent sources.*

Biochemical function and pathway roles
- Core enzyme activity: The GRD provides Ras-GAP activity, lowering RAS-GTP and suppressing RAF–MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT–mTOR output; this is central to its tumor suppressor role. (botero2024unravelingneuronaland pages 3-4, huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 7-8)
- cAMP signaling: Neurofibromin also positively regulates adenylyl cyclase/cAMP–PKA signaling in neurons and astrocytes, consistent with cognitive phenotypes in NF1 and RASopathy biology. (botero2024unravelingneuronaland pages 3-4)
- Cytoskeleton and Rho cross-talk: Loss of NF1 impacts Rho/ROCK-linked cytoskeletal programs and mitochondrial metabolism, indicative of broader network effects tied to Ras hyperactivation. (fay2025globalproteomicsand pages 16-17, huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 7-8)

Subcellular context and interacting partners
- Proteomics/affinity mass spectrometry in human Schwann cells shows that variation or loss of NF1 alters protein expression, mitochondrial metabolism, and maps interactors across cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments; NF1 loss induces mitochondrial ERK-mediated TRAP1 phosphorylation and decreased respiration, reversible with NAD+/SIRT3 modulation. (fay2025globalproteomicsand pages 16-17)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Expanded genotype–phenotype mappings and variant burden: Recent cohort analyses and database curation show variant enrichment within the RAS-GTPase region, high pathogenicity of truncating variants, and clinically relevant CNVs; more than 3,000 germline variants cataloged, with RNA-based testing increasing detection to ~95–97% and clear emphasis on mosaicism in diagnosis and counseling. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 4-6, huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 6-7)
- Mosaicism and counseling: Mosaic NF1 complicates prenatal and clinical interpretation; high mosaic rates necessitate careful genetic counseling strategies. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 6-7)
- Mechanistic regulation of protein stability: Missense variants in SecPH can trigger misfolding, SUMOylation/ubiquitylation, and proteasomal loss of full-length neurofibromin—highlighting protein-stability therapeutic strategies. (okaz2025fromhypeto pages 69-70)
- Tumor ecology and cell states: Multi-omic studies of Schwann cells and tumor tissues implicate altered cell states and metabolic remodeling with NF1 loss, informing biomarkers and combination strategies. (fay2025globalproteomicsand pages 16-17)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Approved therapies: MEK inhibitors are the leading targeted approach for NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). Selumetinib is an established approval for pediatric NF1-PN; mirdametinib recently achieved first approval for NF1-PN, broadening access. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 7-8, okaz2025fromhypeto pages 69-70)
- Clinical rationale: Because NF1 restrains RAS–MAPK output, MEK inhibition partially counteracts pathway hyperactivation. Clinical studies demonstrate tumor-volume reduction in a subset of PN patients; benefits for aggressive tumors (e.g., MPNST) remain limited, necessitating combinations and novel modalities. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 7-8)
- Safety signals and management: Class-typical dermatologic and laboratory adverse events occur under MEK inhibition; ongoing work emphasizes early detection/management. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 7-8)

Expert perspectives and authoritative analyses
- Recent reviews emphasize NF1 as a prototypical RASopathy with multidomain regulation of Ras, cAMP, and metabolism; they highlight gene therapy prospects but underscore foundational challenges (assay standardization, vector capacity/immune issues) and the need for robust models and quantitative readouts. (okaz2025fromhypeto pages 69-70, botero2024unravelingneuronaland pages 3-4)

Statistics and data
- Prevalence and variant detection: NF1 prevalence is historically about 1 in 3,000 with high mutational heterogeneity; >3,000 germline variants documented. Modern sequencing with RNA analysis achieves ~95–97% molecular detection; mosaicism is a notable fraction in certain cohorts and complicates genotype–phenotype translation. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 6-7)
- Variant distribution and pathogenicity: In curated datasets, the RAS‑GTPase domain harbors the largest share of pathogenic changes; truncating variants (frameshift/stop-gain) are overwhelmingly pathogenic; many CNVs span 1–10 Mb and correlate with neurodevelopmental features. (huang2025unravelingnovelvariants pages 4-6)

Limitations and open questions
- The cAMP axis is context dependent across tissues; precise molecular connectors between SecPH lipid binding, PH-like signaling, and GRD activation/regulation in vivo remain incompletely defined. Emerging proteomics and single-cell/nucleus studies are refining NF1 pathway maps and may yield better biomarkers and rational combinations.

Notes on the verification checklist
- Gene symbol NF1 matches the neurofibromin description and organism (human). Domains and families (GRD, Sec14/CRAL‑TRIO, PH‑like, ARM-type fold) align between UniProt and recent literature. No conflicting use of “NF1” for unrelated genes was used in this report.

Overall conclusion
Neurofibromin (NF1) is a multidomain Ras-GAP tumor suppressor whose loss elevates RAS–MAPK and PI3K–mTOR signaling and perturbs cAMP regulation, cytoskeletal programs, and cellular metabolism. Contemporary data reinforce GRD centrality with regulatory input from adjacent Sec14/PH-like modules that influence stability and context-dependent signaling. Clinically, MEK inhibitors (selumetinib; mirdametinib) represent the most mature targeted approach for NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas, while mechanistic and genetic insights (including mosaicism) are refining diagnostics and guiding next-generation therapies and biomarker development.
