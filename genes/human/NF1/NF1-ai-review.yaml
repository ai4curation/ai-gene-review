description: >-
  Neurofibromin (NF1) is a large multidomain tumor suppressor protein of 2839 amino acids
  that functions as a negative regulator of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. The protein
  contains a central GTPase-activating protein (GAP) related domain (GRD, residues 1251-1482)
  that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS proteins, accelerating their conversion
  from active GTP-bound to inactive GDP-bound states. This Ras-GAP activity is the primary
  mechanism by which neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor. The protein also contains a
  SEC14/CRAL-TRIO lipid-binding domain (residues 1580-1738) that binds glycerophospholipids,
  particularly phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine with monounsaturated fatty
  acids, and an adjacent PH-like domain. Loss-of-function mutations cause neurofibromatosis
  type 1 (NF1), characterized by cafe-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and increased cancer risk.
  Neurofibromin also regulates cAMP/PKA signaling in neurons and modulates cytoskeletal
  organization through effects on Rho/ROCK pathways.

    summary: >-
      GTPase activator activity is the defining molecular function of neurofibromin.
      The GRD domain (residues 1251-1482) contains an arginine finger at position 1276
      that is crucial for stabilizing the transition state during RAS GTP hydrolysis.
      This activity has been confirmed by multiple IDA annotations.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core molecular function of NF1. The RasGAP activity is well-established
      through biochemical studies and structural analysis. IBA annotation is appropriate
      as this function is conserved across species and supported by phylogenetic inference.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    NF1 is a RasGAP (Ras GTPase-activating protein) that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase
    activity of RAS proteins via its GRD domain (residues 1251-1482). The arginine finger
    at position R1276 is critical for catalysis. This is the primary molecular function
    and the basis for its tumor suppressor activity.
