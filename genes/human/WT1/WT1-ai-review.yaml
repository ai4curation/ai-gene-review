description: 'WT1 (Wilms tumor protein) is a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor
  that plays essential roles in urogenital and cardiac development. The protein contains
  an N-terminal proline/glutamine-rich regulatory domain (with separate repression
  and activation domains) and four C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers (encoded by exons
  7-10) that mediate sequence-specific DNA binding to the motif 5''-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3''
  with Kd ~1.14 nM. Alternative splicing at intron 9 produces two major isoform classes
  with distinct functions: the -KTS isoform functions as a classical DNA-binding transcription
  factor (both activator and repressor depending on cofactors like BASP1/p53 and cellular
  context), while the +KTS isoform has reduced DNA affinity (due to increased linker
  flexibility between ZnF3-4) and participates in RNA processing, localizing to nuclear
  speckles and interacting with splicing factors (U2AF65, RBM4). The normal +KTS/-KTS
  ratio of ~2:1 is critical; Frasier syndrome results from altered ratio. WT1 functions
  as a tumor suppressor in kidney (loss causes Wilms tumor) but can act as an oncogene
  in AML/leukemias. Key transcriptional targets include nephrin/NPHS1 and podocalyxin
  (activation in podocytes), PAX2 (repression during differentiation), BCL2 and MYC
  (repression for tumor suppression), DNMT3A (activation), and SF1/SRY (activation
  in sex determination). WT1 is essential for: (1) mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
  during nephrogenesis and podocyte maintenance, (2) gonadal development and sex determination,
  and (3) epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition for coronary vasculature
  formation via Wnt/beta-catenin and retinoic acid signaling.'

      DNA-binding transcription factors. The -KTS isoforms lack the KTS tripeptide
      (Lys-Thr-Ser) between zinc fingers 3 and 4, resulting in a shorter linker
      that maintains high DNA-binding affinity (Kd ~1 nM) for the consensus motif
      5'-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3'. These isoforms function as classical transcription factors,
      both activating (SRY, DNMT3A, NPHS1) and repressing (PAX2, BCL2, MYC) target
      genes depending on cofactors and cellular context. The -KTS isoforms are
      essential for kidney development (Wilms tumor suppression) and sex determination.
      PMID:9815658 directly demonstrates SRY promoter activation by -KTS but NOT +KTS.

      RNA-binding/splicing regulators. The +KTS isoforms have a 3-amino acid insertion
      (Lys-Thr-Ser) between zinc fingers 3 and 4, increasing linker flexibility and
      REDUCING DNA-binding affinity by ~10-fold. These isoforms localize to nuclear
      speckles (not nucleoplasm) and interact with splicing factors (U2AF65, RBM4,
      WTAP). The +KTS isoforms do NOT function as transcription factors - they
      participate in mRNA processing. PMID:9815658 shows +KTS does NOT activate the
      SRY promoter that -KTS strongly activates. Frasier syndrome results from loss
      of +KTS isoforms specifically, demonstrating their distinct developmental role.
      The normal +KTS:-KTS ratio of ~2:1 is critical for proper development.

    review:
      summary: WT1 functions as a tumor suppressor and inhibits cell 
        proliferation. This is mediated through transcriptional repression of 
        growth-promoting genes like BCL2, MYC, and growth factor receptors, as 
        well as through interaction with Hsp70 [PMID:9553041, PMID:7585606].

    review:
      summary: WT1 has complex effects on apoptosis. While it represses BCL2 
        which would promote apoptosis [PMID:7585606], developmental studies show
        that WT1 is required for cell survival during nephrogenesis - Wt1 null 
        embryos show apoptosis in the urogenital ridge [PMID:10101119].
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: WT1's role in apoptosis regulation is context-dependent and likely
        secondary to its primary transcriptional regulatory functions. The 
        anti-apoptotic effect observed in development may reflect regulation of 
        survival factors rather than direct apoptosis pathway involvement.

    review:
      summary: PMID:12802290 shows "c-MYC...was upregulated in WT1-mutant 
        tumors", meaning WT1 normally represses c-MYC. The paper states WT1 
        "represses or activates the expression of a variety of putative target 
        genes" but the specific finding for c-MYC supports repression.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: This annotation contradicts the evidence in the referenced paper. 
        PMID:12802290 demonstrates that c-MYC is upregulated when WT1 is 
        mutated, indicating WT1 normally represses (not activates) c-MYC 
        transcription. The negative regulation annotation from this paper is 
        correct; this positive regulation annotation is erroneous.

      reason: Well-documented isoform-specific NOT annotation. The +KTS isoform 
        lacks transcriptional activation ability that the -KTS isoform 
        possesses, due to altered DNA binding from the KTS insertion. This is a 
        paradigm case of functional divergence between splice isoforms.

      - statement: WT1 overexpression causes promoter methylation changes
        supporting_text: Using genome-wide promoter methylation arrays, we show 
          that human embryonal kidney cells over-expressing WT1 acquire DNA 
          methylation changes at specific gene promoters where DNMT3A 
          recruitment is increased, with hypermethylation being associated with 
          silencing of gene expression.

        supporting_text: We found that WT1 can repress transcription of both the
          bcl-2 and c-myc promoters. This suggests that WT1 regulates bcl-2 and 
          c-myc during renal development, and the loss of functional WT1 results
          in deregulation of bcl-2 and c-myc, contributing to tumor formation.

    findings:
      - statement: WT1 zinc fingers 2-4 insert into major groove for 
          base-specific DNA contacts; ZnF1 amplifies affinity without 
          contributing to sequence specificity
        supporting_text: The second, third, and fourth zinc finger domains 
          insert deep into the major groove of DNA where they make base-specific
          contacts. Zinc fingers 2 and 3 are primarily responsible for most of 
          the binding affinity and can function as a minimal DNA binding domain,
          while zinc finger 4 is indispensable for target specificity
      - statement: WT1-DNA binding has Kd of 1.14 x 10^-9 M and is 
          entropy-driven, unlike EGR1
        supporting_text: Quantitative binding studies have demonstrated that 
          recombinant WT1 zinc fingers bind to the dodecamer DNA sequence 
          GCG-TGG-GCG-TGT with high affinity, exhibiting a dissociation constant
          (Kd) of 1.14 x 10^-9 M under physiological conditions. Thermodynamic 
          analysis revealed that WT1-DNA interaction is an entropy-driven 
          process
      - statement: KTS insertion increases linker flexibility between ZnF3-4, 
          abolishing ZnF4 DNA contact
        supporting_text: The molecular basis for the functional differences 
          between +KTS and -KTS isoforms was elucidated by NMR structural 
          studies demonstrating that the KTS insertion increases the flexibility
          of the linker between fingers 3 and 4, abrogating the binding of the 
          fourth zinc finger to its cognate site in the DNA major groove
      - statement: Normal +KTS/-KTS ratio is 2:1; Frasier syndrome results from 
          altered ratio to 1:2
        supporting_text: The physiological importance of maintaining the correct
          ratio of +KTS to -KTS isoforms (normally approximately 2:1) is 
          dramatically illustrated by Frasier syndrome, in which mutations 
          disrupting the +KTS splice site alter this ratio to 1:2
      - statement: p53 interaction converts WT1 from repressor to activator; WT1
          stabilizes p53 protein
        supporting_text: In the absence of p53, WT1 functions as a potent 
          transcriptional activator of EGR1-like promoter sequences rather than 
          as a repressor. WT1 expression can stabilize p53 protein, enhance its 
          DNA binding to target sequences
      - statement: BASP1 myristoylation recruits PIP2 to promoters, enabling 
          HDAC1-mediated repression
        supporting_text: Mechanistically, myristoylated BASP1 binds to nuclear 
          phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which leads to the 
          recruitment of PIP2 to the promoter regions of WT1-dependent target 
          genes. This association with PIP2 is required for the interaction of 
          BASP1 with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), enabling chromatin 
          deacetylation and gene silencing
      - statement: WT1 directly activates nephrin (NPHS1) transcription >10-fold
          via specific promoter element
        supporting_text: WT1 binds to a specific responsive element in the 
          nephrin promoter and activates transcription more than 10-fold. 
          Transgenic mouse analysis confirmed that this WT1 binding site is 
          required for podocyte-specific nephrin expression in vivo
      - statement: WT1 directly activates SF1 and SRY in gonad development; DDS 
          mutations fail to activate SRY
        supporting_text: The -KTS isoform of WT1, but not the +KTS form, 
          directly binds to and transactivates the Sf1 promoter through four 
          identified binding sites. WT1 also directly regulates the 
          sex-determining gene SRY by activating its expression. Mutant WT1 
          proteins found in Denys-Drash syndrome patients fail to activate the 
          SRY promoter
      - statement: WT1 required for epicardial EMT in heart development via 
          Wnt/beta-catenin and retinoic acid pathways
        supporting_text: WT1 is expressed in the proepicardium and developing 
          epicardium, where it is required for epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
          transition (EMT) that generates cardiovascular progenitor cells. WT1 
          regulates epicardial EMT through multiple signaling pathways including
          canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and retinoic acid signaling 
          through direct regulation of Raldh2 expression
      - statement: WT1 ZnF1 is more important for RNA binding than DNA binding; 
          +KTS and -KTS bind RNA similarly
        supporting_text: While zinc fingers 2, 3, and 4 are required for 
          high-affinity DNA binding, zinc finger 1—which is dispensable for DNA 
          binding—is more important for RNA binding. Consequently, the KTS 
          insertion has minimal effect on RNA affinity

  - description: Transcription factor (-KTS isoform) that regulates gonad 
      development and sex determination by activating SRY and regulating MIS/AMH
      and androgen receptor expression. Isoform-specific activity is critical as
      Frasier syndrome results from splice site mutations altering +KTS/-KTS 
      ratio.

  - description: RNA-binding protein (+KTS isoform) that participates in 
      post-transcriptional regulation. Localizes to nuclear speckles where it 
      interacts with splicing factors (U2AF65, RBM4) and modulates alternative 
      splicing. ZnF1 is more important for RNA binding than DNA binding. The 
      +KTS isoform has reduced DNA-binding affinity due to the three amino acid 
      insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4 which increases linker flexibility 
      and abolishes ZnF4 DNA contact.

  - description: Transcription factor required for epicardial 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during heart development. 
      Expressed in proepicardium and epicardium, WT1 regulates EMT through 
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (via Lef1, Ctnnb1), non-canonical Wnt5a 
      signaling, and retinoic acid signaling (via direct Raldh2 regulation). 
      Epicardial EMT generates cardiac fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle 
      cells, and coronary endothelial cells. WT1 null embryos die at E13.5 due 
      to heart failure from defective epicardium.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise mechanism by which WT1 switches between 
      activator and repressor function?
  - question: What are the distinct RNA targets of the +KTS isoform?
suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq for WT1 isoforms to systematically identify 
      genome-wide binding sites for -KTS vs +KTS isoforms, which would clarify 
      their distinct transcriptional targets.
  - description: CLIP-seq for +KTS isoform to identify RNA binding targets, 
      which would elucidate its post-transcriptional regulatory functions.
