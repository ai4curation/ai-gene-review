## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P19544
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Wilms tumor protein; AltName: Full=WT33;
- **Gene Information:** Name=WT1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the EGR C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family.
- **Key Domains:** Wilms_tumour_N. (IPR000976); Znf_C2H2_sf. (IPR036236); Znf_C2H2_type. (IPR013087); WT1 (PF02165); zf-C2H2 (PF00096)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "WT1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'WT1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **WT1** (gene ID: WT1, UniProt: P19544) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein verification and identity
- Target verified: Human WT1 (UniProt P19544) encodes Wilms tumor protein, a transcriptional regulator with an N‑terminal regulatory region (Wilms_tumour_N) and four C2H2 zinc fingers at the C‑terminus; it belongs to the EGR C2H2-type zinc-finger family and functions primarily as a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor with additional RNA-related roles (review, accepted July 2024) (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3). Alternative splicing at intron 9 inserts a three–amino‑acid KTS motif between zinc fingers 3 and 4 to produce +KTS and −KTS isoforms; −KTS acts mainly as a classical transcription factor, while +KTS participates in post‑transcriptional/RNA processes (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3, cassiday2002havingitboth pages 3-4).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Domain architecture and nucleic-acid interactions: WT1 contains four C2H2 zinc fingers (exons 7–10) mediating high‑affinity binding to GC‑rich motifs such as 5′‑GCG(T/G)GGGCG‑3′ in target promoters/enhancers; the zinc‑finger region also provides overlapping surfaces for DNA and RNA binding (EGR-like zinc fingers) (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 7-8). Early biochemical work demonstrated that zinc fingers II–IV are indispensable for RNA and DNA recognition and that RNA can compete with DNA for binding to the same interface (bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 7-8, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 8-8).
- Isoforms and functional partitioning: The −KTS isoform binds DNA sequence‑specifically and drives transcriptional programs, whereas the +KTS isoform shows low DNA affinity, associates with spliceosomal components, and has RNA-binding/processing roles; both isoforms can localize to the nucleus, with +KTS enriched in nuclear speckles/splicing domains (cassiday2002havingitboth pages 3-4, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 1-1). Reviews consolidating structural and genomic data reiterate these isoform‑specific roles and the context‑dependent activator/repressor functions of WT1’s N‑terminus (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 23-24, hirahata2025wt1genea pages 3-4).
- Cellular localization and modality: WT1 is predominantly nuclear for transcriptional regulation, but shuttling to the cytoplasm has been observed, including association with translating polysomes and mRNPs, supporting additional post‑transcriptional/translation‑related roles; nuclear WT1 frequently colocalizes with splicing factors (U2AF65, WTAP) and BASP1/ZNF224 partners that tune its transcriptional output (florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 8-8, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 1-1).

Biological processes and pathways (concise)
- Nephrogenesis and podocyte maintenance: WT1 binds and regulates kidney lineage and podocyte genes and is essential for nephron development and adult podocyte integrity (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3). The WT1–BASP1 complex dynamically modulates podocyte precursor gene expression during differentiation (florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3).
- Gonadal development and sex determination: Alternative splicing (+/−KTS) contributes to distinct roles in supporting cell lineages during gonadal differentiation (cassiday2002havingitboth pages 3-4, nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3). 
- Hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis: WT1 expression is high in most AML and is leveraged diagnostically (see Applications) (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).

Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Consolidated 2024 mechanistic review: A 2024 review emphasizes WT1’s dual DNA/RNA modalities, KTS-dependent isoform functions, canonical DNA-recognition motif, and roles in kidney/podocyte biology (Clinical and Experimental Nephrology; published July 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-024-02539-x) (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3).
- WT1-targeted immunotherapy advances (2024 synthesis): A 2024 mini‑review summarizes Phase I/II WT1 peptide and DC/mRNA-DC vaccine results, noting enhanced immunogenicity when combining HLA class I and II peptides, emerging combinations with checkpoint blockade, and the need for Phase III confirmation (Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics; Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2023.2296735) (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 3-4).
- MRD standardization and thresholds: Updated summaries of ELN‑standardized WT1 qRT‑PCR provide actionable thresholds (bone marrow ≥250 copies/10^4 ABL; peripheral blood ≥50/10^4 ABL) and emphasize integration with flow cytometry/genomics (Clinical and Experimental Medicine; Oct 2025; includes 2013 ELN standardization and subsequent practice; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-025-01769-x) (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).

Subcellular localization and RNA-processing evidence
- Nuclear transcriptional roles: WT1(−KTS) engages promoters/enhancers of podocyte and lineage genes; ChIP-based analyses and motif studies corroborate direct DNA binding in the nucleus (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3).
- RNA processing roles: WT1(+KTS) co-localizes with splicing speckles, interacts with splicing factors (U2AF65, WTAP), forms complexes with ZNF255 and BASP1 that participate in RNA maturation, and associates with translating polysomes, indicating roles spanning splicing to translation (Human Mol Genet 2010; Nucleic Acids Res 2004, 1998; URLs: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddq270; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn955; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/26.7.1784) (florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 1-1, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 8-8, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 7-8).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostic pathology (mesothelium and other lineages): WT1 protein is expressed in mesothelium and select normal tissues; this restricted pattern underlies its frequent use in diagnostic immunohistochemistry panels, especially for mesothelioma and ovarian serous tumors; WT1’s tumor-associated expression across many cancers underpins its targeting in immunotherapy (2024 review) (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2).
- Hematologic MRD monitoring: WT1 mRNA is overexpressed in >80% of AML; standardized ELN qRT‑PCR thresholds are widely used for MRD risk stratification and post‑transplant surveillance, with elevated WT1 early after allo‑HSCT predicting relapse and guiding pre‑emptive therapy decisions (e.g., DLI, hypomethylating agents) (Clinical and Experimental Medicine 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-025-01769-x) (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14). Clinical series summarized in 2024/2025 sources indicate WT1 monitoring complements flow cytometry and can detect residual disease when mutation-based markers are absent (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 14-15, hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).
- Immunotherapy: 
  - Peptide vaccines: Across multiple Phase I/II trials, WT1 class I CTL peptide vaccines, often augmented with class II helper peptides, show safety, strong WT1-specific T‑cell and IgG responses, and disease-control signals in glioma, mesothelioma, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics 2024) (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3). For example, in temozolomide‑resistant brain tumors, WT1 CTL+helper vaccination yielded stable disease in 43%, 1‑year OS 36%, and median OS 24.7 weeks (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3). In a randomized pancreatic study, adding WT1 CTL peptide to gemcitabine improved 1‑year OS to 35.7% vs 20.9% and reduced hazard for progression (HR 0.66) (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2).
  - Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines: WT1 peptide‑pulsed or WT1 mRNA‑loaded DCs demonstrated disease control, median PFS 6.4–8.1 months, and median OS 12.1–15.1 months in Phase 1/2 studies; an adjuvant trial reported 3‑year OS 77.8% with RFS 35% (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3). A 2024 systematic review in pancreatic cancer found feasibility and safety with skin‑site reactions as common AEs, and reported pooled signals including 20% objective responses in one series and 1‑year survival ~29% in another; all studies were Phase I/II and mostly HLA‑A*24:02–selected populations (Cureus 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.56934) (gugulothu2024wt1cancervaccine pages 4-4, gugulothu2024wt1cancervaccine pages 5-6).
  - Combination with ICIs: Combining multipeptide WT1 vaccine (e.g., galinpepimut‑S) with nivolumab showed high T‑cell (91%) and WT1‑IgG (88%) response rates and promising 1‑year PFS in early-phase evaluation (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3).
  - Hematologic settings: In AML complete remission, WT1 peptide vaccination yielded 2‑year RFS 25% and 2‑year OS 40% in one Phase II; a multivalent WT1 vaccine reported median DFS from CR 16.9 months and estimated OS >67.6 months (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 3-4).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- 2024 immunotherapy review (Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics) concludes WT1 is a compelling tumor‑associated antigen with acceptable safety across Phase I/II studies; combining class I/II peptides improves immunogenicity and combinations with checkpoint inhibitors are rational next steps, but large Phase III trials are needed to validate efficacy (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 3-4).
- 2024 nephrology review underscores the mechanistic foundation—WT1’s domain structure, KTS isoforms, and target DNA motif—connecting developmental roles in kidney/podocyte biology to genotype‑phenotype in disease, reinforcing that −KTS is primarily transcriptional and +KTS is post‑transcriptional (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3).
- Clinical MRD perspective (summary including ELN practice) emphasizes standardized WT1 thresholds and integration with other MRD modalities due to low‑level expression in some healthy tissues, guiding nuanced interpretation (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).

Relevant statistics and recent data points (with sources)
- DNA/RNA binding and isoforms: Distinct +KTS/−KTS functional partitioning and overlapping RNA/DNA binding via zinc fingers II–IV (Nucleic Acids Res 1998; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/26.7.1784) (bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 7-8, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 8-8); +KTS enriched in nuclear splicing domains and associates with splicing factors (Nucleic Acids Res 2002; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkf512) (cassiday2002havingitboth pages 3-4); WT1 partners BASP1/ZNF224/ZNF255 modulate transcription vs RNA maturation (HMG 2010; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddq270) (florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 1-1).
- MRD thresholds: ELN‑standardized cutoffs—bone marrow 250 copies WT1/10^4 ABL, peripheral blood 50/10^4 ABL—used for AML/MDS MRD risk and relapse prediction after HSCT (Clinical and Experimental Medicine 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-025-01769-x) (hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).
- Vaccine outcomes (examples, 2023–2024 emphasis): 
  - Glioma (Phase I CTL+helper): SD 43%, 1‑year OS 36%, mOS 24.7 weeks (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3).
  - Pancreatic (randomized): 1‑year OS 35.7% vs 20.9% and HR 0.66 for PFS with WT1 peptide + gemcitabine vs gemcitabine alone (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2).
  - DC vaccines across mixed tumors: DCR 45%, mPFS 6.4 months, mOS 12.1 months (one series); mPFS 8.1 months, mOS 15.1 months (another); adjuvant 3‑year OS 77.8% (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3).
  - Pancreatic (systematic review): Objective response 20% in one cohort; 1‑year survival ~29% in another; safety dominated by grade 1 skin reactions (gugulothu2024wt1cancervaccine pages 4-4, gugulothu2024wt1cancervaccine pages 5-6).
  - AML CR vaccination: 2‑year RFS 25%, 2‑year OS 40%; multivalent WT1 vaccine mDFS 16.9 months, estimated OS >67.6 months (ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 3-4).

Conclusions
Human WT1 (P19544) is a C2H2 zinc‑finger transcription factor with a Wilms_tumour_N regulatory N‑terminus and alternative +/−KTS isoforms that partition nuclear DNA‑dependent transcription from RNA processing functions. Its essential roles in kidney development/podocyte maintenance and gonadal support lineages are underpinned by direct DNA binding and nuclear complexes that also engage RNA metabolism. Clinically, WT1 is entrenched in hematology as a standardized MRD biomarker and is an active oncology target for peptide and DC/mRNA vaccines, with 2023–2024 studies showing consistent safety, robust immunogenicity, and signals of clinical benefit, particularly when helper peptides or checkpoint inhibitors are added. Larger randomized trials remain necessary to establish definitive efficacy endpoints across tumor types (nagano2025areviewof pages 1-3, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 7-8, cassiday2002havingitboth pages 3-4, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 2-3, bardeesy1998overlappingrnaand pages 8-8, florio2010biochemicalandfunctional pages 1-1, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 1-2, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 2-3, ogasawara2024wilms’tumor1 pages 3-4, hirahata2025wt1genea pages 12-14).
