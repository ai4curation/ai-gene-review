description: Alpha-sarcoglycan is a critical transmembrane glycoprotein 
  component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that maintains muscle fiber 
  membrane integrity through mechanical linkage between the cytoskeleton and 
  extracellular matrix, possesses ATP-hydrolyzing enzymatic activity, and 
  participates in mechanotransduction signaling. Mutations cause limb-girdle 
  muscular dystrophy type 2D/LGMDR3.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation for sarcoglycan complex membership is strongly 
        supported by phylogenetic analysis and extensive experimental evidence. 
        Alpha-sarcoglycan is a core structural component of the tetrameric 
        sarcoglycan complex comprising alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits 
        that forms a subcomplex within the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately reflects the primary structural role of
        SGCA. Multiple lines of evidence support this assignment including 
        UniProt annotation, the deep research report describing the sarcoglycan 
        complex as a critical subcomplex of the DGC, recent cryoEM structural 
        data showing the tower-like architecture, and the fact that loss of any 
        single sarcoglycan destabilizes the entire complex. This is a core 
        cellular component annotation representing the fundamental structural 
        context of the protein.

        calcium-binding pockets conserved with alpha-dystroglycan, and the

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
    review:
      summary: IEA annotation based on subcellular location mapping is overly 
        general. While SGCA is part of the DGC that links to the actin 
        cytoskeleton, the protein itself is a transmembrane component at the 
        sarcolemma, not a cytoskeletal protein per se.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: This annotation is too general and somewhat misleading. SGCA is 
        not itself a cytoskeletal component but rather a sarcolemmal membrane 
        protein that indirectly associates with the cytoskeleton through the 
        dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. More specific annotations like 
        sarcolemma, sarcoglycan complex, or dystrophin-associated glycoprotein 
        complex better capture its actual localization and function. The term 
        cytoskeleton suggests the protein is part of the cytoskeletal framework 
        itself, which is inaccurate.

        sarcoglycan complex is an integral subcomplex of the larger DGC. Recent

      action: REMOVE
      reason: This annotation appears to be an over-annotation from orthology

        domains, SGCA is not specifically enriched at cell-cell junctions 
        between muscle fibers. The primary localization is to the sarcolemma 
        broadly and to specialized regions like costameres and the neuromuscular
        junction, which is a neuron-muscle synapse not a cell-cell junction per

      action: REMOVE
      reason: This appears to be an over-annotation from computational transfer.
        There is no specific experimental evidence in the literature that SGCA 
        localizes to membrane rafts or lipid raft microdomains. The primary 
        localizations are sarcolemma, costameres, and neuromuscular junction -

    review:
      summary: NAS annotation for camera-type eye development based on DGC 
        review discussing retinal roles. While DGC components are present in 
        retina, SGCA expression is restricted to striated muscle and this 
        developmental annotation seems like over-annotation.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: This annotation is peripheral to SGCA primary function. While 
        PMID:19899002 discusses DGC roles in multiple tissues including retina, 
        and some sarcoglycans are expressed in retinal tissue, SGCA itself is 
        described as restricted to striated muscle in the deep research report 
        and UniProt. The primary function is muscle membrane stabilization. Eye 
        development may be affected in some sarcoglycanopathies but this is not 
        a core function of SGCA. This should be marked as non-core or 
        potentially removed entirely.

      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While technically accurate that SGCA traffics through the Golgi 
        during biosynthesis and complex assembly, this is not a functionally 
        relevant localization. The Reactome pathways describe the assembly and 
        trafficking process. The functional location is the sarcolemma. Golgi

    review:
      summary: TAS annotation for muscle contraction from seminal paper 
        identifying SGCA mutations causing muscular dystrophy. While SGCA is 
        essential for muscle integrity during contraction, it does not directly 
        participate in the contractile process itself.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: This annotation is somewhat imprecise. SGCA does not directly 
        participate in muscle contraction - it is not part of the contractile 
        apparatus. Rather, it maintains sarcolemmal integrity during contraction
        and protects against contraction-induced membrane damage. More accurate 
        terms would be muscle structure development, sarcomere organization, or 
        maintenance of muscle cell membrane integrity. The primary role is 
        structural stabilization, not the contractile process per se.

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation is appropriate. SGCA is required for proper muscle
        organ development and maintenance. Loss of SGCA causes progressive 
        muscular dystrophy with muscle degeneration starting in childhood, 
        demonstrating its essential role in muscle development and homeostasis. 
        While the primary molecular function is structural, the biological 
        process of muscle organ development accurately captures the 
        physiological role. This is supported by the disease phenotype and 
        tissue-specific expression.

      summary: Proposed new annotation for calcium-dependent ATPase activity
        based on experimental biochemical evidence from PMID:15032752 and
        PMID:10075685. Alpha-sarcoglycan is a Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent ecto-ATPase
        that hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP. Transfection of HEK293
        cells with SGCA resulted in increased ATP-hydrolyzing activity that
        was completely abolished by anti-alpha-sarcoglycan antibodies.
      action: NEW
      reason: Alpha-sarcoglycan has been experimentally demonstrated to possess
        intrinsic ATP-hydrolyzing enzymatic activity that requires both calcium
        and magnesium ions. The enzyme has a substrate specificity for ATP and
        ADP, does not hydrolyze other triphosphonucleosides, and has an affinity
        for ATP in the low mM range. The ATPase activity was completely inhibited
        by suramin and reactive blue-2. This ecto-ATPase activity represents a
        distinct molecular function of SGCA beyond its structural role.

    review:
      summary: Proposed new annotation for involvement in ERK1/2 signaling

        including SGCA participates in mechanical signal transduction through 
        ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
      action: NEW
      reason: Studies demonstrate that the sarcoglycan complex functions as a 
        mechanoreceptor that activates ERK1/2 signaling in response to 
        mechanical loading. During eccentric contractions, the sarcoglycan 
        complex undergoes rapid phosphorylation with concomitant activation of 
        ERK1/2. Muscles lacking sarcoglycans show altered ERK1/2 phosphorylation
        responses to mechanical stimulation. This annotation captures an 
        important signaling function beyond the structural role.
