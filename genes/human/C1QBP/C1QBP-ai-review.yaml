description: >-
  C1QBP (also known as p32, gC1qR, HABP1) is a multifunctional, multicompartmental
  acidic homotrimeric protein with a distinctive donut-shaped structure. It belongs
  to the MAM33 family and localizes predominantly to the mitochondrial matrix, with
  additional pools at the cell surface, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The two primary
  core functions are: (1) mitochondrial translation support through binding mitochondrial
  RNAs (including m5C-modified RNAs) and association with mitoribosomes, essential
  for OXPHOS and cellular metabolic fitness; and (2) cell-surface receptor function
  for complement C1q (gC1qR), binding the globular heads of C1q to modulate complement
  activation and immune signaling. Biallelic C1QBP mutations cause combined oxidative
  phosphorylation deficiency 33 (COXPD33), confirming its essential mitochondrial
  role.

        C1QBP has been documented in the nucleus in specific contexts, including
        nuclear localization with POLGARF (PMID:32958672), translocation during HCMV

        Nuclear localization is well-documented though it represents a minor pool
