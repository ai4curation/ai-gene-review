## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q07021
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=ASF/SF2-associated protein p32; AltName: Full=Glycoprotein gC1qBP; Short=C1qBP; AltName: Full=Hyaluronan-binding protein 1; AltName: Full=Mitochondrial matrix protein p32; AltName: Full=gC1q-R protein; AltName: Full=p33; Short=SF2AP32 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:18191643}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=C1QBP; Synonyms=GC1QBP, HABP1, SF2P32;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MAM33 family. .
- **Key Domains:** MAM33. (IPR003428); MAM33_sf. (IPR036561); MAM33 (PF02330)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "C1QBP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'C1QBP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **C1QBP** (gene ID: C1QBP, UniProt: Q07021) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
We verified the identity of the human gene target as C1QBP (aliases: gC1qR, p32, HABP1; UniProt Q07021). The protein is a prepro‑protein (~282 aa) that migrates at ~33 kDa and assembles as an acidic homotrimer (~96 kDa apparent size) with a donut-like architecture. It localizes predominantly to mitochondria, with additional pools detectable at the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, and nucleus. These features and functions align with the MAM33 family annotation and established literature on gC1qR/p32 (Q07021). (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3, eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4)

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- What C1QBP/gC1qR is: A multifunctional, multicompartmental adaptor that binds the globular heads of complement C1q extracellularly and acts inside mitochondria as a regulator of mitochondrial translation/biogenesis and metabolic fitness. It is not a classical enzyme; its roles are chiefly non‑enzymatic scaffolding/adaptor and RNA-binding for mitochondrial translation. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 9-9, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3)
- Structural features: Mature chain (~33 kDa) forms a homotrimeric donut-shaped complex (~96 kDa by gel filtration); mitochondrial targeting mapped to the N‑terminus in isoforms. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3)
- Subcellular localization: Predominantly mitochondrial (matrix/near nucleoids) with additional cytoplasmic, nuclear, and limited cell-surface/extracellular pools; some soluble release reported from malignant cells. (eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3)
- Primary molecular functions: (1) Mitochondrial RNA binding and interaction with mitoribosomal components to support mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS; (2) Extracellular/cell‑surface receptor functions as gC1qR for C1q and other ligands, contributing to complement/kinin axis signaling and immune modulation. (scully2023c1qbpmediatesbreast pages 1-2, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3, eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Cancer immunology checkpoint concept: 2024 review proposes the C1q–gC1qR axis as a novel checkpoint-like pathway in tumors. gC1qR is overexpressed in many cancers; anti‑gC1qR antibodies reduced tumor growth in a preclinical TNBC model; development of humanized antibodies (e.g., mAb 60.11) is proposed for clinical translation. Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1351656 (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 8-9, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 9-9)
- Mitochondrial roles in cancer cells: In TNBC cells, C1QBP supports proliferation; knockdown reduces growth; mitochondrial localization confirmed (MitoTracker co‑localization). Int J Mol Sci, Jan 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021343 (scully2023c1qbpmediatesbreast pages 1-2)
- PA28γ–C1QBP axis elevates OXPHOS: A 2024/2025 eLife study (preprint DOI issued 2024-07-23) shows PA28γ binds the C1QBP N‑terminus, stabilizes C1QBP, and increases mitochondrial fusion (OPA1/MFN1/2), respiratory complex expression, OXPHOS, ATP, and ROS in oral squamous cell carcinoma; clinical co‑expression associates with poor prognosis. eLife, Jun 2025 (preprint 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.604769 (wang2025pa28γpromotesthe pages 1-2)
- Virus–complement interface (HCMV): During HCMV infection, C1QBP expression increases and translocates to the nucleus, directly interacting with viral proteins UL84/UL44; C1QBP supports viral gene expression, replication, and nuclear egress; knockdown reduces replication. Viruses, Jul 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071171 (lujan2024theinteractionsof pages 10-12)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology targeting: Preclinical strategies include anti‑gC1qR monoclonal antibodies, small‑molecule inhibitors, CAR‑T constructs, and tumor vaccination targeting gC1qR; antibody therapy decreased tumor growth in an orthotopic TNBC model, supporting translational development. Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; Frontiers in Immunology, 2023. URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1351656; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1095943 (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 8-9, lei2023gc1qranew pages 6-7)
- Infectious disease implications: Modulating C1QBP may influence herpesvirus replication cycles (HCMV) via its nuclear adaptor function and potentially affect host antiviral signaling; this positions C1QBP as a putative host-directed antiviral target, though clinical translation remains to be explored. Viruses, 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071171 (lujan2024theinteractionsof pages 10-12)

Viruses, 2024. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/v16071171 (lujan2024theinteractionsof pages 10-12)

Functional roles, binding partners, and pathways (focused mechanistic view)
- Mitochondrial translation adaptor: C1QBP binds mitochondrial mRNAs and associates with mitoribosomes to sustain OXPHOS; it thereby supports cellular proliferation and metabolic fitness. Evidence in cancer cells and recent mitochondrial studies reinforce this role. (scully2023c1qbpmediatesbreast pages 1-2, wang2025pa28γpromotesthe pages 1-2)
- Cell-surface receptor for C1q (gC1qR): Binds C1q globular heads; contributes to immune signaling, lamellipodia formation, and TME modulation, with reported soluble release from tumor cells. (eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 9-9)
- Kinin/contact system linkage: gC1qR participates in complexes with contact system components (HK/FXII), positioning it at the intersection of complement and coagulation/kinin signaling in inflammatory and tumor contexts. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 9-9, eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4)
- T cell regulation: gC1qR on T cells can receive C1q signals that alter proliferation/activation; more recent work frames the C1q–gC1qR axis as modulating CD8+ T cell function and anti‑tumor responses within TME. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 9-9, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3)
- Viral replication hub (HCMV): C1QBP supports viral gene expression and nuclear egress via direct interactions with viral proteins, highlighting a host–virus interface. (lujan2024theinteractionsof pages 10-12)

Subcellular localization (where it acts)
- Mitochondria (predominant): Matrix/near nucleoids with mitoribosome association; key site for RNA-binding and translation support. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3, scully2023c1qbpmediatesbreast pages 1-2)
- Cell surface/extracellular: Detected at low levels; binds C1q; soluble forms can be released by tumor cells and may contribute to microenvironment signaling. (eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4, ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 2-3)
- Nucleus/cytoplasm: Nuclear translocation reported during HCMV infection with functional consequences for viral gene expression; cytoplasmic pools detectable by immunostaining. (lujan2024theinteractionsof pages 10-12, eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4)

Primary function summary with specificity
- Not an enzyme or transporter; acts as a non-enzymatic adaptor/scaffold. Mitochondrial function involves binding mitochondrial RNAs and associating with the mitoribosome to support translation of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits. Extracellularly, gC1qR binds C1q and interfaces with complement/kinin pathways and immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, T cells).

*Table: Concise table summarizing C1QBP (gC1qR/p32) functions, localization, and primary 2023–2024 evidence with sources and DOIs; useful as a quick reference linking key mechanistic roles to supporting literature.*

Limitations and open questions
- Cell-surface abundance and topology remain a point of debate; most protein is mitochondrial, with low-level surface exposure detectable under specific conditions. Further structural work in native membranes and quantitative proteomics in vivo would refine this. (eggleton2000c1qreceptors pages 3-4)
- Translational status of anti‑gC1qR therapeutics: robust preclinical rationale exists, but clinical pharmacology, safety, and efficacy remain to be demonstrated. (ghebrehiwet2024thec1qand pages 8-9)
