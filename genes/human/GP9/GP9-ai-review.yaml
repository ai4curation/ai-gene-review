description: >-
  Platelet glycoprotein IX (GPIX, CD42a) is a small leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane
  protein that is an essential structural subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex
  on platelet
  and megakaryocyte surfaces. GPIX does not directly bind von Willebrand factor (vWF);
  rather,
  it is required for proper assembly, trafficking, and surface expression of the GPIb-IX-V
  complex. The complex binds vWF via the GPIbalpha subunit, initiating platelet adhesion
  at
  sites of vascular injury under high shear conditions. GPIX contributes specific
  extracellular
  and transmembrane interfaces that stabilize the tripartite GPIb-IX core. Biallelic
  mutations
  in GP9 cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), characterized by macrothrombocytopenia,
  giant
  platelets, and defective ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. Recent cryo-EM
  studies
  (2024) support a 1:2:1:1 stoichiometry for GPIbalpha:GPIbbeta:GPIX:GPV in the assembled
  complex.

      GPIX is a component of the GPIb-IX-V receptor complex that mediates platelet
      adhesion
      to von Willebrand factor bound to exposed collagen at sites of vascular injury
      (PMID:2771955).
      This is a core function of the protein, though the adhesive function is mediated
      by the
      GPIbalpha subunit while GPIX provides structural support for complex assembly.
