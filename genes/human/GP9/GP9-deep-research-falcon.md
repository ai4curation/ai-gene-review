## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P14770
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Platelet glycoprotein IX; Short=GP-IX; Short=GPIX; AltName: Full=Glycoprotein 9; AltName: CD_antigen=CD42a; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GP9;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Cys-rich_flank_reg_C. (IPR000483); GPIb-IX-V_Complex. (IPR052313); Leu-rich_rpt. (IPR001611); LRR_dom_sf. (IPR032675); LRRNT. (IPR000372)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GP9" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GP9' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GP9** (gene ID: GP9, UniProt: P14770) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan overview
Objective 1 (verification): Confirmed that the target is human GP9 (gene symbol GP9), encoding platelet glycoprotein IX (GPIX; CD42a), UniProt P14770. It is a platelet/megakaryocyte surface subunit of the GPIb-IX-V receptor and belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. This identity, organism, and domain organization are consistent across recent structural and review sources (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2).
Objective 2–5: Collected 2023–2024 primary/secondary literature on GPIb-IX-V structure and function; compiled disease links (Bernard–Soulier syndrome), diagnostics, clinical management, and population/founder variants; and extracted emerging proteomic/transcriptomic observations of GP9 outside classical hemostasis (huang2024newinsightsof pages 7-9, clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts, definitions, and current understanding
• Identity and family: GP9 encodes platelet glycoprotein IX (GPIX, CD42a), a small type I single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein that is a constitutive subunit of the platelet GPIb-IX-V receptor complex, together with GPIbα (GP1BA), GPIbβ (GP1BB), and GPV (GP5). The extracellular domain is LRR-type with an N-terminal LRRNT cap and cysteine-rich flanking regions; a short cytoplasmic tail follows the transmembrane helix (Homo sapiens). These domain assignments and complex membership are established in recent reviews and structural work (2024) (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2).
• Complex function: GPIb-IX-V is the principal platelet receptor that initiates adhesion at sites of vascular injury under high shear via the interaction of GPIbα with von Willebrand factor (VWF). Engagement transduces mechanosignals, contributes to thrombin responsiveness, and cooperates to activate integrin αIIbβ3, enabling stable aggregation. GPIX’s critical role is structural: it is required for assembly, stability, trafficking, and surface expression of the complex; loss or mutation of any one of GPIbα, GPIbβ, or GPIX markedly reduces surface expression of the entire complex (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2).
• Topology and localization: GPIX is a type I membrane protein with a luminal/extracellular LRR ectodomain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. It localizes to the surface of platelets and megakaryocytes as part of GPIb-IX-V. Recent structural modeling and sequence mapping in the 2024 cryo-EM study confirm the signal peptide, cysteine-rich extracellular region, and transmembrane segment for human GPIX (UniProt P14770) (lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15).

2) Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)
• Intact-complex cryo-EM and stoichiometry revision: A 2024 study purified human GPIb-IX-V and determined a single-particle cryo-EM map (~11 Å), reporting an asymmetric architecture. SEC–MALS and quantitative proteomics argued for GPIbα:GPIbβ:GPIX:GPV stoichiometry of approximately 1:2:1:1, challenging the earlier antibody-based 2:4:2:1 model. Peptide-level MS quantification and model docking (including an AlphaFold GPIX-ECD) supported GPIX as an integral ECD-containing subunit in the assembled receptor (Lu et al., Biological Chemistry, Mar 2024; DOI:10.1515/hsz-2022-0227) (lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15). A 2024 review (Current Opinion in Hematology, Jul 2024; DOI:10.1097/moh.0000000000000832) contextualizes this shift in complex organization and integrates prior biochemical and structural data (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7, huang2024newinsightsof pages 11-15).
• Quaternary interactions underpinning assembly: Structural work on GPIbβ and a GPIbβ/GPIX chimera previously clarified that GPIX contributes specific extracellular interfaces (e.g., convex-face loops engaging the C-terminal cap of GPIb domains), as well as transmembrane packing that stabilizes the tripartite GPIb-IX core. These interactions rationalize how GPIX supports maturation and surface expression; mutation at key residues at the interface disrupts assembly and surface levels, offering a structural basis for Bernard–Soulier syndrome (McEwan et al., Blood, Nov 2011; DOI:10.1182/blood-2011-05-356253) (mcewan2011quaternaryorganizationof pages 6-8). The 2024 analyses integrate these insights into a full-complex framework (lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15).
• Platelet biogenesis links: 2024 perspectives emphasize that GPIb-IX-V contributes to platelet production and size regulation, with recent data on GPIbα–filamin A anchorage and its disruption causing giant platelets and thrombocytopenia. While these studies focus on GPIbα’s cytoplasmic interactions, they underscore the complex’s collective role in megakaryocyte biology; by inference, proper assembly that depends on GPIX is required for these processes (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7, huang2024newinsightsof pages 11-15).

3) Primary function, mechanism, and interactions in pathways
• Primary role within GPIb-IX-V: GPIX is not the ligand-binding subunit for VWF; rather, it is essential for correct assembly/trafficking and mechanical integrity of the GPIb-IX core. Through strong noncovalent interactions (both extracellular and transmembrane) with GPIbα and GPIbβ, GPIX ensures surface expression of a properly organized receptor capable of VWF binding via GPIbα, mechanotransduction, and subsequent activation pathways (huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, mcewan2011quaternaryorganizationof pages 6-8, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2).
• Signaling context: Mechanotransduction downstream of VWF–GPIbα engagement and cooperation with thrombin receptors depends on intact GPIb-IX. 14-3-3 binding sites on GPIb cytoplasmic domains and the GPIbα–filamin A linkage mediate key signaling and cytoskeletal anchoring steps; while these are not GP9-specific, GPIX’s role in maintaining the assembled complex is prerequisite for these pathways to operate (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 11-15).
• Copy numbers and stoichiometry on platelets: Historical antibody counts suggested near 1:1 with GPIbα (20,000–25,000 per platelet), but recent MS data (2024) support a 1:2:1:1 stoichiometry of GPIbα:GPIbβ:GPIX:GPV in intact purified receptor and platelet lysates, aligning absolute copy numbers of GPIX and GPV to approximately similar levels (huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15).

4) Subcellular localization and structural topology
• Localization: The GPIX subunit is localized at the plasma membrane of platelets and megakaryocytes; it is required for surface expression of the GPIb-IX-V complex. The 2024 structural work confirms a signal peptide, luminal LRR ectodomain with cysteine-rich flanks, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail—consistent with a type I membrane topology. GPIX is not GPI-anchored; the GPIb-IX-V receptor comprises single-pass transmembrane subunits (lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4).

5) Disease associations, expert opinions, and statistics
• Bernard–Soulier syndrome (BSS): Biallelic pathogenic variants in GP9 (and in GP1BA, GP1BB) cause classic BSS, characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, giant platelets (macrothrombocytopenia), and absent/markedly reduced ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination; flow cytometry typically shows absent or markedly reduced GPIb-IX-V (CD42a/CD42b) expression. Earlier estimates noted ~100 reported cases worldwide, though the true prevalence is higher; BSS is rare. GP9 mutations have been repeatedly documented among causative alleles; GP5 mutations have not been implicated in BSS (Orphanet review, 2006; DOI:10.1186/1750-1172-1-46) (lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2). A 2025 review further delineates biallelic vs monoallelic forms (monoallelic typically GP1BA/GP1BB; biallelic classic BSS including GP9), with macrothrombocytopenia, diagnostic RIPA patterns, and surface expression findings (Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Aug 2025; DOI:10.1055/s-0044-1789184) (huang2024newinsightsof pages 7-9).
• Founder/recurrent GP9 variants: Population-based biobank data from Finland (2024) report regional occurrence of GP9 founder or enriched variants, including Asn45Ser (enriched in South Ostrobothnia) and Leu40Pro detected heterozygously across multiple regions. Mutations leading to BSS were rare in the donor cohort, consistent with disease rarity (EJHG, Jan 2024; DOI:10.1038/s41431-023-01528-0) (clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).
• Clinical diagnosis and expert guidance: Diagnostic algorithms emphasize light transmission aggregometry (RIPA), flow cytometry for CD42a (GPIX) and CD42b (GPIbα) to quantify receptor expression, and confirmatory genetic testing. Flow cytometry-based glycoprotein phenotyping for inherited platelet function disorders, including BSS, is a standard approach (earlier methodology review, 2014) and has been updated in recent expert recommendations (2025) (Gesi 2014, DOI:10.1055/s-0033-1363472; Althaus et al. 2025, DOI:10.1055/a-2404-0216) (lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7). The 2025 update and 2023 overview underscore that misdiagnosis as ITP is common and that multicolor flow cytometry and genotyping improve accuracy (huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
• Laboratory diagnostics: Routine use of CD42a (GPIX) and CD42b (GPIbα) antibodies in flow cytometry to assess receptor quantity/absence forms a central diagnostic element in BSS workups, alongside ristocetin responses. This is reflected in both foundational and updated expert literature (lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7).
• Clinical management: Platelet transfusions remain the mainstay for bleeding and perioperative prophylaxis; recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is recommended for patients with alloantibodies or refractory responses; allogeneic stem cell transplantation is considered in select severe/refractory cases. These standards appear consistently in authoritative reviews (2006; 2025) (lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2, huang2024newinsightsof pages 7-9).
• Population genetics and screening: Biobanks can detect carriers of GP9 variants; the Finnish donor biobank demonstrates regional enrichment of specific GP9 alleles, an actionable real-world resource for genotype-selected sampling and counseling (clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).

7) Expert opinions and structural-mechanistic synthesis (2023–2024)
• Organization of the GPIb-IX-V complex: Recent expert reviews emphasize that the 1:2:1:1 stoichiometry with an asymmetric, bouquet-like architecture best fits combined proteomics and cryo-EM data; this re-organization has implications for how subunits assemble and how defects in GP9 destabilize the complex (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7, huang2024newinsightsof pages 11-15).
• Role in biogenesis: Experts highlight emerging roles of the complex in platelet production, with structural anchorage via filamin A being crucial. Although many studies center on GPIbα, intact assembly—dependent on GPIX—is necessary for proper trafficking and surface expression during megakaryocyte maturation (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7, huang2024newinsightsof pages 11-15).

8) Relevant statistics and datasets beyond hemostasis
• Omics observations: In non-hemostasis cohorts, GP9 has been detected as part of platelet-related signatures. For example, neutrophil proteomes from community-acquired pneumonia patients displayed platelet proteins including GPIX, consistent with neutrophil–platelet complexes in infection (Frontiers in Immunology, Oct 2024; DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2024.1470383) (huang2024newinsightsof pages 7-9). A COVID-19 blood transcriptomic meta-analysis identified GP9 among a 149-gene disease-specific signature implicating hemostasis/platelet pathways (Frontiers in Genetics, Aug 2022; DOI:10.3389/fgene.2022.929887) (clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6) (clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).

Mandated verification of gene/protein identity and domain/family
• Gene symbol: GP9 matches protein GPIX/CD42a description (UniProt P14770) (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15).
• Organism: Homo sapiens (human) (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2).
• Family/domains: LRR ectodomain with LRRNT and cysteine-rich flanking regions; single-pass transmembrane; short cytoplasmic tail; membership in LRR-containing GPIb-IX-V complex—consistent with UniProt context and 2024 structural/review literature (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15).
• Ambiguity check: No conflicting gene symbol usage identified in the cited literature for human GP9; all sources align on platelet GPIX/CD42a. If unrelated GP9 symbols are encountered in other organisms, they should not be conflated with human GP9 (not observed in evidence used).

Limitations and open questions
• While 2024 structural data greatly clarify global architecture and stoichiometry, atomistic resolution for all extracellular and transmembrane interfaces in the intact complex remains to be resolved at higher resolution to map GP9-specific contacts definitively. The precise contribution of GPIX’s cytoplasmic tail to signaling scaffolding is less well defined compared with GPIbα. Clinical prevalence statistics for GP9-driven BSS are still limited; population biobanks (e.g., Finland) begin to provide regional founder-variant maps but many regions show rarity or absence, emphasizing the need for broader population genomics (lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).

Conclusions
Human GP9 encodes GPIX/CD42a, an LRR-type, single-pass membrane subunit of the platelet GPIb-IX-V complex. It enables assembly, trafficking, and surface expression of the VWF-binding receptor that initiates platelet adhesion and mechanosignaling at high shear. Recent 2024 studies revised long-standing views on stoichiometry and architecture (to 1:2:1:1) and integrated biochemical, proteomic, and cryo-EM evidence. Clinically, biallelic GP9 defects cause Bernard–Soulier syndrome with macrothrombocytopenia, defective ristocetin-induced agglutination, and markedly reduced CD42a/CD42b by flow cytometry; founder GP9 variants exist in specific populations. GP9 also appears in broader disease-associated omics signatures, typically reflecting platelet involvement in inflammation and infection. These converging data solidify GP9’s essential structural role in platelet hemostasis and provide actionable diagnostics and management pathways for BSS (huang2024newinsightsof pages 1-3, huang2024newinsightsof pages 3-4, lu2024stoichiometryandarchitecture pages 1-15, mcewan2011quaternaryorganizationof pages 6-8, lanza2006bernardsouliersyndrome(hemorrhagiparous pages 1-2, huang2024newinsightsof pages 6-7, clancy2024blooddonorbiobank pages 5-6).
