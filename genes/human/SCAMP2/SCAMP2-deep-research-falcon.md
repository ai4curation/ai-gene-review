## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O15127
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2; Short=Secretory carrier membrane protein 2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SCAMP2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SCAMP family. .
- **Key Domains:** SCAMP. (IPR007273); SCAMP (PF04144)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SCAMP2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SCAMP2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SCAMP2** (gene ID: SCAMP2, UniProt: O15127) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan (concise)
- Verified identity: SCAMP2 (UniProt O15127), human Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2; SCAMP family member with conserved topology and motifs (completed). (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Collected foundational and recent literature; 2023–2024 SCAMP2-specific human evidence in the retrieved corpus is sparse; family-level insights and cross-paralog findings dominate (SCAMPs). (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)
- Synthesized functional annotation emphasizing membrane trafficking, localization, motifs, and mechanistic inferences with explicit limits where human SCAMP2 data are not directly available. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)

Identity verification and core definitions
- Gene/protein: SCAMP2 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2); organism: Homo sapiens; UniProt: O15127. SCAMPs are small integral membrane proteins of secretory and endocytic carriers, cycling between the plasma membrane and internal compartments—implicating them in membrane trafficking and its regulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Publication date: Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Family and domains: SCAMP2 belongs to the SCAMP family. Conserved architecture includes: (i) cytosolic N- and C-termini; (ii) a membrane core of four transmembrane helices; (iii) cytosolic N‑terminal low-complexity region with proline-rich sequences (potential SH3/WW-binding); (iv) repeated NPF motifs; and (v) three conserved amphipathic segments whose peptides bind phospholipid membranes and include a helical membrane-proximal element. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)

Primary molecular functions and mechanisms (current understanding)
- Core role: SCAMP family proteins, including SCAMP2, are implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking steps that govern exocytosis and endocytosis/recycling; SCAMPs are enriched on secretory granules and recycling carriers. Structural topology (cytosolic termini and amphipathic segments) supports direct participation at the membrane–cytosol interface where trafficking machineries operate. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Interaction motifs and potential partners: The NPF repeats and proline-rich regions in SCAMPs predict interactions with endocytic adaptors and SH3-/WW-domain proteins; amphipathic segments bind anionic phospholipids at the cytosolic leaflet. Family-level reports referenced in recent work also discuss lipid interactions (e.g., PIP2) and functional links to the exocytic machinery; however, within the retrieved evidence these are primarily cross-referenced from non-human or other SCAMP paralogs. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000; and family-level synthesis citing SCAMP2 roles in regulated exocytosis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.03.662988; Jul 2025 (preprint). (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)

Cellular localization
- SCAMP2 localizes to secretory vesicles and endocytic/recycling carriers that cycle between the plasma membrane and internal compartments, consistent with residence on secretory granules and recycling endosomes. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)

Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024) and state of the field
- Constraint: Within the documents retrieved and scanned for evidence, direct human SCAMP2-specific primary research from 2023–2024 was not available; most contemporary insights are family-level or relate to other paralogs (e.g., SCAMP3/5) or non-human systems. Therefore, while the consensus functional model for SCAMP2 emphasizes roles in regulated exocytosis and recycling, definitive 2023–2024 human SCAMP2 mechanistic updates could not be substantiated here. Family-level 2025 preprint reaffirms SCAMP roles in trafficking and notes prior SCAMP2 functional perturbations in exocytosis; interpret with caution for human SCAMP2. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.03.662988; Jul 2025 (preprint). (jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)

Applications, disease links, and real-world implementations
- Given the trafficking role of SCAMPs, SCAMP2 is frequently used as a vesicular trafficking marker or perturbation target in cell biology. However, in the gathered evidence there are no specific 2023–2024 human disease associations or therapeutic applications uniquely attributable to SCAMP2. The overarching application context remains mechanistic cell biology of secretion and endocytosis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000; and family-level discussion in the 2025 preprint. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.03.662988; Jul 2025 (preprint). (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)

Expert opinions and synthesis
- Authoritative structural/topology review (Hubbard et al., 2000) remains the definitive reference for SCAMP family membrane organization and provides the framework for inferring SCAMP2’s mechanistic role at the cytosolic–membrane interface. This topology underpins hypothesized interactions with SH3/WW domain proteins and lipid-dependent regulation of exo/endocytic steps. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Recent synthesis (2025 preprint) consolidates multiple functional observations across SCAMPs and cites earlier SCAMP2 studies demonstrating roles in late steps of regulated exocytosis and lipid interactions (e.g., PIP2). While it supports the prevailing model, it does not replace the need for updated, SCAMP2-specific human validation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.03.662988; Jul 2025 (preprint). (jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)

Relevant statistics and data
- Quantitative or statistical 2023–2024 datasets specific to human SCAMP2 were not present in the retrieved evidence. The established structural/topological features (four-pass membrane topology; cytosolic termini; amphipathic segments) are consistently reported across SCAMPs and provide a robust qualitative basis for function inference. URL: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.11.9.2933; Sep 2000. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)

Functional annotation for SCAMP2 (evidence-based summary)
- Primary role: Membrane trafficking regulator associated with secretory and recycling pathways; contributes to regulated exocytosis and endocytosis/recycling dynamics. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)
- Localization: Secretory granules/vesicles and endocytic/recycling carriers that cycle to/from the plasma membrane. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Structural features enabling function: Four transmembrane helices; cytosolic N-/C-termini; NPF repeats; proline-rich SH3/WW-binding region; conserved amphipathic segments that interact with phospholipid membranes—consistent with scaffolding or regulatory roles at membrane–cytosol interface. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)
- Interaction landscape (inferred/partial): Potential binding to SH3/WW domain proteins and to anionic phospholipids (e.g., PIP2) via amphipathic regions; functional coupling to exocytosis machinery is supported at the family level; direct, up-to-date human SCAMP2 interaction maps were not available in the retrieved corpus. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2, jiang2025secretorycarriermembrane pages 41-44)
- Pathways: Secretory pathway (regulated exocytosis), endocytic recycling; exact catalytic activity is not applicable (SCAMP2 is not an enzyme), and it is best described as a membrane trafficking regulator/adaptor. (hubbard2000thesecretorycarrier pages 1-2)

Limitations and next steps
- The gene symbol and organism context are unambiguous here (SCAMP2, human; UniProt O15127). However, 2023–2024 primary literature specifically interrogating human SCAMP2 was not captured in the gathered evidence. The present report therefore integrates authoritative foundational evidence and recent family-level synthesis while highlighting the need for targeted, SCAMP2-specific studies (e.g., interactome mapping, loss-of-function phenotyping, live-cell trafficking assays) to refine molecular partners and disease relevance.
