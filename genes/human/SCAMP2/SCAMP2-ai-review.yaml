description: >-
  Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2 (SCAMP2) is a tetraspanning integral
  membrane protein belonging to the SCAMP family. It functions as a regulator of membrane
  trafficking in post-Golgi recycling pathways, shuttling between the trans-Golgi network
  (TGN), recycling endosomes, and the plasma membrane. SCAMP2 directly interacts with and
  regulates the subcellular distribution and cell-surface targeting of membrane transport
  proteins including Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE5, NHE7) and the serotonin transporter (SERT).
  The protein contains cytosolic N- and C-termini with NPF repeats and proline-rich
  sequences that may mediate interactions with SH3/WW-domain proteins, and a conserved
  cytoplasmic loop between TM2-TM3 that is critical for cargo binding. SCAMP2 promotes
  surface targeting of NHE5 through an Arf6-dependent mechanism and participates in the
  redistribution of cargo proteins between recycling vesicles and the TGN.

      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. SCAMP family proteins are implicated
      in regulated exocytosis based on their localization to secretory vesicles and
      functional studies showing roles in late steps of exocytosis (PMID:9378760,
      Hubbard et al. 2000).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation to exocytosis is well-supported by the known role of SCAMP proteins
      in secretory and endocytic membrane trafficking. SCAMPs are enriched on secretory
      granules and recycling carriers, and family-level studies support roles in regulated
      exocytosis. The IBA annotation is consistent with SCAMP2's documented functions in
      post-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Does SCAMP2 have a specific molecular function term that captures its role as
      a trafficking regulator for membrane transporters, beyond generic 'protein binding'?
      Multiple studies show SCAMP2 physically interacts with and functionally regulates
      the subcellular distribution of cargo proteins, but current MF annotations are
      limited to the uninformative 'protein binding' term.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Identify the full repertoire of SCAMP2 cargo proteins beyond NHE5, NHE7, and SERT
      using proximity labeling (BioID/TurboID) followed by mass spectrometry.
      Current knowledge of SCAMP2 cargo is limited to a few transporters. A comprehensive
      cargo identification would better define its functional scope.
    hypothesis: >-
      SCAMP2 regulates trafficking of additional membrane transporters beyond the currently
      characterized NHE5, NHE7, and SERT.
  - description: >-
      Characterize the structural basis of SCAMP2-cargo interactions using cryo-EM or
      crystallography of SCAMP2 TM2-TM3 loop with cargo cytoplasmic domains.
      The TM2-TM3 loop is critical for cargo binding but the molecular details of
      recognition are unknown.
    hypothesis: >-
      The TM2-TM3 cytoplasmic loop of SCAMP2 contains a conserved binding interface
      that recognizes specific motifs in cargo protein cytoplasmic tails.
