## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P00519
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1; EC=2.7.10.2 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20357770, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28428613}; AltName: Full=Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1; AltName: Full=Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 1; AltName: Full=Proto-oncogene c-Abl; AltName: Full=p150;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ABL1; Synonyms=ABL, JTK7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Tyr protein
- **Key Domains:** ABL_SH2. (IPR035837); F-actin-binding. (IPR015015); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); Non-receptor_tyrosine_kinases. (IPR050198); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ABL1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ABL1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ABL1** (gene ID: ABL1, UniProt: P00519) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human ABL1 (UniProt P00519), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with SH3–SH2–kinase (SH1) regulatory core, an N‑terminal myristoylation site that binds a myristoyl pocket in the kinase C‑lobe, and C‑terminal F‑/G‑actin binding and nuclear trafficking signals. These features and the autoinhibition mechanism are affirmed by recent structural/biophysical work and authoritative reviews (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 18-18, wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4, sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 27-33, wang2014thecapableabl pages 1-2). The organism is Homo sapiens as required. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Domain architecture and allosteric autoinhibition: ABL1 comprises an N‑terminal myristoylated cap, SH3 and SH2 domains that assemble with the kinase domain into an autoinhibited core. Binding of the N‑myristoyl group to a hydrophobic pocket on the kinase C‑lobe promotes an SH3–SH2 “clamp” over the kinase, stabilizing an inactive state. The αI‑helix in the C‑lobe exerts force onto the SH2 domain and modulates core assembly; the E528K mutation in αI increases activity by weakening inhibitory contacts. Allosteric myristoyl‑pocket ligands (e.g., asciminib) fix the αI‑helix and favor autoinhibition (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 18-18, wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4).
- Catalytic function: ABL1 is a tyrosine kinase (EC 2.7.10.2) that phosphorylates substrate tyrosines. The kinase toggles among inactive DFG‑out, Src‑like inactive, and active DFG‑in conformations; activation loop phosphorylation stabilizes activity (wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4).
- Cellular localization signals: Multiple NLSs and one NES enable nucleocytoplasmic shuttling; a C‑terminal actin‑binding region localizes ABL1 to actin structures and embeds the NES, linking cytoplasmic localization to actin binding (sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 27-33, wang2014thecapableabl pages 1-2).

| Domain/Region | Approx. residues | Key features | Functional role | Evidence/source (citation IDs) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| N-terminal cap + myristoylation site | ~1–60 | N-myristoyl group binds deep hydrophobic pocket in kinase C-lobe (myristoyl pocket) | Triggers assembly of SH3–SH2 clamp; stabilizes autoinhibited conformation | (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 18-18) |
| SH3 domain | ~80–140 | Binds SH2–kinase linker; contains Tyr89 and RT loop critical for clamp | Part of auto-inhibitory clamp; required for asciminib-induced inhibition | (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3) |
| SH2 domain | ~150–250 | Docks on kinase C-lobe in autoinhibited state | Mediates allosteric control and substrate recognition | (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4) |
| Kinase (SH1) domain | ~260–500 | DFG motif; activation-loop Tyr phosphorylation; myristoyl pocket in C-lobe | Catalysis of tyrosine phosphorylation; adopts inactive/active conformations | (wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4) |
| αI-helix (C-lobe) | ~520–540 | Exerts force on SH2 domain; E528K hyperactivates | Modulates core assembly; asciminib reduces force to inhibit | (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17) |
| Proline-rich (PXXP) motifs | C-terminal tail | SH3-binding sites for adapters | Scaffold for signaling complexes | (siveen2018roleofnon pages 2-4) |
| F-/G-actin binding region (ABD) | C-terminal tail | Direct actin binding; includes NES | Localizes ABL1 to actin structures; enables nucleocytoplasmic shuttling | (sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 27-33, wang2014thecapableabl pages 1-2) |
| NLS (multiple) | Internal / C-terminus | Three nuclear localization signals | Nuclear import for DNA-damage response and transcriptional roles | (sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 27-33, wang2014thecapableabl pages 1-2) |

This table is useful for quick reference to ABL1 architecture and mechanisms underlying allosteric inhibition (e.g., asciminib).*

Biological roles and localization
- Actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis: ABL1 localizes to F‑actin‑rich membrane ruffles and dorsal waves and is required for normal actin lattice architecture. It regulates Rac-dependent actin remodeling by phosphorylating components of the WAVE/Abi complex and cortactin, modulating Arp2/3‑driven branching. ABL1 can also restrain Rac at dorsal ruffles via dynamin/CrkII, influencing cell spreading/migration. In membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic ABL1 modulates EGFR endocytosis through effects on Cbl and trafficking via caveolae/dorsal ruffles (sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 9-11, sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 11-14, sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 27-33).
- Nuclear DNA damage response and apoptosis/transcription: ABL1 shuttles to the nucleus after DNA damage; in an ATM–ABL–Tip60 axis, ABL1 phosphorylates Tip60 (Tyr44) and is acetylated at Lys921, while ATM phosphorylates ABL1 on Ser465—events that promote nuclear ABL1 proapoptotic functions. Nuclear ABL1 can phosphorylate RNAPII CTD Tyr1, linking to transcriptional control (wang2014thecapableabl pages 4-5, wang2014thecapableabl pages 5-6).
- Neuronal/synaptic functions: Reviews synthesize roles for ABL1 in synaptic remodeling, dendritic spine dynamics, and neurodegeneration, with ABL1 positioned at the crossroads of healthy plasticity and neurodegenerative signaling when dysregulated (vysochinskaya2024advancementsandfuture pages 5-7).

Substrate specificity and validated substrates (recent)
- FOXM1: ABL1 directly binds and phosphorylates FOXM1 at several tyrosines (Y129, Y317, Y362, Y575); phosphorylation at Y575 is indispensable for FOXM1 stability by blocking APC/C–CDH1-mediated degradation, thus promoting FOXM1-dependent tumorigenicity. Imatinib reduces FOXM1 tyrosine phosphorylation; ABL1 kinase-dead fails to phosphorylate FOXM1 (Cell Death Differ., 2024) (dong2024abl1mediatedphosphorylationpromotes pages 3-5). 
- Smad4 (TGF‑β pathway): In BCR::ABL1-positive leukemia and with cellular ABL1, tyrosine phosphorylation of Smad4 at Y195/Y301/Y322 disrupts binding to p300/CBP, suppressing TGF‑β antiproliferative signaling; imatinib prevents Smad4 Tyr phosphorylation and restores TGF‑β responses (Signal Transduct Target Ther., 2023) (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 7-8).
- Emerging: ABL1 phosphorylates ATP6V1B2 at Y68, promoting V‑ATPase V1 assembly with V0, maintaining lysosomal acidification and autophagic/mitophagic competence under starvation; ABL1 inhibition impairs lysosomal acidification (Autophagy, 2025 Jan) (dong2024abl1mediatedphosphorylationpromotes pages 3-5).

Pathways and mechanisms
- Cytoplasmic signaling: ABL1 integrates signals downstream of SFKs/RTKs to regulate Rac–JNK and ERK pathways, impacting proliferation, invasion, and actin dynamics; F‑actin also feeds back to allosterically inhibit ABL1 kinase activity (sirvent2008cytoplasmicsignallingby pages 11-14, wang2014thecapableabl pages 4-5).
- Nuclear programs: DNA damage signaling with ATM/Tip60 engages nuclear ABL1 to induce cytostatic/apoptotic transcriptional programs; RNAPII CTD phosphorylation links ABL1 to transcriptional control (wang2014thecapableabl pages 4-5, wang2014thecapableabl pages 5-6).
- Autophagy/lysosome: ABL1’s phosphorylation of ATP6V1B2 reveals a role in controlling V‑ATPase assembly, lysosomal pH, and autophagic flux (dong2024abl1mediatedphosphorylationpromotes pages 3-5).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Regulation by αI‑helix and autoinhibition: 2024 eLife work dissects how the ABL αI‑helix transmits mechanical force that correlates with kinase activity and how asciminib reduces this force to fix the autoinhibited state; ABL1 E528K (linked to developmental disorder) hyperactivates by breaking a stabilizing salt bridge (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17).
- Allosteric inhibition and PROTAC strategies: Reviews summarize asciminib’s myristoyl-pocket (STAMP) mechanism and emerging BCR::ABL1 degraders (PROTACs) designed to overcome resistance, including approaches targeting T315I and non‑catalytic functions (Leukemia, 2024) (cruzrodriguez2024bcrabl1proteolysistargetingchimeras pages 12-13).
- Isoform-specific resistance to asciminib: BCR::ABL1 e13a3/e14a3 isoforms (lacking ABL1 exon 2 that encodes SH3 β1/RT-loop features) are intrinsically resistant to asciminib (GC50 >5 μM) while remaining sensitive to ATP-site inhibitors like dasatinib; mechanistically, loss of SH3-dependent clamp formation prevents asciminib-mediated autoinhibition (Leukemia, 2024) (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3).
- Real-world selection under asciminib: In a UK managed-access cohort (n=49), 66% achieved CCyR or better on asciminib; prior or baseline non‑T315I BCR::ABL1 single-nucleotide variants were associated with poorer response, and serial NGS showed clonal expansion of some variants under selective pressure, sometimes mitigated by dose intensification (Leukemia, 2024) (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Frontline phase 3 ASC4FIRST (NEJM 2024): In newly diagnosed CML‑CP, asciminib achieved higher week‑48 MMR than investigator‑selected TKIs (67.7% vs 49.0%) and notably higher than imatinib within its stratum (69.3% vs 40.2%); time to MMR and to BCR::ABL1 ≤1% IS was shorter; DMR (≤0.01%) was 34.0% vs 15.9%. Grade ≥3 AEs and discontinuations were less frequent with asciminib than with imatinib/second‑generation TKIs in this study (NEJM online Sep 19, 2024; doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2400858) (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 7-8, hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5).
- Special population (T315I): In a 2‑year follow‑up of asciminib 200 mg BID for T315I‑mutated CML‑CP after ≥1 TKI, BCR::ABL1IS ≤1% was achieved in 62.2% of evaluable patients; MMR in 48.9% overall (34.6% ponatinib-pretreated vs 68.4% ponatinib-naïve), with durable responses; most common ≥G3 AEs included lipase increase (18.8%) and thrombocytopenia (14.6%) (Leukemia, May 2024; doi:10.1038/s41375-024-02278-8) (cortes2024asciminibmonotherapyin pages 4-5).
- Clinical pharmacology (label‑relevant): Absolute bioavailability ≈73%; t1/2 ≈7–15 h; highly protein‑bound (~97%); primary clearance via hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) and glucuronidation (UGT2B7/UGT2B17) with biliary secretion via BCRP; food (especially high-fat) reduces exposure; exposure–efficacy modeling indicates higher exposure is needed in T315I vs non‑T315I; no clinically relevant QT effect; predicted weak CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibition at common/higher doses (Clin Pharmacokinet., Oct 2024; doi:10.1007/s40262-024-01428-6) (hoch2024clinicalpharmacologyof pages 1-2, hoch2024clinicalpharmacologyof pages 10-11, hoch2024clinicalpharmacologyof pages 16-16).
- Clinical management context: Contemporary CML guidance emphasizes comparable survival with imatinib vs second‑generation TKIs in frontline CML‑CP, earlier DMR with second‑generation agents for TFR, and use of ponatinib first for true second‑generation‑resistant or T315I disease, with asciminib as a third‑generation option with a favorable toxicity profile but lesser T315I activity at standard dosing (Blood Cancer J., 2023) (wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4).

Resistance mechanisms and expert analysis (selected 2023–2024)
- Isoform/mutation contexts: Asciminib requires an intact ABL1 SH3–SH2–KD clamp for allosteric inhibition; exon‑2–deleted a3 isoforms abrogate this dependency (Leukemia, 2024) (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3). Real‑world observations suggest asciminib can select for or against specific SNVs, with some variants (e.g., F317L, F359I) associated with resistance, while dose intensification or combination strategies may retain efficacy in others (Leukemia, 2024) (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic basis of allostery: Structural work clarifies that asciminib stabilizes the myristoyl‑pocket/αI‑helix interactions to promote autoinhibition, rationalizing both its unique safety/targeting profile and resistance hotspots in or near the myristoyl pocket (paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 16-17, paladini2024themolecularbasis pages 18-18, hoch2024clinicalpharmacologyof pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic innovation: PROTAC concepts to degrade BCR::ABL1 and dual‑site inhibition (myristoyl pocket + ATP site) are under active investigation to address compound resistance and non‑catalytic roles (Leukemia, 2024) (cruzrodriguez2024bcrabl1proteolysistargetingchimeras pages 12-13).

Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- ASC4FIRST: Week‑48 MMR 67.7% asciminib vs 49.0% investigator‑selected TKI; vs imatinib 69.3% vs 40.2%; DMR ≤0.01% 34.0% vs 15.9%; fewer grade ≥3 AEs and discontinuations vs imatinib/2G TKIs (NEJM 2024) (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 7-8, hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5). 
- T315I cohort: BCR::ABL1IS ≤1% in 62.2% evaluable; MMR 48.9% overall; ≥G3 lipase increase 18.8%, thrombocytopenia 14.6% (Leukemia 2024) (cortes2024asciminibmonotherapyin pages 4-5).
- Real-world managed access: 66% CCyR or better; 12% discontinued for intolerance; baseline SNVs predicted poorer response (Leukemia 2024) (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3).

Selected trials and ongoing implementations (NCT identifiers)
- Phase 3 frontline asciminib vs investigator-selected TKIs: ASC4FIRST, NCT04971226, active/not recruiting (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5, hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 7-8).

- Phase 3 tolerability/efficacy of asciminib vs nilotinib in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML‑CP: NCT05456191, active/not recruiting (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5).
- Phase 3 optimization in ≥3rd line CML‑CP: NCT04948333, active/not recruiting (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5).
- Additional prospective/phase 2/4 real‑world and consolidation/TFR studies include NCT05413915, NCT06092879, NCT06236724, NCT06427811 (statuses per listings) (hochhaus2024asciminibinnewly pages 4-5).

Expert opinions and guidance
- A 2023 consensus review (Kantarjian et al. and colleagues) highlights practical endpoints and dosing flexibility, sequencing by mutation status (e.g., T315I), and positions asciminib as a third‑generation agent with a favorable safety profile and distinct mechanism that may be combined rationally with ATP‑competitive TKIs (Blood Cancer Journal, 2023) (wu2024clinicalinsightsinto pages 2-4).

Synthesis: function and pathway role of ABL1
- ABL1 is a modular, allosterically regulated tyrosine kinase that integrates cytoskeletal cues and growth factor signals to remodel actin, regulate endocytosis, and propagate proliferative programs from the cytoplasm, while in the nucleus it couples DNA damage checkpoints and transcriptional control to apoptosis. These context‑dependent outputs reflect its subcellular localization and its ability to phosphorylate substrates spanning cytoskeletal regulators (Abi/WAVE/cortactin), transcriptional modules (RNAPII CTD, Tip60, FOXM1), TGF‑β pathway transducers (Smad4), and lysosomal machinery (ATP6V1B2). Its autoinhibitory myristoyl‑pocket mechanism underlies both physiological control and the clinical success of allosteric inhibition with asciminib, including new frontline data. The same mechanism explains asciminib resistance for ABL1 exon‑2–deleted BCR::ABL1 isoforms that cannot assemble the SH3–SH2–kinase clamp.

Limitations and open questions
- While multiple nuclear substrates/mechanisms are mapped, the full scope of transcriptional control by ABL1 and its interplay with chromatin remains active research. Autophagy/lysosome regulation by ABL1 has recent mechanistic support, but disease‑specific roles and therapeutic leverage require more investigation (dong2024abl1mediatedphosphorylationpromotes pages 3-5). Real‑world resistance evolution under myristoyl‑pocket pressure requires ongoing molecular monitoring (leske2024thee13a3(b2a3) pages 2-3).
