description: >-
  ABL1 (Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1, EC 2.7.10.2) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with
  critical roles in cytoskeleton remodeling, DNA damage response, and cell signaling. The
  protein contains an N-terminal cap with myristoylation site, SH3 and SH2 domains that form
  an autoinhibitory clamp with the kinase domain, and a C-terminal F-actin binding region.
  ABL1 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm; nuclear ABL1 mediates DNA damage response
  and apoptosis, while cytoplasmic ABL1 regulates actin dynamics and receptor signaling.
  Key substrates include DNA repair proteins (RAD51, RAD52, WRN), cytoskeletal regulators
  (WAVE complex, cortactin), and transcriptional regulators (TP73, YAP1). BCR-ABL1 fusion
  resulting from t(9;22) translocation drives chronic myeloid leukemia.
