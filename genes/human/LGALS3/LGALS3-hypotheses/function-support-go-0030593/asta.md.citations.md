**Query:** # Literature evidence for LGALS3 (Homo sapiens): LGALS3 has neutrophil chemotaxis (GO:0030593).

Gene/protein: LGALS3. Organism: Homo sapiens (NCBITaxon:9606).
Claim to support or refute with independent experimental literature: LGALS3 has neutrophil chemotaxis (GO:0030593).
Key context:
- Term: neutrophil chemotaxis (GO:0030593)
- Existing evidence type: IBA
- Original reference: GO_REF:0000033

Retrieve primary experimental papers that directly test this claim for
LGALS3 (or a well-supported ortholog): assays, mutant phenotypes,
localisation, interactions, or structures.

## How to use this prompt

You are searching for **independent literature support for the single
gene-function hypothesis stated above**. The hypothesis is a plain claim that a
gene product has a particular molecular function, biological role, or cellular
location. Find primary (or well-justified orthologous) evidence that **confirms
or refutes** that claim for this specific gene.

This is a recall-oriented search: surface every plausible piece of supporting
evidence, but make each candidate **independently checkable** so a downstream
curator or agent can filter false positives. This is not a general gene
overview, and any prior curation decision shown in the context is intentionally
neutralised — judge the hypothesis on the external evidence, not on the existing
annotation.

A common use of this template is confirming annotations that currently rest only
on phylogenetic inference (evidence code IBA, propagated from PANTHER
`GO_REF:0000033`), but it applies to any gene-function hypothesis.

## Research Objective

Find the strongest available **independent** evidence bearing on whether the
hypothesis is true for LGALS3. Prioritise, in order:

1. Direct experimental evidence in LGALS3 itself (the named gene in the
   named organism): assays, mutant phenotypes, localisation, interactions,
   structures.
2. Direct experimental evidence in a clearly orthologous gene, where the
   orthology is well established and the function is expected to be conserved.
3. Strong indirect or computational evidence (domain architecture, conserved
   motifs, structural homology, operon/pathway context), reported
   conservatively.

Prefer **PMID** citations; include **DOI** citations when no PMID is available.
Treat reviews and database records as orientation only — cite the underlying
primary papers wherever possible.

**Expect false positives.** This pipeline is tuned for recall, so a downstream
curator/agent will sift your results. For every candidate you must therefore
provide an **exact verbatim snippet** from the source that can be checked, plus
enough context (organism, assay, gene actually studied) to detect paralog
confusion, wrong-organism carry-over, or claims that are really about a
different gene.

## Required Output

### Executive Judgment

State whether independent support exists: **supported** (with strong primary
evidence), **partially / indirectly supported**, **unresolved** (no independent
evidence found), or **refuted**. One short paragraph; lead with the verdict.

### Evidence Matrix

A table with one row per candidate evidence item:

- Citation (PMID preferred; DOI otherwise)
- Gene/protein actually studied (and organism) — flag if it is an ortholog or a paralog
- Evidence type (direct assay, mutant phenotype, localization, interaction, structural/evolutionary, computational, review/database)
- Supports / refutes / qualifies
- Exact verbatim snippet to verify (quote the source)
- Key finding in your own words
- Confidence and the most important caveat (false-positive risk)

### Best Supporting References

List the 1–3 references most suitable to add to the review's `supported_by`
for this hypothesis, each with the exact snippet a curator should confirm. If
none qualify, say so explicitly.

### Conflicts and Alternatives

Note any evidence that contradicts the hypothesis or that points to paralog
confusion, organism-specific differences, isoform-specific findings, or
database carry-over.

### Knowledge Gaps

If no adequate independent evidence exists, state what was searched, why the gap
matters, and what evidence or experiment would resolve it.
