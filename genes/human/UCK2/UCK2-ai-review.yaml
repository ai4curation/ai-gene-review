description: 'Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) is a cytosolic pyrimidine ribonucleoside
  kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective
  monophosphates (UMP and CMP) using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors. UCK2 is a key
  enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, essential for nucleotide metabolism and
  RNA/DNA synthesis. The enzyme functions as a homotetramer and exhibits substrate
  specificity for ribonucleosides, not deoxyribonucleosides. UCK2 also activates
  cytotoxic nucleoside analogs used in cancer chemotherapy. Expression is tissue-specific,
  with high levels in placenta and various cancers.'

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation correctly places UCK2 in the cytoplasm. Multiple lines
      of evidence confirm cytoplasmic localization, including Reactome annotation
      as cytosolic enzyme and experimental data showing cytosol localization in transfected
      cells.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Consistent with experimental evidence from multiple sources confirming
      cytoplasmic/cytosolic localization. UniProt CC line states function occurs in
      cytoplasm, Reactome describes enzyme as cytosolic, and direct fluorescence microscopy
      shows cytosol localization.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for uridine kinase activity is well-supported. UCK2 catalyzes
      phosphorylation of uridine to UMP using ATP. This is one of the two core catalytic
      activities of UCK2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents a core molecular function of UCK2, supported by direct
      experimental evidence and multiple independent studies. UniProt catalytic activity

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for CMP biosynthetic process based on logical inference
      from cytidine kinase activity. While technically correct (UCK2 does synthesize
      CMP from cytidine), this term is overly general as it does not distinguish
      between de novo and salvage pathways. The more specific term GO:0044211 (CTP
      salvage) better captures UCK2's specific role in the salvage pathway.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term is too general and does not accurately reflect that UCK2 functions
      specifically in the salvage pathway, not de novo biosynthesis. UCK2 catalyzes
      cytidine + ATP to CMP + ADP, which is the first step of CTP salvage. The annotation
      should use GO:0044211 (CTP salvage) which is already present with IDA evidence.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: This annotation appears to be a computational transfer from orthologs
      and is likely spurious for UCK2. There is no literature evidence connecting
      UCK2 to feeding behavior, and this seems implausible for a cytosolic nucleoside
      kinase involved in nucleotide metabolism.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: No supporting evidence for UCK2 involvement in feeding behavior. This
      appears to be an incorrect orthology-based inference. The deep research and
      all publications focus on nucleotide metabolism, cancer biology, and drug activation,
      with no mention of feeding behavior. Likely a false positive from automated
      annotation transfer.

    label: response to axon injury
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on automated ortholog transfer. While UCK2 is
      expressed in neural tissues and has been studied in neuroblastoma, there is
      no direct evidence linking it to axon injury response. This may be an overly
      specific inference from expression data.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: No direct experimental evidence in the available literature for UCK2 role
      in axon injury response. The neuroblastoma study focuses on UCK2 role in pyrimidine
      metabolism and drug sensitivity, not axon injury. Would need access to the original
      ortholog study (GO_REF:0000107) to evaluate this claim properly.

    summary: This annotation comes from automated ortholog transfer. There is no direct
      evidence in the available literature connecting UCK2 to oxygen level response.
      While UCK2 is overexpressed in various cancers which may involve hypoxic conditions,
      this is not the same as having a specific role in oxygen level response.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: No direct experimental evidence in available publications for UCK2 role
      in cellular response to oxygen levels. Would need to access the original reference
      and any supporting ortholog data to properly evaluate this annotation. The cancer
      association does not necessarily imply a direct oxygen response function.

      This is fully consistent with crystallographic data showing UCK2 functions
      as a homotetramer in its active form.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UCK2 forms homotetramers, which necessarily involves identical protein
      binding. This is strongly supported by X-ray crystallographic structures (PDB
      entries 1UDW, 1UEI, 1UEJ, 1UFQ, etc.) showing the tetrameric assembly and the
