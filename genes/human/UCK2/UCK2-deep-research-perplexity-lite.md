## Question

Research the UCK2 (UCK2) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

**Uridine-Cytidine Kinase 2 (UCK2)** is a human gene encoding a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, with important roles in nucleotide metabolism, cancer biology, and cellular signaling.

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  UCK2 encodes a **pyrimidine ribonucleoside kinase** that catalyzes the phosphorylation of **uridine and cytidine** to **uridine monophosphate (UMP)** and **cytidine monophosphate (CMP)**, respectively, using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors[1][5][8][10].  
  - **Enzyme Commission (EC) number:** 2.7.1.48[1][5].
  - **Gene Ontology (GO) annotations:** Cytidine kinase activity, uridine kinase activity, and identical protein binding activity[11].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  UCK2 is central to the **pyrimidine salvage pathway**, which recycles nucleosides for RNA and DNA synthesis[1][2][3][8].  
  - Involved in **CTP salvage** and **UMP salvage**[11].
  - Plays a role in **ribosomal biogenesis** and cellular response to nucleolar stress[2][3].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  UCK2 is primarily **cytoplasmic**[5].  
  - Expression is **tissue-specific**: highly expressed in **placenta** and **various cancers**, but not in most normal adult tissues[2][3][7].

---

### 2. Protein Domains and Structure

- **Structural Features:**  
  UCK2 is a **tetramer** (~112 kDa total)[3].  
  - Each monomer contains:
    - A **five-stranded parallel β-sheet** (core)
    - **Five α-helices**
    - A **large β-hairpin loop** forming a deep substrate binding pocket[2][3]
  - **Active site residues:**  
    - **Asp-62**: Catalytic activity, deprotonates the 5’-hydroxyl group of the substrate[3].
    - **His117 and Tyr112**: Determine nucleoside binding specificity via hydrogen bonds[2].
  - **Substrate specificity:**  
    - UCK2 is specific for **ribonucleosides** (uridine, cytidine), not 2’-deoxyribonucleosides[3].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Protein-Protein Interactions:**  
  - UCK2 interacts with **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**, blocking EGF-induced EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby activating the **EGFR-AKT signaling pathway**[2].
  - UCK2 inhibition leads to **nucleolar stress**, releasing ribosomal proteins that bind **MDM2**, blocking p53 ubiquitination and activating p53-mediated apoptosis[2][3].

- **Pathways:**  
  - **Nucleotide salvage**
  - **Fluoropyrimidine activity** (activation of nucleoside analog drugs)[1][3]

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Cancer:**  
  - **Overexpression** of UCK2 is observed in multiple cancers, including:
    - **Lung cancer** (especially small cell lung carcinoma)[1][4]
    - **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**[1][2][4]
    - **Esophageal, liver, pancreatic, gastric, renal, nasopharyngeal, colorectal cancers, and pediatric T-cell acute lymphatic leukemia**[4]
  - **Prognostic marker:** High UCK2 expression correlates with **poor prognosis** and **reduced survival rates** in several cancers[4].
  - **Functional role:** Promotes **cell proliferation**, **migration**, and **metastasis** via activation of oncogenic pathways (e.g., **STAT3**, **MMP2**, **MMP9**)[3][4].
  - **Therapeutic target:** UCK2 is being explored as a target for anti-cancer therapies, either by inhibiting its activity or exploiting its role in activating nucleoside analog drugs[2][3].

- **Other Associations:**  
  - An allele of UCK2 may play a role in **nonhumoral immunity** to *Haemophilus influenzae* type B[3].

### 5. Recent Developments and Latest Research (2022–2024)

- **Non-metabolic roles:**  
  - UCK2 has **non-metabolic functions** in tumor progression, such as interacting with EGFR and modulating signaling pathways[2].
  - UCK2 can generate **circular RNAs** with potential tumor-suppressive roles[2].

- **Biomarker potential:**  
  - UCK2 is being investigated as an **early diagnostic and prognostic biomarker** for lung cancer and other malignancies[4].

- **Therapeutic implications:**  
  - Inhibition of UCK2 can induce **nucleolar stress** and **p53-mediated apoptosis** in cancer cells, suggesting a strategy for cancer therapy[2][3].

---

### 6. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Sequence identity:**  
  - UCK2 shares **72% sequence identity** with UCK1[2][3].
  - **Catalytic efficiency:** UCK2 is **15–20 times higher** than UCK1[2].
- **Genomic location:**  
  - Chromosome **1q22-23.2** (positions 165,827,586–165,911,618, forward strand)[4][9].

**Summary:**  
UCK2 is a cytoplasmic kinase essential for pyrimidine salvage, with a unique structure and high catalytic efficiency. It is overexpressed in many cancers, where it promotes tumor progression through both metabolic and non-metabolic mechanisms, making it a promising biomarker and therapeutic target[1][2][3][4][5].
