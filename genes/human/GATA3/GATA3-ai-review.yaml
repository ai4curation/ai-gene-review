description: GATA3 is a zinc finger transcription factor that serves as the 
  master regulator of T-helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation and a key regulator 
  of T cell development, epithelial differentiation, and neuronal development. 
  It binds DNA via two zinc finger domains at WGATAR consensus sequences and 
  functions as a pioneer transcription factor capable of remodeling chromatin.

    review:
      summary: GATA3 binds specific DNA sequences at cis-regulatory regions 
        through its zinc finger domains, recognizing WGATAR consensus motifs. 
        This is well-supported by experimental evidence showing GATA3 binding to
        promoters and enhancers of target genes like IL4, IL5, IL13, and TCR 
        genes.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately captures GATA3's core molecular 
        function. The IBA annotation is consistent with extensive experimental 
        evidence showing GATA3 binds to cis-regulatory elements with the WGATAR 
        consensus sequence. This is a fundamental aspect of GATA3's 
        transcription factor activity.

    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: GATA3 functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription 
        factor that regulates RNA polymerase II transcription. It can both 
        activate and repress transcription of target genes, with well-documented
        roles in activating Th2 cytokine genes and repressing Th1 genes like 
        IFN-gamma.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function of GATA3, strongly supported by 
        phylogenetic inference and consistent with extensive experimental 
        evidence. GATA3 directly regulates transcription by RNA polymerase II 
        through DNA binding and recruitment of coactivators or corepressors.

      reason: While GATA3 is required for embryonic development (GATA3 knockout

      summary: Essential molecular function of GATA3 as a pioneer transcription 
        factor that directly binds chromatin at GATA motifs
      action: NEW
      reason: GATA3 is a sequence-specific transcription factor that directly 
        binds chromatin through its C-terminal zinc finger domain, recognizing 
        WGATAR consensus motifs in target gene regulatory regions. As a pioneer 
        transcription factor, GATA3 can bind DNA motifs even when wrapped in 
        nucleosomes without disrupting core histones, enabling it to access and 
        modify chromatin structure. This chromatin binding activity is 
        fundamental to GATA3's mechanism of transcriptional regulation and its 
        ability to establish lineage-specific gene expression programs.

          supporting_text: GATA3 has the capacity to bind DNA motifs that are 
            wrapped in nucleosomes and recruit chromatin-remodeling complexes to

            fingers can bind their 5′-GAT-3′ target sites even when those sites 
            lie on the nucleosome surface without disrupting core histones.

        supporting_text: GATA3 also acts as a 'pioneer' transcription factor, 
          meaning it can engage chromatin in its native (nucleosomal) state and 
          initiate chromatin remodeling. GATA3 has the capacity to bind DNA 
          motifs that are wrapped in nucleosomes and recruit 
          chromatin-remodeling complexes to establish new enhancers.

          maintained through positive autoregulatory feedback

          cytokines like interleukin-4 (IL-4) (via the STAT6 transcription 
          factor) and IL-2 (via STAT5) induce GATA3 expression. Once induced, 
          GATA3 can maintain its own expression in a positive feedback manner

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: pioneer transcription factor activity
    proposed_definition: The activity of a transcription factor that can bind to
      nucleosomal DNA in chromatin and initiate chromatin remodeling to 
      establish accessible regulatory regions
    justification: GATA3's pioneer function is well-established but not captured
      by existing GO terms. This function is distinct from regular DNA-binding 
      transcription factor activity and represents a key mechanistic difference 
      in how some transcription factors operate in chromatin contexts.

      - reference_id: PMID:23818516
        supporting_text: GATA-3 functions as a pioneer transcription factor that
          binds nucleosomal DNA
  - proposed_name: Th1/Th2 lineage decision regulation
    proposed_definition: The process by which transcription factors coordinate 
      the mutually exclusive development of T-helper 1 versus T-helper 2 cell 
      fates through competitive binding and mutual antagonism
    justification: The mutual antagonism between GATA3 and T-bet represents a 
      fundamental mechanism in cell fate decisions that lacks a specific GO 
      term. This cross-regulatory mechanism is critical for proper immune system
      development.

      corepressors, and chromatin modifiers using proximity labeling (BioID) and

      cell types and developmental stages
