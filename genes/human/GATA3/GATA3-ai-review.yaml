description: GATA3 is a zinc finger transcription factor that serves as the master
  regulator of T-helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation and a key regulator of T cell
  development, epithelial differentiation, and neuronal development. It binds DNA
  via two zinc finger domains at WGATAR consensus sequences and functions as a pioneer
  transcription factor capable of remodeling chromatin.

    label: RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: GATA3 binds specific DNA sequences at cis-regulatory regions through
      its zinc finger domains, recognizing WGATAR consensus motifs. This is well-supported
      by experimental evidence showing GATA3 binding to promoters and enhancers of
      target genes like IL4, IL5, IL13, and TCR genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures GATA3's core molecular function. The
      IBA annotation is consistent with extensive experimental evidence showing GATA3
      binds to cis-regulatory elements with the WGATAR consensus sequence. This is
      a fundamental aspect of GATA3's transcription factor activity.

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: GATA3 functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor
      that regulates RNA polymerase II transcription. It can both activate and repress
      transcription of target genes, with well-documented roles in activating Th2
      cytokine genes and repressing Th1 genes like IFN-gamma.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of GATA3, strongly supported by phylogenetic
      inference and consistent with extensive experimental evidence. GATA3 directly
      regulates transcription by RNA polymerase II through DNA binding and recruitment
      of coactivators or corepressors.

      The more specific terms for sequence-specific DNA binding (GO:0000978) better

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While GATA3 is required for embryonic development (GATA3 knockout is embryonic

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While GATA3 is involved in nervous system development, particularly sympathetic

  review:
    summary: GATA3 physically interacts with T-bet in a functionally important antagonistic
      relationship for Th1/Th2 fate decisions.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the protein interaction is real and functionally critical, "protein
      binding" is too generic. This paper specifically shows GATA3-T-bet interaction
      that controls cell fate. Should use more specific terms for transcription factor
      interactions.

    summary: Essential molecular function of GATA3 as a pioneer transcription factor that directly binds chromatin at GATA motifs
    action: NEW
    reason: GATA3 is a sequence-specific transcription factor that directly binds chromatin through its C-terminal zinc finger domain, recognizing WGATAR consensus motifs in target gene regulatory regions. As a pioneer transcription factor, GATA3 can bind DNA motifs even when wrapped in nucleosomes without disrupting core histones, enabling it to access and modify chromatin structure. This chromatin binding activity is fundamental to GATA3's mechanism of transcriptional regulation and its ability to establish lineage-specific gene expression programs.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: GATA3-deep-research.md
      supporting_text: "GATA3 has the capacity to bind DNA motifs that are wrapped in nucleosomes and recruit chromatin-remodeling complexes to establish new enhancers. Structural studies show that GATA3's zinc fingers can bind their 5′-GAT-3′ target sites even when those sites lie on the nucleosome surface without disrupting core histones."

  findings:
  - statement: GATA3 functions as a pioneer transcription factor capable of binding
      to nucleosomal DNA and initiating chromatin remodeling
    supporting_text: GATA3 also acts as a 'pioneer' transcription factor, meaning
      it can engage chromatin in its native (nucleosomal) state and initiate chromatin
      remodeling. GATA3 has the capacity to bind DNA motifs that are wrapped in nucleosomes
      and recruit chromatin-remodeling complexes to establish new enhancers.
  - statement: GATA3 expression is regulated by IL-4/STAT6 signaling and maintained
      through positive autoregulatory feedback
    supporting_text: Upon antigen stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells, cytokines like
      interleukin-4 (IL-4) (via the STAT6 transcription factor) and IL-2 (via STAT5)
      induce GATA3 expression. Once induced, GATA3 can maintain its own expression
      in a positive feedback manner that is independent of continued cytokine stimulation.
  - statement: The GATA3-AS1 lncRNA is required for establishing permissive chromatin
      at the GATA3 locus through MLL complex recruitment
    supporting_text: GATA3-AS1 is required to establish a chromatin environment permissive
      for GATA3 transcription. It recruits histone modification enzymes (such as the
      MLL complex for H3K4 methylation) and forms an R-loop structure at the GATA3
      locus.
