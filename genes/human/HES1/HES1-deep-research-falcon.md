## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q14469
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Transcription factor HES-1; AltName: Full=Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 39; Short=bHLHb39; AltName: Full=Hairy and enhancer of split 1; AltName: Full=Hairy homolog; AltName: Full=Hairy-like protein; Short=hHL;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HES1; Synonyms=BHLHB39, HL, HRY;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** bHLH_dom. (IPR011598); HES_HEY. (IPR050370); HLH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036638); Orange_dom. (IPR003650); Hairy_orange (PF07527)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HES1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HES1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HES1** (gene ID: HES1, UniProt: Q14469) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human HES1 (UniProt: Q14469)

Executive verification of target identity
- Gene/protein: HES1 (Hairy and enhancer of split-1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor in human. Protein architecture includes an N‑terminal bHLH domain (basic DNA-binding region plus HLH dimerization), a central Orange domain (partner selectivity), and a C‑terminal WRPW tetrapeptide that recruits TLE/Groucho corepressors; length ≈280 amino acids (~29.4 kDa) (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624, July 2025) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).
- Organism: Homo sapiens. All evidence below is consistent with human HES1 or directly relevant conserved mechanisms.

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular function and DNA recognition: HES1 is a transcriptional repressor that binds DNA as homo- or heterodimers, preferring N‑box (CACNAG) and class C (CACGCG) motifs. The WRPW motif engages TLE/Groucho family corepressors, enabling chromatin repression, frequently with HDACs. HES1 can also recruit SIRT1 for TLE-independent deacetylation and can inhibit transcription elongation by attenuating P‑TEFb/Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).
- Mechanism of Notch-dependent activation: Canonical Notch ligand binding triggers ADAM/γ‑secretase cleavage of the receptor, releasing NICD, which translocates to the nucleus and binds CSL, recruiting MAML co-activators to activate hes1 transcription (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 4-5, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4).
- Core features as an oscillator: HES1 binds its own promoter to generate negative feedback and ultradian oscillations. These dynamics coordinate progenitor maintenance and differentiation programs in development (reviewed; primary dynamics summarized below) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.30.586691) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 4-5, azhar2024unravellingdifferentialhes1 pages 1-4).
- Subcellular localization: HES1 functions as a nuclear DNA-binding transcriptional repressor; its regulatory roles and domain architecture are defined in the context of nuclear transcription (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Intestinal homeostasis via HES1 oscillation periods (2024): Using a Hes1-Achilles knock-in reporter with intravital imaging/organoids, NOTCH-driven HES1 oscillations were shown to pattern fate decisions along the crypt–villus axis. Oscillation period encodes fate: ~90-minute oscillations promote Paneth cells; ~130-minute oscillations bias other secretory subtypes; low-period oscillations support stemness and proliferation (preprint, Aug 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609553) (weterings2024notchdrivenoscillationscontrol pages 1-5).
- Differential HES1 dynamics during axis elongation (2024): Single-cell tracking of an endogenously tagged Hes1 reporter in mouse embryos showed synchronized, high-amplitude oscillations in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) versus low-amplitude oscillations in the preneural tube (pre‑NT); Notch inhibition perturbed dynamics in tissue-specific ways (preprint, Apr 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.30.586691) (azhar2024unravellingdifferentialhes1 pages 1-4).
- Immuno-oncology (2024): Myeloid cell–specific deletion of Hes1 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) reduced tumor growth, lowered Arg1 (a T‑cell-suppressive enzyme), increased intratumoral cytotoxic T‑cell infiltration/activation, and enhanced response to anti‑PD‑1 therapy in vivo (Dec 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40164-024-00588-2) (kim2024disruptingnotchsignaling pages 1-2).
- Post-translational crosstalk via HEY1–HES1 heterodimerization and SUMOylation (2024): In endothelium, HEY1 SUMOylation by TRIM28 promotes HEY1 homodimers with high‑fidelity E‑box binding and repression of angiogenic RTK programs. DeSUMOylation (e.g., by VEGF/hypoxia) favors HEY1–HES1 heterodimerization, shifts DNA motif preference, weakens DNA binding, and relieves repression—demonstrating functional interplay with HES1 (Jan 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323398) (ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 1-3, ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 13-15).

3) Function, processes, localization, and pathways
- Transcriptional repression and co-repressors: HES1 represses target genes by (i) N‑box/class C motif binding as dimers; (ii) recruiting TLE/Groucho co-repressors via WRPW (often with HDACs); (iii) TLE-independent SIRT1 recruitment; and (iv) interfering with elongation (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).
- Pathway position: HES1 is a canonical downstream effector of NOTCH signaling (NICD–CSL–MAML → HES1 transcription). It integrates inputs from other pathways (e.g., Hedgehog/Gli, Wnt/β‑catenin, ERK/AKT), underscoring crosstalk at the level of hes1 promoter activation and target gene networks (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 4-5, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4).
- Developmental dynamics and roles:
  - Intestine: HES1 oscillation periods encode lineage bias and maintain the absorptive–secretory balance; NOTCH activation suppresses secretory differentiation, while loss of HES1 skews toward secretory lineages (Aug 2024 preprint) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609553) (weterings2024notchdrivenoscillationscontrol pages 1-5).
  - Somite segmentation and neurogenesis: HES1/Hes-family oscillators coordinate segmentation clock and neurogenic timing; tissue-specific dynamics revealed by single-cell live imaging (Apr 2024 preprint) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.30.586691) (azhar2024unravellingdifferentialhes1 pages 1-4), and reviewed (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 4-5).
- Nuclear site of action: HES1 functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Comprehensive mechanistic review (2025): A state-of-the-art review synthesizes HES1 structure (bHLH/Orange/WRPW), repression mechanisms (TLE/Groucho via WRPW; SIRT1; elongation control), oscillatory regulation, pathway crosstalk (JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/β‑catenin), developmental roles, and oncologic relevance, while emphasizing the need for large-sample validation of HES1 as an independent biomarker and integrated multi-omics to resolve tumor/immune functions (Frontiers in Immunology, July 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 15-16).
- Preclinical immuno-oncology insight (2024): Targeting HES1 in myeloid compartments (TAMs) reprograms the TME and augments checkpoint blockade, supporting HES1 as an immunomodulatory node downstream of NOTCH (Experimental Hematology & Oncology, Dec 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40164-024-00588-2) (kim2024disruptingnotchsignaling pages 1-2).
- Vascular signaling plasticity (2024): Endothelial HEY1 SUMOylation and context-dependent HEY1–HES1 heterodimerization reveal a dynamic post-translational layer integrating angiogenic stimuli with NOTCH effector function (Circulation Research, Jan 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323398) (ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 1-3, ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 13-15).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Intestinal oscillation periods: In vivo/in vitro analyses mapped distinct HES1 periods associated with fate bias—~90 min promoting Paneth cells; ~130 min increasing other secretory subtypes; shorter periods supporting stemness/proliferation (preprint, 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609553) (weterings2024notchdrivenoscillationscontrol pages 1-5).
- TAM-targeted Hes1 deletion: Conditional Hes1 KO in TAMs led to decreased tumor growth and increased cytotoxic T-cell infiltration/activity; Arg1 levels were reduced, alleviating T-cell suppression; combination with anti‑PD‑1 further enhanced tumor growth inhibition (peer-reviewed, 2024). While the study reports robust effects, quantitative magnitudes are model-specific and not detailed in the excerpt here (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40164-024-00588-2) (kim2024disruptingnotchsignaling pages 1-2).

Mechanistic details: domains, motifs, and repression
- Domains: bHLH (basic DNA binding; HLH dimerization), Orange (partner selection/protein–protein interactions), WRPW (TLE/Groucho recruitment) (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).
- DNA motifs: HES-family proteins preferentially bind N‑box (CACNAG) and class C (CACGCG) motifs; HES1 autorepresses via N‑box elements in its promoter (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 15-16).
- Co-repressors and chromatin: WRPW engages TLE/Groucho and HDACs; HES1 can recruit SIRT1 for TLE-independent repression; HES1 can also limit P‑TEFb–dependent transcription elongation (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2).

Network position and crosstalk
- Canonical NOTCH effector: NICD–CSL–MAML activation of hes1 transcription is a defining regulatory step (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 4-5, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4).
- Crosstalk: HES1 can bind STAT3 and facilitate its phosphorylation via JAK2, illustrating Notch–JAK/STAT axis integration (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 2-4, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 15-16).

Applications and real-world implementations
- Immuno-oncology: Myeloid (TAM) HES1 targeting improves the tumor microenvironment and synergizes with PD‑1 blockade in vivo, nominating HES1 for compartment-specific therapeutic strategies (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40164-024-00588-2, 2024) (kim2024disruptingnotchsignaling pages 1-2).
- Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling: Endothelial NOTCH effectors (HEY1 and HES1) are post-translationally tuned; modulating SUMO pathways (e.g., TRIM28–SENP) alters HEY1/HES1 dimer states and angiogenic gene repression, suggesting actionable axes impacting tumor/ischemic angiogenesis (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323398, 2024) (ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 1-3, ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 13-15).
- NOTCH pathway therapeutics and HES1 as readout: Reviews consolidate that γ‑secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and ligand/receptor-directed biologics regulate canonical NOTCH outputs including HES1; preclinical/clinical programs often monitor HES1 as a pharmacodynamic marker of NOTCH blockade or activation in diverse cancers (reviewed synthesis) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624, 2025) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 15-16, zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2). Note: Specific trial-level statistics are context‑ and agent‑dependent and not detailed in the accessible excerpts here.

Limitations and open questions
- While HES1 expression correlates with malignant progression and therapy resistance across contexts, its value as an independent biomarker requires large-sample clinical validation (reviewed) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585624) (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 15-16).
- Tissue- and context-specific oscillation decoding: Emerging work shows that HES1 dynamics rather than static levels encode fate; translation into clinical biomarkers or interventions needs further study (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.26.609553, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.30.586691, 2024) (weterings2024notchdrivenoscillationscontrol pages 1-5, azhar2024unravellingdifferentialhes1 pages 1-4).

Conclusions
Human HES1 (Q14469) is a nuclear bHLH/Orange/WRPW transcriptional repressor and canonical NOTCH effector that binds N‑box/class C motifs and recruits Groucho/TLE through WRPW to silence targets. HES1 generates self‑organized oscillations that regulate developmental fate choices in the intestine, segmentation clock, and neurogenesis. Recent advances (2023–2024) highlight (i) period‑specific intestinal oscillations encoding fate, (ii) tissue‑specific embryonic dynamics, (iii) immuno‑oncology efficacy by ablating HES1 in TAMs, and (iv) endothelial SUMOylation-switches that alter HEY1–HES1 dimer usage and angiogenic repression. HES1 remains a central readout and mediator of NOTCH pathway therapeutics and a promising node for targeted manipulation, with further clinical validation and quantitative pharmacodynamic frameworks needed for biomarker deployment (zhang2025hes1inmalignant pages 1-2, weterings2024notchdrivenoscillationscontrol pages 1-5, azhar2024unravellingdifferentialhes1 pages 1-4, kim2024disruptingnotchsignaling pages 1-2, ren2024sumoylationfinetunesendothelial pages 1-3).
