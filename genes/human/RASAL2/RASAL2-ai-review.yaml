description: >-
  RASAL2 (RAS protein activator-like 2), also known as nGAP (neuronal GAP), is a
  dual-specificity GTPase-activating protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP
  bound to Ras and Rap small GTPases, converting them from their active GTP-bound
  state to their inactive GDP-bound state. The protein contains N-terminal
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, tandem calcium-binding C2 domains (C2A and
  C2B), and a catalytic GAP domain at the C-terminus. RASAL2 functions as a
  critical negative regulator of Ras signaling through a conserved catalytic
  mechanism. It exhibits context-dependent functions, acting as a tumor suppressor
  in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers through Ras inhibition, while
  showing pro-tumorigenic functions in triple-negative breast cancer through RAC1
  activation via antagonizing ARHGAP24. The protein is also involved in autophagy
  regulation through phosphorylation-dependent switches that alter its substrate
  specificity and binding interactions.

        RASAL2 is a well-characterized GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that

        RASAL2 regulates intracellular signal transduction through its GAP
        activity on Ras proteins, which are central mediators of signal
        transduction cascades downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. RASAL2
        negatively regulates the RAS-MAPK pathway, and loss of RASAL2 results

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is based on ortholog transfer. RASAL2 regulates the
        Ras-MAPK signaling cascade by modulating Ras GTPase activity. This
        annotation captures an aspect of RASAL2's signaling function, though
        it is quite general.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        While RASAL2 does regulate protein activation cascades through its
        modulation of Ras signaling, this annotation is somewhat redundant
        with the "regulation of intracellular signal transduction" annotation
        and does not provide additional specific insight. Retained as non-core
        as it accurately describes an aspect of RASAL2 function but is not
        the most informative annotation.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation indicates cytosolic localization based on Reactome
        pathway annotation. RASAL2 is predominantly cytoplasmic with enrichment
        at the plasma membrane upon calcium-dependent membrane recruitment
        through its C2 domains [file:human/RASAL2/RASAL2-deep-research-perplexity.md].
        The cytosol annotation is accurate for the basal state of the protein.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        RASAL2 is documented to localize to the cytoplasm/cytosol, with
        translocation to the plasma membrane occurring upon activation via
        calcium-dependent C2 domain-mediated membrane binding. The cytosol
        annotation accurately reflects the resting state localization.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This is a duplicate cytosol annotation from a different Reactome pathway
        reference (RAS GAPs bind RAS:GTP). The annotation is accurate and
        consistent with RASAL2's documented cytoplasmic localization.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This annotation correctly identifies cytosolic localization of RASAL2.
        Although it duplicates the other cytosol annotation with a different
        reference, it is appropriate as it derives from a different Reactome
        pathway context (RAS binding versus GAP activity).

        This TAS annotation is based on the original characterization of RASAL2
        showing that it functions as a RasGAP. The study demonstrated that
        expression of RASAL2 in yeast defective in Ira2 (a RasGAP) complemented
        the loss of Ira2 function, providing functional evidence for GAP

        This annotation is based on direct experimental evidence demonstrating

    review:

        This annotation indicates involvement in signal transduction based on
        the original RASAL2 characterization. As a RasGAP, RASAL2 modulates
        Ras signaling, which is a central component of signal transduction
        pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        RASAL2 functions as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, which is
        a core signal transduction pathway. The annotation accurately captures

        This annotation is a more specific MF term than GO:0005096 that accurately

        GO:0005099 (Ras GTPase activator activity) is more specific than the

      RASAL2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that accelerates the
      intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and Rap small GTPases, converting them
      from active GTP-bound to inactive GDP-bound forms. This is the primary
      biochemical activity of RASAL2.
