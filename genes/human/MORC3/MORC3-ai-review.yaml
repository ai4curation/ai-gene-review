        MISANNOTATION: MORC3 is a GHL-ATPase (not a kinase) that regulates p53 recruitment
        to PML-NBs. PMID:17332504 explicitly states "genotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation
        and stabilization of p53 but barely increased its transcriptional activity
        in
        Morc3-/- fibroblasts" - this means p53 IS PHOSPHORYLATED even without MORC3.
        MORC3
        affects p53 activity DOWNSTREAM of phosphorylation through PML-NB recruitment,
        not by performing phosphorylation itself.

        MISANNOTATION: MORC3 is a GHL-ATPase domain protein, NOT a serine/threonine
        kinase. PMID:17332504 describes MORC3's role in p53 recruitment to PML-NBs
        and
        shows p53 phosphorylation occurs independently of MORC3 ("genotoxic stress-induced
        phosphorylation... in Morc3-/- fibroblasts"). MORC3 has ATPase activity but
        no
        kinase activity. The annotation incorrectly attributes phosphorylation catalysis
        to MORC3.
