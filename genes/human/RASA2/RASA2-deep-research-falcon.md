## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q15283
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ras GTPase-activating protein 2; AltName: Full=GTPase-activating protein 1m; Short=GAP1m;
- **Gene Information:** Name=RASA2; Synonyms=GAP1M, RASGAP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C2_dom. (IPR000008); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849); Ras_GTPase. (IPR039360)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RASA2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RASA2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RASA2** (gene ID: RASA2, UniProt: Q15283) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target identity: We focus on human RASA2 (UniProt Q15283), also known as GAP1m/GTPase-activating protein 1m. Literature classifies GAP1m/RASA2 among Ras-specific GAPs with a RasGAP catalytic domain and membrane-targeting/regulatory modules including C2 and PH domains, consistent with the UniProt-provided domain set (PH-like, PH, C2, RasGTPase/GAP) (scheffzek2019; conserved C2–GAP architecture augmenting catalytic function across RasGAPs) (scheffzek2019rasspecificgtpaseactivatingproteinsstructures pages 12-14, paul2025thec2domain pages 4-6).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular function: RASA2 is a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that accelerates hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, thereby downregulating RAS output (e.g., RAF–MEK–ERK) in response to membrane signals. In T cells, RASA2 functions as an intracellular checkpoint that limits RAS/MAPK signalling upon antigen stimulation (Nature 2022) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05126-w; Aug 2022) (carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 1-2).
- Domains and mechanism: RasGAP family members, including GAP1m/RASA2, possess a catalytic RasGAP module and adjacent regulatory lipid-binding modules (C2 and PH) that help target and regulate activity at membranes. Recent structural work shows GAP-proximal C2 surfaces augment GAP catalytic activity; this architecture is conserved across C2-containing RasGAPs and underpins physiological regulation of Ras hydrolysis (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2418433122; Feb 2025). Broader reviews detail RasGAP modular organization and mechanism (https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a031500; Aug 2019) (paul2025thec2domain pages 4-6, scheffzek2019rasspecificgtpaseactivatingproteinsstructures pages 12-14).
- Substrate specificity: RASA2 is a Ras-specific GAP acting on the classical RAS isoforms to terminate RAS-GTP signalling; reviews of RAS–effector competition and GAP control detail how GAP activity influences effector engagement (e.g., RAF, PI3K) and localization (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.06.027; Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/kinasesphosphatases1020007; Apr 2023) (mozzarelli2024functionalandstructural pages 6-7, nair2023regulationofrasgtpase pages 10-12).
- Cellular/localization context: PH and C2 domains confer lipid-dependent membrane association of RasGAPs, coordinating with the catalytic domain to accelerate Ras GTP hydrolysis at the plasma membrane/inner leaflet signalling sites (scheffzek2019; Paul 2025) (scheffzek2019rasspecificgtpaseactivatingproteinsstructures pages 12-14, paul2025thec2domain pages 4-6).

Recent developments (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Melanoma genomics: In a real-world targeted DNA sequencing cohort of 254 cutaneous melanomas (2013–2023), RASA2 was recurrently altered (n=22; 8.7%), and NF1 mutations significantly co-occurred with RASA2 loss (Pearson r=0.37, adjusted p<0.001), supporting a tumor-suppressor role within MAPK pathway regulation and alignment with historic reports of RASA2 inactivation in melanoma (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16071347; Jan 2024; review context https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12103066; Oct 2020) (haugh2024targeteddnasequencing pages 7-9, bellazzo2020cuttingthebrakes pages 15-17).
- Somatic SVs in melanoma: A harmonized analysis of melanoma structural variants (JCI 2024) highlighted recurrent pathway regulators including SPRED1 and RASA2 in certain subtypes, reinforcing the broader theme of Ras pathway negative regulators in melanoma; though details vary by subtype, the study supports biologic/therapeutic impact of noncanonical drivers (https://doi.org/10.1172/jci177270; May 2024) (haugh2024targeteddnasequencing pages 7-9).
- Radioresistance in NSCLC: A 2024 translational study linked high RASA2 to decreased radiotherapy response in NSCLC, proposing a mechanism whereby RASA2 binds p53, promotes its phosphorylation and ubiquitin–proteasome degradation, and thereby reduces apoptosis after irradiation (https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-24-160; Mar 2024) (li2024theroleof pages 1-3).
- RAS signalling context: A 2024 Molecular Cell review synthesizes how RAS–effector interactions and GAP-mediated inactivation shape pathway flux and localization, providing mechanistic context for how RASA2 loss elevates RAS-GTP and biases effector engagement (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.06.027; Aug 2024). A 2023 review summarizes post-translational regulation of RAS and the roles of GAPs/GEFs in oncogenic signalling (https://doi.org/10.3390/kinasesphosphatases1020007; Apr 2023) (mozzarelli2024functionalandstructural pages 6-7, nair2023regulationofrasgtpase pages 10-12).

Current applications and implementations
- Engineered T cells/CAR-T (gene editing): Multiple screens and preclinical studies identify RASA2 as an intracellular checkpoint whose knockout enhances MAPK signalling, antigen sensitivity, cytolytic function, metabolic fitness, and persistence of engineered human T cells. The Nature 2022 study demonstrated improved tumor control across leukemia and solid tumor xenografts, with RASA2-KO CAR T cells outcompeting controls in bone marrow and conferring prolonged survival (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05126-w; Aug 2022) (carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 8-9, carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 7-8).
- 2024 implementation reviews: Reviews in Biomarker Research (May 2024) and Leukemia (Oct 2024) summarize the use of CRISPR and base-editing to optimize CAR-T, explicitly noting RASA2 as a screen-derived intracellular checkpoint target for enhancing engineered T cell function and discussing manufacturing/delivery approaches (https://doi.org/10.1186/s40364-024-00602-z; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-024-02444-y) (song2024crisprcasbasedcartcells pages 7-9, lei2024leveragingcrisprgene pages 20-21).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic positioning: Expert reviews (Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine 2019; Molecular Cell 2024) emphasize that RasGAPs are modular, with lipid-binding domains (C2/PH) guiding subcellular targeting and augmenting catalysis, consistent with RASA2’s predicted architecture. The 2025 PNAS study provides direct evidence that the GAP-proximal C2 surface is functionally required to augment catalytic activity across RasGAPs, supporting the inference that RASA2’s C2 domain is critical for its physiological Ras inactivation role (https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a031500; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.06.027; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2418433122) (scheffzek2019rasspecificgtpaseactivatingproteinsstructures pages 12-14, mozzarelli2024functionalandstructural pages 6-7, paul2025thec2domain pages 4-6).
- Safety considerations in T cell engineering: While RASA2 loss-of-function can enhance engineered T cells, RASA2 is a tumor suppressor recurrently altered in melanoma; therefore, experts suggest pairing edits with orthogonal safeguards (e.g., TRAC knock-in to eliminate endogenous TCR) and careful preclinical evaluation (Nature 2022; 2024 CAR-T engineering reviews) (carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 8-9, song2024crisprcasbasedcartcells pages 7-9, lei2024leveragingcrisprgene pages 20-21).

Relevant statistics and recent data
- Melanoma frequency/co-mutation: In the 254-patient cohort (2013–2023), RASA2 alterations were present in 22 cases (8.7%). NF1 significantly co-occurred with RASA2 loss (Pearson r=0.37, adjusted p<0.001), and triple-wild-type tumors sometimes harbored RASA2 as part of MAPK-pathway alterations, consistent with pathway dysregulation in melanoma (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16071347; Jan 2024) (haugh2024targeteddnasequencing pages 7-9).
- Engineered T cells (functional outcomes): RASA2 knockout T cells showed increased MAPK signalling, cytokine production, antigen-dim target killing, metabolic fitness, and in vivo competitive advantage with prolonged animal survival across models (Nature 2022), consolidated in 2024 reviews (carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 8-9, song2024crisprcasbasedcartcells pages 7-9, lei2024leveragingcrisprgene pages 20-21).
- NSCLC radioresistance association: In patient tumor analyses and orthotopic mouse models, higher RASA2 associated with lower ORR after radiotherapy and reduced apoptosis via p53 modulation (https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-24-160; Mar 2024) (li2024theroleof pages 1-3).

Pathway placement and cellular role
- Primary pathway: RASA2 negatively regulates the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK cascade by accelerating Ras GTP hydrolysis; its lipid-binding domains coordinate membrane recruitment, ensuring spatial coupling of Ras inactivation with effector engagement. Loss or reduction of RASA2 increases RAS-GTP and downstream MAPK signalling, with context-specific effects on PI3K/other effectors depending on cellular localization and effector competition (Molecular Cell 2024; Kinases & Phosphatases 2023) (mozzarelli2024functionalandstructural pages 6-7, nair2023regulationofrasgtpase pages 10-12).

Conclusion
Human RASA2 (Q15283) encodes a RasGAP with C2 and PH domains that localize/regulate its catalytic activity toward Ras, acting as a negative regulator of RAS–MAPK signalling at membranes. Recent genomics shows recurrent RASA2 alteration in melanoma with significant co-occurrence with NF1 loss, consistent with tumor-suppressor function. Emerging translational data link high RASA2 to radioresistance in NSCLC via p53 modulation. In cell therapy engineering, RASA2 knockout enhances CAR/TCR T cell antigen sensitivity, function, and persistence in preclinical models; 2024 reviews incorporate RASA2 among prioritized intracellular checkpoints for CRISPR engineering. Together, structural, mechanistic, and translational evidence position RASA2 as a membrane-localized RasGAP whose modulation has implications across oncology and engineered immunity (scheffzek2019rasspecificgtpaseactivatingproteinsstructures pages 12-14, paul2025thec2domain pages 4-6, haugh2024targeteddnasequencing pages 7-9, li2024theroleof pages 1-3, carnevale2022rasa2ablationin pages 8-9, song2024crisprcasbasedcartcells pages 7-9, lei2024leveragingcrisprgene pages 20-21).
