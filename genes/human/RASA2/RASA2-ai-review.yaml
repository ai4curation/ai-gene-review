description: 'RAS p21 protein activator 2, GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAS family small GTPases.
  Member of GAP1 family of RasGAPs characterized by tandem C2 domains (Ca2+ and phospholipid binding),
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (binds PIP3 with high affinity), and C-terminal RasGAP catalytic domain.
  Functions as tumor suppressor by negatively regulating RAS signaling: catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on RAS
  proteins (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, R-Ras) via arginine-finger mechanism (Arg-511), converting active RAS-GTP
  to inactive RAS-GDP. Cytoplasmic protein with regulated membrane association - PH domain recruitment
  to PIP3-enriched membranes brings RASA2 to sites of active RAS signaling. Loss of RASA2 leads to hyperactive
  RAS-MAPK and RAS-PI3K pathways, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. Recurrent
  inactivating mutations identified in ~5% of melanomas; loss associated with enhanced ERK signaling,
  increased proliferation/migration, and worse patient outcomes. Rare germline mutations cause Noonan
  syndrome (Rasopathy) due to elevated developmental RAS activity. In T cells, RASA2 acts as brake on
  TCR signaling - RASA2-deficient T cells show ~2-fold increased proliferation, enhanced activation markers
  (CD69, CD154), heightened antigen sensitivity, and improved tumor cell killing. Expression in immune
  cells, endothelium, and various tissues. Part of negative feedback mechanisms restraining growth factor
  receptor signaling cascades.'

  review:
    summary: RASA2/GAP1m is a Ras GTPase-activating protein that accelerates hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to
      Ras-GDP, thereby downregulating RAS output. This is the core molecular function of the protein,
      supported by phylogenetic inference and extensive literature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core enzymatic function of RASA2. The protein contains a conserved RasGAP catalytic domain
      with an arginine finger residue (Arg-397 in human) that is essential for stimulating GTP hydrolysis.
      This function is well-established across the GAP1 family of RasGAPs.
