  Epiphycan (EPYC) is a Class III small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that functions
  as a secreted extracellular matrix component primarily regulating collagen fibrillogenesis
  and matrix organization in cartilage and other connective tissues. The protein contains
  six leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and is post-translationally modified with dermatan
  sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. EPYC's core functions include: (1) regulating collagen
  type II fibril assembly in cartilage by binding collagen fibrils and controlling lateral
  growth; (2) organizing three-dimensional extracellular matrix architecture through interactions
  with collagen, hyaluronan, and other proteoglycans; and (3) modulating growth factor signaling
  by binding and sequestering TGF-β and BMPs. The protein is essential for maintaining articular
  cartilage integrity and preventing osteoarthritis, as demonstrated by progressive joint
  degeneration in EPYC-deficient mice. EPYC is expressed primarily in skeletal tissues including
  growth plate cartilage, articular cartilage, and intervertebral discs, as well as in ligaments
  and placenta

    summary: |
      This annotation is correct and represents the core localization of EPYC. Epiphycan is a
      secreted proteoglycan with an N-terminal signal peptide (aa 1-19) that directs it to the
      extracellular matrix where it functions exclusively. The protein is integrated into the
      organized three-dimensional scaffold of the ECM through interactions with collagen fibrils,
      hyaluronan, and other matrix components [file:human/EPYC/EPYC-deep-research-perplexity.md
      "functions exclusively in extracellular contexts...becomes integrated into the organized
      three-dimensional scaffold of the extracellular matrix"]. This is a fundamental and essential
      annotation for EPYC function.

  review:
    summary: |
      This annotation is supported but represents a non-core function. EPYC does influence bone
      development through mechanisms involving matrix organization and growth factor sequestration
      during endochondral ossification [file:human/EPYC/EPYC-deep-research-perplexity.md
      "protein influences bone development...during endochondral ossification"]. However, EPYC's
      primary role is in cartilage matrix organization, with bone development being a secondary
      consequence. EPYC-deficient mice show relatively subtle skeletal abnormalities early in
      development with age-dependent changes, indicating it's not essential for initial bone
      formation but contributes to skeletal homeostasis.

  review:
    summary: |
      This annotation is correct and represents a core biological process for EPYC. Epiphycan is
      essential for articular cartilage development and maintenance. EPYC is highly expressed in
      articular cartilage and is critical for maintaining joint integrity. EPYC-deficient mice
      develop progressive osteoarthritis with articular cartilage erosions and proteoglycan loss,
      demonstrating its essential role [file:human/EPYC/EPYC-deep-research-perplexity.md
      "essential for maintaining articular cartilage integrity...EPYC-deficient mice develop
      osteoarthritis spontaneously with age...articular cartilage erosions"]. This is a fundamental
      function of EPYC.

  review:
    summary: Extracellular matrix localization is correct for EPYC. While this duplicates
      the IBA annotation, both provide support for this cellular component.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: EPYC is a component of the extracellular matrix, particularly in cartilage.
      Multiple evidence codes supporting the same correct annotation provide additional
      confidence.

    label: glycosaminoglycan binding
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:8975717
  review:
    summary: |
      This annotation is problematic. EPYC itself IS a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan - it carries
      GAG chains as post-translational modifications [PMID:8975717 "small dermatan sulfate
      proteoglycan"]. The term "glycosaminoglycan binding" suggests EPYC binds to GAGs as ligands,
      which is not its primary characterized function. EPYC's GAG chains mediate interactions with
      other molecules (collagen, growth factors), but "glycosaminoglycan binding" is not an accurate
      description of EPYC's molecular function. This should be removed or replaced with a more
      accurate term like "extracellular matrix structural constituent" or "collagen binding".

  review:
    summary: |
      This annotation is based solely on expression evidence - EPYC is expressed in placental
      tissue [PMID:8975717 "expressed in cartilage, as well as ligament and placental tissues"].
      However, mere expression in placenta does not establish a specific role in pregnancy. The
      term "female pregnancy" is too broad and doesn't describe EPYC's actual molecular or cellular
      function. EPYC likely plays a structural role in placental ECM organization, but this hasn't
      been experimentally demonstrated. This is an over-annotation based on tissue expression alone.

      This accurately describes EPYC's role as a structural component of the ECM. EPYC serves
      as an organizational node that facilitates interactions between collagen fibrils, hyaluronan,
