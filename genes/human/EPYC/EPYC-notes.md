# EPYC (Epiphycan) Gene Review Notes

## Gene Overview
- **Gene**: EPYC (also known as DSPG3, PG-Lb, SLRR3B)
- **Protein**: Epiphycan (dermatan sulfate proteoglycan 3)
- **UniProt**: Q99645
- **Classification**: Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycan (SLRP), Class III subfamily
- **Structure**: 322 amino acids, ~36.6 kDa, contains 6 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs)

## Core Function Summary
Epiphycan is a secreted extracellular matrix proteoglycan that functions primarily to:
1. **Regulate collagen fibrillogenesis** - particularly type II collagen in cartilage [PMID:8975717, deep-research-perplexity lines 139-146]
2. **Organize extracellular matrix architecture** - maintains ordered structure of cartilage and other connective tissues [deep-research-perplexity lines 139-146, UniProt]
3. **Modulate growth factor signaling** - binds and sequesters TGF-β and BMPs [deep-research-perplexity lines 154-157]

## Molecular Function
- **Glycosaminoglycan binding**: Carries dermatan sulfate GAG chains that mediate interactions [PMID:8975717 "small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan"]
- **Collagen binding**: Direct binding to collagen fibrils via LRR domains regulates fibril assembly [deep-research-perplexity lines 214-219]
- **Growth factor binding**: Binds TGF-β isoforms and BMPs, modulating their bioavailability [deep-research-perplexity lines 154-157]

## Biological Processes
- **Collagen fibril organization**: Controls kinetics of collagen fibril formation and limits lateral growth [deep-research-perplexity lines 139-146, 214-219]
- **Bone development**: Influences endochondral ossification and osteoblast function [deep-research-perplexity lines 148-151, UniProt]
- **Cartilage development**: Essential for articular cartilage development and growth plate organization [deep-research-perplexity lines 135-138, 161-165]
- **ECM organization**: Creates matrix architecture through interactions with collagen, hyaluronan, and other proteoglycans [deep-research-perplexity lines 145-146]

## Cellular Localization
- **Extracellular matrix**: Secreted protein with N-terminal signal peptide [UniProt lines 181-182]
- **Tissue distribution**: Primarily cartilage, ligament, and placenta [PMID:8975717 lines 49-50, UniProt line 82]
- **Developmental expression**: Epiphyseal cartilage, growth plate, articular cartilage [deep-research-perplexity lines 135-138]

## Structural Features
- **Signal peptide**: Amino acids 1-19 for secretion [UniProt lines 181-182]
- **LRRNT domain**: Amino acids 106-143 [UniProt lines 186-187]
- **Six LRRs**: Leucine-rich repeats at positions 144-310 [UniProt lines 188-199]
- **GAG attachment sites**: Dermatan sulfate chain at Ser-64; O-linked glycans at Thr-60 and Ser-96 [UniProt lines 203-211]
- **Disulfide bonds**: Two disulfide bridges (Cys118-Cys130, Cys279-Cys312) [UniProt lines 218-221]

## Disease Associations
- **Osteoarthritis**: EPYC-deficient mice develop progressive osteoarthritis; enhanced phenotype in EPYC/biglycan double knockouts [deep-research-perplexity lines 161-169]
- **Corneal dystrophies**: Candidate gene for posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD) and cornea plana [deep-research-perplexity lines 168-171]
- **Cancer**: Upregulated in pancreatic and ovarian cancers; promotes tumor progression via PI3K/AKT signaling [deep-research-perplexity lines 174-179]

## Protein Interactions
- **Collagen II**: Primary binding partner in cartilage [deep-research-perplexity lines 141-143]
- **TGF-β family**: Binds and sequesters TGF-β and BMPs [deep-research-perplexity lines 154-157]
- **PLCG2 and CRK**: Signaling molecules identified as interacting partners [deep-research-perplexity line 157]

## Signaling Pathways
- **PI3K/AKT pathway**: Activated by EPYC in cancer and normal contexts [deep-research-perplexity lines 181-185]
- **Focal adhesion signaling**: Engages integrin-mediated signaling cascades [deep-research-perplexity lines 185-186]
- **TGF-β signaling**: Modulates TGF-β bioavailability and signaling activity [deep-research-perplexity lines 154-157]

## Functional Redundancy
- Shows partial functional redundancy with other SLRPs (particularly biglycan)
- Double EPYC/biglycan knockouts have more severe osteoarthritis than single knockouts [deep-research-perplexity lines 161-165, 194-199]
- Tissues upregulate other SLRPs (asporin, fibromodulin, lumican) when EPYC is deleted [deep-research-perplexity lines 163-164]
