description: Glypican-4 (GPC4) is a GPI-anchored cell surface heparan sulfate 
  proteoglycan belonging to the glypican family. GPC4 functions as a co-receptor
  that modulates growth factor signaling pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, and 
  FGF by binding ligands through its heparan sulfate chains and presenting them 
  to their cognate receptors. In the central nervous system, astrocyte-derived 
  GPC4 serves as a critical synaptogenic factor that promotes excitatory synapse
  formation and maturation by increasing surface clustering of GluA1-containing 
  AMPA receptors through LRRTM-GPC4-PTPsigma interactions. GPC4 can also be shed
  from the cell surface into extracellular fluids where it may act as a soluble 
  signaling factor. Mutations in GPC4 cause Keipert syndrome, an X-linked 
  recessive disorder characterized by craniofacial and digital abnormalities, 
  and variants have been implicated in Robinow syndrome through perturbation of 
  Wnt signaling.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from other 
        glypican family members. Glypicans can modulate cell migration through 
        their interactions with growth factors and morphogens that regulate cell
        motility. However, direct experimental evidence for GPC4-specific roles 
        in cell migration is limited compared to its well-established roles in 
        synaptogenesis and Wnt signaling.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While glypicans broadly influence cell migration through growth 
        factor modulation, this is not a defining core function of GPC4. The 
        phylogenetic inference is reasonable but GPC4's primary characterized 
        functions are in synapse formation and Wnt signaling co-receptor 
        activity.

        matrix. As a GPI-anchored proteoglycan bearing heparan sulfate chains, 
        GPC4 can interact with ECM components. However, GPC4 is primarily 
        described as a cell surface protein with a GPI anchor.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Glypicans are known to interact with the extracellular matrix 
        through their heparan sulfate chains. While GPC4 is primarily 
        GPI-anchored at the cell surface, it can also be shed and found in 
        extracellular spaces including the synaptic cleft.

    review:
      summary: GPC4 functions as a synaptic adaptor that bridges pre- and 
        postsynaptic membranes through the LRRTM-GPC4-PTPsigma trans-synaptic 
        complex. This adaptor function is critical for recruiting and clustering
        AMPA receptors at glutamatergic synapses.
      action: NEW
      reason: This annotation captures GPC4's well-characterized role as a 
        trans-synaptic organizer that mediates protein complex assembly at 
        synapses. The deep research literature confirms GPC4 bridges LRRTMs with
        presynaptic PTPsigma to coordinate synapse development and AMPA receptor
        recruitment. This molecular function term accurately describes GPC4's 
        adaptor role in assembling synaptic protein complexes.

    description: GPC4 functions as a cell surface co-receptor for growth factors
      and morphogens, particularly Wnts. Through its heparan sulfate chains, 
      GPC4 binds signaling ligands and presents them to their primary receptors,
      modulating signaling pathway activation. This co-receptor function is 
      central to GPC4's role in development and is perturbed in Robinow 
      syndrome.
