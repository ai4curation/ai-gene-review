        MISANNOTATION: HCST (also called KAP10/DAP10) is NOT a kinase. PMID:10528161
        explicitly describes HCST as a "transmembrane adapter protein" that "binds
        phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase following phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic YINM
        motif, which results in activation of Akt". This means HCST is PHOSPHORYLATED
        (it's a substrate) and then recruits PI3K signaling - it does not perform
        phosphorylation. HCST is an adaptor/scaffold for immune receptor signaling.
