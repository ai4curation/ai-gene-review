description: 'Insulin is a 51-amino acid peptide hormone composed of two polypeptide chains (A-chain and B-chain)

  linked by disulfide bonds. It is synthesized as preproinsulin in pancreatic beta cells, processed

  through the secretory pathway to generate mature insulin, and secreted into the extracellular space

  in response to elevated blood glucose. The primary core function of insulin is regulation of glucose

  homeostasis through binding to the insulin receptor, triggering intracellular signaling cascades

  (primarily PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways) that stimulate glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue,

  suppress hepatic glucose production, promote glycogen synthesis, stimulate lipogenesis, and inhibit

  lipolysis and protein degradation. Beyond its metabolic roles, insulin has important functions in

  cell growth, proliferation, and neuroprotection.

- description: Binds insulin receptor with high affinity to activate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades regulating glucose homeostasis
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: Insulin binding to site-1, the primary insulin-binding site, is composed of the L1 domain of one α-subunit and the αCT domain of the adjacent α-subunit; insulin binds to this site with high affinity (Kd approximately 10-30 nanomolar)
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: Upon binding of a single insulin molecule to site-1, the receptor undergoes a dramatic conformational transition to a Γ-shaped intermediate state, where the FnIII-2 domains move away from the L1 domain, initiating separation of the two receptor protomers. This conformational change brings the two intracellular kinase domains into closer spatial proximity, enabling trans-autophosphorylation

  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: The most physiologically important function of insulin is the stimulation of glucose uptake from the bloodstream into insulin-responsive tissues, particularly skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which together account for the majority of postprandial glucose disposal. This metabolic action is mediated through the insulin-dependent translocation of glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4) from intracellular membrane compartments to the plasma membrane
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: Following AKT activation, the serine/threonine kinase AS160 (also known as TBC1D4) is phosphorylated by AKT, leading to its release from GLUT4-containing storage vesicles. This phosphorylation event activates the RabGAP activity of AS160, converting Rab small GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound state and enabling GLUT4 vesicle mobilization

  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: The suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis by insulin involves inhibition of the transcription factors CREB and FoxO1, which normally activate the expression of the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase. The AKT-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO1, combined with reduced CREB activity following insulin treatment, leads to decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes and reduced hepatic glucose production
  - reference_id: file:human/INS/INS-deep-research-perplexity.md
    supporting_text: Insulin rapidly inhibits hepatic glycogenolysis through mechanisms involving protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), which is activated through insulin-mediated suppression of glycogen phosphorylase kinase, thereby preventing phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and allowing its inactivation

    supporting_text: Insulin is a potent anabolic hormone that stimulates fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride storage in adipose tissue and liver through multiple transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. The key transcription factors mediating insulin-induced lipogenic gene expression are the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), particularly SREBP-1c in lipogenic tissues

    supporting_text: Reciprocally, insulin potently inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue through inactivation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) via a PKA-independent mechanism. Insulin-activated AKT phosphorylates and inactivates phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), reducing the degradation of cAMP and preventing PKA activation
