### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ISCA1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ISCA1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ISCA1** (gene ID: ISCA1, UniProt: Q9BUE6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Human ISCA1 (Q9BUE6): Mitochondrial A‑type Fe–S Biogenesis Factor for [4Fe‑4S] Maturation

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and verification: ISCA1 (gene symbol: ISCA1; UniProt: Q9BUE6) encodes a human mitochondrial A‑type iron–sulfur cluster assembly protein in the HesB/IscA family. It localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and functions in the late steps of Fe–S biogenesis, specifically in maturation of mitochondrial [4Fe‑4S] proteins. This aligns with the UniProt description and HesB/IscA family membership (A-type ISC proteins). Evidence from human cell knockdowns and in vivo mammalian systems supports this identity and role (Apr 2012; May 2017) (sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2, beilschmidt2017isca1isessential pages 1-2).
- Core pathway position: ISCA1 acts downstream of de novo [2Fe‑2S] synthesis on ISCU and transfer to GLRX5, within a late-acting module comprising ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57 that enables conversion to [4Fe‑4S] and delivery to target apoproteins (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).

2) Molecular function and mechanism
- Function: ISCA1 is a late-acting Fe–S carrier/cluster-conversion factor required for [4Fe‑4S] protein maturation, not for [2Fe‑2S] targets. Depletion selectively compromises mitochondrial [4Fe‑4S] enzymes such as aconitase (ACO2), respiratory complex I, and lipoic acid synthase (LIAS), while [2Fe‑2S] ferrochelatase is relatively spared (Apr 2012) (sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Mechanism of [4Fe‑4S] formation: Biochemical reconstitution shows GLRX5 donates [2Fe‑2S] clusters to ISCA1–ISCA2, where two [2Fe‑2S] clusters undergo reductive fusion to form a [4Fe‑4S] cluster. This reaction requires IBA57 and electron flow uniquely from mitochondrial ferredoxin FDX2 and its reductase FDXR; FDX1 cannot substitute. In contrast, transfer of [2Fe‑2S] from GLRX5 directly to [2Fe‑2S] targets occurs spontaneously within seconds, highlighting distinct mechanisms for [2Fe‑2S] versus [4Fe‑4S] maturation (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).
- Substrate specificity: ISCA1 specifically supports [4Fe‑4S] centers in mitochondrial targets, including LIAS and complex I subunits. Patient and knockdown data show selective impairment of [4Fe‑4S] proteins with relative preservation of [2Fe‑2S] proteins (May 2018; Apr 2012) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 1-5, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 17-19, sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Structural/biochemical features: Mammalian ISCA1 and ISCA2 are Fe2S2-binding A-type proteins capable of forming a complex; however, they show discrete interactions with late ISC components, and in vivo data indicate ISCA1 has a nonredundant role in some tissues (May 2017) (beilschmidt2017isca1isessential pages 1-2).

3) Interacting partners and pathway nodes
- Immediate partners: ISCA2 and IBA57 assemble with ISCA1 to promote [4Fe‑4S] formation; GLRX5 provides the [2Fe‑2S] donor; FDX2/FDXR supply electrons for reductive fusion (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).
- Downstream delivery: Late delivery to specific apoproteins involves NFU1 and BOLA3 for certain targets (e.g., LIAS, some complex I components). Genetic and biochemical data position an ISCA1–NFU1 node for insertion of [4Fe‑4S] into mitoribosome assembly factor METTL17 and link BOLA3/NFU1 defects to mitochondrial translation attenuation (Oct 2023) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).
- Upstream ISC components: NFS1 (with LYRM4/ISD11 and ISD co-factors) and ISCU participate in [2Fe‑2S] assembly and transfer to GLRX5 prior to ISCA1‑mediated steps; ISCA1 acts after these steps (Aug 2020; Apr 2012) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1, sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2).

4) Cellular localization
- ISCA1 is a mitochondrial matrix protein. Depletion produces mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities and selective loss of [4Fe‑4S] enzyme activities, consistent with a matrix-localized, late ISC biogenesis role (Apr 2012). A disease-causing N‑terminal variant demonstrates dependence on mitochondrial import for function (May 2018) (sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 14-17).

5) Disease associations, phenotypes, and variant evidence
- Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Syndrome 5 (MMDS5): Pathogenic ISCA1 variants cause MMDS5, typically presenting as infantile-onset leukodystrophy with lactic acidosis and combined OXPHOS deficiencies. A homozygous p.V10G missense variant (in the presequence) impairs mitochondrial import and stability of ISCA1 and leads to severe defects in [4Fe‑4S] proteins, including LIAS, with markedly reduced lipoylation of multi-enzyme complexes. Wild-type ISCA1 rescues defects, whereas p.V10G only partially complements cellular phenotypes (May 2018) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 1-5, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 17-19, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 14-17, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 42-53).
- Quantitative phenotypes: In patient fibroblasts harboring ISCA1 p.V10G, mitochondrial enzyme activities show significant reductions; for example, ATP synthase-linked measurements reported ~33% of control under defined substrate conditions, illustrating downstream energetic compromise secondary to Fe–S defects (May 2018) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 42-53).
- In vivo requirement: Tissue knockdowns in mouse show ISCA1 is essential for mitochondrial [4Fe‑4S] protein biogenesis, whereas ISCA2 can be dispensable in specific contexts, indicating nonredundant ISCA1 roles (May 2017) (beilschmidt2017isca1isessential pages 1-2).

6) Recent developments (2023–2024) and expert analyses
- Mitoribosome and ISCA1–NFU1 node: Recent work established that the mitoribosome’s [2Fe‑2S] clusters derive from the GLRX5–BOLA3 node and that assembly of the small subunit depends on METTL17, which harbors a [4Fe‑4S] cluster proposed to be inserted via an ISCA1–NFU1 node. Patient fibroblasts with BOLA3 or NFU1 mutations show attenuated mitochondrial protein synthesis, linking late ISC pathways, including the ISCA1 axis, to translational control (Oct 2023) (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).
- Cancer metabolism connection: In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models, autophagy maintains iron homeostasis to sustain mitochondrial function. Autophagy inhibition perturbs ISCA1-dependent pathways; forced expression of SDHB or ISCA1 rescues growth and mitochondrial defects, underscoring ISCA1’s functional importance in disease settings beyond primary mitochondrial disease (Apr 2023) (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).
- Expert reviews: Contemporary reviews underscore late ISC pathway branching and the specific requirement of FDX2/FDXR electrons for ISCA1–ISCA2-mediated [4Fe‑4S] formation, and contextualize ISCA1 within human diseases including MMDS (Jan 2022; Mar 2024) (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostics: ISCA1 is included among nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disease genes evaluated in clinical genomics for leukodystrophies and MMDS; case-based molecular diagnoses with functional follow-up (rescue by wild-type ISCA1) demonstrate utility (May 2018) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 1-5, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 17-19, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 14-17).
- Mechanistic reconstitution for target discovery: The reconstituted [4Fe‑4S] maturation system identifies specific dependencies (GLRX5 donor, ISCA1/2/IBA57 conversion, FDX2/FDXR electrons), providing targets and readouts for therapeutic screening or pathway modulation studies (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).
- Cancer therapeutics research: Modulating iron homeostasis or compensating ISCA1 function can influence tumor cell metabolism and therapeutic response in PDAC models (Apr 2023) (maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).

8) Quantitative and specific data points
- Kinetics: [2Fe‑2S] transfer from GLRX5 to [2Fe‑2S] apoproteins proceeds within seconds in vitro, whereas [4Fe‑4S] assembly requires the ISCA1–ISCA2–IBA57 complex and electrons from FDX2/FDXR (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).
- Specificity: FDX2, not FDX1, supports ISCA1–ISCA2 reductive fusion (Aug 2020) (weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1).
- Functional rescue: Wild-type ISCA1 complements ISCA1-depleted cells; disease variant ISCA1-V10G shows incomplete rescue even when import is artificially enhanced, demonstrating that both import and intrinsic function are compromised (May 2018) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 17-19, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 14-17).
- Patient biochemistry: In ISCA1 p.V10G cells, [4Fe‑4S]-dependent lipoylation is severely reduced; multiple OXPHOS complexes are affected with quantifiable declines in enzyme activities (May 2018) (torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 42-53).

9) Synthesis and current understanding
- ISCA1 is a mitochondrial matrix A-type Fe–S biogenesis factor that, with ISCA2 and IBA57, executes reductive fusion of GLRX5-delivered [2Fe‑2S] clusters into [4Fe‑4S] clusters using electrons from FDX2/FDXR. These [4Fe‑4S] clusters are subsequently delivered to specific apoproteins, with NFU1/BOLA3 mediating insertion for certain targets including LIAS and complex I components. Genetic disruption of ISCA1 causes MMDS5 with leukodystrophy due to selective failure of mitochondrial [4Fe‑4S] protein maturation. Emerging work further connects ISCA1-linked nodes to mitoribosome assembly and cancer metabolism, highlighting ISCA1 as a pivotal hub with clinical and translational relevance (Apr 2012; May 2017; May 2018; Aug 2020; Oct 2023; Apr 2023; Mar 2024; Jan 2022) (sheftel2012thehumanmitochondrial pages 1-2, beilschmidt2017isca1isessential pages 1-2, torraco2018isca1mutationin pages 1-5, weiler2020mitochondrial[4fe4s]protein pages 1-1, maio2022mammalianironsulfur pages 1-2).
