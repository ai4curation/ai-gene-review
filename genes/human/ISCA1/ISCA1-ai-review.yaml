description: ISCA1 is a mitochondrial matrix A-type iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster 
  assembly protein that functions late in the ISC biogenesis pathway, 
  specifically in the maturation of [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing proteins. ISCA1 
  forms a heterodimeric complex with ISCA2 that acts as an "assembler" of 
  [4Fe-4S] clusters by receiving two [2Fe-2S] clusters from GLRX5 and catalyzing
  their reductive fusion into a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. This reaction requires 
  the additional factor IBA57 and electrons from the mitochondrial ferredoxin 
  FDX2 and its reductase FDXR. The assembled [4Fe-4S] clusters are then 
  transferred to target apoproteins, with downstream factors NFU1 and BOLA3 
  mediating insertion for certain targets including lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) 
  and respiratory complex I subunits. ISCA1 is essential for [4Fe-4S] protein 
  maturation but dispensable for [2Fe-2S] proteins. Pathogenic variants cause 
  Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Syndrome 5 (MMDS5), characterized by 
  infantile-onset leukodystrophy, lactic acidosis, and combined OXPHOS 
  deficiencies.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. While bacterial 
        A-type ISC proteins (IscA) function in the cytoplasm, human ISCA1 is a 
        mitochondrial matrix protein (PMID:22323289). ISCA1 contains a 
        mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 1-12) and has been 
        experimentally localized to mitochondria. This cytoplasm annotation 
        likely reflects the cytoplasmic function of bacterial orthologs rather 
        than human ISCA1.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: 'Sheftel et al. (PMID:22323289) demonstrated that ISCA1 localizes to
        mitochondria, not cytoplasm: "ISCA1, ISCA2, and IBA57 are localized to mitochondria".
        The UniProt entry also indicates mitochondrial localization. While bacterial
        IscA orthologs function in the cytoplasm, human ISCA1 is a mitochondrial protein.
        There is no evidence for cytoplasmic ISCA1 function; the authors explicitly
        state "We further provide evidence against a localization and direct Fe/S
        protein maturation function of ISCA1 and ISCA2 in the cytosol."'

          (aconitase, complex I, LIAS)
        supporting_text: The activities of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, 
          including aconitase, respiratory complex I, and lipoic acid synthase, 
          were diminished following depletion of the three proteins.
      - statement: '[2Fe-2S] proteins (ferrochelatase) are unaffected by ISCA1 depletion'

    findings:
      - statement: ISCA1/ISCA2 heterodimer receives [2Fe-2S] clusters from GLRX5
        supporting_text: two molecules of [2Fe-2S](2+) GRX5 donate their cluster
          to a heterodimeric ISCA1/ISCA2 complex.

          to one [4Fe-4S]
        supporting_text: This complex acts as an "assembler" of [4Fe-4S]

core_functions:
  - description: ISCA1 is a core component of the late-acting mitochondrial 
      [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly machinery. The ISCA1/ISCA2 heterodimer receives 
      [2Fe-2S] clusters from GLRX5 and catalyzes their reductive fusion into 
      [4Fe-4S] clusters, requiring electrons from FDX2/FDXR and the additional 
      factor IBA57. This function is essential for maturation of mitochondrial 
      [4Fe-4S] proteins including aconitase, respiratory complex I subunits, and
      lipoic acid synthase.
