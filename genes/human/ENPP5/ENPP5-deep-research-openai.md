## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene ENPP5 (Q9UJA9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Introduction and Gene Family Context  
**ENPP5** (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5) is a **human gene** encoding a *type I transmembrane glycoprotein* that belongs to the ENPP family ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). This family (ENPP1–7 in mammals) comprises enzymes that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds in various substrates such as nucleotides and phospholipids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=substrates%20and%20mediate%20different%20biological,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)). ENPP5 (also known as **NPP5**) is often considered a *“putative”* enzyme because it shares conserved domains with other ENPPs but remained poorly characterized for years ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). Like ENPP4 and ENPP7, ENPP5 is a **single-pass type I membrane protein** anchored at the cell surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=only%20have%20the%20signature%20PDE,11)), meaning it has a large extracellular domain and a short cytosolic tail. Unlike ENPP1–3, which have additional regulatory domains (two N-terminal somatomedin B-like domains and a C-terminal nuclease-like domain), ENPP5’s simpler architecture consists primarily of the catalytic **phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=substrates%20and%20mediate%20different%20biological,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)).  

ENPP family members differ in substrate preference and biological role. ENPP5 is grouped with ENPP1, 3, and 4 as an enzyme that hydrolyzes **nucleotide substrates**, in contrast to ENPP2, 6, and 7 which evolved as phospholipases (lipid metabolizing enzymes) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=domain,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)). Early clues from rodent studies suggested ENPP5 might play a role in **neuronal cell communication**, hinting at a function in the nervous system ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). However, ENPP5 has been among the **least characterized** ENPPs, and our current understanding of its function has only recently solidified ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). Below, we detail the known **biochemical activity**, **cellular localization**, and **biological processes** involving ENPP5, incorporating the latest research findings (2023–2024) and expert analyses. Key experimental evidence and statistics are provided to support each aspect of ENPP5’s functional annotation.

# Structure and Cellular Localization  
ENPP5 is synthesized as a single-pass **membrane protein** with its **N-terminal domain** directed to the extracellular space (a hallmark of type I membrane proteins) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=only%20have%20the%20signature%20PDE,11)). The mature protein is glycosylated and anchored in the plasma membrane, positioning its catalytic domain outside the cell where it can act on extracellular substrates ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=GO%3A0005576%20,IEA)). Alternative splicing of ENPP5 mRNA gives rise to at least two transcript variants ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)), which may influence its localization or stability (for example, a shorter isoform could lack the transmembrane segment, potentially making a soluble enzyme, though this remains to be confirmed experimentally). UniProt annotations and gene ontology data consistently indicate ENPP5 is localized to the **plasma membrane** and extracellular region ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=GO%3A0005576%20,IEA)), in line with it functioning as an **ecto-enzyme**. 

Structurally, ENPP5’s extracellular portion comprises the **conserved PDE catalytic domain** found in all ENPP family members ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=substrates%20and%20mediate%20different%20biological,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)). Notably, ENPP5 lacks the N-terminal somatomedin B domains present in ENPP1–3 and also lacks the C-terminal nuclease-like domain, resulting in a somewhat smaller ectodomain focused on catalysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=substrates%20and%20mediate%20different%20biological,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)). Despite this streamlined domain structure, recent structural analysis revealed **unique features in ENPP5’s active site**. It is the only ENPP family member that coordinates **three Zn²⁺ ions** in its catalytic center (most ENPPs use two Zn²⁺ for catalysis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20has%20unique%20features%20that,catalytic%20site%20environment%20is%20negatively)). This extra zinc ion in ENPP5, coordinated by Aspartate-192 and Glutamate-159, interacts with the 2′ and 3′ oxygen atoms of ribose moieties on substrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20has%20unique%20features%20that,catalytic%20site%20environment%20is%20negatively)). Additionally, ENPP5 uniquely contains a **tyrosine (Tyr73)** in its substrate-binding pocket where other ENPPs have a phenylalanine at the corresponding position ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ribose%20substrates%20%2846%20%29,catalytic%20site%20environment%20is%20negatively)). This single amino acid difference is significant: the hydroxyl group of Tyr73 likely sterically or electrostatically clashes with bulky polyphosphate groups of common nucleotides. In fact, experimentally replacing Tyr73 with phenylalanine (as found in other ENPPs) “*eliminates the hydroxyl group that would presumably clash with nucleotide substrates*” and **enables ENPP5 to hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs)** like ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ribose%20substrates%20%2846%20%29,%E2%88%921)). These structural insights underscore that ENPP5’s active-site configuration is specialized and more restrictive than that of its relatives. It is a membrane-bound **ectoenzyme** whose structure is tuned to a specific subset of substrates, as discussed next.

# Enzymatic Function and Substrate Specificity  
ENPP5 is an **ecto-phosphodiesterase**, meaning it cleaves phosphodiester bonds in extracellular molecules. However, its substrate specificity is unusually narrow compared to other ENPP family enzymes. **Biochemical assays** have demonstrated that recombinant ENPP5 **can hydrolyze NAD⁺ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)**, but notably **cannot hydrolyze standard nucleotide di- or triphosphates** such as ADP or ATP ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=Function%3A)). In other words, ENPP5 fails to break down the typical nucleotide substrates that enzymes like ENPP1 or ENPP3 readily hydrolyze ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=,and%20triphosphates)). Consistent with this, ENPP5 also **lacks lysophospholipase D activity**, so it does not act on lipid substrates like lysophosphatidylcholine (the reaction catalyzed by ENPP2/autotaxin) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=domain,These%20adaptations%20explain%20the%20different)). These observations align with ENPP5’s unique active-site features (the Tyr73 gatekeeper and extra Zn²⁺) that prevent binding or efficient turnover of bulky polyphosphate-containing ligands ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ribose%20substrates%20%2846%20%29,%E2%88%921)). 

Instead, ENPP5 shows activity toward a small set of **unusual nucleotide substrates**. Besides NAD⁺, it can cleave **ADP-ribose (ADPR)** and **UDP-glucose**, both of which are molecules containing a single diphosphate linkage connecting two moieties ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). These are structurally akin to NAD in that they have two linked portions but lack the triphosphate chain of ATP. ENPP5 exhibits the **highest catalytic rate** for NAD⁺ (and its reduced form NADH) compared to those other substrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). However, its efficiency on NAD⁺ is still quite low – a 2017 enzymology study measured a catalytic efficiency (k_cat/K_m) of only about **6.7×10^-4 s^-1·μM^-1** for NAD⁺ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). This rate is orders of magnitude lower than the efficiencies of classical nucleotide hydrolases like ENPP1 on ATP. The low turnover number suggests ENPP5 is a rather **slow enzyme**, potentially functioning in a regulatory capacity (fine-tuning local signaling levels) rather than bulk turnover of metabolites ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). 

Importantly, when ENPP5 does act on NAD⁺, it performs a **pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase reaction** that cleaves NAD⁺ into two products: **nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)** and **adenosine monophosphate (AMP)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=Cleavage%20yields%20NMN%20,of%20NAD%20and%20cleavage%20products)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=relevant%20standards%20,by%20SmNPP5%2C%20as%20revealed%20by)). This reaction breaks the pyrophosphate bond that connects the two nucleotide components of NAD⁺. A clear demonstration of this comes from a **TLC (thin-layer chromatography) analysis** using a schistosome (parasitic worm) ortholog of ENPP5: the enzyme’s NAD⁺ cleavage yielded distinct NMN and AMP spots matching known standards ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=relevant%20standards%20,by%20SmNPP5%2C%20as%20revealed%20by)). Figure 3d of that study explicitly depicts **NAD⁺ → NMN + AMP** as the reaction catalyzed by ENPP5-type enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=Cleavage%20yields%20NMN%20,of%20NAD%20and%20cleavage%20products)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=relevant%20standards%20,by%20SmNPP5%2C%20as%20revealed%20by)). By removing NAD’s adenine-containing AMP portion from the nicotinamide mononucleotide portion, ENPP5 effectively destroys extracellular NAD signals and produces AMP. The liberated AMP can in turn be further metabolized by other ecto-enzymes (e.g. CD73 5′-nucleotidase) into adenosine, which has its own signaling roles in purinergic pathways. Thus, ENPP5’s enzymatic activity can be seen as **modulating extracellular NAD and related metabolites**, distinct from ATPases or classical phosphodiesterases that target cyclic nucleotides. 

To summarize, **ENPP5’s primary known function** is **enzymatic hydrolysis of NAD⁺** (and similar ADP-ribose-containing molecules) on the cell surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). It **does not degrade ATP, ADP, or cyclic nucleotides** under normal conditions ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=,and%20triphosphates)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ribose%20substrates%20%2846%20%29,%E2%88%921)), due to structural constraints in its active site. This specificity sets ENPP5 apart within the ENPP family and suggests it has a specialized biological role related to NAD⁺ signaling or metabolism. The next section discusses what that role might be, based on current evidence.

# Biological Roles and Pathways Involving ENPP5  
Given its ability to hydrolyze extracellular NAD⁺, ENPP5 is thought to influence **purinergic signaling pathways**, particularly those involving NAD⁺ as an extracellular messenger. NAD⁺ has emerged in recent years as a signaling molecule that can act as a **“danger signal”** or neurotransmitter in certain contexts ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=A%20second%20important%20signaling%20molecule,For%20instance%2C%20during%20inflammation)). Under stress or inflammation, NAD⁺ can be released into the extracellular space where it affects immune cells and other cell types ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=very%20low%20levels%20in%20serum%3B,to%20P2X7R%20activation%20which%20induces)). One well-documented pathway is **NAD-induced cell death (NICD)** in the immune system: extracellular NAD⁺ can be used as a substrate by the T cell surface enzyme ART2 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 2) to ADP-ribosylate the P2X7 purinergic receptor on T cells, triggering pore formation and apoptosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=extracellular%20NAD%20acts%20to%20modulate,Relatively%20low%20levels%20of%20NAD)). This mechanism preferentially affects certain T cell subsets (notably regulatory T cells) and is considered a regulatory process during inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=L,18%2C20)). By **degrading NAD⁺ outside the cell, ENPP5 would remove the substrate required for this ART2/P2X7 pathway**, thereby modulating immune responses. In other words, ENPP5 could act as a “checkpoint” that protects cells from NAD⁺-mediated overactivation or death. Indeed, studies on the **schistosome parasite ENPP5** (SmNPP5) dramatically illustrate this concept: the parasite’s surface NPP5 enzyme cleaves NAD⁺ and **prevents NAD-induced T cell apoptosis**, helping the parasite evade the host immune system ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=layer%20chromatography%20,these%20findings%2C%20we%20hypothesized%20that)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=%28to%20generate%20NMN%20and%20AMP%29,This%20would%20ultimately%20promote%20the)). When SmNPP5 is experimentally knocked down in the parasite, the worms lose much of their ability to degrade NAD⁺ and can no longer protect T cells from NAD-triggered P2X7 activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=ADP%20and%20block%20platelet%20aggregation,suppressed%20the%20expression%20of%20SmNPP5)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=not%20SmNACE,by%20preventing%20Treg%20cell%20death)). This highlights a potential **immunomodulatory role** for NPP5 enzymes – by consuming extracellular NAD⁺, they **prevent pro-apoptotic signaling in neighboring cells**. 

In humans, ENPP5 is hypothesized to perform a similar function in relevant tissues. **Neuronal and glial cells** in the brain, for example, may release NAD⁺ upon injury or during neurotransmission, and ENPP5 could regulate such signals. While direct in vivo evidence is still lacking, a comprehensive 2021 review noted that ENPP5’s NAD-hydrolyzing activity *“suggests a role for ENPP5 in NAD-based neurotransmission,”* though this awaits confirmation in ENPP5 knockout models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). The **brain expression** of ENPP5 (and its rodent analogs) lends some support to this idea: ENPP5 transcripts have been detected in the central nervous system, and the initial discovery in rat implicated it in neuronal communication ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). By degrading NAD⁺ near synapses or in the extracellular space, ENPP5 could influence purinergic neurotransmitter receptors (some P2Y/P2X receptors or other NAD-sensitive pathways) and thereby modulate neuronal excitability or neuroinflammation. This proposed role is analogous to the immune scenario – controlling the availability of NAD⁺ to receptors/enzymes that respond to it – but in the context of neural circuits. 

Another potential pathway involves **ectoenzyme cascades**: ENPP5’s product AMP can be converted to **adenosine**, which activates P1 adenosine receptors on cells and generally exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects. So ENPP5, by generating AMP (and subsequently adenosine), might indirectly promote adenosine-mediated signaling. This could have significance in tissues like the **thyroid and testis**, where ENPP5 is notably expressed at higher levels ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Expression%20Biased%20expression%20in%20thyroid,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). RNA profiling shows **ENPP5 mRNA is enriched in the thyroid gland and in male reproductive tissues (testis/epididymis)**, among other tissues ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59084#:~:text=Expression%20Biased%20expression%20in%20thyroid,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). The functional significance in those contexts is not fully understood, but it may relate to local regulation of extracellular nucleotides during hormone release or sperm development, for instance. 

In summary, ENPP5 appears to function as a **regulator of extracellular nucleotide signaling**. Its **biochemical activity (NAD⁺ → NMN + AMP)** positions it to control the levels of NAD⁺ and ADP-ribose in the extracellular milieu, thereby modulating pathways like: (1) **Purinergic receptor signaling** (e.g., preventing excessive P2X7 activation on immune cells), (2) **Cell death and survival signaling** in contexts where NAD⁺ acts as a DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern), and possibly (3) **Neurotransmission** processes that utilize nucleotide derivatives as messengers. These roles are still being elucidated, but recent research has begun to shed light on ENPP5’s importance in certain physiological and pathological states, as discussed below.

# Emerging Research: ENPP5 in Aging and Disease  
Although ENPP5 was historically understudied, **recent developments (2023–2024)** have linked this enzyme to significant biological phenomena, including cellular aging and cancer, and have even suggested practical clinical applications. One of the most striking new findings is ENPP5’s involvement in the **senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)** and skin aging. In a June 2024 study published in *Biogerontology*, Takaya *et al.* identified **ENPP5 as a factor upregulated in senescent human dermal fibroblasts** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=recombinant%20ENPP5%20,knockdown%20in%20mouse%20skin%20ameliorated)). Senescent cells are known to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and other factors (the SASP) that contribute to tissue aging. The researchers found that when ENPP5 expression was **knocked down by siRNA in fibroblasts, SASP biomarkers and other aging-related factors were significantly reduced ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=recombinant%20ENPP5%20,knockdown%20in%20mouse%20skin%20ameliorated))**, suggesting that ENPP5 activity helps drive the senescent phenotype. Conversely, treating fibroblasts with **recombinant ENPP5 protein or overexpressing ENPP5** caused an increase in SASP factors and accelerated cellular senescence ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=recombinant%20ENPP5%20,knockdown%20in%20mouse%20skin%20ameliorated)). These in vitro results indicate that ENPP5’s enzymatic action in the extracellular space (likely its NAD⁺-degrading activity, though the study did not explicitly detail the mechanism) promotes the pro-inflammatory, tissue-degrading milieu associated with aging cells. 

Crucially, the same study provided *in vivo* evidence: **mice treated with ENPP5 knockdown** (via a topical siRNA approach to the skin) showed **attenuated skin aging** signs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=aging,aging%20treatments%20for%20the%20skin)). The aged mice with reduced ENPP5 had less thinning of the dermal collagen layer, retained more subcutaneous fat, and had a thicker panniculus carnosus (a muscle layer) compared to controls ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=aging,aging%20treatments%20for%20the%20skin)). These are hallmarks of more youthful skin. This finding suggests that ENPP5 is not merely a bystander in aging, but indeed a **causal SASP factor**: by regulating extracellular nucleotides or related signals, ENPP5 influences the chronic inflammation and matrix degradation that characterize aging tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=lentiviral%20overexpression%20of%20ENPP5%20promoted,aging%20treatments%20for%20the%20skin)). The authors conclude that targeting ENPP5 could be a novel strategy to **suppress SASP and prevent age-related tissue deterioration** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=aging,aging%20treatments%20for%20the%20skin)). In practical terms, ENPP5 might become a therapeutic target in anti-aging interventions – for example, small-molecule inhibitors of ENPP5 or topical treatments to reduce its activity could mitigate skin aging. While such therapies are not yet available, the identification of ENPP5 in this context is a significant development in our understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of aging.  

Another area of emerging interest is **cancer biology**. A 2023 study in *PLoS ONE* by Lee *et al.* highlighted ENPP5 in the context of microRNA regulation and tumor progression. The researchers discovered that **ENPP5 is a direct target of the tumor-suppressive microRNA miR-126**, and that in certain cancers (notably breast cancer and canine mammary tumors, which were used as a comparative model), **ENPP5 is upregulated when miR-126 is downregulated** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=in%20the%20transcriptome%20data%20of,suppressive)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=regulated,in%20ENPP5%20gene%20expression%20via)). Mechanistically, they found that LINE-1 retrotransposon transcripts acting as competing endogenous RNAs can “sponge” miR-126, thereby freeing ENPP5 mRNA from miR-126–mediated suppression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=regulated,in%20ENPP5%20gene%20expression%20via)). The result is an increase in ENPP5 expression in tumor cells. Clinically, this seems relevant: cancer patients with higher miR-126 (which would keep ENPP5 levels low) had better overall survival, whereas those with low miR-126 and presumably higher ENPP5 fared worse ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=in%20the%20transcriptome%20data%20of,suppressive)). Moreover, experimentally introducing a miR-126 mimic into cells **downregulated ENPP5**, confirming the regulatory relationship ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=regulated,in%20ENPP5%20gene%20expression%20via)). Conversely, overexpressing a fragment of LINE-1 that contains miR-126 binding sites relieved this repression and **boosted ENPP5 levels** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=of%20miR,126)). These findings point to ENPP5 as a **pro-oncogenic factor** when dysregulated: its overexpression (due to loss of miR-126 control) may confer advantages to tumor cells or the tumor microenvironment. One hypothesis is that tumor cells might exploit ENPP5’s NAD⁺-degrading activity to modulate immune surveillance – analogous to how the schistosome uses NPP5 to protect itself, a tumor might use ENPP5 to protect the cancer cells from NAD⁺-mediated immune cell attack or to alter inflammation in the tumor milieu. While this hypothesis needs further investigation, the identification of ENPP5 in a microRNA-regulated network adds to its functional significance and suggests that **ENPP5 could be a potential marker or therapeutic target in oncology**. It also exemplifies expert opinion that much of ENPP5’s impact may lie in subtle modulation of signaling rather than a dramatic enzymatic output, consistent with it being a low-efficiency enzyme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)).

Beyond aging and cancer, ENPP5 has recently been examined in a **clinical context for sepsis**. Sepsis is an extreme inflammatory response to infection, and there is growing interest in biomarkers that can diagnose or predict sepsis outcomes. In 2025, Gao *et al.* performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis (integrating multiple patient gene expression datasets) and identified **ENPP5 as a potential diagnostic biomarker for sepsis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12211274/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%204%2C450%20intersected,negatively%20associated%20with%20mast%20cells)). In their analysis, ENPP5 was one of seven “hub genes” differentially expressed in sepsis, and it had the highest importance in a diagnostic model (with the largest area under the ROC curve for distinguishing sepsis patients from controls) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12211274/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%204%2C450%20intersected,negatively%20associated%20with%20mast%20cells)). They also noted correlations between ENPP5 expression and immune cell infiltration: ENPP5 levels positively correlated with T cell abundance and negatively with mast cells in sepsis patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12211274/#:~:text=GSE13904%2C%20GSE154918%2C%20GSE8121,negatively%20associated%20with%20mast%20cells)). While this study did not delve into mechanism, the data suggest that ENPP5 expression changes in the immune system during sepsis and might reflect the body’s attempt to regulate extracellular NAD⁺/nucleotide levels amid the intense inflammation. If validated, ENPP5 could serve as a **blood biomarker for early sepsis diagnosis** or even as a therapeutic target to modulate the immune response in sepsis. This is a **real-world application** under exploration – using ENPP5 as a marker in clinical decision-making – although it’s still in the research phase.

# Expert Perspectives and Ongoing Research  
Authoritative reviews and experts in the field underscore both the importance of ENPP5 and the gaps in our knowledge. In a 2021 *J. Biol. Chem.* review of ENPP family structure and function, Borza *et al.* describe ENPP5 as *“among the least characterized”* of the ENPP enzymes, highlighting that its biological role is **inferred mainly from its substrate specificity and expression patterns** rather than direct experimentation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). They note the intriguing possibility that ENPP5 specializes in **NAD-based signaling in the nervous system**, given its ability to hydrolyze NAD⁺ and some expression in brain tissues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). However, they also emphasize that *in vivo* studies (such as generating **ENPP5-knockout mice**) are needed to definitively pinpoint its physiological function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). This expert opinion aligns with the experimental findings cited above: while we know what ENPP5 can do biochemically, determining *what it actually does in the human body* is the next critical step. 

From a biochemical standpoint, experts find ENPP5’s **active-site composition and inefficiency** thought-provoking. The presence of a third Zn²⁺ ion and the Tyr73 “brake” on activity suggest nature has deliberately tuned ENPP5 to be more selective and slower than its cousins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20has%20unique%20features%20that,catalytic%20site%20environment%20is%20negatively)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). Some hypothesize that ENPP5 might function in specialized microenvironments – for example, in *synaptic clefts, junctional spaces, or confined extracellular niches* – where NAD⁺ or ADPR is released at low levels and needs tight regulation. In such locales, a high-activity enzyme could deplete signals too quickly or nonspecifically, whereas ENPP5’s low catalytic efficiency might allow for a **more graded, homeostatic control** of nucleotide signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=hydrolysis%20%2846%20%29,does%20not%20happen%20through%20the)). This idea is consistent with ENPP5 acting in processes like **fine-tuning neurotransmitter pools or maintaining immune tolerance** (by preventing excessive NAD⁺-P2X7 mediated cell death). 

It is also worth noting that other ENPP family members have well-defined roles in human disease (for instance, ENPP1 in bone mineralization and pathological calcification, ENPP2 in cancer metastasis and fibrosis via LPA production, ENPP7 in gut lipid metabolism). The emerging links of ENPP5 to **skin aging and cancer** suggest that it too could play a significant role in human health and disease, even if subtler. Some dermatology researchers, for example, now consider ENPP5 a candidate **SASP factor** to target for anti-aging skin treatments ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=lentiviral%20overexpression%20of%20ENPP5%20promoted,aging%20treatments%20for%20the%20skin)). In oncology, the connection to miR-126 places ENPP5 in a network of tumor suppression and oncogenesis, implying it might be part of the “dark matter” of cancer genomics that wasn’t previously appreciated ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=in%20the%20transcriptome%20data%20of,suppressive)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=regulated,in%20ENPP5%20gene%20expression%20via)). 

Finally, **future directions** pointed out by experts include: validating ENPP5’s function through genetic models (knockout or overexpressing animals), identifying the cells and conditions where ENPP5 is most active (e.g. during neuroinflammation, in senescent cells, etc.), and exploring whether any endogenous inhibitors or modulators of ENPP5 exist. With new tools like high-specificity antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors being developed for other ENPPs, similar tools could be applied to ENPP5 to probe its role in vivo. There is also interest in the **structural biology** of ENPP5 – for instance, determining a high-resolution crystal structure or cryo-EM structure (to complement the AlphaFold models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=AF,Q6UWV6))) could reveal how exactly its Tyr73 and third zinc confer its unique properties. Such structural insights might even enable **structure-guided drug design** if ENPP5 becomes a therapeutic target in conditions like fibrosis, neurodegeneration, or immunological disorders.

# Conclusion  
In summary, **ENPP5 (Q9UJA9)** encodes an enzyme that is *distinct* within the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family. Its main **biochemical function** is the hydrolysis of NAD⁺ and related molecules in the extracellular space, yielding NMN and AMP and thereby modulating purinergic signaling pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=relevant%20standards%20,by%20SmNPP5%2C%20as%20revealed%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=layer%20chromatography%20,these%20findings%2C%20we%20hypothesized%20that)). ENPP5 is a **membrane-bound ectoenzyme**, predominantly localized to the cell surface where it can intercept extracellular nucleotides ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ENPP5#:~:text=GO%3A0005576%20,IEA)). Structurally, it features a unique active-site architecture (including three Zn²⁺ ions and a tyrosine residue in the binding pocket) that explains its **narrow substrate specificity** and inability to process common nucleotides like ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ribose%20substrates%20%2846%20%29,%E2%88%921)). Biologically, ENPP5 is implicated in **regulating cell–cell communication**: it likely contributes to **neuronal communication** (by shaping NAD⁺-mediated neurotransmission) and to **immune regulation** (by limiting NAD⁺-triggered cell death and possibly influencing inflammation) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549896/#:~:text=Here%2C%20NAD%20serves%20as%20a,Relatively%20low%20levels%20of%20NAD)). Recent research breakthroughs have illuminated ENPP5’s role in driving the **senescence secretory phenotype** in aging cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436793/#:~:text=recombinant%20ENPP5%20,knockdown%20in%20mouse%20skin%20ameliorated)) and its potential **oncogenic upregulation** when microRNA control is lost ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10289412/#:~:text=in%20the%20transcriptome%20data%20of,suppressive)), underscoring the enzyme’s relevance to human health. ENPP5 has even emerged as a candidate **diagnostic marker** in diseases like sepsis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12211274/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%204%2C450%20intersected,negatively%20associated%20with%20mast%20cells)). 

Despite these advances, ENPP5 remains somewhat enigmatic. It stands out as an enzyme that is **highly selective and relatively slow**, hinting that its physiological roles might be subtler than those of other nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes. As expert analyses highlight, many questions about ENPP5 persist – for example, **which physiological signals induce NAD⁺ release for ENPP5 to act on, which cell types primarily express ENPP5 in vivo, and how its activity is regulated under normal vs. pathological conditions** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808174/#:~:text=ENPP5%20is%20among%20the%20least,validation%20using%20Enpp5%20KO%20mice)). Ongoing and future studies, including targeted knockouts and specific inhibitors, will help answer these questions. What is clear now is that ENPP5 is *not* a redundant “orphan” enzyme; rather, it fulfills a niche in the intricate network of extracellular signaling by controlling NAD⁺ and related metabolites. As such, ENPP5 adds a unique piece to the puzzle of how cells communicate and maintain homeostasis via extracellular nucleotides. Continuing to unravel ENPP5’s function will enhance our understanding of purinergic signaling in the nervous and immune systems and could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches in aging, immunology, and beyond.
