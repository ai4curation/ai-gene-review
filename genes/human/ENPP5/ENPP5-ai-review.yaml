description: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5, enzyme
  that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleotides. Member of ENPP family characterized by
  phosphodiesterase and nucleotide pyrophosphatase activities. Localizes to cell surface
  as type II transmembrane protein with extracellular catalytic domain. Catalyzes
  hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in nucleotides and their derivatives. Substrate
  specificity includes 5'-nucleotide monophosphates - ENPP5 converts AMP to adenosine,
  functioning as ecto-5'-nucleotidase. Also exhibits activity toward cyclic nucleotides
  and nucleotide sugars. By generating adenosine from AMP extracellularly, regulates
  purinergic signaling - adenosine acts on P1 adenosine receptors modulating immune
  responses, inflammation, neurotransmission. Complements CD73 (another ecto-5'-nucleotidase)
  in producing extracellular adenosine. Expression in various tissues including immune
  cells, endothelium, neurons. May regulate cell-cell communication, immune modulation,
  and inflammatory responses through nucleotide/adenosine metabolism. Dysregulation
  implicated in cancer, autoimmunity, and neurological disorders where purinergic
  signaling is altered.
