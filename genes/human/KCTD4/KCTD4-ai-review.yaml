description: >-
  KCTD4 encodes a BTB/POZ domain-containing protein belonging to the potassium channel
  tetramerization domain (KCTD) family. The protein contains an N-terminal BTB/T1
  (T1-type BTB) domain that mediates oligomerization, predicted to form pentameric
  assemblies. Unlike some KCTD family members, KCTD4 is not predicted to form stable
  complexes with Cullin 3 (Cul3) based on AlphaFold modeling, and is not part of the
  GABAB receptor-associated KCTD subclade (KCTD8/12/16). KCTD4 can form hetero-oligomeric
  complexes with other KCTD family members such as KCTD5. The protein is expressed
  in brain tissue and its precise molecular function remains to be fully characterized
  experimentally. Limited KCTD4-specific mechanistic literature exists, with function
  largely inferred from family-level analyses.

  review:
    summary: >-
      KCTD4 contains a BTB/T1 domain that mediates homo-oligomerization, a conserved
      feature of the KCTD family. Structural predictions indicate KCTD4 forms pentameric
      assemblies. The BTB domain is well-documented to drive self-association in KCTD
      proteins (KCTD4-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The identical protein binding annotation is well-supported by structural and
      family-level evidence. KCTD proteins characteristically oligomerize via their
      N-terminal BTB/T1 domain. AlphaFold-based structural clustering places KCTD4
      in a pentameric cluster (Balasco et al. 2024). Family reviews confirm that
      KCTDs are intracellular proteins whose N-terminal BTB/T1 domain is structurally
      related to BTB/POZ folds and adapted to drive homo-oligomerization (Teng et al. 2019).

  review:
    summary: >-
      KCTD4 is predicted to form pentameric homooligomers via its BTB/T1 domain,
      consistent with the structural architecture of other KCTD family members
      (KCTD4-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The protein homooligomerization annotation is supported by structural predictions
      and family-level evidence. AlphaFold-based analysis specifically assigns KCTD4
      to a pentameric assembly cluster (Balasco et al. 2024). The InterPro2GO mapping
      is appropriate given the T1-type BTB domain (IPR003131) present in KCTD4, which
      is known to mediate oligomerization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from a large-scale interactome study examining how
      disease-associated mutations affect protein-protein interactions. The study
      was not focused on characterizing KCTD4 function specifically.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Per GO curation guidelines, the term "protein binding" (GO:0005515) is
      uninformative and should be avoided. This annotation comes from a high-throughput
      Y2H screen studying disease mutation effects on protein interactions (Sahni et al.
      2015). While the interaction data may be valid, the generic "protein binding"
      annotation provides no insight into KCTD4's actual molecular function. More
      specific molecular function terms should be used when available.
