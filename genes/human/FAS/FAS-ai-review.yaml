description: 'FAS (CD95/APO-1) is a death receptor that triggers extrinsic apoptosis.
  CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative splicing produces 7 isoforms with ANTAGONISTIC
  functions: (1) Membrane-bound isoform 1 (P25445-1) forms the DISC with FADD and
  CASP8 to trigger apoptosis; (2) Soluble isoforms 2-6 (lacking transmembrane domain)
  act as DECOY RECEPTORS that BLOCK apoptosis by binding FasL without signaling. UniProt
  states "The secreted isoforms 2 to 6 block apoptosis (in vitro)". The GOA has BOTH
  GO:0043065 (positive regulation) AND GO:0043066 (negative regulation) of apoptosis
  - this reflects isoform conflation where membrane and soluble forms have opposite
  effects.'

      summary: 'CORE FUNCTION of FAS. FAS/CD95 is a type I transmembrane death receptor
        that binds FASLG (FasL/CD95L) and mediates apoptotic signaling. FAS is a bona
        fide member of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF6), containing three cysteine-rich
        domains (CRDs) in its extracellular region characteristic of this family [PMID:1375228].

        soluble isoforms retain ligand binding but lack signaling capacity.'

      reason: This is a core molecular function of FAS. The deep research 
        confirms FAS is TNFRSF6 with characteristic cysteine-rich domains that

        highly conserved across the TNFR family.

      summary: ISOFORM-SPECIFIC ANNOTATION. This annotation refers to SOLUBLE 
        FAS isoforms (P25445-2 to P25445-6), NOT the canonical membrane-bound 
        form. PMID:7510905 explicitly demonstrates that "a human Fas messenger 
        RNA variant capable of encoding a soluble Fas molecule lacking the 
        transmembrane domain" produces a protein where "Supernatants from cells 
        transfected with the variant messenger RNA blocked apoptosis induced by 
        the antibody to Fas."
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Correct annotation for soluble FAS isoforms. This is the 
        antagonistic function of the TMdel isoforms that act as decoy receptors.
        Should ideally be annotated to specific isoforms P25445-2/6, not the 
        canonical membrane-bound P25445-1.

    description: FAS (CD95/APO-1) is a type I transmembrane death receptor of 
      the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF6). The extracellular domain contains 
      three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) that bind FasL (FASLG/CD95L). This is 
      the defining molecular function of FAS. ISOFORM-SPECIFIC to membrane-bound
      isoform 1 (P25445-1).

      domain and intracellular death domain. Triggers apoptosis upon FasL binding
      by recruiting
