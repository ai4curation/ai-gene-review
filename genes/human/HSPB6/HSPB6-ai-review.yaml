description: >-
  HSPB6 (also known as HSP20 or HspB6) is a member of the small heat shock protein
  (sHSP) family. It functions as an ATP-independent molecular chaperone (holdase) that
  binds partially unfolded or denatured proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation,
  maintaining them in a folding-competent state. Unlike ATP-dependent chaperones such as
  HSP70, HSPB6 does not actively refold substrates. HSPB6 exists primarily as a homodimer
  and can form heterooligomers with HSPB1 and CRYAB. It is highly expressed in skeletal and
  smooth muscle, where it plays roles in smooth muscle vasorelaxation and cardiac contractility.
  Phosphorylation at Ser-16 by PKA regulates its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAZ) and
  its cardioprotective effects. HSPB6 also functions as a secreted cardiokine promoting
  angiogenesis via VEGFR2 activation.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation inferred from phylogenetic analysis across sHSP family members including
      alpha-crystallins (CRYAA, CRYAB) and HSPA1A. HSPB6 has well-documented anti-apoptotic
      functions, particularly in cardiomyocytes. UniProt notes that phosphorylation at Ser-16
      by PKA is required to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis. The P20L variant abolishes
      cardioprotective effects (PMID:18790732). HSPB6 overexpression protects hearts against
      ischemia/reperfusion injury, isoproterenol-triggered cardiac remodeling, endotoxin-induced
      myocardial dysfunction, and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, largely through inhibition of
      cardiomyocyte death via interactions with Akt, Bax, and ASK1 (PMID:22427880). This IBA
      annotation at the general level of "negative regulation of apoptotic process" is appropriate
      as a broad characterization, though for HSPB6 the anti-apoptotic role is primarily
      cardiac-specific.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The anti-apoptotic function of HSPB6 is well supported by multiple lines of evidence.
      The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and confirmed by extensive experimental
      literature on cardioprotection. While a more specific cardiac term (GO:0010667) is also
      annotated, this broader term is appropriate as the core anti-apoptotic function may not
      be restricted solely to cardiac muscle cells.

      IBA annotation for protein refolding inferred from phylogenetic analysis of Drosophila
      sHSP orthologs. However, HSPB6 is specifically a holdase-type chaperone that prevents
      aggregation of unfolded substrates but does not actively refold them. PMID:24382496
      describes HSPB6 as an "ATP-independent" sHSP that binds partially unfolded proteins
      to prevent their "irreversible aggregation." Active refolding requires ATP-dependent
      chaperones such as HSP70. PMID:19464326 tested HSPB members for refolding activity
      using a luciferase refolding assay and found that HSPB1 and CRYAB "chaperoned heat
      unfolded substrates and kept them folding competent" but HSPB6 was not among those
      shown to support refolding independently. The term "protein refolding" implies an
      active refoldase activity that HSPB6 does not possess.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      HSPB6 is a holdase chaperone, not a refoldase. It prevents aggregation but does not
      actively refold substrates. The appropriate process term is GO:0006457 "protein folding"
      (which is already annotated via IDA from PMID:14717697), as HSPB6 participates in the

      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). This IBA
      annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis across the sHSP family, including
      alpha-crystallins and other small heat shock proteins. The annotation correctly captures
      that HSPB6 binds unfolded/denatured proteins, as demonstrated by chaperone assays showing
      it prevents reduction-induced aggregation of insulin and heat-induced aggregation of
      alcohol dehydrogenase (PMID:14717697). However, simple "binding" to unfolded proteins
      is not the correct GO representation of chaperone function. HSPB6 is a holdase-type
      chaperone that binds partially unfolded substrates to prevent aggregation in an
      ATP-independent manner (PMID:24382496). The best available replacement is GO:0044183
      "protein folding chaperone", which is already annotated to HSPB6 via IMP evidence
      (PMID:24382496). Note that GO:0044183 is an imperfect fit since HSPB6 is specifically a

    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is scheduled for obsoletion. The term "unfolded protein binding" conflates

      as a holdase chaperone preventing irreversible aggregation. GO:0044183 "protein folding

      is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac tissue (UniProt:

      HSPB6 is actively secreted from cardiomyocytes via exosomes, independent of the

      cardiac-specific overexpression and was further elevated upon myocardial

      IDA annotation from PMID:14717697 (Bukach et al., 2004). This study characterized the

      At neutral pH, HSPB6 prevented reduction-induced aggregation of insulin and heat-induced
      aggregation of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase with activity similar to or higher than
      commercial alpha-crystallin. HSPB6 participates in the protein folding process by
      maintaining substrates in a folding-competent state (holdase activity), though it does

      annotation is based on PMID:19845507 (Fuchs et al., 2009), which demonstrated that
      HspB6 interacts with Bag3 through the conserved hydrophobic groove (beta4/beta8 strands)
      and that the HspB6-Bag3 complex promotes clearance of aggregated mutant huntingtin
      (Htt43Q). The paper describes sHSPs as proteins that "bind to unfolded or misfolded
      proteins and protect them from aggregation." The study also showed that deletion of
      Bag3 IPV motifs suppresses HspB8 chaperone activity toward mutant Htt43Q, and that
      HspB6-Bag3 promotes clearance of aggregated Htt43Q. This demonstrates HSPB6 acts as
      a chaperone for misfolded substrates, not merely as a passive binder. The appropriate
      replacement is GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone". Note that HSPB6 is specifically
