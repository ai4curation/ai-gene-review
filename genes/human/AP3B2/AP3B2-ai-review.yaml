description: >-
  AP3B2 encodes AP-3 complex subunit beta-2 (beta3B/beta-NAP), the neuron-specific
  large beta subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-3 adaptor complex. AP-3 mediates
  cargo selection and vesicle formation for protein sorting from trans-Golgi network
  and endosomes to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. In neurons, AP3B2-containing
  AP-3 complexes are preferentially localized to neuronal processes and function in
  synaptic vesicle biogenesis and recycling, cooperating with BLOC-1 to sort synaptic
  vesicle proteins. AP3B2 contains a clathrin-binding domain in its appendage region
  and interacts with ARF1 GTPases for membrane recruitment. Biallelic loss-of-function
  mutations cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy type 48 (DEE48),
  characterized by early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability.

    summary: >-
      AP3B2 as a component of the AP-3 adaptor complex is directly involved in vesicle-mediated
      transport. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference across multiple
      organisms including yeast, fly, worm, mouse, and human orthologs. This is consistent
      with the established role of AP-3 in mediating vesicle formation and cargo transport.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      AP-3 is a core component of the vesicle-mediated transport machinery. This is well
      established through the original identification of beta-NAP as a vesicle coat protein
      [PMID:7671305] and subsequent studies showing AP-3 function in cargo selection and
      vesicle budding. The IBA annotation correctly captures this fundamental function.

      AP3B2 is the neuron-specific beta subunit that distinguishes neuronal AP-3 from
      ubiquitous AP-3. Genetic studies in mice demonstrate that beta3B-containing AP-3

      This annotation accurately reflects the neuron-specific role of AP3B2-containing

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      AP3B2 functions as the beta subunit of neuronal AP-3 adaptor complex, mediating
      clathrin-coated vesicle cargo loading for protein sorting to lysosomes and
      synaptic vesicles. The beta3 subunit directly binds clathrin via its appendage
      domain. A key role of neuronal AP-3 is generating synaptic vesicles that respond
      specifically to high-frequency stimulation through recruitment of the phospholipid
      flippase ATP8A1 and its auxiliary subunit TMEM30A. ATP8A1 regulates phosphatidylserine
      distribution enabling synapsin recruitment to these vesicles. AP-3-derived vesicles
      contribute specifically to asynchronous neurotransmitter release, which affects
      the precision of postsynaptic firing. In dopamine neurons, AP-3 has dual functions:
      targeting VMAT2 to axons (conferring axonal polarity of dopamine release) and
      producing high-frequency-responsive synaptic vesicles essential for phasic
      dopamine signaling underlying learning and reward processing.
