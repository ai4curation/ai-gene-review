### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AP3B2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AP3B2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AP3B2** (gene ID: AP3B2, UniProt: Q13367) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan summary: We verified the identity and organism for AP3B2 (UniProt Q13367), gathered recent structural and authoritative review evidence on AP-3 recruitment, cargo recognition, localization, neuronal specificity, and human disease links, synthesized mechanistic and clinical insights, and prepared a source table for quick reference. Below is the comprehensive research report with citations, URLs, and publication dates.

Comprehensive research report: AP3B2 (Q13367), AP-3 complex subunit beta-2 (β3B/β-NAP)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: AP3B2 encodes the β3B (β-NAP) large subunit of the adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) heterotetramer, which contains δ, β3, μ3, and σ3 subunits. AP-3 mediates cargo selection and vesicle formation in endosomal trafficking. β3B is the neuron-enriched paralog of β3 (the other is β3A encoded by AP3B1), consistent with a specialized neuronal AP-3 isoform (often termed AP-3B) (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21).
- Cargo recognition: AP-3 recognizes canonical sorting motifs, including YxxØ signals via the μ3 subunit’s C-terminal domain and acidic dileucine [DE]xxxL[LI] signals via sites across σ3 and δ. These motifs underlie sorting of lysosomal and synaptic vesicle membrane proteins (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Recruitment: AP-3 is recruited to endosomal membranes by GTP-bound ARF family GTPases, particularly ARF1; phosphoinositide contributions (e.g., PtdIns3P) have been implicated. AP-3 can interact with clathrin but often mediates clathrin-independent vesicle formation (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 34-36).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Cryo-EM mechanism for AP-3 initiation: 2024 cryo-EM structures of human AP-3 in complex with myristoylated Arf1 and membrane-embedded cargo (LAMP1 YxxØ peptide) reveal membrane interfaces at δ–Arf1 and β3–Arf1, show AP-3 in a cargo-engaged state, and support a model in which Arf1 promotes AP-3 dimerization and initiation of a clathrin-independent coat on endosomal membranes. Depositions include EMDB EMD-45207–45214 and PDB 9C58–9C5C (published Dec 2024; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121). Reported overall and focused resolutions include ~4.5 Å overall with focused maps to ~4.3–5.6 Å; datasets contained up to ~1.2 million particles for nanodisc-bound complexes. These data provide structural support for Arf1-dependent recruitment, cargo capture by μ3, and nascent coat polymerization involving a β3–Arf1 interface (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 8-9, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 12-12, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 10-11, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 4-5).
- Conceptual synthesis: The structural work refines prior biochemical models of ARF1-dependent AP-3 recruitment and clarifies how cargo binding and membrane engagement may coordinate with AP-3 oligomerization to drive coat assembly without clathrin (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 4-5, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).

3) Primary function and localization
- Function: AP3B2 (β3B) functions as the β subunit within the neuronal AP-3 adaptor. AP-3 selects membrane cargo bearing YxxØ and acidic dileucine signals and forms transport carriers from endosomal tubules, contributing to delivery to late endosomes/lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (LROs), and, in neurons, to biogenesis of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and dense-core vesicles (DCVs) (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21).
- Subcellular localization: AP-3 localizes to tubular/recycling endosomes and defines endosomal exit sites for lysosomal membrane proteins; in neurons, AP-3 is found on early endosomal compartments where SV and lysosomal membrane proteins are sorted (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234; Mar 2009; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-05-0456) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, newelllitwa2009rolesofbloc1 pages 1-2).
- Neuronal cargo sorting: Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates neuronal AP-3 (containing β3B/AP3B2) cooperates with BLOC-1 to sort SV proteins; Ap3b2 knockout mice exhibit reductions in specific SV components, consistent with a role in presynaptic cargo selection (Mar 2009; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-05-0456) (newelllitwa2009rolesofbloc1 pages 1-2).

4) Interaction partners and pathway context
- AP-3 core subunits: δ, β3B (AP3B2), μ3, and σ3 assemble into the AP-3 adaptor; β3B is the neuron-specific β paralog (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21).
- Arf1: Structural and biochemical data support direct Arf1 binding at δ and β3 interfaces, mediating AP-3 recruitment and dimerization at endosomal membranes (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 4-5, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 10-11).
- Cargo receptors and accessory factors: AP-3 recognizes YxxØ cargo via μ3 and acidic dileucine cargo via σ3-δ; AP-3 also interfaces with HOPS subunit VPS41 in lysosomal trafficking contexts; BLOC-1 cooperates for neuronal SV cargo sorting (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234; Mar 2009; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-05-0456) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, newelllitwa2009rolesofbloc1 pages 1-2).
- Clathrin dependence: While AP-3 possesses a clathrin-binding motif, multiple lines of evidence—including 2024 structural work—support clathrin-independent coat assembly by AP-3 on endosomal membranes (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 8-9, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).

5) Human genetics, disease spectrum, and applications
- Neuron-specific β3B and disease: The β3B subunit (AP3B2) is expressed almost exclusively in the brain and was originally identified as a neuron-specific vesicle coat antigen (β-NAP). Biallelic loss-of-function in β3B has been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-48 (EIEE48), characterized by severe developmental delay and seizures, indicating a neuronal AP-3–related encephalopathy distinct from pigment/hematologic defects seen with AP3B1 (β3A) (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- AP-3 disease spectrum context: Mutations in other AP-3 subunits cause related syndromes with LRO and immune defects: AP3B1 (β3A) causes Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2), and AP3D1 (δ) causes Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 10 (HPS10) with immunodeficiency, neutropenia, seizures, and neurodevelopmental features. These define a spectrum of “coatopathies” involving AP-3 (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234; 2023 clinical genetics of AP3D1 cited therein) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 34-36).
- Real-world implementation: Genetic testing panels for developmental and epileptic encephalopathies increasingly include AP-3 subunit genes given established disease associations. While guidelines and panels evolve, the recognition of AP3B2 in severe early-onset epilepsy underscores its diagnostic relevance as part of coatopathy gene sets (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).

6) Expression specificity
- Tissue specificity: Authoritative review evidence indicates β3B (AP3B2) expression is largely restricted to brain, consistent with a neuronal role for AP-3B; β3B was initially detected as a neuron-specific antigen (β‑NAP) (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21).

7) Links to neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment (recent perspectives)
- Neurodevelopment: Reviews and foundational work connect AP-3 to synaptic and lysosomal trafficking—processes central to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuronal AP-3 (with AP3B2) sorts SV and lysosomal membrane cargo, and disruption produces synaptic protein changes and seizures in animal models and humans (Mar 2009; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e08-05-0456; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (newelllitwa2009rolesofbloc1 pages 1-2, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Neurodegeneration: Contemporary structural and conceptual advances underscore AP-3’s clathrin-independent role and coordination with Arf1 on endosomes, mechanisms which intersect with broader endolysosomal pathways implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Direct quantitative links between AP3B2 and Parkinson’s disease or autism proteomes were not resolved in the evidence collected here; thus, any such associations should be considered preliminary pending targeted validation (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 8-9, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).

8) Quantitative data and statistics
- Structural datasets: Cryo-EM studies reported ~1.2 million particles for AP-3–Arf1–cargo nanodisc complexes, with overall map resolutions around 4.5 Å and focused maps to ~4.3–5.6 Å; deposited coordinates (PDB 9C58–9C5C) and maps (EMDB EMD-45207–45214) were released in mid/late 2024, providing reproducible resources for AP-3 recruitment and cargo-binding analyses (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 12-12, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 10-11, begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 4-5).

Expert analysis
- Mechanistic role: AP3B2 supplies the β subunit scaffold for the neuronal AP-3 coat, positioning Arf1-binding interfaces and ear/hinge elements that enable membrane association and potential coat polymerization. The 2024 cryo-EM models unify cargo recognition (μ3 YxxØ pocket) with Arf1-mediated dimerization, advancing a mechanistic framework for clathrin-independent vesicle initiation on endosomes—particularly relevant to neurons where rapid SV/LRO protein turnover and polarized trafficking are essential (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 8-9, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Disease implications: The restricted neuronal expression of β3B explains why AP3B2 defects manifest primarily as epileptic encephalopathy without the classic pigmentation/hematologic features observed for AP3B1 or AP3D1 defects. These genotype–phenotype distinctions refine the concept of AP-3 coatopathies into sub-syndromes dictated by subunit expression and tissue specialization (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).

Verification of identity (mandatory steps)
- Symbol and protein match: AP3B2 encodes AP-3 complex subunit beta-2 (β3B/β‑NAP), a neuron-enriched β subunit of AP-3 (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Organism: Homo sapiens evidence is consistent across sources and reviews (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Family/domains alignment: AP3B2 is a large subunit of the adaptor protein complexes family; functional and structural evidence of AP-3 recruitment and cargo recognition aligns with the adaptor complexes’ architecture described in authoritative reviews and recent cryo-EM work (Dec 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411974121; Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (begley2024astructurebasedmechanism pages 8-9, dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 18-20).
- Ambiguity check: No conflicting gene symbols or non-human literature were used for the core claims; AP3B2 is neuron-specific β3B, distinct from AP3B1 (β3A) and from non-human orthologs (Oct 2019; https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100818-125234) (dellangelica2019coatopathiesgeneticdisorders pages 20-21).
