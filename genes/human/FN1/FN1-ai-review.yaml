description: Fibronectin is a major extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein and 
  one of the most important adhesion molecules in vertebrates. This large 2477 
  amino acid multidomain protein exists as a dimer and contains three types of 
  repeating modules (FN-I, FN-II, and FN-III repeats) that create distinct 
  binding sites for cells and other ECM components. The core functions of 
  fibronectin center on organizing the ECM architecture and mediating cell-ECM 
  interactions. Through its RGD motif in the FN-III10 domain, fibronectin 
  directly binds integrin receptors (particularly alpha5beta1, alpha4beta1, 
  alphaVbeta3) to mediate cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Fibronectin 
  serves as a key structural organizer by binding collagen types I-V and VII, 
  assembling into fibrillar networks, and coordinating ECM assembly. It also 
  binds fibrin through N-terminal and C-terminal sites, playing critical roles 
  in provisional matrix formation during wound healing and hemostasis. 
  Additional functions include binding heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans and
  serving as a ligand for various cell surface receptors. Fibronectin is 
  essential for embryonic development, particularly in mesoderm formation, 
  neural crest cell migration, heart development, and vascular morphogenesis. 
  While the protein participates in numerous biological contexts including wound
  healing, angiogenesis, and platelet function, its fundamental role is as an 
  ECM structural constituent and cell adhesion scaffold that integrates 
  mechanical and biochemical signals at the cell-matrix interface.

    review:
      summary: Fibronectin plays important roles in neural crest cell migration 
        and nervous system development during embryogenesis. However, this 
        represents a developmental context rather than a core molecular function
        of the mature protein.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While experimentally validated (PMID:26571399 demonstrates FN1 
        role in neural crest cell migration for enteric nervous system 
        development), nervous system development represents a specific 
        developmental context. The core function is ECM-mediated cell adhesion 
        and migration; nervous system development is one of many developmental 
        processes where these core functions are deployed. Appropriate to retain
        but mark as non-core.

    review:
      summary: Fibronectin is a key component in assembling focal adhesions and 
        cell-substrate junctions through integrin engagement. This is a core 
        function directly related to fibronectin's role as a cell adhesion 
        substrate.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Cell-substrate junction assembly (focal adhesion formation) is a 
        direct and core consequence of fibronectin-integrin interactions. The 
        RGD motif in FN-III10 mediates integrin binding which triggers focal 
        adhesion assembly. Multiple experimental studies confirm fibronectin's 
        central role in this process. This IBA annotation is well-supported and 
        represents core fibronectin biology.

      summary: Cell-matrix adhesion is one of the most fundamental and core 
        functions of fibronectin. Through integrin binding (RGD motif), 
        fibronectin directly mediates cell attachment to the ECM.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation captures the quintessential function of 
        fibronectin as a major cell adhesion molecule. Fibronectin serves as the
        primary ligand for multiple integrins (alpha5beta1, alpha4beta1, 
        alphaVbeta3, alphaVbeta1, alphaVbeta6, alpha8beta1) mediating 
        cell-matrix adhesion. This is extensively validated across decades of

        phylogenetically sound.

      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

        developmental context. Heart development is one of many developmental

      reason: This is the most important cellular component annotation for 
        fibronectin. Fibronectin is one of the major structural constituents of 
        the ECM, assembling into fibrillar networks that organize the matrix 
        architecture. Both cellular and plasma fibronectin ultimately localize 
        to and organize ECM. Extensively validated across decades of research 
        and multiple experimental approaches (IDA, HDA, ISS evidence in other 
        annotations). This IEA annotation is accurate and represents core 
        fibronectin localization.

    review:
      summary: Fibronectin acts as a ligand for integrin receptors and other 
        cell surface receptors, mediating cell signaling. This is a valid 
        molecular function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Fibronectin functions as a bona fide receptor ligand, particularly
        for integrin receptors (alpha5beta1, alpha4beta1, alphaVbeta3, etc.) 
        where it triggers intracellular signaling cascades upon binding. This 
        leads to focal adhesion kinase activation, MAPK signaling, PI3K/Akt 
        pathway activation, and other downstream events. The term accurately 
        describes fibronectin's role in receptor-mediated signaling. Accept as 
        valid molecular function.

        interactions, including inhibitory checkpoint receptors.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: PMID:34089617 demonstrates that blockade of fibronectin binding to
        checkpoint receptor ILT3/LILRB4 ameliorates autoimmune disease by 
        affecting monocyte activation. While experimentally validated, this 
        represents a specific immunomodulatory function in a particular disease 
        context rather than a core function. The fundamental role is receptor 
        binding; monocyte regulation is a downstream consequence in specific 
        contexts. Mark as non-core.

      summary: Fibronectin binds fibrin/fibrinogen forming complexes important 
        for provisional matrix and wound healing.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Fibronectin contains fibrin-binding sites at N-terminal and 
        C-terminal regions. Interaction with fibrin(ogen) is critical for 
        provisional matrix formation during hemostasis and wound healing. 
        Experimentally validated. Core molecular interaction. Accept.

        localization annotation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Fibronectin is a secreted protein localizing to extracellular 
        space. Both plasma fibronectin (soluble in body fluids) and cellular 
        fibronectin (assembled into ECM) occupy extracellular space. Appropriate
        cellular component annotation.

      summary: Fibronectin participates in fibrin clot formation through fibrin 
        binding, but this is a specific physiological context.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: Fibronectin-fibrin interaction contributes to clot formation and 
        provisional matrix assembly (PMID:3997886). However, blood coagulation 
        represents one specific biological context where fibronectin's core 
        binding functions are deployed. The fundamental activities are fibrin 
        binding and ECM organization. Mark as non-core.

      reason: High-throughput detection assays confirm fibronectin as an ECM 
        component. While multiple HDA annotations exist, they come from 
        different studies/contexts. ECM is the core localization. Accept but
