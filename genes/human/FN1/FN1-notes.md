# FN1 (Fibronectin 1) Notes - ISOFORMS Project

## Key Isoform Biology

FN1 is a classic example of **developmental/tissue-specific splicing** with 17 named isoforms.

### Core Alternative Splicing Events

The key splicing events involve:
1. **EDA domain** (Extra Domain A, also called EIIIA) - alternative exon
2. **EDB domain** (Extra Domain B, also called EIIIB) - alternative exon
3. **IIICS region** (Variable region, V region) - can be partially or completely included

### Functional Isoform Groups

| Isoform Type | EDA | EDB | Expression | Function |
|--------------|-----|-----|------------|----------|
| **Plasma FN** | - | - | Hepatocytes, soluble | Wound healing, blood clot |
| **Cellular FN** | + | +/- | Fibroblasts, solid | ECM assembly, embryonic development |
| **Oncofetal FN** | + | + | Embryonic, tumors | Angiogenesis, tumor progression |

### Critical Functional Differences

**EDA-containing isoforms:**
- Promote cell adhesion more strongly
- Essential for wound healing
- Re-expressed in cancer (oncofetal antigen)
- EDA-null mice have normal development but impaired wound healing

**EDB-containing isoforms:**
- Strong pro-angiogenic activity
- Expressed during embryonic development
- Re-expressed in tumor angiogenesis
- Target for cancer imaging/therapy (antibody L19)

**EDA/EDB double-null mice:**
- Cardiovascular defects
- Embryonic lethality or early postnatal death
- Demonstrates functional importance of these domains

### UniProt Isoform Summary

UniProt lists 17 isoforms including:
- Isoform 7: Contains EDB domain
- Isoform 8: Lacks EDA domain
- Isoform 9: Lacks both EDA and EDB, uses V64 variant
- Isoform 16: Migration stimulation factor (MSF)

## Expected Annotation Issues

1. **"Angiogenesis"** - may be specific to EDB+ isoforms
2. **"Wound healing"** - involves EDA+ isoforms
3. **"Embryonic development"** - EDA+/EDB+ isoforms re-expressed
4. **"Cell adhesion"** - all isoforms, but strength varies
