description: >-
  RFT1 encodes the Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol translocation protein, a multi-pass
  transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that functions as a glycolipid
  flippase. It catalyzes the translocation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO)
  intermediate M5GN2-PP-Dol from the cytosolic to the lumenal leaflet of the ER membrane,
  an essential step in the N-glycosylation pathway. RFT1 belongs to the MOP
  (multidrug/oligosaccharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide) transporter superfamily and contains
  approximately 12-14 transmembrane spans with both N- and C-termini facing the cytosol.
  The protein shows substrate selectivity for the M5 intermediate over shorter M3
  intermediates. Loss-of-function mutations cause RFT1-CDG (OMIM 612015), a severe
  congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities,
  epilepsy, and sensorineural deafness.

        The generic "protein binding" term is uninformative for GO annotation purposes,

        functional relevance to RFT1's core flippase activity. None of these
        interactors have established roles in the N-glycosylation or LLO translocation

        should be avoided when more specific molecular function terms are available.
