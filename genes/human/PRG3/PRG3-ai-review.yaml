  label: Homo sapiens
description: 'Proteoglycan 3 (eosinophil major basic protein 2, MBP-2), paralog of
  PRG2/MBP-1, encoded by adjacent gene on chromosome 11q12. Similar structure to PRG2:
  highly cationic mature protein preceded by acidic glycosylated prosegment. Like
  PRG2, synthesized as proteoglycan precursor with heavily glycosylated acidic N-terminal
  domain that neutralizes toxicity during biosynthesis, cleaved to yield active cationic
  protein. Stored in eosinophil secondary granules. Primary function is antiparasitic
  and antimicrobial effector via membrane disruption through cationic interactions.
  Binds heparin and sulfated polysaccharides. Released during eosinophil degranulation
  in response to helminth infection or allergic inflammation. Cytotoxic to parasites,
  bacteria, and host cells via membrane permeabilization. Lower expression than PRG2
  in eosinophils but similar biological activities. Also triggers mast cell/basophil
  degranulation and histamine release. Implicated in allergic diseases and asthma
  pathophysiology. Functions extracellularly after secretion from eosinophil granules.
  Contributes to host defense against parasitic worms and pathogenic microbes, but
  also mediates tissue damage in chronic eosinophilic inflammation.'
