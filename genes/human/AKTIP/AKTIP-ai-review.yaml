description: >-
  AKTIP (also known as FTS/Ft1) is a UEV-domain scaffold protein that lacks the catalytic
  cysteine
  required for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity. Its core functions include:
  (1) telomere
  replication support through interactions with shelterin components (TRF1/TRF2) and
  replication
  factors (PCNA/RPA70), facilitating replication through difficult telomeric DNA structures;
  (2) ESCRT-I adaptor function at the midbody during cytokinesis, where it interacts
  with VPS28
  and collaborates with TSG101 to recruit ESCRT-III components (CHMP4B, IST1) for
  abscission;
  (3) core component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex that links cytoplasmic dynein-1
  to
  various cargos for microtubule-based transport. AKTIP also interacts with A- and
  B-type lamins
  and localizes to the nuclear rim, linking telomere maintenance to nuclear architecture.
  Despite its name (AKT-interacting protein), the AKT interaction represents a minor
  aspect
  of its biology compared to its telomere and ESCRT functions.

        similarity without considering the critical absence of the catalytic residue.

      summary: >-
        This annotation suggests AKTIP is involved in K63-linked ubiquitination. However,
        AKTIP
        lacks the catalytic cysteine for E2 activity. While K63-linked ubiquitination
        is associated
        with UEV/UBC13 complexes (which AKTIP's yeast homolog participates in), there
        is no direct
        evidence that human AKTIP participates in K63-linked ubiquitination.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: >-
        The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference, but AKTIP lacks the
        catalytic cysteine.
        In yeast, related UEV proteins (like MMS2) work with UBC13 for K63 ubiquitination,
        but there
        is no direct evidence AKTIP participates in this process. The deep research
        focuses on AKTIP's
        roles in telomere replication, ESCRT function, and FHF complex - not ubiquitination.
        Requires more investigation to determine if AKTIP has a scaffold role in K63
        ubiquitination.

        While AKTIP's telomere replication support function does relate to handling

        The annotation is
        based on phylogenetic inference from yeast homologs involved in post-replication
        repair. AKTIP's
        primary function is more accurately described as telomere replication support
        rather than
        general DNA damage tolerance.

        The
        original 2004 paper by Remy & Michnick reported that AKTIP modulates apoptosis
        susceptibility
        in T lymphocytes via the AKT/GSK3/NFAT signaling cascade. However, subsequent
        extensive
        characterization has revealed AKTIP's core functions are telomere replication
        support and
        ESCRT-mediated cytokinesis - not apoptosis (file:human/AKTIP/AKTIP-deep-research-falcon.md).

        The apoptosis annotation derives from a single early study (PMID:14749367)

        AKTIP as an AKT-interacting protein affecting apoptosis susceptibility. However,
        comprehensive
        subsequent research (2015-2022) establishes AKTIP's core functions as: (1)
        telomere replication
        support through shelterin/PCNA interactions, (2) ESCRT-I adaptor for cytokinetic
        abscission,
        (3) FHF complex component for dynein cargo transport. Any effect on apoptosis
        is a downstream
        pleiotropic consequence, not a direct core function. The deep research review
        found no
        significant role for AKTIP in apoptosis pathways.

        AKTIP is a core component of the FHF (FTS-Hook-FHIP) complex. This study demonstrates
        AKTIP interacts directly with Hook proteins (HOOK1, HOOK2, HOOK3) and FHIP
        proteins,
        forming the complex that mediates perinuclear distribution of AP-4 and ATG9A
        cargo.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        FHF complex membership is a core function of AKTIP. This is well-documented
        with
        direct experimental evidence including co-IP, mutagenesis (WF->AA disrupts
        interactions),
        and functional assays.

      AKTIP supports telomeric DNA replication through interactions with shelterin
      components (TRF1/TRF2) and replication factors (PCNA/RPA70). This UEV-domain
      scaffold helps stabilize TRF1 engagement during replication through difficult
      telomeric DNA structures. Depletion causes fragile telomeres, TIFs, and STAs.

      AKTIP functions as an ESCRT-I adaptor at the midbody during cytokinetic abscission.
      It binds ESCRT-I subunit VPS28 and collaborates with TSG101 to recruit ESCRT-III
      components (CHMP4B, IST1) for membrane scission. Forms a characteristic ring
      structure at the midbody dark zone.
