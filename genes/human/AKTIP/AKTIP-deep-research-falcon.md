### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AKTIP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AKTIP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AKTIP** (gene ID: AKTIP, UniProt: Q9H8T0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human AKTIP (Q9H8T0) functional annotation

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Target gene/protein: AKT-interacting protein (AKTIP), UniProt Q9H8T0; synonyms: FTS/Ft1; human orthologue of mouse Ft1 and Drosophila Pendolino/Peo. Organism: Homo sapiens. Multiple primary studies identify AKTIP as a nuclear/telomeric factor and as an ESCRT-associated protein in human cell systems (hTERT fibroblasts, HeLa, 293T) (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6).

Key concepts and current definitions
- Domain family: AKTIP is a UEV/UBC-like protein (E2-variant) that lacks the catalytic cysteine needed for ubiquitin transfer, placing it closer to UEV/RWD-like scaffolds than active E2 enzymes (inference supported by homology and structure prediction) (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, giampietro2025thelaminassociatedtelomerica pages 12-14).
- Primary cellular roles: (1) Telomere replication support through interactions with shelterin (TRF1/TRF2) and replication factors (PCNA/RPA70); (2) Nuclear lamina/lamin-associated processes and senescence regulation; (3) ESCRT-associated function at the midbody during cytokinetic abscission, acting with ESCRT-I to recruit ESCRT-III (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20).

Structure, domains, and biochemical features
- UEV/E2-variant homology: AKTIP carries a UBC-like (UEV) core that structurally resembles E2/UEV folds but lacks the catalytic Cys; models predict a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet typical of UEVs and disordered termini potentially involved in regulation or partner binding (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, giampietro2025thelaminassociatedtelomerica pages 12-14).
- Shelterin binding: Direct biochemical interactions with TRF1 and TRF2 are demonstrated; mapping indicates binding to the TRF2 homodimerization (TRFH2) domain, consistent with a scaffold function at telomeres (torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 56-65).
- Replication factor contacts: AKTIP physically associates with PCNA and RPA70; purified proteins support a direct AKTIP–PCNA interaction (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 56-65).
- ESCRT association: AKTIP binds ESCRT-I subunit VPS28 (yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down), localizes in close proximity to TSG101/VPS28 rings at the midbody, and functions in ESCRT-III recruitment (CHMP4B, IST1) (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 10-13).

Cellular functions and pathways
1) Telomere replication and shelterin interplay
- Function: AKTIP facilitates telomeric DNA replication in concert with TRF1. AKTIP depletion in human primary fibroblasts causes reduced chromatin-bound PCNA, activation of intra-S checkpoint, S-phase arrest, and telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs). Telomere phenotypes include multiple telomeric signals (MTS; “fragile telomeres”) and sister telomere associations (STAs), phenocopying TRF1/BLM defects. Epistasis analysis shows AKTIP and TRF1 act in the same pathway for MTS formation (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 49-56).
- Mechanistic detail: In S phase, TRF1 is less tightly bound to telomeric DNA when AKTIP is depleted, consistent with a role stabilizing TRF1 engagement during replication through difficult telomeric DNA (G4, secondary structures). AKTIP transiently colocalizes with TRF1 at telomeres (~5–25% in asynchronous cells), consistent with S-phase-restricted function (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17).
- Context within shelterin: Reviews position AKTIP among noncore telomere replication facilitators (with TopIIα, others) that cooperate with core telomere protection by shelterin (TRF1/TRF2/TPP1/POT1/TIN2/RAP1) (lange2018shelterinmediatedtelomereprotection. pages 14-16).

2) Lamin interactions, nuclear envelope, and senescence
- Interactions and localization: AKTIP biochemically interacts with A-type and B-type lamins, localizes at the nuclear rim in interphase, and partially colocalizes with lamin A/C and lamin B1. Proper AKTIP rim localization requires functional lamin A (burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 56-65).
- Functional impact: AKTIP depletion perturbs lamin A (but not lamin C/B) expression and induces senescence-associated phenotypes, recapitulating aspects of progeroid states in cells and in mouse Ft1 models (burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 90-96).
- Disease-relevant mislocalization: In HGPS models (progerin expression) and HGPS patient fibroblasts, AKTIP is robustly mislocalized from the nuclear rim; in HeLa cells expressing progerin, AKTIP rim foci are reduced from approximately 2966/cell (control) to 1157/cell (progerin) without changes in AKTIP expression, and AKTIP does not co-accumulate in progerin aggregates (quantified by super-resolution; supports topology rather than sequestration) (torre2022combinedalterationof pages 9-13).

3) Cytokinesis and ESCRT pathway at the midbody
- Midbody architecture: High-resolution 3D-SIM shows AKTIP forms a ring encircling the dark zone (Flemming body) of the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis, with a measured internal ring diameter ~1.05 ± 0.03 μm and external diameter ~1.89 ± 0.077 μm, similar to rings of ESCRT-I (TSG101) and ESCRT-II (VPS36) and adjacent to ESCRT-III (IST1, CHMP2A, CHMP4B) (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6).
- Recruitment logic: AKTIP binds ESCRT-I subunit VPS28 via its UEV-containing region; AKTIP recruitment to the midbody is MKLP1-dependent and CEP55-independent, and AKTIP and TSG101 are independently recruited (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 10-13).
- Functional consequence: AKTIP collaborates with TSG101 to recruit ESCRT-III. Combined depletion reduces CHMP4B recruitment; AKTIP depletion impairs IST1 recruitment and causes abscission defects and multinucleation (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 27-28).
- Broader ESCRT context: ESCRT-III and VPS4 execute reverse membrane scission in abscission and also participate in nuclear envelope reformation and sealing of ruptures (CHMP7–LEM2 axis), situating AKTIP’s ESCRT association within membrane remodeling pathways that preserve genome integrity (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 29-30, olmos2022theescrtmachinery pages 7-9).

Subcellular localization dynamics
- Interphase: nuclear rim enrichment in puncta; intranuclear foci partially overlapping lamins; detergent-resistant nuclear signals (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6).
- S phase: transient telomeric association with TRF1 during replication (co-localization ~5–25% in asynchronous cells) (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17).
- Mitosis/abscission: enrichment at spindle poles/centrosomes and formation of a ring encircling the midbody dark zone; loss of signal upon AKTIP knockdown confirms specificity (burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6).

Recent developments and 2023–2024 literature
- Nuclear envelope–telomere links: A 2023 review synthesizes emerging ties between mammalian telomeres and the nuclear envelope/lamina, noting AKTIP among factors linking telomere maintenance and the NE and discussing relevance to laminopathies and cancer (Genes, 2023) (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17).
- ESCRT and genome integrity: A 2024 review focuses on ESCRT roles at the nuclear membrane and midbody, highlighting how ESCRT dysfunction co-drives genome damage and disease; annotations place AKTIP near ESCRT-I (e.g., TSG101) and note its recruitment to the midbody (Cells, 2024) (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 29-30).
- ESCRT in NE repair: Mechanistic review (2022) consolidates CHMP7–LEM2-mediated ESCRT-III nucleation and VPS4-driven sealing of nuclear envelope ruptures, providing a framework for AKTIP-linked ESCRT functions impacting nuclear integrity (Membranes, 2022) (olmos2022theescrtmachinery pages 7-9).

Current applications and implementations
- Biomarker/topology readouts: Super-resolution quantification of AKTIP topology at the nuclear rim, combined with lamin expression and nuclear morphometrics, has been proposed as a composite analytical approach to better stratify lamin-associated changes in tumor cells, with translational evaluation suggested toward risk biomarkers (J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 2022) (torre2022combinedalterationof pages 9-13).
- Mechanistic targets in cytokinesis: The AKTIP–VPS28 axis offers a defined node within the abscission machinery that could be exploited to probe abscission defects and mitotic vulnerabilities in disease contexts where ESCRT function is altered (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20).

Expert opinions and authoritative sources
- Shelterin and telomere replication/protection: Authoritative reviews outline the division of labor in shelterin and enumerate accessory replication aids (placing AKTIP among factors promoting telomere replication), establishing the conceptual framework for AKTIP’s telomere role (Annual Review of Genetics, 2018) (lange2018shelterinmediatedtelomereprotection. pages 14-16).
- ESCRT machinery in membrane remodeling and NE repair: Reviews articulate ESCRT’s centrality in abscission and nuclear envelope sealing, contextualizing AKTIP’s ESCRT-I association (Membranes, 2022; Cells, 2024) (olmos2022theescrtmachinery pages 7-9, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 29-30).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Telomere/S-phase: AKTIP–TRF1 co-localization at telomeres ~5–25% in asynchronous cells; AKTIP depletion reduces chromatin-bound PCNA and causes S-phase arrest (human primary fibroblasts) (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14).
- Midbody architecture: AKTIP 3D-SIM ring dimensions at the midbody: internal diameter ~1.05 ± 0.03 μm; external ~1.89 ± 0.077 μm (merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6).
- HGPS/progerin mislocalization: In progerin-expressing HeLa cells, AKTIP rim foci decreased from ~2966/cell to ~1157/cell without changes in AKTIP protein/mRNA; in HGPS fibroblasts, AKTIP does not co-accumulate with progerin aggregates (torre2022combinedalterationof pages 9-13).
- Mouse genetic interaction: Ft1+/kof;p53+/ko animals showed ~15.6% death incidence (n=64), and p53 dosage modulated Ft1 depletion phenotypes, implicating DNA damage/senescence pathways (torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 90-96).

Limitations and open questions
- Biochemical activity: Despite UEV homology, no catalytic E2 activity has been demonstrated; AKTIP likely functions as a scaffold/adaptor at telomeres and ESCRT sites (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20).
- Direct role in NE repair: While AKTIP’s ESCRT interactions and nuclear rim enrichment suggest potential involvement, direct demonstrations of AKTIP at NE rupture repair remain to be established; existing evidence is inferential from ESCRT function and AKTIP localization (olmos2022theescrtmachinery pages 7-9, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6).

Summary of primary function and localization
- AKTIP is a UEV-like scaffold that supports telomere replication by stabilizing TRF1 engagement and recruiting/retaining replication factors (PCNA/RPA) at telomeres in S phase; it localizes to the nuclear rim in interphase and forms a defined ring at the midbody where, via VPS28 and in parallel to TSG101, it aids ESCRT-III recruitment to drive abscission. Its interactions with lamins link telomere maintenance, nuclear architecture, and senescence, and its topology at the nuclear rim is sensitive to laminopathies (e.g., HGPS) and altered nuclear morphology (burla2015aktipft1anew pages 11-14, burla2015aktipft1anew pages 15-17, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 3-6, merigliano2021aktipinteractswith pages 19-20, torre2022combinedalterationof pages 9-13).

| Disease / biomedical observations (HGPS & cancer notes) | Progerin expression (HGPS) and altered lamin/nuclear morphology mislocalize AKTIP (e.g., AKTIP rim foci reduced from ~2966/cell to ~1157/cell in LV-progerin HeLa); AKTIP perturbation linked to senescence/progeroid phenotypes and to altered tumor cell AKTIP topology; mouse Ft1 (AKTIP) depletion yields developmental defects and genetic interaction with p53 (e.g., Ft1+/kof;p53+/ko death incidence ~15.6%, n=64). | Cell transduction (LV-progerin), IF quantification, WB/RT‑qPCR, mouse genetics, tumor cell imaging. | J Exp Clin Cancer Res, La Torre et al., 2022; Torre et al., 2016; Burla et al., 2016; Giampietro 2025 (commentary) | https://doi.org/10.1186/s13046-022-02480-5 ; n/a (Torre 2016) ; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.160103 ; n/a (Giampietro 2025) | (torre2022combinedalterationof pages 9-13, torre2016thetelomericprotein pages 90-96, burla2016thetelomericprotein pages 5-6, giampietro2025thelaminassociatedtelomerica pages 12-14) |
