description: >-
  BCL2L12 (Bcl-2-like protein 12) is an atypical anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family,
  characterized by a proline-rich structure with PxxP motifs, a C-terminal BH2 domain, and
  a BH3-like motif (lacking classical BH1/BH3/BH4 and transmembrane regions). BCL2L12
  functions as a dual-site apoptosis inhibitor: in the cytoplasm, it blocks post-mitochondrial
  apoptosis by directly inhibiting effector caspases (particularly caspase-7, and attenuating
  caspase-3 activation); in the nucleus, it binds and antagonizes p53 transcriptional activity,
  preventing induction of p53 target genes (p21, DR5, Noxa, PUMA). BCL2L12 is overexpressed
  in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) where it contributes to therapy resistance. GSK3beta
  phosphorylates BCL2L12 at Ser156, which is required for its anti-apoptotic function.
  Two major isoforms exist: full-length BCL2L12 (~250 aa) and truncated BCL2L12A (~176 aa,
  lacking exon 3).

  review:
    summary: >-
      BCL2L12 localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear localization is functionally
      important as nuclear BCL2L12 forms complexes with p53 and inhibits p53 transcriptional
      activity (Stegh & DePinho, 2011; PMID:20837658).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is well-established and functionally significant. The IBA annotation
      is consistent with experimental evidence from PMID:20837658 showing nuclear localization
      in GBM models.

      BCL2L12 inhibits p53-dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis through direct physical

      This is a core function of BCL2L12. The IBA annotation accurately captures the specific

      DNA damage, as demonstrated experimentally.

      BCL2L12 is a bona fide anti-apoptotic protein with evolved mechanisms for apoptosis
      inhibition. The generic 'apoptotic process' annotation from the UniProt Apoptosis
      keyword is too vague - the protein specifically negatively regulates apoptosis.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While BCL2L12 is legitimately involved in apoptotic processes as a Bcl-2 family member,
      this annotation should be more specific. The protein functions as an anti-apoptotic
      factor through caspase inhibition and p53 antagonism, not as a general participant
      in apoptosis.

      PMID:19946888 is a high-throughput membrane proteomics study of NK cells that
      identified 1843 proteins. BCL2L12 detection in membrane fractions is unexpected
      given that BCL2L12 lacks a transmembrane domain (unlike typical Bcl-2 family members).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      BCL2L12 is atypical among Bcl-2 family members in lacking a transmembrane domain.
      Its established localization is cytoplasm and nucleus, not membrane. The HDA detection
      in membrane fractions from a large-scale study likely represents contamination or
      transient association rather than functional membrane localization. The primary
      literature consistently describes BCL2L12 as cytoplasmic and nuclear.

    summary: >-
      This annotation suggests BCL2L12 positively regulates Pol II transcription. However,
      the primary literature describes BCL2L12 as inhibiting p53-mediated transcription,
      which would be negative regulation. The annotation may reflect indirect effects.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The citation PMID:22262180 focuses on BCL2L12's anti-apoptotic role and GSK3beta
      regulation, not direct transcriptional regulation. BCL2L12's known transcriptional
      role is inhibiting p53 target gene transcription. Without access to the full text
      showing direct evidence for positive transcriptional regulation, this annotation
      requires further verification.
