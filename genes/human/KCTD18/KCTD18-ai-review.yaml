description: >-
  KCTD18 is a poorly characterized BTB/POZ domain-containing protein of the KCTD family.
  It contains an N-terminal T1-type BTB domain (aa 12-80) and a KCTD18-specific C-terminal
  domain. AlphaFold2 structural modeling predicts a stable 1:1 BTB-Cullin 3 interaction,
  suggesting KCTD18 may function as a CRL3 (Cullin-RING ligase 3) substrate adaptor.
  Unlike many KCTD family members that form pentamers, KCTD18 is predicted to be monomeric.
  No substrates, cellular localization, or enzymatic activities have been experimentally
  validated for KCTD18. The protein's function remains to be determined through direct
  experimental investigation.

    label: identical protein binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is inferred by the ARBA machine learning model, likely based
      on
      the presence of the BTB/POZ domain. BTB domains are known to mediate protein-protein
      interactions, including self-association. However, per curation guidelines,
      'protein
      binding' and related generic terms like 'identical protein binding' are discouraged
      as they do not convey informative molecular function. For KCTD family proteins,
      a more informative annotation would be cullin binding if experimentally validated.
      AlphaFold2 modeling predicts KCTD18 BTB can bind CUL3 in a 1:1 complex [Balasco
      et al., 2024],
      but this remains unvalidated experimentally. Given the lack of specificity
      of this
      term and absence of experimental validation, this annotation should be removed.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Generic 'protein binding' terms are uninformative per GO curation guidelines.
      While BTB domains do mediate protein interactions, the specific interactors
      for
      KCTD18 are not experimentally established. Structural predictions suggest
      CUL3
      binding [Balasco et al., 2024], but this requires experimental validation
      before
      annotation. The term should be replaced with a more specific function term
      once
      experimental evidence is available.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is electronically inferred from the T1-type BTB domain (InterPro:IPR003131).
      While many BTB domain proteins do form homo-oligomers, recent structural prediction
      analysis suggests KCTD18 may be an exception. Balasco et al. (2024) report
      that
      AlphaFold2 models predict KCTD18 to be monomeric, in contrast to other KCTD
      family
      members that form pentamers (e.g., KCTD5). This automated annotation appears
      to
      be incorrect based on current structural predictions.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Recent AlphaFold2-based structural analysis predicts KCTD18 is monomeric rather
      than oligomeric [Balasco et al., 2024]. While the T1-type BTB domain in many
      proteins does mediate oligomerization, KCTD18 appears to be an outlier in
      the
      KCTD family. The InterPro-based inference is too broad and does not account
      for
      protein-specific structural features. This annotation should be removed until
      experimental evidence (e.g., SEC-MALS, native MS) confirms the oligomeric
      state.
