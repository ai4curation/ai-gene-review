## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9P287
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein; AltName: Full=P21- and CDK-associated protein 1; AltName: Full=Protein TOK-1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BCCIP; Synonyms=TOK1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the BCP1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** BCP1_family. (IPR025602); BCCIP (PF13862)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BCCIP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BCCIP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BCCIP** (gene ID: BCCIP, UniProt: Q9P287) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity and aliases: BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A/p21‑interacting protein; also TOK1) is a human protein originally identified by its interactions with BRCA2 and p21/CDKN1A, consistent with the UniProt Q9P287 description (human) (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2, huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).
- Organism: All evidence cited here is from human studies or mammalian cells; the α isoform is primate‑restricted, further supporting the human context (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9).
- Family/domains: BCCIP is the metazoan homolog of yeast Bcp1 and functions in 60S ribosome biogenesis; reviews and primary work place human BCCIP in the Bcp1/BCCIP group of 60S biogenesis factors, aligning with the BCP1 family/domain annotation (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein and isoforms: Human BCCIP encodes two major splice isoforms, BCCIPα (322 aa) and BCCIPβ (314 aa), which share an identical ~258 aa N‑terminal region but have distinct C‑termini; both possess a nuclear localization signal in the shared region (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 3-5). BCCIPα and BCCIPβ differ dramatically in 3D structure (“distinct folds”), despite high sequence identity, yielding isoform‑specific functions (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 3-5, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9).
- Primary molecular role: BCCIP is a non‑enzymatic regulator/adaptor in several pathways: homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair with BRCA2/RAD51; transcriptional regulation of p21 via p53 and YY1/INO80; large subunit (60S) ribosome biogenesis via nucleolar recruitment of eIF6 and 12S pre‑rRNA production; and mitotic spindle/centrosome organization (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2, kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).
- Enzymatic status: BCCIP itself has no demonstrated catalytic activity; rather, BCCIPα directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of FAM46/TENT5 noncanonical poly(A) polymerases by binding their active site, while BCCIPβ stimulates the recombinase activity of RAD51 by promoting ADP release from RAD51 filaments (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14).

2) Molecular mechanisms and pathways
- Homologous recombination and replication stress
  • BRCA2/RAD51 focus formation and HR: BCCIP depletion reduces BRCA2 and RAD51 foci and decreases HR repair efficiency by ~20–100‑fold in reporter assays, establishing BCCIP as a BRCA2 partner in HR (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2005; https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.25.5.1949-1957.2005; Mar 2005) (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2).
  • RAD51 filament regulation (isoform‑specific): Purified human BCCIPβ binds RAD51 and promotes ADP release from RAD51 presynaptic filaments, enhancing homologous DNA pairing; maximal stimulation occurs at ~2 BCCIP per RAD51 protomer (Nucleic Acids Research, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw877; Sep 2017) (kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14). These data mechanistically link BCCIPβ to maintaining the active, ATP‑bound RAD51 filament during HR (kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14).
  • Replication stress and genome maintenance: Mouse and cell studies show BCCIP deficiency elevates spontaneous chromatid breaks and chromatin bridges and reduces Rad51 levels/foci, consistent with roles in resolving stalled forks and suppressing replication stress (summarized in Ye et al., NAR 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1114; Nov 2020) (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).

- Transcriptional regulation of p21(CDKN1A) and p53
  • p53 transactivation: BCCIP is required for wild‑type p53 transactivation; BCCIP knockdown reduces p53 binding to the p21 and MDM2 promoters and impairs p53 tetramerization (J. Biol. Chem., 2007; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M607520200; Jan 2007) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 14-14).
  • YY1/INO80 axis and p21 promoter occupancy: YY1 and BCCIP co‑occupy the p53 responsive element of the p21 promoter and coordinately regulate p21 transactivation; YY1 can repress whereas BCCIP enhances p53RE‑driven transcription in context‑dependent fashion (Int. J. Mol. Sci., 2019; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20092095; Apr 2019) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 13-14). A related study showed INO80/YY1 complexes regulate BCCIP transcription itself, reinforcing a feedback loop (Protein & Cell, 2016; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-016-0306-1; Aug 2016) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 13-14).

- Ribosome biogenesis (60S subunit)
  • Nucleolar targeting and eIF6 recruitment: An acidic N‑terminal motif in BCCIP drives nucleolar localization and is required to recruit eIF6 to nucleoli; BCCIP is essential for production of the 12S pre‑rRNA (precursor to 5.8S rRNA) and thus for 60S subunit biogenesis (Nucleic Acids Research, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1114; Nov 2020) (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).
  • Family placement: Reviews of human ribosome assembly discuss Bcp1/BCCIP as a conserved 60S biogenesis factor, consistent with BCP1 family/domain annotations (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).

- Mitotic spindle and centrosomes
  • BCCIP (notably BCCIPα) localizes to centrosomes and spindle poles, participates in microtubule organization and spindle architecture; depletion causes spindle disorientation, chromosome congression defects, and delayed mitosis (Oncogene, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.92; Apr 2017) (huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2).

- Regulation and localization
  • Subcellular localization: BCCIP resides in the nucleus and, in part, nucleolus; BCCIPα contains an NLS and can drive nuclear localization of binding partners (e.g., FAM46A/C), increasing their nucleus:cytosol ratio; BCCIPβ also has nuclear roles but lacks the FAM46 interaction (Sci. Adv., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf5583; Apr 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 2-3, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2). BCCIP also localizes to centrosome/spindle poles during mitosis (huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2).
  • Transcriptional regulation: YY1/INO80 regulates BCCIP gene expression; BCCIP in turn cooperates with YY1 and p53 at the p21 promoter (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 13-14). MicroRNA regulation has been reported in disease contexts, but mechanistic BCCIP‑directed miRNA data are limited in the present curated sources.

3) 2023–2024 developments and latest research
- Isoform‑specific structure and fold switching (2023)
  • High‑resolution structures of FAM46A/BCCIPα and cryo‑EM of FAM46C/BCCIPα reveal BCCIPα adopts a unique fold completely different from BCCIPβ; a BCCIPα helix‑loop‑helix inserts into the FAM46 active‑site cleft, sterically blocking RNA/ATP binding and inhibiting PAP activity; structures deposited (e.g., PDB 8EXE/8EXF, 8EQB; published Apr 5, 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf5583) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 14-14, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 5-6, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2).
  • The authors highlight this as a striking case where alternative splicing yields isoforms with distinct folds, offering an experimentally validated example of fold switching in humans (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 3-5, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9).

- AlphaFold limitations for fold‑switching proteins (2024)
  • A 2024 Nature Communications analysis of AlphaFold predictions for fold‑switchers reports that AF2/AF3 poorly predict fold switching and often memorize training structures; BCCIPα is discussed among recent structures outside AF training, illustrating AF’s limitations in capturing the BCCIPα vs BCCIPβ fold divergence (Nature Communications, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51801-z; Aug 2024) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2).

- Chemoproteomics and cysteine‑targeting ligands (2023–2024)
  • A 2023 Nature Chemical Biology study mapped the human “sulfenome” and showed nucleophilic covalent fragments can engage cysteine‑sulfenic acids across proteins; the authors demonstrated that nucleophilic fragments can perturb functions in nuclear oncoprotein transport and DNA damage repair and assessed BCCIP as a perturbable target in this context (Nature Chemical Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-023-01330-5; May 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).
  • A 2024 review of quantitative proteomics and covalent ligand discovery cites a fragment MM2‑48 that targets BCCIP Cys141 (C141) and states it more potently inhibits homologous recombination repair than ibrutinib, highlighting a nascent chemical probe space around BCCIP (Frontiers in Chemical Biology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fchbi.2024.1352676; Jan 2024) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).

- Additional 2023 disease‑relevant observations
  • Cancer transcriptome studies in 2023 continue to mention BCCIP among cell‑cycle/HR‑related targets and prognostic gene sets; for example, in NSCLC, BCCIP expression has been associated with worse survival and functional connections to cell‑cycle RNA processing networks (PeerJ, 2023; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.16526; Dec 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13). Reviews of YY1 in colorectal cancer discuss YY1/BCCIP autoregulatory recruitment to the BCCIP promoter and BCCIP’s role in YY1‑dependent programs (Cancer Medicine, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.5745; Mar 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).

4) Current applications and implementations
- Genome engineering: RAD51‑enhanced inter‑homolog repair (IHR) in embryos shows that adding BCCIP together with a RAD51 G151D variant can enhance homozygous gene conversion, indicating practical utility of BCCIP in CRISPR knock‑in strategies (Cell, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.035; Jun 2021) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).
- Chemical probes: Emerging nucleophilic fragment chemoproteomics and fragment MM2‑48 targeting BCCIP C141 provide avenues to modulate HR or BCCIP‑dependent processes in cells, with potential for research probes and, possibly, therapeutic leads (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).

5) Subcellular localization and regulation
- Nuclear and nucleolar pools: BCCIP is predominantly nuclear; a fraction (including BCCIPβ) is nucleolar, where an acidic N‑terminal motif drives localization and eIF6 recruitment for 60S production (NAR, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1114; Nov 2020) (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16). BCCIPα can recruit cytoplasmic FAM46A/C into the nucleus, increasing their nuclear enrichment (Sci. Adv., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adf5583; Apr 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 2-3, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2).
- Centrosome/spindle: BCCIP (notably α) localizes proximal to the mother centriole and to spindle poles; depletion leads to spindle disorientation and mitotic delay, linking BCCIP to accurate chromosome segregation (Oncogene, 2017; https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2017.92; Apr 2017) (huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2).
- Transcriptional feedback: YY1/INO80 regulate BCCIP expression; BCCIP partners with YY1 and p53 to regulate p21 promoter occupancy and transactivation (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 13-14).

6) Binding partners and biochemical interactions (selected)
- BRCA2 and RAD51: BCCIP co‑localizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 nuclear foci; BCCIPβ directly enhances RAD51 filament activity; BCCIP depletion abrogates BRCA2/RAD51 foci and HR (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2, kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14).
- CDKN1A/p21 and p53: BCCIP binds p21 and supports p53 transactivation at p21 and MDM2 promoters (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 14-14).
- YY1/INO80: Physical and functional associations at the p21 promoter and in regulation of BCCIP gene transcription (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 13-14).
- FAM46/TENT5: BCCIPα binds into the active site of FAM46A/C/D to inhibit PAP activity; BCCIPβ does not bind/inhibit (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2).
- eIF6: BCCIP recruits eIF6 to nucleoli and is required for 12S pre‑rRNA production in 60S biogenesis (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12).

7) Disease links and quantitative data
- HR deficiency phenotypes: BCCIP knockdown reduces HR by ~20–100× and eliminates RAD51/BRCA2 foci after damage (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2005; https://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.25.5.1949-1957.2005) (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2).
- Astrocytoma/glioblastoma: In human astrocytic tumors, ~45% lacked detectable BCCIP protein and ~45% of glioblastomas showed significant BCCIP copy‑number reduction; loss correlated with higher tumor grade (BMC Cancer, 2009; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-9-268; Aug 2009) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).
- Breast cancer patterns: BCCIP downregulation can suppress initiation but appear required for tumor progression in experimental models, indicating complex roles in tumor biology (Cancer Research, 2013; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1766; Dec 2013) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).
- Lung cancer: Transcriptomic analyses in NSCLC report BCCIP within cell‑cycle/HR programs and associations with shorter survival in LUAD cohorts, supporting potential prognostic relevance (PeerJ, 2023; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.16526; Dec 2023) (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).

8) Expert perspectives and analysis
- HR pathway placement: BCCIP functions upstream and at the level of RAD51 filament regulation (via BCCIPβ) and BRCA2 foci assembly; its depletion produces classic HR‑defect signatures (loss of RAD51 foci, strong HR reporter deficits) (lu2005thebrca2interactingprotein pages 1-2, kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14). These non‑enzymatic roles make BCCIP a scaffold/accessory factor for HR, rather than a catalytic core enzyme (kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14).
- Ribosome biogenesis: The BCCIP–eIF6 axis ties BCCIP to nucleolar 60S assembly; the requirement for 12S pre‑rRNA production explains why partial BCCIP loss can be tumorigenic (genome instability) while complete loss is lethal (ribosome biogenesis failure) (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, ye2020bccipisrequired pages 16-16).
- Isoform‑resolved biology: The discovery that BCCIPα and BCCIPβ assume distinct folds provides a structural logic for their divergent functions—RNA metabolism (via FAM46 inhibition) versus DNA repair (via RAD51 stimulation), and highlights the limits of purely sequence‑based function prediction (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 3-5, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2).
- Tool development: Chemoproteomic mapping of cysteine sulfenic acids and nucleophilic fragments (including an agent reported to target BCCIP Cys141) and the deployment of BCCIP in genome editing workflows illustrate translational opportunities (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).

Conclusions
Human BCCIP (Q9P287) is a multifunctional, non‑enzymatic regulator with isoform‑specific activities: BCCIPβ is an HR accessory factor that activates RAD51 filaments, while BCCIPα adopts a unique fold to inhibit FAM46/TENT5 PAPs and to relocalize partners to the nucleus (kelso2017theβisoformof pages 13-14, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 2-3). Beyond HR, BCCIP is required for nucleolar eIF6 recruitment and 12S pre‑rRNA production during 60S biogenesis, and it safeguards mitotic spindle integrity (ye2020bccipisrequired pages 10-12, huhn2017regulationofspindle pages 1-2). Recent structural and chemoproteomic studies (2023–2024) sharpen isoform‑resolved mechanisms, reveal AlphaFold’s limits on predicting BCCIP fold switching, and nominate BCCIP cysteines as covalent‑ligandable sites, opening avenues for chemical probes and potential therapeutic modulation (liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 6-9, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 1-2, liu2023inhibitionoffam46tent5 pages 12-13).
