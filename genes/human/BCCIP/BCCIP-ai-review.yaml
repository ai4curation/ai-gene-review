description: >-
  BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein, also known as TOK-1) is a multifunctional
  nuclear protein that functions as a non-enzymatic regulator/adaptor in multiple
  pathways.
  Two major isoforms exist: BCCIPalpha (322 aa) and BCCIPbeta (314 aa) which share
  an N-terminal
  region but have distinct C-termini that adopt completely different folds, conferring
  isoform-specific functions. BCCIPbeta directly enhances RAD51 recombinase activity
  by
  promoting ADP release from RAD51 presynaptic filaments during homologous recombination
  DNA repair. BCCIPalpha inhibits FAM46/TENT5 poly(A) polymerases by binding their
  active
  site. BCCIP is also required for nucleolar recruitment of eIF6 and 12S pre-rRNA
  production
  during 60S ribosome biogenesis, consistent with its membership in the BCP1 family.
  During
  mitosis, BCCIP localizes to centrosomes and spindle poles where it participates
  in
  microtubule organization and spindle architecture. BCCIP also cooperatively enhances
  p21/CDKN1A-dependent inhibition of CDK2 activity.

      BCCIP belongs to the BCP1 family and is required for nucleolar recruitment of
      eIF6 and 12S pre-rRNA production during 60S ribosome biogenesis. An acidic
      N-terminal motif drives nucleolar localization.

      BCCIP, particularly BCCIPalpha, localizes to centrosomes and spindle poles
      during mitosis. BCCIP cooperates with the dynein epistatic group to ensure
      faithful spindle assembly. Depletion causes spindle defects and mitotic delays.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the relative contribution of the two BCCIP isoforms to each of its
      multiple functions (HR, ribosome biogenesis, spindle assembly, CDK regulation)?
  - question: >-
      Does BCCIP's role in 60S ribosome biogenesis contribute to its tumor suppressor
      function, and is this separable from its DNA repair role?
  - question: >-
      What is the physiological significance of BCCIPalpha inhibition of FAM46/TENT5
      poly(A) polymerases?

suggested_experiments:

      which functions are dependent on alpha vs beta isoforms
  - description: >-

      their sequence
