## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q96PV0
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ras/Rap GTPase-activating protein SynGAP; AltName: Full=Neuronal RasGAP; AltName: Full=Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1; Short=Synaptic Ras-GAP 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SYNGAP1; Synonyms=KIAA1938;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** C2_dom. (IPR000008); C2_domain_sf. (IPR035892); DAB2P_C. (IPR021887); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SYNGAP1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SYNGAP1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SYNGAP1** (gene ID: SYNGAP1, UniProt: Q96PV0) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
Objective 1 (identity) was completed: The target is human SYNGAP1 (UniProt Q96PV0), encoding SynGAP, a synaptic Ras/Rap GTPase-activating protein; synonyms include KIAA1938; domain architecture and postsynaptic localization are consistent across sources (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 1-4, jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8).

Comprehensive research report on human SYNGAP1 (Q96PV0)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and synonyms: SYNGAP1 (6p21) encodes SynGAP, a neuronally enriched GTPase-activating protein; common synonym KIAA1938. SynGAP is a core component of excitatory postsynaptic signaling complexes (PSD) (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8, aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 1-4). URL examples: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032 (Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, Feb 2016); https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.01.25336001 (medRxiv, Oct 2025).
- Domain architecture and isoforms: SynGAP contains an N‑terminal PH-like region, a C2 domain, a canonical GAP domain homologous to RasGAPs, and a disordered C-terminus with isoform-specific splicing at both N- and C-termini; isoforms confer distinct synaptic effects (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 1-4, aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 19-22). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.01.25336001 (medRxiv, Oct 2025).
- Subcellular localization and complex: SynGAP is among the most abundant proteins in the postsynaptic density, associates with PSD-95 and NMDAR complexes, and is positioned to regulate synaptic Ras/Rap signaling in spines (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032 (Feb 2016).
- Biochemical function: SynGAP is a GAP for Ras and Rap GTPases; multiple studies report potent regulation of Rap relative to Ras. SynGAP thereby modulates MAPK/ERK and Rap1/2-dependent synaptic pathways (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8, cherra2024interactionsbetweenras pages 3-5). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032 (Feb 2016); https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2024.1352731 (Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, Feb 2024).
- Regulation by phosphorylation: SynGAP is phosphorylated by CaMKII and CDK5; phosphorylation shifts GAP activities (e.g., increases Ras‑ and/or Rap‑GAP activity in vitro), providing state-dependent control of GTPase signaling at the PSD (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032 (Feb 2016).
- Functional role at synapses: SynGAP constrains AMPAR insertion and spine maturation; loss reduces the threshold for synaptic potentiation and alters plasticity, consistent with its role as a brake on excitatory synapse strengthening (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8, wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032 (Feb 2016); https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17913 (Epilepsia, Mar 2024).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Cohort-level natural history and phenotypes (2024): A 147-participant digital registry captured the contemporary phenotype of SYNGAP1-related disorder (SRD), reporting 84% epilepsy prevalence, 68% autistic traits, frequent behavioral/sleep problems, and genotype–phenotype trends (e.g., exons 1–4 with better phrase speech; SH3-binding motif variants with lower epilepsy frequency) (Epilepsia, Mar 2024; DOI: 10.1111/epi.17913) (wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3).
- Integrated data analysis (2024): Claims (n=246) and EMR (n=158) integration showed epilepsy in 65–83% with generalized-onset seizures most common; median seizure onset ~2.8 years; strong enrichment of autism and behavioral abnormalities versus broader epilepsy populations; valproate/lamotrigine were relatively effective in seizure control (Genetics in Medicine; preprint, Oct 2024; DOI: 10.1101/2024.10.02.24314452) (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24).
- Mechanistic synaptic signaling perspective (2024): Review of Ras/Rap intersections emphasizes SynGAP’s dual specificity and modulation by post-translational modifications, with haploinsufficiency disrupting spine maturation and circuit plasticity; disease-associated truncating variants modeled in mice recapitulate neurobehavioral phenotypes (Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, Feb 2024; DOI: 10.3389/fnmol.2024.1352731) (cherra2024interactionsbetweenras pages 3-5).
- Variant-level structural insights (2024): In silico and mutational analyses (e.g., multi-parametric functionalization) highlight domain- and isoform-dependent impacts on GTPase signaling, localization, and stability, informing pathogenicity prediction frameworks (summarized in genotype–phenotype synthesis) (medRxiv, Oct 2025; cites 2021–2024 variant studies) (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 19-22).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical care patterns: Real-world treatment data show frequent use of valproic acid and clobazam for seizures and risperidone/aripiprazole/guanfacine for behavior; valproate and lamotrigine were associated with seizure reduction or maintenance of seizure freedom more often than other ASMs in EMR analyses (Genetics in Medicine; preprint, Oct 2024) (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24).
- Care guidelines emerging from cohorts: Registry/integrated analyses support early developmental/communication therapies, sleep/behavioral management, and seizure monitoring with attention to generalized-onset seizure risk and onset around the toddler years (wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3, mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- SynGAP as a PSD scaffold regulator of Ras/Rap nodes: Foundational and contemporary reviews converge on SynGAP as a high-abundance PSD-95 complex constituent that integrates CaMKII/CDK5 phosphorylation with Ras/Rap GAP control, shaping AMPAR trafficking and LTP/LTD thresholds; this provides a coherent mechanism for SRD’s excitatory/inhibitory imbalance (Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, 2016; Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, 2024) (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8, cherra2024interactionsbetweenras pages 3-5).
- Domain/isoform specificity shaping phenotypic heterogeneity: Recent genotype–phenotype work posits milder phenotypes for variants in the PH domain and highlights opposing isoform effects on synaptic strength; additional rare variants in synaptic genes may modify severity, indicating a primary haploinsufficiency mechanism with modulators (medRxiv, Oct 2025) (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 11-14, aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 19-22).

5) Statistics and data from recent studies (2023–2024)
- Prevalence and genetics: SRD is a recognized, relatively frequent monogenic cause of ID/DEE; registry summaries cite incidence on the order of 1–4 per 10,000 and de novo dominance with occasional parental mosaicism (Genes, Mar 2025) (greco2025syngap1syndromeand pages 11-11).
- Epilepsy and neurodevelopment: 2024 registry cohort (n=147) reported epilepsy in 84%, autistic traits in 68%, behavioral issues in 68%, sleep problems in 61%, and gait/ataxia in 47% (Epilepsia, Mar 2024) (wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3). Integrated data (claims n=246; EMR n=158) estimated epilepsy 65–83% with generalized-onset seizures ~66–69% among those with coded seizure types; median seizure onset 2.8 years; marked enrichment for autism (OR ~12) and behavioral abnormalities (OR ~12) compared to broader epilepsy populations (Genetics in Medicine; preprint, Oct 2024) (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24).
- Age-related trajectories: Behavioral/autistic features emerge around 27–30 months; generalized seizures become enriched after age 3 years (Genetics in Medicine; preprint, Oct 2024) (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24).

Biology and mechanistic detail
- Primary molecular role: SynGAP is a GAP for Ras and Rap GTPases at excitatory synapses, more potently regulating Rap in several assays; phosphorylation by CaMKII or CDK5 tunes substrate preference and catalytic output, thereby coupling activity-dependent Ca2+ signals to Ras/Rap pathways (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8, cherra2024interactionsbetweenras pages 3-5). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2024.1352731.
- Structural determinants: PH/C2 regions contribute to membrane/complex recruitment and regulation; the GAP domain provides canonical arginine-finger catalysis; isoform diversity at N/C termini confers distinct synaptic targeting and functional effects (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 1-4, aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 19-22). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.01.25336001.
- Localization and interactors: SynGAP is highly concentrated in the PSD, co-immunoprecipitates with PSD-95 and NMDAR complexes, and is a CaMKII substrate in spines, positioning it to regulate AMPAR trafficking during plasticity (jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2016.00032.
- Pathway integration: By constraining Ras→ERK/MAPK and Rap1/2 branches, SynGAP regulates transcriptional/trafficking responses underlying LTP/LTD and dendritic spine maturation; haploinsufficiency perturbs these nodes, contributing to E/I imbalance and network hyperexcitability (cherra2024interactionsbetweenras pages 3-5, jeyabalan2016syngap1mindthe pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2024.1352731.

Disease mechanism, clinical spectrum, and genotype–phenotype
- Mechanism: Most pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants act via haploinsufficiency, producing a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with ID, epilepsy (predominantly generalized-onset), autistic traits, behavioral dysregulation, and sleep disturbance (wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3, mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17913; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.24314452.
- Genotype–phenotype: 2024–2025 work reports trends such as better expressive language with variants in exons 1–4 and lower epilepsy frequency with SH3-binding motif variants; missense variants show broader phenotypic variability and may associate with higher rates of autistic traits; PH-domain variants may confer relatively milder severity (wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3, aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 11-14). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17913; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.01.25336001.
- Seizure types and onset: Generalized-onset seizures predominate; reported seizure-type coding in integrated cohorts includes bilateral tonic–clonic, atonic, absence, and myoclonic seizures, with onset typically before 3 years (median ~2.8 years) (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.24314452.

Therapeutic landscape and trials
- Current management: Symptomatic care with ASMs (valproate, lamotrigine, clobazam frequently used) and behavioral medications; cohort analyses suggest relatively favorable seizure control with valproate/lamotrigine in SRD compared with other ASMs (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.24314452.
- Trial readiness and natural history: Large-scale data integration and registries are defining age-related trajectories, seizure profiles, and treatment patterns, directly informing outcome measures and stratification for upcoming interventional studies (mckee2024clinicalsignaturesof pages 16-24, wiltrout2024comprehensivephenotypesof pages 1-3). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.24314452; https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.17913.

Notes on symbol ambiguity and verification
- The symbol SYNGAP1 is unambiguous in human literature and matches the UniProt description for Q96PV0; no conflicting human gene was identified in recent sources (aranda2025genotypephenotypecorrelationsand pages 1-4).
