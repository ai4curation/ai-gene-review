  label: Homo sapiens
description: SYNGAP1 encodes SynGAP, a brain-specific Ras/Rap GTPase-activating protein that is one of
  the most abundant proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. SynGAP functions
  as a dual-specificity GAP for both Ras and Rap small GTPases. By accelerating GTP hydrolysis, SynGAP
  inactivates these signaling molecules, thereby serving as a negative regulator of Ras-ERK/MAPK and Rap
  signaling pathways at synapses. This regulation controls AMPA receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic
  membrane, dendritic spine maturation, and long-term synaptic plasticity. SynGAP is regulated by phosphorylation
  from CaMKII and CDK5, which modulates its GAP activity and synaptic localization. The protein contains
  PH, C2, and Ras-GAP domains, along with a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that anchors it to PSD-95 and
  related scaffolds. De novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual
  disability and epilepsy through haploinsufficiency.

    label: GTPase activator activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SynGAP is a well-established dual-specificity GTPase activator for both Ras and Rap family
      GTPases. The GAP domain provides canonical arginine-finger catalysis for GTP hydrolysis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GTPase activator activity is the primary molecular function of SynGAP. The protein contains
      a Ras-GAP domain (residues 459-667) that catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on Ras and Rap GTPases. The IBA
      annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference from other characterized RasGAP family members.

  review:
    summary: SynGAP regulates intracellular signal transduction by inactivating Ras and Rap GTPases at
      synapses, thereby modulating downstream MAPK/ERK signaling cascades and AMPA receptor trafficking
      pathways.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This biological process annotation accurately captures SynGAP's role in modulating Ras-ERK
      and Rap signaling pathways at excitatory synapses. The annotation is appropriately general since
      SynGAP regulates multiple signaling cascades through its GAP activity.

  review:
    summary: SynGAP is a cytosolic protein that is recruited to the postsynaptic membrane region through
      protein-protein interactions with PSD-95 and other scaffold proteins, rather than directly associating
      with the plasma membrane itself.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While SynGAP does localize near the plasma membrane at synapses, it is a cytosolic protein
      that lacks transmembrane domains. It associates with the postsynaptic density through PDZ-binding
      motif interactions with PSD-95. A more accurate annotation would be postsynaptic density (GO:0014069)
      or glutamatergic synapse (GO:0098978).

    label: GTPase activator activity
  description: SynGAP is a dual-specificity GTPase activating protein for Ras and Rap small GTPases. The
    central Ras-GAP domain (aa 459-667) provides catalytic activity using an arginine finger mechanism
    to accelerate GTP hydrolysis. This enzymatic function is the primary molecular activity of SynGAP
    and underlies its role in signal transduction regulation.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the relative contribution of SynGAP's enzymatic GAP activity versus its scaffolding
    function to synaptic regulation? Some evidence suggests catalytically-dead SynGAP mutants retain normal
    synaptic plasticity.
- question: How do different SynGAP isoforms (with different C-terminal splicing) differentially affect
    synaptic function? Alternative splicing generates isoforms with different PDZ-binding motifs that
    may have distinct effects.
- question: What is SynGAP's role in neural progenitor cells and early brain development independent of
    its synaptic functions?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Compare synaptic phenotypes in mice with catalytically-dead SynGAP versus complete SynGAP
    knockout to dissect GAP-dependent versus scaffolding functions.
- description: Isoform-specific rescue experiments in Syngap1 null neurons to determine distinct functions
    of N-terminal and C-terminal splice variants.
- description: Super-resolution imaging of SynGAP dynamics during synaptic plasticity induction to understand
    how SynGAP regulates PSD composition during LTP/LTD.
