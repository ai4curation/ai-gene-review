description: >-
  Hemopexin (HPX) is a secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds free heme with the highest affinity
  of any known protein (Kd < 10^-13 M). It serves as the primary scavenger of free heme released
  from hemoproteins during hemolysis, hemorrhage, and other pathological states. HPX transports
  heme to the liver for degradation and iron recovery via receptor-mediated endocytosis through
  LRP1/CD91. This prevents heme-mediated oxidative damage, inflammatory activation, and iron loss.
  The protein is synthesized primarily in hepatocytes and is an acute-phase protein induced by
  IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection and inflammation.

      HPX is a secreted plasma glycoprotein that functions in the extracellular space. UniProt
      annotates it as "Secreted" and notes it is "Expressed by the liver and secreted in plasma."
      The deep research confirms HPX "circulates as a plasma protein" with plasma concentrations
      of 0.5-1.5 mg/mL. This IBA annotation is phylogenetically supported and represents a core
      localization.

      This annotation is from a study on HPX interaction with FLVCR1
      (feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor). While this specific
      interaction is documented in UniProt ("Interacts with FLVCR1"),
      the generic protein binding term is uninformative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      While HPX-FLVCR1 interaction is real and documented, the generic
      protein binding term does not capture this specific interaction.
      A more specific annotation would be preferable.

      This annotation is INCORRECT. The cited paper describes HPX as

    reason: >-
      Erroneous annotation. HPX is a soluble plasma protein that binds heme
      extracellularly and is endocytosed with its cargo via LRP1. It is not
      a transmembrane transporter. The original reference does not support
      this annotation.

# NEW ANNOTATION - heme binding is a core molecular function missing from GO annotations
- term:
    id: GO:0020037
    label: heme binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:3855550
  review:
    summary: >-
      Heme binding is the primary molecular function of HPX. It binds heme
      with the highest affinity of any known protein (Kd < 10^-13 M). This
      core function is missing from the existing GO annotations and should
      be added.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Core molecular function of HPX. The protein binds heme via histidine
      residues (H79, H150, H236, H293) in the hemopexin domains. Structural
      studies have characterized the heme-binding site in detail.
