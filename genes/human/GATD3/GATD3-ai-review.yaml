description: GATD3 (glutamine amidotransferase-like class 1 domain-containing protein 3) is a mitochondrial matrix-localized deglycase that catalyzes the removal of non-enzymatic glycation modifications produced during the Maillard reaction. Through its glutamine amidotransferase-like catalytic domain, GATD3 removes early glycation intermediates (glyoxal and methylglyoxal adducts) from nucleotides and amino acids, thereby preventing formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) within mitochondria. The protein contains a critical Cys176 residue essential for deglycase activity. GATD3 protects mitochondrial mRNA, ribosomal RNA, and ribosomal proteins from glycation damage, maintaining mitochondrial translation capacity. It also regulates TCA cycle function through interaction with malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2). GATD3 deficiency causes cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, and has been implicated in osteoarthritis pathogenesis. Related to but evolutionarily distinct from DJ-1/PARK7 deglycase.

  review:
    summary: Mitochondrial localization - GATD3 localizes to mitochondrial matrix.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Correct but imprecise. GATD3 specifically localizes to the mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759), not just mitochondrion generally.

  review:
    summary: Generic protein binding from interactome study - uninformative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Per curation guidelines, generic "protein binding" is uninformative. Large-scale interactome study does not provide mechanistic insight into GATD3's specific function as a deglycase.

  review:
    summary: GATD3 participates in protein repair by removing glycation intermediates from proteins and nucleotides before they progress to irreversible AGEs. Protects mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and rRNA from glycation damage.
    action: NEW
    reason: Loss of GATD3 results in enhanced glycation of ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins, demonstrating its role in protecting proteins from glycation-induced damage.
