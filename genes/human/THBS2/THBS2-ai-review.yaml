description: 'Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2/TSP2) is a secreted homotrimeric matricellular
  glycoprotein (~145 kDa per monomer) that modulates cell-matrix interactions rather
  than serving as a core structural ECM component. THBS2 contains a modular domain
  architecture including an N-terminal heparin-binding domain, procollagen-like region,
  three type I thrombospondin repeats (TSRs), EGF-like repeats, seven type III calcium-binding
  repeats, and C-terminal globular domain with RGD cell attachment site. Primary functions
  include: (1) Potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor - the type I repeats bind
  CD36 receptor on endothelial cells triggering apoptosis and capillary regression
  via caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss; (2) Regulator
  of ECM organization - modulates collagen fibrillogenesis by binding MMP-2 and facilitating
  its endocytic clearance via LRP1 receptor; (3) Mediator of cell-matrix adhesion
  - binds integrins including avb3 via RGD motif. THBS2-null mice exhibit disorganized
  collagen fibrils, elevated MMP-2 levels, connective tissue defects (skin fragility,
  lax tendons), and increased tissue vascularization. Heterozygous THBS2 pathogenic
  variants cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with vascular features (EDSCLL3) in humans
  via impaired MMP2 clearance. Localizes to interstitial ECM and basement membranes
  of connective tissues. Expression is low at baseline but induced during tissue remodeling,
  wound healing, and fibrosis. Recent studies implicate THBS2 in fibrogenesis via
  TLR4-FAK/TGF-beta signaling in hepatic stellate cells. Functions as an extracellular
  scaffold orchestrating cell-matrix communication, tissue architecture, and angiogenic
  balance.'

        (including THBS2) bind to alpha2delta-1 (Cacna2d1), the gabapentin 
        receptor, via their EGF-like domains. This interaction mediates 
        synaptogenesis. However, the general 'protein binding' term is 
        uninformative.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While the interaction with alpha2delta-1 is documented, 'protein

    review:
      summary: This annotation appears to be transferred from TSP1, which has 
        established roles in synaptogenesis via alpha2delta-1 binding. While 
        THBS2 can also bind alpha2delta-1, the synaptogenesis function is 
        primarily attributed to TSP1 (expressed during postnatal synapse 
        formation) rather than TSP2.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: The synaptogenic function is primarily documented for TSP1, not 
        TSP2. TSP1/2 are differentially expressed, with TSP1 being the primary 
        synaptogenic thrombospondin in the CNS.

      label: epidermal growth factor receptor binding
    description: Potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor via binding CD36 
      receptor on endothelial cells through type I thrombospondin repeats 
      (TSRs). This interaction triggers endothelial cell apoptosis through 
      caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to
      capillary regression. TSP2-deficient mice exhibit elevated vascular 
      density and excessive blood vessel networks.

      label: integrin binding
    description: Binds integrins including alpha-v-beta-3 via RGD cell 
      attachment site (positions 928-930) to mediate cell adhesion and transmit 
      signals into cells. This contributes to cell-matrix adhesion and 
      potentially activates downstream signaling pathways.
