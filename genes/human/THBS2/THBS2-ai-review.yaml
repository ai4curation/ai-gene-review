description: 'Thrombospondin-2 (THBS2/TSP2, ~145 kDa per monomer), extracellular matricellular
  glycoprotein that modulates cell-matrix interactions rather than serving as core
  structural ECM component. Forms homotrimeric complexes secreted into extracellular
  matrix. Multi-domain architecture: N-terminal heparin-binding domain, procollagen-like
  region, three type I thrombospondin repeats (TSRs), three type II EGF-like repeats,
  seven type III calcium-binding repeats, and C-terminal globular domain containing
  RGD sequence. Functions as regulator of extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis,
  and tissue remodeling. Primary role is modulating matrix structure and turnover
  - influences collagen fibrillogenesis by binding MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2)
  and facilitating its endocytic clearance via LRP1 receptor, preventing excessive
  collagen degradation. Thbs2-null mice show disorganized collagen fibrils, abnormally
  high MMP-2 levels, connective tissue defects (skin fragility, lax tendons), and
  increased tissue vascularization. Potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor - type
  I repeats bind CD36 receptor on endothelial cells triggering apoptosis and capillary
  regression. TSP2-deficient mice exhibit elevated vascular density and excessive
  blood vessel networks in healing wounds. Binds integrin αvβ3 via RGD sequence, transmitting
  signals into cells (activates PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways in synovial fibroblasts).
  Unique among thrombospondins: binds Notch3 receptor and Jagged1 ligand, potentiating
  Notch3 signal transduction. Dynamically regulated during tissue repair - expression
  rises in fibroblasts during wound healing, peaks during granulation tissue maturation.
  Restrains fibrovascular proliferation ensuring proper scar formation. In cartilage,
  protects from breakdown by suppressing MMP-13 and promoting chondrocyte differentiation.
  Localizes to interstitial spaces and basement membranes of connective tissues including
  dermis, cartilage, bone, blood vessel walls. Expression low at baseline but induced
  during tissue remodeling, injury, inflammation. Implicated in cancer (high TSP2
  correlates with suppressed tumor vascularization), fibrotic diseases (modulates
  TGF-β activation), osteoarthritis (upregulated as compensatory response), connective
  tissue disorders. Serves as extracellular scaffold that orchestrates cell-matrix
  communication, tissue architecture, and angiogenic balance.'
