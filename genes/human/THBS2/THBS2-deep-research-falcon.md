## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P35442
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Thrombospondin-2; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=THBS2; Synonyms=TSP2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the thrombospondin family. .
- **Key Domains:** ConA-like_dom_sf. (IPR013320); EGF-like_Ca-bd_dom. (IPR001881); EGF-like_dom. (IPR000742); EGF_dom. (IPR024731); Thrombospondin_3-like_rpt. (IPR003367)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "THBS2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'THBS2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **THBS2** (gene ID: THBS2, UniProt: P35442) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: THBS2 (UniProt P35442) encodes human thrombospondin‑2, a secreted matricellular glycoprotein of the thrombospondin family. Recent primary studies explicitly describe THBS2 as an extracellular, disulfide‑linked homotrimeric thrombospondin released by stromal cells, consistent with UniProt and the thrombospondin family/domain architecture; no evidence of symbol ambiguity was found in human literature cited here (Zhang et al., JHEP Reports, 2024; Hadar et al., EJHG, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein class and structure: THBS2 is a secreted matricellular thrombospondin that assembles into disulfide‑linked homotrimers and resides in the extracellular matrix (ECM), modulating cell–matrix signaling rather than serving as a structural fibril itself (JHEP Reports, 2024; EJHG, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2). THBS2’s modular architecture (N‑terminal coiled-coil/oligomerization, von Willebrand factor C-like and EGF-like modules, and multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats) underlies interactions with ECM ligands and receptors including integrins, CD36, and proteases; functional engagement of integrins and CD36 is noted in recent cancer work (IJMS, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8). Subcellular localization: secreted to the extracellular space and deposited in the ECM (JHEP Reports, 2024; Scientific Reports, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2).
- Core molecular functions: (i) regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis/ECM assembly; (ii) modulation of protease activity and clearance (notably MMP2); (iii) receptor-mediated signaling affecting angiogenesis, fibrogenesis, and inflammation through pathways including TLR4→FAK/TGF‑β/SMAD, and, in cancer contexts, Notch and EGFR/PI3K–Akt–mTOR axes (EJHG, 2024; JHEP Reports, 2024; AJCR, 2024; IJMS, 2024) (hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)
- Fibrosis—liver: THBS2 produced by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) directly binds TLR4 to drive profibrotic signaling via FAK and TGF‑β/SMAD2/3. AAV6 shRNA targeting Thbs2 in HSCs reduced intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis in CCl4 and MCD mouse models (Zhang et al., JHEP Reports; online 24 Jan 2024; 6:101014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhepr.2024.101014) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11). In LX‑2 HSCs, THBS2 peptide (1 μg/mL, 24 h) increased COL1 and p‑SMAD2; TGF‑β inhibitor LY2157299 (1 μM) and FAK inhibitor PF‑562271 (1 μM) attenuated these readouts, supporting a TLR4→FAK/TGF‑β axis (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11).
- Fibrosis—NAFLD: In human datasets and HSC models, THBS2 strongly correlates with collagen genes and is induced by TGF‑β; knockdown reduces COL1A1 and collagen fiber accumulation, while recombinant THBS2 increases COL1A1. Single‑cell and in situ analyses localize THBS2 to HSCs (bioRxiv preprint, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.01.543250) (kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10).
- Fibrosis—Crohn’s disease: THBS2 is significantly upregulated in subserosal fibroblasts of fibrostenosing Crohn’s disease, with distinct collagen architecture (thicker, more tortuous fibers) compared to submucosa, indicating layer‑specific fibroblast states; CD36 is referenced as a THBS2 receptor in this context (Scientific Reports, 10 Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64672-7) (jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2).
- Cancer—cholangiocarcinoma: Recombinant human THBS2 (≈100 ng/mL) enhances iCCA cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion, with stronger EMT‑like effects than THBS1; authors discuss integrin engagement and EGFR upregulation leading to PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation (Int J Mol Sci, 8 Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25031782) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).
- Cancer—gastric: THBS2 promotes gastric cancer progression and stemness via Notch signaling (regulating Notch3/HES1), and is negatively regulated by miR‑29b‑3p; THBS2 downregulation impairs tumorigenesis and liver metastasis in xenografts (Am J Cancer Res, 2024; https://doi.org/10.62347/uxwk4038) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).
- Human genetics—connective tissue disease: A heterozygous THBS2 missense variant (p.Cys896Arg) causes a dominantly inherited Ehlers–Danlos–like syndrome with vascular features in humans; CRISPR knock‑in mice reproduce key phenotypes. Mechanistically, THBS2 normally binds MMP2 to mediate its clearance; loss‑of‑function reduces MMP2 clearance, increasing proteoglycan cleavage and causing ECM disorganization with vascular consequences (Eur J Hum Genet, 18 Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-024-01559-1) (hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting of fibrogenesis: Preclinical AAV6‑shRNA silencing of Thbs2 in HSCs attenuates liver fibrosis in multiple models, nominating THBS2 as a stromal therapeutic target irrespective of etiology (JHEP Reports, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11).
- Diagnostic/biomarker directions: Disease‑tissue studies show layer‑specific THBS2 upregulation in fibrostenosing Crohn’s disease and strong associations with activated fibroblast states; these support histopathologic and digital pathology workflows for stratifying fibrosis and fibroblast populations (Sci Rep, 2024) (jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2). In oncology, THBS2 elevation corresponds to invasive phenotypes in iCCA and supports tumor progression/stemness in gastric cancer, suggesting utility in risk stratification and potentially as a circulating biomarker in selected cancers (IJMS, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).

4) Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- Recent mechanobiology review underscores thrombospondins as mechanosensitive ECM effectors linking matrix stiffening to TGF‑β and NF‑κB signaling; THBS2 participates in fibrosis and tumorigenesis under altered mechanical cues, aligning with its induction in fibrotic tissues and tumor microenvironments (Cell Communication and Signaling, 2025; review cites 2023–2024 primary work including JHEP Reports 2024) (zhao2025themechanobiologyof pages 17-17). Together with primary data above, the consensus places THBS2 as a context‑dependent modulator of ECM‑receptor signaling governing fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and tumor cell behavior (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10, jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2, corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data (selected 2023–2024)
- HSCs/liver fibrosis: THBS2 peptide 1 μg/mL for 24 h increased COL1 and p‑SMAD2 in LX‑2; pathway inhibition with LY2157299 (1 μM; TGF‑β) or PF‑562271 (1 μM; FAK) reduced these readouts, supporting a TLR4→FAK/TGF‑β axis (JHEP Reports, 2024; DOI above) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11). AAV6‑shRNA against Thbs2 reduced fibrosis progression in CCl4 and MCD models (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3).
- NAFLD/HSCs: THBS2 mRNA >160‑fold higher in LX‑2 vs. HepG2; TGF‑β induced THBS2 (P<0.0001); THBS2 peaked ≈10 h before COL1A1; THBS2 siRNA (~50% knockdown) reduced COL1A1 (P=0.0046); recombinant THBS2 increased COL1A1 (P=0.0051) (bioRxiv, 2023) (kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10).
- Crohn’s fibrostenosis: Significant qPCR upregulation of THBS2 in subserosa vs. submucosa; digital pathology quantified thicker, more tortuous, reticulated collagen fibers in subserosal fibrosis (Sci Rep, 2024) (jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2).
- iCCA: Recombinant THBS2 (100 ng/mL) increased adhesion, migration, invasion; stronger EMT‑like phenotype vs THBS1 in HuCCT‑1; analysis linked THBS2 to a poor‑prognosis proteogenomic subgroup (IJMS, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).
- Human genetics: THBS2 p.Cys896Arg associated with joint hypermobility, atrophic scarring, prolonged bleeding, and age‑related aortic dilatation/rupture in a pedigree; KI mice recapitulated phenotypes, supporting a pathogenic mechanism via impaired MMP2 clearance and ECM disorganization (EJHG, 2024) (hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2).

Mechanistic pathway mapping for THBS2
- ECM and collagen regulation: THBS2 modulates collagen fibrillogenesis and ECM organization; genetic disruption leads to disorganized collagen and abnormal ECM ultrastructure in human/mouse (EJHG, 2024) (hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2). In fibrotic liver and NAFLD, THBS2 upregulation in HSCs precedes COL1A1 induction and increases collagen gene expression and matrix deposition (JHEP Reports, 2024; bioRxiv, 2023) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10).
- Receptor interactions: Direct extracellular binding to TLR4 on HSCs initiates FAK and TGF‑β/SMAD signaling to activate fibrogenesis (JHEP Reports, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11). Engagement of integrins and CD36 is supported by iCCA and Crohn’s disease fibrosis contexts (IJMS, 2024; Sci Rep, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8, jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2). Cancer studies indicate coupling to Notch signaling (Notch3/HES1) and potential EGFR upregulation (AJCR, 2024; IJMS, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).
- Protease regulation: THBS2 binds MMP2 and mediates its clearance; pathogenic variants undermine MMP2 clearance, increasing proteoglycan cleavage and causing ECM defects (EJHG, 2024) (hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2).
- Angiogenesis and inflammation: As a matricellular cue, THBS2 influences angiogenesis and inflammatory signaling; fibrotic and cancer contexts reveal elevated THBS2 associated with profibrotic cytokine signaling (TGF‑β/SMAD) and invasive/EMT‑like programs (JHEP Reports, 2024; IJMS, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).

Where THBS2 functions
- THBS2 is secreted and functions in the extracellular milieu/ECM at the interface of stromal cells (e.g., HSCs, fibroblasts), endothelial and immune cells, acting through cell‑surface receptors and ECM ligand binding to control matrix assembly and cell behavior (JHEP Reports, 2024; Sci Rep, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2).

Applications and implementation examples
- Preclinical anti‑fibrotic strategy: Cell‑type–targeted THBS2 silencing (AAV6‑shRNA to HSCs) retards fibrosis progression across etiologies in mouse liver models, demonstrating a feasible in vivo intervention strategy and providing a translational rationale for THBS2‑directed therapeutics (JHEP Reports, 2024) (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11).
- Pathology stratification: THBS2 immunostaining/qPCR coupled with digital collagen analysis separates submucosal vs subserosal fibroblast populations and matrix architectures in fibrostenosing Crohn’s disease, an approach applicable to precision pathology and surgical planning (Sci Rep, 2024) (jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2).
- Oncology: THBS2 promotes invasive phenotypes in iCCA and supports Notch‑dependent stemness and metastasis in gastric cancer; these data support exploration of THBS2 as a tumor microenvironmental target and as a tissue/circulating biomarker in select indications (IJMS, 2024) (corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8).

Limitations and open questions
- Some mechanistic threads (e.g., breadth of integrin specificity, direct structural mapping of TSR‑receptor contacts, cell‑type–specific effects on angiogenesis) remain incompletely resolved in 2023–2024 literature and may be context dependent. Preprint data (NAFLD) require peer‑reviewed confirmation (kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10).

Conclusion
THBS2 (UniProt P35442) is a human secreted thrombospondin that operates in the ECM to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis, protease (MMP2) activity/clearance, and receptor‑mediated signaling. Recent studies position THBS2 as a stromal driver of fibrogenesis via a TLR4→FAK/TGF‑β axis in liver and as a marker/effector of fibroblast states in intestinal fibrosis. In cancer, THBS2 promotes invasion and stemness through integrin/EGFR and Notch signaling. Human genetics show that disrupting THBS2’s ECM‑modulatory role underlies an Ehlers–Danlos–like vascular syndrome via impaired MMP2 clearance. These findings motivate therapeutic targeting of THBS2 in fibrosis and support its evaluation as a biomarker and microenvironmental target in oncology (zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 1-3, zhang2024targetingthrombospondin2retards pages 10-11, kimura2023thrombospondin2is pages 5-10, jerala2024thrombospondin2matrix pages 1-2, corbella2024thbs1andthbs2 pages 7-8, hadar2024heterozygousthbs2pathogenic pages 1-2).
