description: PLD3 (Phospholipase D3) is a lysosomal enzyme that, despite its name, functions primarily
  as a 5'-3' exonuclease rather than a phospholipase. The protein is synthesized as a type II transmembrane
  glycoprotein and traffics to lysosomes where it is proteolytically cleaved to release its soluble catalytic
  domain. PLD3 degrades single-stranded DNA and RNA from the 5' end at acidic pH, generating nucleoside
  3'-monophosphates. This nuclease activity is critical for degrading mitochondrial DNA and other nucleic
  acids in lysosomes, thereby preventing inappropriate activation of nucleic acid-sensing innate immune
  receptors (TLR7, TLR9, cGAS-STING). Recent work (2024) has also established that PLD3 synthesizes (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate
  (BMP), a key lipid constituent of lysosomal intralumenal vesicles. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain
  and has been linked to Alzheimer's disease risk (though this remains controversial) and spinocerebellar
  ataxia type 46 (SCA46).

    summary: High-throughput proteomics identified PLD3 in exosomes from prostatic secretions.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Detection in exosomes from high-throughput proteomics is consistent with PLD3's presence in
      the endolysosomal system (exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies). However, this is not a
      functional localization - the protein functions intracellularly in lysosomes.

    summary: PMID:24336208 reports PLD3 interaction with APP (amyloid precursor protein).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The study reports PLD3-APP interaction but the significance is controversial. Later studies
      did not find PLD3 affecting APP metabolism in relevant mouse models. The "protein binding" term
      is also uninformative without specifying the binding partner.

    label: phospholipase D activity
  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:9140189
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on the original 1997 study identifying PLD3 as a member of the phospholipase
      D superfamily. However, subsequent studies have definitively shown that PLD3 does NOT have significant
      phospholipase D activity and instead functions as a 5'-3' exonuclease.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PMID:9140189 identified PLD3 as having sequence homology to the PLD superfamily, leading to
      the assumption of phospholipase activity. However, extensive subsequent biochemical studies have
      definitively demonstrated that PLD3 lacks significant phospholipase D activity and instead functions
      as a 5'-3' exonuclease. UniProt now classifies PLD3 as EC 3.1.16.1 (5'-3' exonuclease) rather than
      as a phospholipase. This annotation should be removed as it is now known to be incorrect.

  original_reference_id: PMID:39423811
  review:
    summary: PLD3 has been demonstrated to catalyze a transphosphatidylation reaction, synthesizing (S,S)-BMP
      from LPG and monoacylglycerol substrates. This phosphotransferase activity represents a second core
      enzymatic function distinct from its exonuclease activity.
    action: NEW
    reason: A 2024 Cell paper (PMID:39423811) demonstrated that purified PLD3 synthesizes (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate
      via a transphosphatidylation reaction. This BMP synthase activity is essential for lysosomal lipid
      catabolism. This molecular function annotation should be added as it represents a newly characterized
      core enzymatic activity.

  justification: A 2024 Cell paper (PMID:39423811) demonstrated that PLD3 and PLD4 synthesize (S,S)-BMP,
    a key phospholipid in lysosomal intralumenal vesicles. This is a distinct enzymatic activity not well
    captured by existing GO terms.
suggested_questions:
- question: How do the dual enzymatic activities of PLD3 (exonuclease and BMP synthase) relate to each
    other mechanistically and physiologically? Both activities use the HKD catalytic motifs but act on
    very different substrates. Understanding their relative contributions to lysosomal function is important.
- question: What is the relative contribution of PLD3 vs PLD4 to immune regulation in different cell types?
    PLD3 is highly expressed in neurons while PLD4 is more prominent in immune cells. Their redundancy
    and tissue-specific functions need clarification.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Structural studies of PLD3 with BMP pathway substrates to understand the mechanism of transphosphatidylation.
    Current structures show ssDNA binding. Structures with lipid substrates would clarify how the same
    active site accommodates both nucleic acids and lipids.
- description: Tissue-specific knockout studies to determine cell-type specific functions of PLD3. Understanding
    the relative importance of PLD3's nuclease vs BMP synthase activities in neurons vs other cell types
    would clarify disease mechanisms.
