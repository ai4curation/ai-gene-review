## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q12778
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Forkhead box protein O1 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Forkhead box protein O1A; AltName: Full=Forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8275086};
- **Gene Information:** Name=FOXO1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12228231, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:3819}; Synonyms=FKHR {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9479491}, FOXO1A;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** FH_FOXO1. (IPR047408); Fork_head_dom. (IPR001766); FOXO-TAD. (IPR032067); FOXO_KIX-bd. (IPR032068); TF_fork_head_CS_2. (IPR030456)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "FOXO1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'FOXO1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **FOXO1** (gene ID: FOXO1, UniProt: Q12778) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target identity and nomenclature: FOXO1 (UniProt Q12778) encodes the human Forkhead box protein O1 (aliases: FKHR/FOXO1A), a FOXO-family transcription factor with a conserved forkhead (winged-helix) DNA-binding domain, nuclear localization and export signals, and a C-terminal transactivation domain; these match the UniProt domain annotations (Fork_head_dom, FOXO-TAD, KIX-binding interface) and recent structural reviews (2023–2024) (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 4-6, cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).

Comprehensive research report: FOXO1 (human; UniProt Q12778)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and domains: FOXO1 is a forkhead box O transcription factor that binds DNA via a conserved winged-helix DBD whose recognition helix (H3) targets FOXO motifs; the protein is largely intrinsically disordered outside the DBD and contains conserved CR1/CR2/CR3 regions that mediate interactions with co-regulators (e.g., CBP/p300) and an activation domain (TAD). An overlapping NLS/NES controls nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 4-6, cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4).
- Consensus DNA motifs: FOXO proteins recognize the DAF-16 family binding element (DBE; 5′-TTGTTTAC-3′) with high affinity, and also bind insulin-responsive elements (IREs); FOXO1 predominantly binds as a monomer to these motifs, though dimeric binding to palindromic sites has been described (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Biochemical role: FOXO1 functions as a transcriptional regulator integrating nutrient, insulin/PI3K–AKT, and stress signaling to control programs of metabolism (e.g., gluconeogenesis), autophagy, cell cycle arrest, and stress resistance. FOXO family members can act as pioneer factors to open condensed chromatin, and CR3/CR2 can autoinhibit the DBD, relieved by cofactor binding (e.g., β-catenin) (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 12-13).
- Post-translational modifications (PTMs) and localization control:
  • AKT/PKB phosphorylation at conserved FOXO1 residues Thr24, Ser256, and Ser319 creates 14‑3‑3 docking sites, driving CRM1-dependent nuclear export and cytosolic sequestration (and promoting degradation under sustained insulin signaling) (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
  • Additional kinases modulate FOXO1: AMPK, JNK, p38, MST1 often promote nuclear localization/activation under stress; ERK, CK1, CDK2, IKK can negatively regulate activity or stability in a context-dependent manner (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
  • Acetylation/deacetylation: CBP/p300 acetylate FOXO1 lysines within the regulatory region (e.g., K245, K248, K262, K265), modulating DNA binding and transactivation, while sirtuin deacetylases (e.g., SIRT family) deacetylate FOXOs to tune activity and target gene selection (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, asadi2025foxosandtheir pages 2-4).
  • Ubiquitylation: FOXO ubiquitylation states correlate with localization and stability; monoubiquitylation can favor nuclear import, whereas polyubiquitylation drives proteasomal degradation. E3s such as MDM2/SKP2 and DUBs like USP7 are implicated across FOXOs (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, asadi2025foxosandtheir pages 2-4).
  • 14-3-3 and nuclear transport: AKT-site phosphorylation generates 14‑3‑3 binding that masks the NLS and exposes the NES, enabling CRM1-dependent export; conversely, stress kinases and redox cues promote nuclear import via importins (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Engineered T cells and immunotherapy: Two independent studies established FOXO1 as a master regulator of human CAR T cell memory and metabolic fitness. In Nature (2024), FOXO1 inhibition or gene editing impaired memory programs and antitumor function, while FOXO1 overexpression enforced a memory-like state, increased chromatin accessibility at FOXO motifs, preserved function under chronic stimulation, and improved in vivo persistence and tumor control; notably, TCF1 overexpression did not substitute for FOXO1, underscoring FOXO1’s unique role (published online April 10, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07300-8) (doan2024foxo1isa pages 1-2). A 2023 preprint similarly reported that FOXO1 overexpression enhanced memory markers (CD62L, IL7R), suppressed exhaustion programs, and improved metabolic fitness and tumor control, whereas FOXO1 inhibition had the opposite effects (posted Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2802998/v1) (mackall2023foxo1isa pages 6-8).
- FOXO1 in metabolism: Isoform-focused review synthesis indicates hepatic FOXO1 (with FOXO3/4) controls gluconeogenic programs; combined hepatic deletion of FOXO1/3/4 in mice reduces blood glucose and insulin with improved insulin sensitivity. FOXO1 can interact with PPARα to attenuate FGF21 induction, linking FOXO1 to systemic fuel metabolism and endocrine signaling (2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06177-1) (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 12-13). Mechanistic overviews in 2024 detail how PI3K–AKT phosphorylation drives nuclear exclusion, while stress kinases (JNK/p38/MST1/AMPK) promote nuclear FOXO activation during fasting/stress, consistent with FOXO1’s role in gluconeogenesis and autophagy (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Endothelial biology and angiogenesis: State-of-the-art reviews in 2024 synthesize that FOXOs (including FOXO1) restrain endothelial proliferation and regulate metabolic state, with insulin/AKT inhibition of FOXOs shifting endothelial programs and stress kinases promoting nuclear FOXO entry under oxidative stress; redox-dependent importin interactions (e.g., TNPO1/IPO7/8 pathways) facilitate nuclear import under oxidative cues (2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00649-0) (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3) and outline the NLS/NES-based shuttling critical to endothelium (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4).
- Fusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS): Recent narrative and mechanistic reviews consolidate that PAX3–FOXO1 and PAX7–FOXO1 are pathognomonic drivers of fusion-positive ARMS, functioning as pioneer-like oncoproteins that establish super-enhancers and reprogram the myogenic transcriptional circuitry (MYOD1, MYOG, MYCN) with extensive chromatin binding and enhancer–promoter looping via CBP/p300, BRD4, and Mediator dependency (2025 synthesis of the 2017–2024 literature; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26115204, May 2025) (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 2-4, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 4-6). Fusion status is prognostic and diagnostic (detected in ~70–80% of ARMS) and correlates with aggressive disease; fusion-specific antibodies can assist IHC-based detection (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 1-2, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 48-50). While direct fusion targeting remains elusive, preclinical dependencies and strategies include epigenetic modulators (BET inhibitors), cell-cycle kinase inhibitors (CDK4/6, Aurora A), and newly proposed vulnerabilities (e.g., metabolic DHFR dependency leading to methotrexate sensitivity) summarized in 2025 (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 45-47, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 2-4, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 48-50, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- T cell engineering: The 2024 Nature study highlights a translational strategy—genetic FOXO1 overexpression in CAR T products—to enforce a memory-like state, enhance persistence and tumor control, and potentially improve outcomes; the work also associates endogenous FOXO1 activity with clinical responses in patients treated with CAR T or TILs (online April 10, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07300-8) (doan2024foxo1isa pages 1-2). The 2023 preprint similarly proposes FOXO1 modulation as an engineering knob for next-generation cell therapies (Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2802998/v1) (mackall2023foxo1isa pages 6-8).
- Diagnostics/prognostics in ARMS: Reviews summarize clinical adoption of fusion testing (FISH/RT-PCR/NGS) and fusion-junction antibodies for subclassification, risk stratification, and monitoring; fusion positivity is integrated into modern ARMS risk schemas (synthesized 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26115204) (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 1-2, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 4-6).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Nature Reviews perspective (2024) emphasizes FOXOs as central stress-adaptation transcription factors with pioneer activity, regulated by a combinatorial PTM code (phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitin states) and co-regulator interactions that determine context-specific genome engagement and transcriptional outcomes (Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00649-0) (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Cross-isoform structural/functional analysis (2023) underscores shared architecture with isoform-specific IDR features; provides curated site-level PTMs in FOXO1 (AKT sites T24/S256/S319; multiple kinase sites; acetyl-lysines; PRMT1 arginine methylation), and highlights therapeutic angles (isoform-selective 14‑3‑3 interactions; protein–protein interaction disruptors; PROTACs) (Oct 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06177-1) (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 12-13).
- Cell Regeneration (2024) delineates canonical DNA motifs (DBE vs IRE), NLS/NES mechanisms, and broad kinase/deacetylase regulation in mammalian FOXOs with specific attention to stem cell contexts (Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13619-024-00190-1) (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 1-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- CAR T engineering: FOXO1 overexpression in human CAR T cells increased memory-associated gene programs and improved tumor control in vivo; FOXO1 inhibition reduced memory markers (e.g., CD62L/SELL, IL7R) and increased exhaustion markers (e.g., PD-1/TOX family), with impaired antitumor activity. FOXO1 activity correlated with positive outcomes in patients receiving CAR T/TILs (Nature, online April 10, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07300-8) (doan2024foxo1isa pages 1-2). Concordant preprint data in Nov 2023 documented enhanced OXPHOS/metabolic fitness and serial-stimulation resilience with FOXO1 overexpression, and reduced persistence/efficacy with FOXO1 inhibition (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2802998/v1) (mackall2023foxo1isa pages 6-8).
- Metabolic regulation: Genetic ablation studies summarized in 2023 show combined liver FOXO1/3/4 deletion reduces blood glucose/insulin and improves insulin sensitivity, indicating synergistic control of gluconeogenesis; FOXO1’s attenuation of PPARα-driven FGF21 links FOXO1 to systemic metabolic endocrine responses (Oct 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06177-1) (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 12-13).
- ARMS fusion epidemiology and prognosis: Fusion-positive ARMS is defined by PAX3/7–FOXO1 fusions in ~70–80% of cases, with fusion status linked to aggressive clinical behavior and poorer survival, establishing fusion testing as critical for risk stratification (compiled 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26115204) (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 1-2).

Mechanistic framework: regulation, localization, and partners
- Phospho-switch for trafficking: AKT/SGK phosphorylation on FOXO1 T24/S256/S319 recruits 14‑3‑3, masks the NLS and reveals the NES, enabling CRM1 export and cytoplasmic sequestration; dephosphorylation or stress-kinase inputs (JNK/p38/MST1/AMPK) favor nuclear import and transcriptional activation (cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4, santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3).
- Acetylation code: p300/CBP acetylation on FOXO1 K245/K248/K262/K265 dampens DNA binding/altered cofactor recruitment, while sirtuin deacetylation (e.g., SIRT family) re-sensitizes FOXOs and influences target selection (santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 6-7, asadi2025foxosandtheir pages 2-4).
- Ubiquitin-state control: Monoubiquitylation favors nuclear import and transcriptional competence, polyubiquitylation targets FOXO for proteasomal turnover; MDM2/SKP2 and USP7 participate in FOXO ubiquitin cycling (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, asadi2025foxosandtheir pages 2-4).
- Cofactor partnerships: CR3/CR2 interfaces recruit coactivators (CBP/p300, Mediator), engage β‑catenin to relieve autoinhibition, and cooperate with tissue-specific factors to specify transcriptional outcomes (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, cheng2024forkheadboxo pages 3-4).

Notes on scope and limitations
- RNF213-mediated K63-linked FOXO1 ubiquitination and several endothelial/metabolic primary studies from late 2024–2025 fall outside the directly citable context here. Where mechanistic components (e.g., K63 Ub and nuclear import) are discussed broadly for FOXOs, we have cited integrative 2023–2024 reviews (rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, asadi2025foxosandtheir pages 2-4). For fusion-positive ARMS, the 2025 narrative synthesis aggregates 2017–2024 evidence (ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 45-47, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 1-2), including super-enhancer biology and indirect targeting strategies; readers should consult the referenced URLs for detailed 2023–2024 primary citations.

Conclusion
Human FOXO1 (Q12778) is a stress- and nutrient-responsive transcription factor whose activity is set by a combinatorial PTM code (phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation) and nuclear shuttling via 14‑3‑3/CRM1 and importins. Recent high-impact work established FOXO1 as a tractable lever to enhance human CAR T memory, persistence, and antitumor efficacy, positioning FOXO1 modulation for near-term translational applications. In parallel, consolidated evidence underscores FOXO1’s central roles in hepatic gluconeogenesis and endothelial stress responses, and documents that PAX3/7–FOXO1 fusions drive ARMS via enhancer reprogramming with actionable cofactor dependencies. Together, these advances provide precise mechanistic targets and implementation paths—from T cell engineering knobs to fusion-positive sarcoma vulnerabilities—for FOXO1-centered interventions (doan2024foxo1isa pages 1-2, mackall2023foxo1isa pages 6-8, rodriguezcolman2024foxotranscriptionfactors pages 2-3, santos2023foxofamilyisoforms pages 12-13, ziemba2025moleculartargetsin pages 2-4).
