description: >
  FOXO1 (Forkhead box protein O1) is a transcription factor of the FOXO family that
  functions as a key integrator
  of insulin/PI3K-AKT signaling with metabolic homeostasis and stress responses. FOXO1
  binds to insulin response
  elements (IRE; 5'-TT[G/A]TTTTG-3') and DAF-16 binding elements (DBE; 5'-TT[G/A]TTTAC-3')
  via its conserved
  forkhead/winged-helix DNA-binding domain. FOXO1 is implicated in regulation of hepatic
  gluconeogenic
  gene programs (e.g., G6PC1, PCK1), though the FOXO1–PGC-1alpha interaction has been
  reported as indirect
  in PMID:17024043. FOXO1 activity is tightly regulated by
  post-translational modifications: AKT phosphorylation at T24/S256/S319 promotes
  14-3-3 binding, nuclear export,
  and cytoplasmic sequestration, while stress kinases (MST1, JNK, AMPK) and deacetylation
  by sirtuins promote
  nuclear retention and transcriptional activation. FOXO1 shuttles between nucleus
  and cytoplasm based on
  metabolic and stress cues, functioning as a molecular switch for metabolic adaptation.

      FOXO1 is the main downstream effector of insulin signaling through the PI3K-AKT

      Insulin-activated AKT phosphorylates FOXO1 at T24/S256/S319, promoting 14-3-3
      binding,
      nuclear export, and transcriptional inactivation. This represents FOXO1's role

    description: >
      FOXO1 mediates cellular adaptation to oxidative stress by translocating to the
      nucleus
      and activating transcription of antioxidant and stress resistance genes. This
      represents
      one of FOXO1's primary evolved functions alongside metabolic regulation.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >
      Is there evidence for isoform-specific functions of FOXO1 versus FOXO3/FOXO4
      in specific
      tissues, particularly in hepatic gluconeogenesis versus other metabolic processes?
  - question: >
      What is the relative contribution of FOXO1's transcriptional versus non-transcriptional
      (cytoplasmic ATG7 interaction) roles in autophagy regulation?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >
      ChIP-seq comparison of FOXO1 binding sites in fed versus fasted hepatocytes
      to define
      the core gluconeogenic gene regulatory program.
  - description: >
      Structure-function analysis of FOXO1 acetylation sites to determine which modifications
      are essential for transcription factor activity versus autophagy induction.
