description: >-
  ATP5F1B encodes the catalytic beta subunit of the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (Complex V).
  Three copies of the beta subunit alternate with three alpha subunits (ATP5F1A) to form the
  alpha3-beta3 hexameric F1 catalytic head, which faces the mitochondrial matrix. The beta subunit
  contains the catalytic nucleotide-binding site where ADP is phosphorylated to ATP via a rotary
  mechanism driven by the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane (PMID:37244256).
  As part of the F1Fo complex, ATP5F1B contributes to proton-transporting ATP synthase activity
  (EC 7.1.2.2). Pathogenic variants in ATP5F1B cause hypermetabolism due to uncoupled oxidative
  phosphorylation (HUMOP2, PMID:36239646) and dominantly inherited dystonia (PMID:Nasca et al. 2023,
  Brain). ATP5F1B is also found on the cell surface as ecto-F1-ATPase, where it functions in
  extracellular ATP generation, angiogenesis regulation, and immune recognition (PMID:8006588,
  PMID:17510399, PMID:17643490).

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for CC. ATP5F1B is a core structural and catalytic component of the
      proton-transporting ATP synthase complex (Complex V). This is well supported by cryo-EM
      structural data (PMID:37244256), immunocapture studies (PMID:12110673), and assembly studies
      (PMID:26297831).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the defining complex membership for ATP5F1B. The beta subunit is one of the major
      subunits of the F1 catalytic head. Cryo-EM structures show ATP5F1B as chains D/E/F in the
      alpha3-beta3 hexamer (PMID:37244256). IBA annotation is appropriate and well conserved across
      the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for MF with contributes_to qualifier. The beta subunit contributes to the
      proton-transporting ATP synthase activity of the holoenzyme complex via the rotational
      mechanism. The contributes_to qualifier is correct because this activity is a property of
      the whole complex, not the individual subunit.

      The contributes_to qualifier is appropriate for a subunit that is part of the catalytic
      core but requires the full complex for proton-transporting ATP synthase activity. The beta
      subunit houses the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, but the rotational mechanism requires
      the assembled F1Fo complex including the proton channel (Fo). Well supported by structural

      HDA annotation for BP from a quantitative proteomics study of membrane proteins during
      osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (Foster et al. 2005). ATP5F1B

      This annotation appears to be based on differential protein expression during osteoblast

      changes likely reflect altered metabolic demands during differentiation rather than a
      specific role in osteoblast biology.

  description: >-
    ATP5F1B is the catalytic beta subunit of the F1 head of the mitochondrial ATP synthase
    (Complex V). It contains the active site where ADP + Pi is converted to ATP via the
    binding change mechanism driven by rotation of the gamma subunit. The beta subunit binds
    ATP/ADP at its catalytic nucleotide-binding site (residues 209-214, 238-239) with Mg2+
    as a required cofactor. It contributes_to the complex-level proton-transporting ATP
    synthase activity (GO:0046933) of the rotational mechanism. Three beta subunits alternate
    with three alpha subunits to form the alpha3-beta3 hexameric F1 catalytic head on the
    matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structural evidence from cryo-EM at
    2.53 A resolution (PMID:37244256) and functional evidence from the L335P uncoupling
    variant (PMID:36239646) confirm the catalytic role.
