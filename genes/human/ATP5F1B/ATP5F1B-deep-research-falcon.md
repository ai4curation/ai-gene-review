- **UniProt Accession:** P06576
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ATP synthase F(1) complex subunit beta, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; EC=7.1.2.2 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:25168243}; AltName: Full=ATP synthase F1 subunit beta {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:830}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATP5F1B {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:830}; Synonyms=ATP5B {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:830}, ATPMB, ATPSB {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:830};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATPase alpha/beta chains family.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ATP-synt_VA_C. (IPR055190); ATP_synth_F1_bsu. (IPR005722); ATPase_a/bsu_AS. (IPR020003); ATPase_alpha/beta_chains. (IPR050053)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5F1B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5F1B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5F1B** (gene ID: ATP5F1B, UniProt: P06576) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target identity: ATP5F1B (HGNC:830; UniProt P06576) encodes the mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase beta subunit (also known as ATP5B), a nuclear-encoded component of Complex V in Homo sapiens. It forms part of the F1 catalytic head (α3β3) on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane; this aligns with the ATPase alpha/beta chains family and expected domains for catalytic nucleotide binding and hydrolysis/synthesis (EC 7.1.2.2) (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in the collected 2023–2024 literature targeting different organisms.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and complex architecture. F1Fo-ATP synthase (Complex V) produces the bulk of cellular ATP. Its soluble F1 head comprises an alternating α3β3 hexamer in which β (ATP5F1B) houses the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites; F1 is connected via the central stalk (γ, δ, ε) to the membrane-embedded Fo (including the c-ring and mtDNA-encoded subunits a/A6L) and braced by the peripheral stalk (b, d, F6, OSCP). The F1 head faces the mitochondrial matrix, performing ATP synthesis/hydrolysis coupled to proton motive force across the inner membrane (reviewed with structural references; https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Catalytic mechanism and states. Recent cryo-EM shows multiple rotary substates and elastic coupling between F1 and Fo, capturing conformational ensembles that underpin catalysis and chemomechanical coupling across pH conditions; these studies reaffirm β’s catalytic role in nucleotide binding/hydrolysis/synthesis (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12) (sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21).
- Dimerization/oligomerization and cristae. ATP synthase forms dimers and higher-order oligomeric rows that shape cristae membrane curvature; altered high–molecular weight bands consistent with dimer/oligomeric Complex V can be resolved by BN-PAGE in human cells (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01; https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5).

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Conformational plasticity and coupling (2024). Yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase cryo-EM under low pH resolved unique intermediates that illuminate flexible F1–Fo coupling and rotary substate transitions, advancing mechanistic models applicable to mammalian enzymes (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12) (sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21).
- Clinical genetics of ATP5F1B (2023) and spectrum expansion (2024–2025). A Brain 2023 study identified heterozygous ATP5F1B missense variants (p.Thr334Pro; p.Val482Ala) segregating with early-onset isolated dystonia with incomplete penetrance; patient fibroblasts showed severe isolated Complex V deficiency without reductions of other respiratory complex activities, mitochondrial membrane potential defects, and BN-PAGE evidence for altered high-MW Complex V species, suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 2-3, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 5-6, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5). A 2024 Movement Disorders review synthesizes that ATP5F1B-related dystonia often exhibits normal oxygen consumption, whereas some alleles cause an “uncoupling” phenotype with increased oxygen consumption, reinforcing allele-dependent bioenergetic signatures (https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29657, 2024-11-01) (indelicato2024dystoniainatp pages 4-4). A 2025 Movement Disorders cohort further reported a heterozygous ATP5F1B splice-donor variant (c.1074+1G>T) leading to exon skipping, reduced ATP5F1B mRNA, and impaired Complex V ATPase activity; the clinical spectrum broadened to include dystonia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and cerebral palsy phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.30209, 2025-04-01) (harrer2025expandingtheallelic pages 1-2).
- Regulation via IF1 and targeting approaches (2024). Experimental peptide tools that displace the inhibitory factor IF1 from ATP synthase OSCP altered mitochondrial permeability transition behavior in HeLa cells, underscoring regulatory interfaces and offering proof-of-concept for therapeutic modulation of ATP synthase regulation (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655, 2024-04-30) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Diagnostic and functional genomics. For suspected ATP5F1B-related movement disorders, integration of exome/genome sequencing with fibroblast functional assays (Complex V activity assays, BN-PAGE oligomer profiling, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption) has been deployed in clinical studies to assign pathogenicity and mechanism (dominant-negative vs. haploinsufficiency) (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20; https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.30209, 2025-04-01) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5, harrer2025expandingtheallelic pages 1-2).
- Structural informatics for inhibitor design. High-resolution conformational ensembles inform binding-site exposure and coupling strain that can guide allosteric or catalytic-site inhibitor design or peptide modulators (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12) (sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21).
- Experimental modulation of IF1–ATP synthase interface. Mitochondria-targeted peptides engaging the IF1–OSCP interaction modulate permeability transition and apoptosis resistance in tumor cells, a potential lead for anti-cancer strategies that indirectly affect Complex V regulation (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655, 2024-04-30) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Comprehensive clinical-pathophysiology synthesis. A 2024 review emphasizes that ATP5F1A/ATP5F1B subunits occur in multiple copies within the holoenzyme; expression levels, subunit stoichiometry, and environmental stressors likely determine penetrance and phenotypic variability. Notably, in ATP5F1B dystonia, oxygen consumption may be preserved or paradoxically increased (allele-specific uncoupling), guiding expectations for functional tests (https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29657, 2024-11-01) (indelicato2024dystoniainatp pages 4-4).
- Structural-functional consensus. Recent reviews concur that the α3β3 head (with β catalytic sites) and rotary coupling underlie ATP production, and that ATP synthase dimer/oligomer rows contribute to cristae morphology—linking molecular defects to organelle-scale architecture (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Genetics and clinical penetrance (2023). Two heterozygous ATP5F1B missense variants (c.1000A>C; c.1445T>C) segregated with early-onset isolated dystonia across two families, with incomplete penetrance noted. Variants were absent from gnomAD. Structural modeling placed substitutions near α/γ interfaces (Thr334) and at the periphery of the α3β3 hexamer (Val482), altering local contacts (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5).
- Biochemical readouts (2023). In patient fibroblasts, an isolated Complex V ATPase deficiency was observed in affected individuals, with other respiratory chain complex activities within normal range; one affected father showed Complex V activity 88% of the lower control range (mild defect). BN-PAGE revealed high-MW Complex V bands consistent with dimer/supercomplex alterations; mitochondrial membrane potential imaging (JC‑1) showed localized depolarization despite preserved maximal respiratory capacity (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 5-6, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5).
- Transcript/protein levels (2023). cDNA analyses showed biallelic expression of the mutant allele; immunoblots for ATP5F1B/ATP5F1A generally showed stable steady-state levels (one subject with a significant ATP5F1B change), supporting dominant-negative mechanisms over loss-of-protein scenarios in many cases (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 5-6).
- Splice variant mechanism (2025). An ATP5F1B c.1074+1G>T variant caused exon skipping with significantly reduced ATP5F1B mRNA and impaired ATPase activity in fibroblasts, indicating haploinsufficiency-like effects and expanding phenotypes to dystonia/HSP/CP (https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.30209, 2025-04-01) (harrer2025expandingtheallelic pages 1-2).

Functional roles, pathways, and localization of ATP5F1B
- Enzymatic function. ATP5F1B contributes the catalytic β subunit to the F1 head; its active sites bind ADP/ATP and participate in the rotary mechanism that couples proton translocation in Fo to ATP synthesis (or reverse hydrolysis). Conformational ensembles captured by cryo-EM support a model of elastic coupling and sequential site catalysis at β subunits (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12) (sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21).
- Pathway membership. ATP5F1B is a core subunit of OXPHOS Complex V in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, positioned at the terminal energy-converting step of oxidative phosphorylation (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Subcellular localization. The β subunit resides in the mitochondrial matrix-facing catalytic head attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane’s Fo sector; assembly defects or altered oligomerization can impact cristae morphology and bioenergetics (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01; https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5).

Assembly/biogenesis and regulation
- Assembly and quality control. Biogenesis of the α3β3 head requires dedicated assembly factors (e.g., ATPAF1/2) and mitochondrial Hsp70 functions for both assembly and quality control, ensuring only properly folded subunits integrate into the holoenzyme (review) (https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
- Regulatory proteins. IF1 binds the F1 sector under low pH or specific conditions to inhibit ATP hydrolysis; disrupting IF1–OSCP interactions with designed peptides modulates mitochondrial permeability transition in cancer cells, indicating a druggable regulatory interface (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655, 2024-04-30) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17).

Clinical implications and translational directions (2023–2024 emphasis)
- Diagnostic recommendations. Given the allele-dependent functional fingerprints, comprehensive evaluation should include: (i) molecular genetics of ATP5F1B; (ii) fibroblast Complex V enzymology; (iii) BN-PAGE for oligomerization; (iv) mitochondrial membrane potential imaging; and (v) oxygen consumption profiling to detect uncoupling vs. preserved respiration (https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20; https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29657, 2024-11-01) (nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 3-5, indelicato2024dystoniainatp pages 4-4).
- Therapeutic exploration. While no ATP5F1B-specific therapy exists, regulatory targeting of IF1–ATP synthase and structure-guided modulation of catalytic/rotary interfaces are under experimental study as anti-cancer or mitochondrial modulatory approaches (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655, 2024-04-30; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17, sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21).

*Table: A corrected, compact markdown table summarizing vetted evidence (identity, catalytic role, localization, structure, assembly, regulation, ectopic presence, 2023–2024 disease links, quantitative readouts, and translational leads) for human ATP5F1B with recent source citations (context IDs).*

Conclusion
Human ATP5F1B encodes the catalytic β subunit of ATP synthase’s F1 head, executing nucleotide-binding and ATP synthesis/hydrolysis within Complex V at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Contemporary cryo-EM substantiates elastic F1–Fo coupling and multi-state rotary catalysis centered on β subunits. Clinically, 2023–2024 work establishes heterozygous ATP5F1B variants as causes of isolated dystonia (dominant-negative mechanisms) with expanding phenotypes (HSP/CP), and allele-dependent functional readouts ranging from isolated Complex V defects with preserved respiration to uncoupling-like profiles. Regulatory interfaces (IF1–OSCP) are experimentally druggable, suggesting avenues for modulating ATP synthase function in disease contexts (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-024-01219-4, 2024-02-12; https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad068, 2023-03-20; https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29657, 2024-11-01; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25094655, 2024-04-30; https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407, 2024-08-01) (sharma2024conformationalensembleof pages 19-21, nasca2023variantsinatp5f1b pages 2-3, indelicato2024dystoniainatp pages 4-4, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 16-17, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
