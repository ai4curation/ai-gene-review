description: MMS19 is a key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) 
  protein assembly (CIA) targeting complex, functioning as a HEAT-repeat 
  scaffold protein that mediates the delivery of [4Fe-4S] clusters to cytosolic 
  and nuclear target proteins. MMS19 partners with CIAO1, CIAO2B/FAM96B, and 
  CIAO3/IOP1 in the CIA targeting complex, serving as an adapter between 
  early-acting CIA components and specific Fe-S client proteins involved in DNA 
  metabolism and genomic integrity. Key client proteins include XPD/ERCC2 
  (nucleotide excision repair and TFIIH component), FANCJ/BRIP1 (Fanconi anemia 
  helicase), RTEL1 (telomere maintenance helicase), and DNA polymerases. Fe-S 
  cluster insertion occurs in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear import and assembly
  of target proteins into functional complexes. MMS19 also participates in the 
  MMXD complex (with XPD, MIP18, CIAO1) that localizes to the mitotic spindle 
  and is required for proper chromosome segregation. Loss of MMS19 leads to 
  instability of Fe-S client proteins, sensitivity to DNA damage, and defects in
  DNA replication and repair.

  review:
    summary: MMS19 is a core component of the cytosolic [4Fe-4S] assembly 
      targeting complex (CIA targeting complex/CTC). This annotation is 
      phylogenetically inferred and strongly supported by experimental evidence 
      from multiple studies showing MMS19 forms a complex with CIAO1, 
      CIAO2B/MIP18, and CIAO3/IOP1 (PMID:22678361, PMID:22678362, 
      PMID:23585563).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: MMS19 is established as the central scaffold of the CIA targeting 
      complex. Multiple independent studies using co-immunoprecipitation and 
      mass spectrometry have demonstrated that MMS19 forms tight complexes with 
      CIAO1, CIAO2B, and CIAO3 to facilitate Fe-S cluster transfer to target 
      proteins (PMID:22678361, PMID:22678362, PMID:23585563).

      facilitating Fe-S cluster insertion. This phylogenetically inferred 
      annotation is accurate but could be more specific.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: MMS19's primary function is to mediate protein maturation by 
      inserting Fe-S clusters into apoproteins. This is the defining biochemical
      role of the CIA targeting complex. However, a more specific term such as 
      "iron-sulfur cluster assembly" would be more informative.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While MMS19 is critical for DNA repair by maturing Fe-S DNA repair 
      proteins, it does not directly participate in the DNA repair reaction. Its
      role is upstream - ensuring that repair proteins receive their essential

    reason: While MMS19 has been shown to enhance ER-mediated transcription
