description: >
  BCL2 is a founding member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators, functioning
  as an anti-apoptotic
  protein that prevents mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). BCL2
  contains four Bcl-2
  homology (BH1-BH4) domains that form a hydrophobic groove capable of binding BH3
  domains from
  pro-apoptotic family members (BIM, BAD, PUMA, BID) and the effectors BAX/BAK. By
  sequestering
  BH3-only proteins and restraining BAX/BAK activation, BCL2 prevents cytochrome c
  release and
  subsequent caspase activation. BCL2 localizes primarily to the mitochondrial outer
  membrane via
  a C-terminal transmembrane helix, with additional localization to the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane.
  At the ER, BCL2 also modulates calcium homeostasis and interacts with BECN1 to regulate
  autophagy,
  though this latter function represents regulatory crosstalk rather than its evolved
  core function.

        BCL2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents apoptosis, not promotes it.
        This annotation
        appears to be incorrectly propagated. While BCL2 family member genes are involved
        in apoptosis
        regulation broadly, BCL2 itself is a well-established negative regulator of
        apoptosis.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >
        BCL2 functions as an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents MOMP and cytochrome
        c release.
        Multiple studies demonstrate BCL2 inhibits apoptosis (PMID:9027314, PMID:9219694).
        The IBA
        annotation appears to be a family-level annotation that does not distinguish
        between
        pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members. This is incorrect for BCL2 specifically.

        BCL2 regulates the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway, not the extrinsic
        pathway.

        by opposing
        BAX/BAK-mediated MOMP (croce2025thebcl2protein). The extrinsic pathway annotation

        BCL2's primary core function is to prevent MOMP. This more specific term
        captures the mechanism better than general negative regulation of apoptosis.
      action: NEW

        BCL2 prevents MOMP by sequestering BH3-only proteins and restraining

core_functions:
  - description: >
      BCL2's primary evolved function is to prevent apoptosis by blocking MOMP
      and cytochrome c release. This is supported by extensive experimental
      evidence from multiple cell types and organisms.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does BCL2's channel-forming activity at acidic pH have 
      physiological relevance, or is it an artifact of artificial membrane 
      systems?
  - question: What is the relative importance of BCL2's function at the ER vs 
      mitochondria in different cellular contexts?
  - question: Should BCL2's autophagy regulation through BECN1 be considered a 
      secondary evolved function or purely crosstalk?

      binding but lack membrane insertion to dissect OMM vs cytosolic functions
