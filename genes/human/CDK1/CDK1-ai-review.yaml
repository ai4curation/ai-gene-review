description: Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, also known as CDC2/p34cdc2) is the essential
  and universally conserved serine/threonine kinase that drives the G2/M transition
  and mitotic progression in all eukaryotes. CDK1 is unique among CDKs in being absolutely
  required for cell division in mammals. The active holoenzyme consists of CDK1 bound
  to cyclin B1 (principally) or cyclin A, with CKS1/2 serving as phospho-adaptors
  that promote multisite substrate phosphorylation. CDK1 activity is tightly regulated
  through activating phosphorylation at Thr161 by CAK (CDK7-cyclin H) and inhibitory
  phosphorylation at Thr14 and Tyr15 by WEE1 and PKMYT1, which is reversed by CDC25
  phosphatases at mitotic entry. CDK1 phosphorylates substrates on S/T-P motifs and
  has over 1000 documented substrates, including lamins (nuclear envelope breakdown),
  condensins (chromosome condensation), and numerous mitotic machinery proteins. As
  a master regulator of cell division, CDK1 has been documented to phosphorylate many
  proteins involved in diverse processes beyond mitosis (transcription, metabolism,
  organelle dynamics), but its core evolved function is as the essential mitotic kinase

    id: GO:0005634
    label: nucleus
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CDK1 localizes to the nucleus during G2 and at mitotic entry. CDK1-cyclin
      B complexes shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus, with activation detected
      at centrosomes and then across nuclear compartments at nuclear envelope breakdown.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is well-established and essential for CDK1 function
      in regulating nuclear substrates including lamins. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      supported across diverse eukaryotes.

    label: G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CDK1 is THE essential kinase for G2/M transition - the defining core
      function of this protein. CDK1 drives the bistable switch into mitosis through
      phosphorylation of numerous mitotic substrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the canonical, essential function of CDK1. CDK1 is uniquely essential
      among CDKs for mammalian cell cycle progression and specifically drives G2/M
      transition. The IBA annotation reflects deeply conserved function across all
      eukaryotes.

    label: cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CDK1 functions as part of a holoenzyme complex with cyclin partners (principally
      cyclin B1, also cyclin A) and CKS subunits (CKS1/2) that act as phospho-adaptors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CDK1 requires cyclin binding for activity - this is fundamental to its
      function. The holoenzyme complex is the active form of the kinase.

    id: GO:0004693
    label: cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CDK1 is a prototypical cyclin-dependent kinase with serine/threonine
      kinase activity (EC 2.7.11.22/23). It requires cyclin binding for catalytic
      activity and phosphorylates S/T-P motifs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of CDK1. The enzyme activity is well-characterized
      biochemically with defined substrate specificity for S/T-P motifs.

    label: mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint signaling
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CDK1 activity is the target of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. The checkpoint
      operates through inhibition of CDC25 phosphatases and activation of WEE1/PKMYT1,
      which maintain CDK1 in an inactive, phosphorylated state.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CDK1 is central to G2 checkpoint signaling as its activity is the regulated
      output of the checkpoint pathway. DNA damage prevents CDC25-mediated activation
      of CDK1.

    label: chromatin remodeling
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: CDK1 phosphorylates chromatin-associated proteins during mitosis as part
      of chromosome condensation. However, CDK1 is not a dedicated chromatin remodeler
      - this is a downstream consequence of its mitotic role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While CDK1 does phosphorylate chromatin-associated substrates, this is
      part of its broader role in mitotic progression rather than a core chromatin
      remodeling function.

  review:
    summary: CDK1 can phosphorylate the RNA Pol II CTD, but this is not its core function.
      CDK1's transcriptional regulation role is largely through mitotic transcriptional
      shutdown.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: CDK1 phosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD and transcriptional regulators
      occurs but is peripheral to its core cell cycle function.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: This appears to be derived from CDK1 role in viral infection processes.
      CDK1 may be exploited by viruses but this is not an evolved function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Viral exploitation of host cell cycle machinery does not represent an
      evolved function of CDK1. This annotation conflates pathogen hijacking with
      host protein function.

  review:
    summary: CDK1 binds ATP as a substrate for its kinase activity. This is a generic
      annotation that follows from having kinase activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While true, this is a very general annotation implied by the kinase activity.
      The more specific ATP binding term is more informative.

    label: virus receptor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation appears to be based on UniProt keywords. CDK1 is not
      a virus receptor in the canonical sense - viruses may exploit CDK1 function
      but it is not a cell surface receptor for viral entry.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: CDK1 is an intracellular kinase, not a virus receptor. This annotation
      is misleading and likely results from misinterpretation of CDK1's role in viral
      replication cycles.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This is the most appropriate molecular function term for CDK1. The enzyme
      requires cyclin binding for activity and phosphorylates serine/threonine residues.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of CDK1 and accurately describes its
      catalytic activity and cyclin-dependence.

  review:
    summary: CDK1 binds ATP as a phosphate donor for its kinase activity. The ATP
      binding pocket is well-characterized structurally.

  review:
    summary: CDK1 localizes to centrosomes where it is first activated at mitotic
      entry and regulates centrosome maturation and separation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Centrosomal localization is well-established and functionally important
      for CDK1 activation and mitotic spindle organization.

  review:
    summary: CDK1 localizes to the mitotic spindle where it phosphorylates spindle-associated
      substrates to regulate spindle assembly and function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Spindle localization is well-documented and functional for mitotic regulation.
- term:
    id: GO:0006915
    label: apoptotic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: CDK1 phosphorylates apoptosis-related proteins including survivin (Thr34),
      caspase-9, and Bcl-2 family members as part of its extensive substratome. However,
      apoptosis is NOT a core function of CDK1. CDK1 phosphorylates survivin to maintain
      its anti-apoptotic activity during mitosis, preventing inappropriate cell death
      during cell division. This represents phosphorylation of apoptotic regulators
      during normal cell cycle, not an evolved apoptotic function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This is the quintessential OVER-ANNOTATION. CDK1's core function is cell
      cycle control. The fact that CDK1 phosphorylates survivin and other apoptosis-related
      proteins among its 1000+ substrates does not make apoptosis its function. This
      is analogous to annotating a transcription factor to all processes involving
      its target genes. The 2023 Massacci review explicitly notes CDK1's apoptosis-related
      substrates as part of the expanded CDK1 substratome but this represents downstream
      effects of cell cycle kinase activity, not an evolved apoptotic function.

      CDK1 also has connections to circadian rhythm.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The cell cycle is rhythmic, and CDK1 has been implicated in circadian
      regulation, but rhythmic process is not the core function.

  description: >-
    CDK1 is the essential cyclin-dependent kinase for cell division. It forms
    holoenzyme complexes with cyclin B1 (principally) or cyclin A, and with CKS1/2
    phospho-adaptors. CDK1 phosphorylates substrates on S/T-P motifs and drives
    the G2/M transition by phosphorylating over 1000 substrates including lamins,
    condensins, and numerous mitotic machinery proteins.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Should CDK1 be annotated to apoptotic process given that it phosphorylates
    survivin and other apoptosis regulators? Review consensus is NO - this is
    over-annotation. CDK1 phosphorylates over 1000 substrates as part of its cell
    cycle function. Phosphorylating apoptosis regulators to maintain cell viability
    during division is not the same as having apoptosis as an evolved function.
- question: >-
    How should the extensive Reactome pathway annotations resulting in many
    duplicate localization terms be handled? Multiple Reactome pathway references
    for the same localization term create redundancy but add evidence.
