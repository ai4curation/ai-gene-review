description: >-
  ARL6IP1 (also known as ARMER) is an ER membrane-shaping protein that contains reticulon-like
  hairpin transmembrane domains. Its primary function is generating positive membrane
  curvature
  to promote and stabilize tubular ER formation. ARL6IP1 binds to atlastin (ATL1)
  and recruits
  the inositol 5-phosphatase INPP5K to ER tubules. Loss of ARL6IP1 shifts ER architecture
  from
  tubules to sheets. In neurons, it is essential for smooth ER integrity within axons,
  coupling
  ER organization to mitochondrial dynamics at distal axon ends. Mutations cause autosomal
  recessive spastic paraplegia type 61 (SPG61). The anti-apoptotic activity initially
  reported
  (hence the "ARMER" name) is likely a secondary consequence of its role in ER homeostasis
  rather than a direct apoptosis regulatory function.

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        The annotation is technically correct - ARL6IP1 is indeed a membrane protein
        with
        multiple transmembrane domains (PMID:24262037). However, more specific terms
        like
        "endoplasmic reticulum membrane" or "endoplasmic reticulum tubular network"
        better
        capture its localization.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This IBA annotation suggests ARL6IP1 is part of the Sec61 translocon complex.
        However,
        the deep research and primary literature focus entirely on its role as an
        ER membrane-shaping
        protein with reticulon-like function, not as a translocon component.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        There is no evidence in the literature that ARL6IP1 is a component of the
        Sec61 translocon
        complex. The deep research review (Dong et al. 2018, Yamamoto et al. 2014,
        Hubner & Kurth 2014)
        consistently describes ARL6IP1 as an ER membrane-shaping protein that promotes
        tubular ER
        formation through reticulon-like hairpin domains. It interacts with atlastin
        (ATL1) and
        INPP5K, not with Sec61 components. This IBA annotation appears to be an error
        in phylogenetic
        inference, possibly confounding ARL6IP1 with structurally distinct ER proteins.

        This IBA annotation suggests involvement in cotranslational protein targeting.
        However,
        all primary literature describes ARL6IP1 as an ER membrane-shaping protein,
        not involved
        in protein translocation.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        No evidence supports a role for ARL6IP1 in cotranslational protein targeting.
        The
        established function is ER membrane morphology through reticulon-like curvature
        induction
        (PMID:24262037). This annotation likely arose from the same erroneous phylogenetic
        inference as the Sec61 annotation. ARL6IP1 binds atlastin (a membrane fusion
        GTPase)
        and INPP5K (an inositol phosphatase), not ribosome-translocon machinery.

        This IEA annotation maps from the UniProt "Apoptosis" keyword based on the
        ARMER name
        and early characterization. However, the anti-apoptotic effect is a secondary
        consequence

      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: >-
        While ARL6IP1 overexpression does protect cells from apoptosis (PMID:12754298),
        the deep
        research makes clear this is secondary to its primary role in ER morphology.
        Loss of
        ARL6IP1 causes ER structure disruption, leading to ER stress and cell death
        as a
        downstream consequence. The anti-apoptotic effect reflects the importance
        of proper
        ER structure for cell viability, not an evolved apoptosis regulatory function.
        ARL6IP1 is linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) via ER dysfunction,
        not
        apoptosis dysregulation. The annotation to "apoptotic process" without qualifier
        is misleading about the protein's core function.

      reason: >-
        The experimental evidence that ARL6IP1 overexpression protects from apoptosis
        is valid (PMID:12754298). However, the deep research makes clear this anti-apoptotic
        effect is secondary to its primary role in ER membrane shaping. Loss of ER-shaping
        proteins causes ER stress and downstream cell death. The anti-apoptotic effect
        reflects the importance of proper ER structure for cell viability. ARL6IP1
        is
        linked to HSP via ER dysfunction, not apoptosis pathway dysregulation. Keep
        as
        non-core to acknowledge the experimental observation while not misrepresenting

      ARL6IP1 generates positive membrane curvature through reticulon-like hairpin
      transmembrane
      domains, promoting tubular ER formation. The protein oligomerizes (identical
      protein binding)
      which is typical for ER-shaping proteins. Overexpression induces extensive ER
      tubules,
