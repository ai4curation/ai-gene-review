## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8WWK9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cytoskeleton-associated protein 2; AltName: Full=CTCL tumor antigen se20-10; AltName: Full=Tumor- and microtubule-associated protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CKAP2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:1990}; Synonyms=LB1 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAC17466.1}, TMAP {ECO:0000312|EMBL:AAL47212.1};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the CKAP2 family. .
- **Key Domains:** CKAP2_C. (IPR029197); CKAP2_fam. (IPR026165); CKAP2_C (PF15297)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CKAP2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CKAP2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CKAP2** (gene ID: CKAP2, UniProt: Q8WWK9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status and target verification
- Verified target: Human CKAP2 (UniProt Q8WWK9), also known as TMAP/LB1, a member of the CKAP2 family with a C‑terminal CKAP2_C domain. Distinct from the paralog CKAP2L; all evidence below pertains to human CKAP2 (Q8WWK9) (Seki & Fang 2007; Case et al. 2013). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064575 (May 2007; May 2013) (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 1-2).

Executive summary
- Primary function: CKAP2 is a mitotic spindle protein and potent microtubule growth factor that increases nucleation and growth and suppresses catastrophes in vitro; in cells it is essential for maintaining adequate microtubule growth rates, proper spindle assembly, and faithful chromosome segregation (eLife 2022; PNAS 2024). URLs: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202 (Jan 2022); https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (Feb 2024) (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).
- Localization dynamics: CKAP2 associates with centrosomal microtubules in late G2 and with spindle poles and spindle microtubules from prophase to anaphase; it rapidly relocalizes to chromatin upon mitotic exit and is degraded before cytokinesis (JBC 2007; PNAS 2024). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).
- Cell-cycle regulation: CKAP2 is a bona fide APC/C–Cdh1 substrate degraded via a KEN box during mitotic exit; it undergoes mitosis-specific phosphorylation (CDK1–Cyclin B1 among others), with phosphorylation required for centrosome integrity (JBC 2007; JBC 2009; Exp Mol Med 2017; summarized in Case 2013). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m900257200; https://doi.org/10.1038/emm.2017.92 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 13-14).
- Disease relevance: CKAP2 is frequently upregulated in cancers and correlates with worse outcomes in several settings (breast cancer meta-analyses and cohorts; cervical carcinoma independent prognostic HRs; glioma cohorts). Functional knockdown reduces proliferation and migration in breast and cervical models.

*Table: Compact, source-linked evidence table summarizing identity, biochemical activity, localization, cell-cycle regulation, phenotypes, and cancer associations for human CKAP2 (UniProt Q8WWK9). Useful as a quick-reference linking key mechanistic findings (2022–2024) and foundational studies to primary DOIs.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and family: CKAP2 (TMAP/LB1) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein belonging to the CKAP2 family (conserved CKAP2_C domain). It is intrinsically disordered and lysine-rich, lacking canonical MT-binding domains yet acting as a high-potency microtubule (MT) assembly factor (JBC 2007; eLife 2022). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 2-3, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2).
- Core cellular role: CKAP2 is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) of the mitotic spindle that promotes MT nucleation and growth and suppresses catastrophes, thereby supporting spindle assembly, kinetochore–microtubule attachment fidelity, and genome stability (eLife 2022; PNAS 2024; PLoS ONE 2013). URLs: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064575 (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2, case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2022–2024 prioritized)
- In vitro biochemistry (eLife 2022): Purified human CKAP2 markedly lowers the critical tubulin concentration (∼100-fold), boosts the apparent tubulin on-rate ka by ∼54-fold (from ≈2.6 to ≈142 dimers μM−1 s−1 at 500 nM CKAP2), increases growth rates linearly with CKAP2 concentration, and drives catastrophe frequency toward zero at tens of nM concentrations. CKAP2 also potently nucleates MTs at low tubulin levels and does not catalyze depolymerization in the absence of tubulin (Jan 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202 (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 3-4, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 6-7).
- Cellular mechanism (PNAS 2024): Endogenously tagged CKAP2 localizes to mitotic spindles; loss of CKAP2 reduces MT growth rates in cells, increases kinetochore–microtubule misattachments, elevates chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy; re-expression rescues these phenotypes. CKAP2 relocalizes to chromatin at mitotic exit and is degraded, consistent with APC/C regulation (Feb 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).
- Post-translational regulation updates: Foundational work established APC/C–Cdh1-mediated degradation of CKAP2 at mitotic exit and mitotic phosphorylation (KEN box dependency; CDK1–Cyclin B1 sites). A 2025 preprint proposes Aurora A/TPX2-dependent phosphorylation that reduces MT affinity and modulates spindle growth; as preprint evidence, it suggests a regulatory axis integrating Aurora A–TPX2 with CKAP2 function (Sep 2025 preprint). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.09.675182 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, kucharski2025anaurorakinase pages 33-37, kucharski2025anaurorakinase pages 9-13).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Proliferation/prognosis biomarker (breast cancer): In an analysis of public cohorts, higher CKAP2 expression associates with worse overall survival and relapse-free survival in ER+ and HER2− breast cancer; experimental knockdown reduces proliferation, migration, and 3D aggregate formation in aggressive breast cancer cell models (Aug 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14153759 (santos2022knockdownofckap2 pages 16-19).
- Independent prognostic marker (cervical carcinoma): In a clinical cohort, high CKAP2 expression predicted poorer OS with univariate HR 4.686 (95% CI 2.175–9.882, p<0.0001) and multivariate HR 2.383 (95% CI 1.234–6.481, p=0.013). CKAP2 overexpression drove motility and invasion via a FAK–ERK2 axis, and small-molecule FAK (PF-562271) and ERK2 (VX‑11e) inhibitors mitigated these phenotypes, indicating pathway druggability (May 2017). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01832-y (guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 3-4, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 1-2, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 9-11).
- Prognostic association (glioma): Across CGGA (n=301) and TCGA (n≈633) datasets, higher CKAP2 in high-grade glioma associates with shorter OS and PFS; multivariate Cox analyses support CKAP2 as an independent prognostic factor and link expression to malignant features (Aug 2018). URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2018.6611 (wang2018ckap2expressionis pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic centrality to spindle dynamics: The 2022 eLife study concludes CKAP2 is among the most potent known MT growth factors, combining nucleation, polymerase-like acceleration, and anti-catastrophe activity—properties that mechanistically explain its essentiality for faithful mitosis and potential oncogenicity when misregulated (Jan 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202 (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 8-10).
- Genome stability safeguarding: Case et al. (2013) showed that CKAP2 depletion disrupts early MT nucleation organization around chromatin, increases merotelic attachments and anaphase lagging, and leads to polyploidy, directly linking CKAP2 to the maintenance of chromosomal stability (May 2013). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064575 (case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 1-2, case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 13-14).
- Proteolysis control of function: Seki & Fang (2007) established CKAP2 as an APC/C–Cdh1 substrate; overexpression (including non-degradable KEN mutants) arrested cells with monopolar, hyper-bundled spindles for >10 h, indicating that precise CKAP2 turnover is critical for mitotic progression (May 2007). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, seki2007ckap2isa pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- In vitro quantitative biochemistry (eLife 2022):
  • Critical concentration lowering: ~100-fold decrease for MT growth in the presence of CKAP2. • Apparent tubulin on-rate (ka): increased from ≈2.6 to ≈142 dimers μM−1 s−1 at 500 nM CKAP2 (∼54-fold). • Catastrophe suppression: frequencies approach zero at ≈50 nM CKAP2; strong suppression across 6.5–50 nM in TIRF assays. • Growth: increased linearly with CKAP2, with robust nucleation at low tubulin (Jan 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202 (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 3-4, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 6-7, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 2-3, mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2).
- Cell-level phenotypes (PNAS 2024):
  • CKAP2 loss reduces MT growth rates and increases kinetochore–MT misattachments, segregation errors and aneuploidy; rescue by CKAP2 re-expression restores growth rates and fidelity (Feb 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).
- Mitotic proteolysis and overexpression phenotypes (JBC 2007):
  • APC/C–Cdh1-dependent degradation; CKAP2 overexpression or non-degradable mutants cause monopolar, bundled spindles and sustained mitotic arrest (>10 h), with increased G2/M fraction and mitotic index versus controls (May 2007). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, seki2007ckap2isa pages 1-2).
- Cancer prognosis and functional data:
  • Breast cancer (Aug 2022): Higher CKAP2 associates with worse OS in ER+ (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.21–1.94; p=0.0004) and HER2− (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.12–1.74; p=0.0033) cohorts; worse RFS in ER+ (HR 1.54; p=2.4×10−12), HER2− (HR 1.57; p=1.7×10−14), and ER+/HER2− (HR 1.51; p=1.7×10−9) cohorts; knockdown reduces proliferation/migration/3D aggregation (Cancers). URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14153759 (santos2022knockdownofckap2 pages 16-19).
  • Cervical carcinoma (May 2017): OS univariate HR 4.686 (95% CI 2.175–9.882; p<0.0001), multivariate HR 2.383 (95% CI 1.234–6.481; p=0.013); CKAP2-high tumors enriched for metastasis/cell-cycle/FAK pathways; FAK or ERK2 inhibitors reverse CKAP2-driven motility/invasion (Sci Rep). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01832-y (guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 3-4, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 1-2, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 9-11).
  • Glioma (Aug 2018): CKAP2 higher in HGG; higher expression associated with shorter OS and PFS; supported as an independent prognostic factor across CGGA (n=301) and TCGA (n≈633) datasets (Oncol Rep). URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2018.6611 (wang2018ckap2expressionis pages 1-2).

Functional mechanism and pathways
- Microtubule system: CKAP2 binds and stabilizes MTs, promoting nucleation and polymerization, suppressing catastrophes. In cells, it maintains microtubule growth rates compatible with robust k-fiber assembly and accurate kinetochore–microtubule attachments, thereby limiting merotelic attachments and anaphase lagging (eLife 2022; PNAS 2024; PLoS ONE 2013). URLs: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72202; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064575 (mcalear2022themitoticspindle pages 1-2, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2, case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 1-2).
- Cell-cycle regulation: CKAP2 accumulates through mitosis and is degraded by APC/C–Cdh1 during mitotic exit (KEN-box dependent). Mitosis-specific phosphorylation (CDK1–Cyclin B1; additional residues reported) is important for centrosome integrity and spindle formation; potential Aurora A–TPX2 regulation has been proposed (JBC 2007; Case 2013 summary; preprint 2025).

- Signaling links in cancer contexts: CKAP2 overexpression engages the FAK–ERK2 pathway to drive proliferation and motility in cervical carcinoma models, with pharmacologic reversibility, suggesting pathway-level therapeutic leverage rather than direct CKAP2 targeting (Sci Rep 2017). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01832-y (guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 1-2).

Subcellular localization
- Centrosomes/spindles: CKAP2 localizes to centrosomal MTs in late G2 and to spindle poles and spindle MTs from prophase through anaphase (JBC 2007). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9).
- Chromatin relocalization and mitotic exit: CKAP2 rapidly shifts to chromatin upon anaphase/mitotic exit and is subsequently degraded; it is absent from midbody MTs during cytokinesis (JBC 2007; PNAS 2024). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).

Perturbation phenotypes
- Loss-of-function: Early mitosis shows dispersed nucleation (cage-like MTs around chromatin), increased multipolarity, merotelic attachments, lagging chromosomes, polyploidy; reduced cellular MT growth rates and elevated aneuploidy observed in CKAP2 knockout cells; rescue with CKAP2 re-expression restores growth rates and fidelity (PLoS ONE 2013; PNAS 2024). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064575; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318782121 (case2013ckap2ensureschromosomal pages 1-2, paim2024thespindleprotein pages 1-2).
- Overexpression and non-degradable mutants: Monopolar spindles with highly bundled MTs, prolonged mitotic arrest (>10 h), increased mitotic index; underscores the necessity of timely APC/C–Cdh1-mediated degradation (JBC 2007). URL: https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m701688200 (seki2007ckap2isa pages 8-9, seki2007ckap2isa pages 1-2).

Translational considerations and limitations
- Biomarker utility: CKAP2’s strong linkage to proliferation/mitosis and CIN supports its use as a proliferation/prognostic biomarker in certain cancers (e.g., ER+/HER2− breast cancer; cervical carcinoma; glioma). Prospective clinical validation and standardization (antibody clones, scoring) would be needed for routine diagnostics (Cancers 2022; Sci Rep 2017; Oncol Rep 2018). URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14153759; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01832-y; https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2018.6611 (santos2022knockdownofckap2 pages 16-19, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 3-4, wang2018ckap2expressionis pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic targeting: CKAP2 lacks obvious catalytic domains and is intrinsically disordered, complicating direct small-molecule targeting. However, pathway nodes that modulate CKAP2’s function (e.g., Aurora A/TPX2 axis; FAK–ERK2 signaling in cervical models) or proteostasis (APC/C–Cdh1) present testable indirect strategies; the Aurora A/TPX2 regulatory model awaits peer-reviewed validation (preprint). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.09.675182 (kucharski2025anaurorakinase pages 33-37, kucharski2025anaurorakinase pages 9-13, guo2017involvementoffakerk2 pages 1-2).
