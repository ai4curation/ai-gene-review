# CKAP2 (Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 2) – Comprehensive Gene Profile

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms

CKAP2 encodes a cytoskeleton-associated protein known for stabilizing microtubules and regulating cell division ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26586#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,this%20gene%20on%20chromosome%2014)). It acts as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) with potent microtubule polymerization activity. In vitro reconstitution studies revealed CKAP2 as one of the most powerful microtubule nucleation and growth factors identified: it lowers the critical tubulin concentration required for microtubule assembly by ~100-fold, dramatically accelerates microtubule growth rates, and strongly suppresses microtubule catastrophes (shrinkage events) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)). Through these activities, CKAP2 promotes the formation and stability of the mitotic spindle, helping drive the rapid microtubule reorganization needed for cell division ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)). Consistent with this, CKAP2 is considered an important mitotic spindle protein and its misregulation can contribute to aneuploidy and oncogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)).

CKAP2’s molecular action on microtubules includes bundling and stabilization. Ectopic overexpression of CKAP2 in cells induces prominent microtubule bundling, indicating it can cross-link or bundle microtubules into stable arrays ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=functions%20remain%20unknown,We%20also%20show%20that)). While this stabilization is normally beneficial for spindle formation, excessive CKAP2 causes defects: overexpressing CKAP2 leads to mitotic arrest with monopolar spindles due to failure of centrosome separation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=functions%20remain%20unknown,We%20also%20show%20that)). Conversely, loss-of-function studies show that CKAP2 is required for maintaining spindle integrity. CKAP2-depleted cells display a high incidence of spindle aberrations, such as multipolar spindles and other spindle pole defects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=understood,mediated%20nucleation)). Without CKAP2, nascent microtubules formed at mitosis are abnormally dispersed around chromatin (forming a “cage-like” structure) instead of focusing into bipolar spindles ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=understood,mediated%20nucleation)). These mitotic defects lead to downstream errors in chromosome segregation – for example, CKAP2 knockdown cells exhibit merotelic kinetochore attachments (one kinetochore attached to both spindle poles), lagging chromosomes during anaphase, and an increased frequency of polyploidy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=one%20hour%20of%20mitotic%20release,minus%20ends%20to%20the%20spindle)). Such findings underscore that CKAP2’s microtubule-stabilizing activity is crucial for proper bipolar spindle assembly and faithful chromosome segregation. In summary, CKAP2 serves as a non-motor microtubule regulator that promotes microtubule growth and organization, thereby supporting the mechanics of mitosis and preserving genomic stability ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=into%20daughter%20cells.%20Cytoskeleton,mitotic%20block%2C%20consisting%20of%20dispersal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)).

Mechanistically, CKAP2 is regulated by phosphorylation during the cell cycle, which modulates its activity and localization. It contains multiple serine/threonine sites that are phosphorylated in mitosis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26586#:~:text=Summary%20This%20gene%20encodes%20a,this%20gene%20on%20chromosome%2014)). Notably, CKAP2 is a substrate of **Aurora B kinase** – Aurora B phosphorylates CKAP2 on Ser^627 (within a conserved _RRSRRL_ motif), and this modification is critical for CKAP2’s proper behavior during late mitosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=we%20report%20that%20TMAP%20is,Ser627)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=explained%20by%20the%20phosphorylation%20status,the%20subcellular%20localization%20of%20TMAP)). Mutation of the Ser^627 motif disrupts CKAP2’s normal localization: instead of being released from microtubules at the end of mitosis, the non-phosphorylatable mutants abnormally remain attached to microtubules and centrosomes throughout mitosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=substrate%20phosphorylation,However%2C%20the)). This suggests Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation triggers CKAP2’s relocalization (likely its dissociation from spindle microtubules) as cells exit mitosis. **CDK1/cyclin B1** is another cell-cycle kinase that targets CKAP2. In late G2/M, CDK1 phosphorylates CKAP2 on key sites (identified in mouse as Thr^603 and Ser^608, corresponding to human Thr^596 and nearby residues), and these modifications are crucial for CKAP2’s function at the centrosome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). Phospho-mutant CKAP2 (T→A substitutions) fails to maintain normal centrosome number and bipolar spindle formation in CKAP2-deficient cells, indicating that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of CKAP2 is required to control centrosome biogenesis and ensure bipolar spindle assembly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). Together, these phosphorylation events finely tune CKAP2’s activity: they coordinate when CKAP2 associates with or dissociates from microtubules and centrosomes, thereby orchestrating the timing of spindle assembly and disassembly.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components

CKAP2 is predominantly a cytosolic protein that associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton. During interphase, endogenous CKAP2 is largely diffuse in the cytoplasm, with some reports indicating it may concentrate in the **nucleolus** or other subnuclear structures when not needed in the cytosol ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=GO%3A0005730%20,21399614)). As cells prepare for division, CKAP2 relocalizes to microtubule structures. It is strongly enriched at the **mitotic spindle**, particularly at the **spindle poles** and centrosomal region during mitosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=Integrity%20of%20the%20microtubule%20spindle,mechanism%20of%20action%20are%20poorly)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=GO%3A0005737%20,IEA)). Immunolocalization studies show that from late G2 phase through metaphase, CKAP2 accumulates at the separated centrosomes and along spindle microtubules, consistent with its role in spindle organization. Indeed, CKAP2 was originally described as a spindle pole protein: it localizes to the spindle poles and adjacent microtubule fibers in mitotic cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=Integrity%20of%20the%20microtubule%20spindle,mechanism%20of%20action%20are%20poorly)). This spindle pole localization likely underlies its function in focusing microtubule minus-ends and stabilizing the spindle apparatus.

Notably, CKAP2’s subcellular localization is dynamic across the cell cycle, controlled in part by phosphorylation. In late mitosis (anaphase/telophase), phosphorylated CKAP2 is released from the spindle and does not remain on microtubules ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=substrate%20phosphorylation,However%2C%20the)). Instead, just before cytokinesis, a pool of CKAP2 has been observed at the chromosomal region (possibly on chromatin or in reforming nuclei) – a redistribution that depends on the Aurora B phosphorylation at Ser^627 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=substrate%20phosphorylation,However%2C%20the)). By the end of cell division, the protein is targeted for degradation (see below), so it largely disappears until the next cell cycle. Thus, under normal conditions, **endogenous CKAP2 is present at centrosomes/spindle poles during mitosis** and is absent from microtubules in interphase ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=GO%3A0005737%20,IEA)). The transient nucleolar presence noted in some studies might indicate a storage or sequestration mechanism in interphase cells ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=GO%3A0005730%20,21399614)), though this aspect is less well characterized. Overall, the key subcellular components associated with CKAP2, as supported by experimental evidence, are the **centrosomes**, the **mitotic spindle microtubules**, and the **spindle pole** structures ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=GO%3A0005737%20,IEA)).

## Biological Processes Involvement

CKAP2 is involved in fundamental biological processes related to the cell cycle and cytoskeletal organization. **Mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance** is the primary process requiring CKAP2. By regulating microtubule dynamics, CKAP2 ensures that a robust bipolar spindle forms to accurately segregate chromosomes during mitosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=spindle%20defects%20and%20cytokinesis%20failure,bipolarity%20in%20the%20next%20mitosis)). The protein’s stabilizing effect on microtubules contributes to spindle **microtubule organization (a component of mitotic cytoskeleton organization)** and prevents premature microtubule depolymerization (catastrophe), thereby supporting continuous spindle fiber growth and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=one%20hour%20of%20mitotic%20release,minus%20ends%20to%20the%20spindle)). CKAP2’s role in **chromosome segregation** is evidenced by the consequences of its loss: without CKAP2, cells frequently fail to segregate chromosomes correctly, leading to lagging chromosomes and aneuploid daughter cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=one%20hour%20of%20mitotic%20release,minus%20ends%20to%20the%20spindle)). This implies CKAP2 normally helps align and separate chromosomes faithfully (likely by maintaining spindle bipolarity and tension across sister kinetochores).

Another process CKAP2 influences is **centrosome stability and duplication**. Research in primary cells showed CKAP2 is required to maintain centrosome integrity during the cell cycle, thereby allowing proper centrosome duplication and separation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). When CKAP2 is absent or not phosphorylated correctly, cells can develop supernumerary centrosomes or centrosomal abnormalities, which in turn result in aberrant mitoses (e.g. multipolar spindles) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=understood,mediated%20nucleation)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). Thus, CKAP2 participates in the control of the **centrosome cycle**, ensuring only two functional spindle poles form.

CKAP2 is also tied to the **mitotic G2/M transition and exit**. Its protein levels peak at G2/M and then drop rapidly as cells exit mitosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=that%20is%20frequently%20upregulated%20in,motif%20near%20the%20N%20terminus)), suggesting CKAP2’s presence is tightly coupled to the mitotic phase. It is actively degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ubiquitin ligase during **mitotic exit** (through the Cdh1 co-activator), and this timely degradation is important for completing cytokinesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=resulted%20in%20cell%20cycle%20arrest,destruction%20during%20mitotic%20exit%20serves)). Expression of a non-degradable CKAP2 mutant leads to cytokinesis failure and persistent spindle defects in the next cell cycle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=degradation%20of%20TMAP%2FCKAP2%20during%20mitotic,and%20in%20the%20maintenance%20of)), indicating that **cytokinesis** and the reset of spindle architecture for the next cycle depend on removing CKAP2 at the end of mitosis. In summary, CKAP2 contributes to multiple cellular processes within the broader context of cell division: it participates in **microtubule cytoskeleton organization during mitosis**, **ensures bipolar spindle formation**, **helps maintain chromosomal stability** by preventing segregation errors, and must be properly eliminated to allow **successful cytokinesis and normal cell cycle progression** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=spindle%20defects%20and%20cytokinesis%20failure,bipolarity%20in%20the%20next%20mitosis)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=one%20hour%20of%20mitotic%20release,minus%20ends%20to%20the%20spindle)).

Beyond mitosis, CKAP2’s influence on cell fate is intertwined with checkpoint pathways and genome stability. For instance, loss of CKAP2 function can trigger the p53-dependent post-mitotic checkpoints due to genome instability (cells becoming aneuploid will often activate p53 and undergo cell cycle arrest or cell death). In line with this, CKAP2 has been implicated in **p53-dependent pathways of cell cycle control and apoptosis** – improper CKAP2 function (leading to aneuploidy) can activate p53, whereas in p53-deficient backgrounds CKAP2 misregulation might directly contribute to unchecked proliferation ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=UniProtKB%2FSwiss)). Overall, the proper functioning of CKAP2 is critical for the **mitotic cell cycle**, particularly the processes of spindle organization, chromosome segregation, and cell division, all of which are central to the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms such as **“mitotic spindle assembly”**, **“chromosome segregation”**, and **“cell division”**.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features

CKAP2 is a 683-amino-acid protein (canonical isoform) with a largely uncharacterized domain structure. It **lacks any previously well-known conserved domains** or enzymatic motifs, and does not share significant homology with other major MAP families ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=Cytoskeleton,does%20not%20share%20significant%20homology)). However, a conserved region in its C-terminus has been defined: the **CKAP2_C domain** (Pfam ID: PF15297) spans roughly the latter half of the protein ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26586#:~:text=pfam15297%20Location%3A326%20%E2%86%92%20673%20CKAP2_C%3B,associated%20protein)). This C-terminal segment is thought to mediate microtubule binding and stabilization, as truncation studies have suggested the microtubule-associating activity resides in that region. The N-terminal half of CKAP2 is less defined but is predicted to contain low-complexity sequences and possible coiled-coil motifs that may contribute to oligomerization or binding to other proteins. Indeed, coiled-coil structure could explain CKAP2’s ability to bundle microtubules, although classical coiled-coil domains are not annotated. 

One key sequence motif in CKAP2 is a **KEN-box** near the N-terminus, which serves as a recognition signal for the APC/C^Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase. The presence of this KEN-box is *necessary* for CKAP2’s targeted destruction during late mitosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=resulted%20in%20cell%20cycle%20arrest,destruction%20during%20mitotic%20exit%20serves)). Mutating or deleting the KEN motif renders CKAP2 non-degradable by APC/C, leading to its persistence past mitosis and causing errors in spindle function and cytokinesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=degradation%20of%20TMAP%2FCKAP2%20during%20mitotic,and%20in%20the%20maintenance%20of)). This underscores the importance of that short motif as a functional element regulating CKAP2’s stability. Apart from the KEN-box, CKAP2 does not have other common destruction motifs like D-boxes (destruction boxes) reported, so the KEN sequence (and potentially neighboring residues) is the primary APC/C recognition element for CKAP2.

CKAP2 also features multiple **phosphorylation sites** that are critical for its function. We discussed two major regulatory phosphosites: one is Ser^627, within the sequence _RRSRRL_ (amino acids 625–630), which is phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=we%20report%20that%20TMAP%20is,Ser627)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=explained%20by%20the%20phosphorylation%20status,the%20subcellular%20localization%20of%20TMAP)). This motif around Ser^627 is highly conserved and constitutes a specific Aurora B consensus sequence; it controls CKAP2’s localization in anaphase as described above. Another important region lies around Thr^596 (human numbering; Thr^603 in mouse) and Ser^601/608, which are sites phosphorylated by CDK1/cyclin B1 during early mitosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). These sites conform to the minimal CDK1 consensus (S/TP motifs) and their phosphorylation is essential for CKAP2 to support normal centrosome and spindle function. In summary, although CKAP2 is not an enzyme and has no catalytic domains, it possesses **functional motifs**: a **C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (CKAP2_C)**, an **N-terminal APC/C-targeting KEN-box**, and several **phospho-regulatory sites** (for Aurora B, CDK1, and likely other mitotic kinases). These features collectively enable CKAP2’s role as a structural MAP that is tightly controlled by cell-cycle signals. The lack of any enzymatic domain means CKAP2’s molecular function is best described as **microtubule binding** and stabilization – consistent with Gene Ontology molecular function terms such as **“microtubule binding” (GO:0008017)**.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation

In human tissues, **CKAP2 expression is strongly associated with proliferative cell populations**. RNA expression profiles indicate relatively high CKAP2 mRNA levels in tissues with frequent cell division. For example, CKAP2 is expressed robustly in bone marrow and in testis (both tissues with high proliferative activity), among others ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26586#:~:text=Expression%20Broad%20expression%20in%20bone,24%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). Conversely, in most differentiated, non-dividing tissues, CKAP2 expression is low to negligible. This pattern aligns with CKAP2’s role in cell cycle progression – it is largely unnecessary in quiescent cells but induced in cells entering the cell cycle. During the normal cell cycle, CKAP2 expression (and protein abundance) is tightly regulated. **CKAP2 transcript and protein levels are low in G1 phase, begin to rise as cells commit to division (G1/S transition), and peak during G2/M phase** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=that%20is%20frequently%20upregulated%20in,motif%20near%20the%20N%20terminus)). The protein level then drops precipitously after metaphase, due to APC/C-mediated degradation, such that CKAP2 is nearly absent in G1 of the next cell cycle ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=that%20is%20frequently%20upregulated%20in,motif%20near%20the%20N%20terminus)). This cyclical pattern ensures CKAP2 is available when needed for mitosis and is removed afterwards to allow cells to exit mitosis properly.

At the transcriptional level, CKAP2 is subject to regulation by cell proliferation signals and stress responses. Several studies have found that CKAP2 expression can be upregulated by oncogenic or stress-related pathways. For instance, under hypoxic conditions in tumors, the transcription factor HIF-1α can drive CKAP2 expression. A long non-coding RNA **DLEU1** acts as a co-activator for HIF-1α, enhancing HIF-1’s ability to transactivate the CKAP2 gene; this mechanism contributes to breast cancer malignancy by elevating CKAP2 levels ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=2.%20Long%20non,induced%20transcription%20of%20CKAP2)). In another regulatory axis, CKAP2 is modulated by microRNAs and competing endogenous RNAs. **LncRNA DARS-AS1** (an antisense long non-coding RNA) has been shown to promote hepatocellular carcinoma progression by sponging miR-3200-5p, thereby de-repressing CKAP2 expression ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=3.%20LncRNA%20DARS,CKAP2%29%20axis)). In normal scenarios, miR-3200-5p would target CKAP2 mRNA for degradation or translational inhibition; when the lncRNA absorbs that microRNA, CKAP2 protein is elevated, driving cancer cell growth. These examples illustrate that CKAP2 is a downstream effector in certain oncogenic pathways, where increased CKAP2 expression contributes to uncontrolled proliferation.

Additionally, CKAP2 expression responds to extracellular signals like growth factors and stress. Under high-glucose conditions (such as in diabetic microenvironments), CKAP2 was found to be upregulated in retinal capillary endothelial cells through a pathway involving **VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and p53** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=4.%20Cytoskeleton,glucose%20conditions)). This suggests that hyperglycemia-induced VEGF signaling can influence CKAP2 levels, potentially linking CKAP2 to pathological angiogenesis or cellular stress responses; p53’s involvement hints that normally p53 might repress CKAP2 (since p53 activation generally halts cell cycle progression), but in high glucose, p53 regulation of CKAP2 is altered. Moreover, cell-cycle transcription factors likely regulate CKAP2: E2F family factors (which drive many G1/S genes) could induce CKAP2 transcription as cells enter S-phase, though specific promoters/enhancers for CKAP2 have not been fully delineated in literature. Experimental data from cancer cell lines also indicate that the transcription factor dimer TFDP1/E2F can upregulate CKAP2, promoting colorectal cancer cell proliferation and metastasis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11637825/#:~:text=CKAP2%20Regulated%20by%20TFDP1%20Promotes,The%20cell%20viabilities%20of)) (TFDP1 being a partner of E2F). Thus, CKAP2 sits at the convergence of cell-cycle regulation and stress/onco-signaling, with multiple layers of control – transcriptional (via factors like HIF-1α/E2F), post-transcriptional (via lncRNAs and miRNAs), and post-translational (via phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation).

## Evolutionary Conservation

CKAP2 appears to be a vertebrate-specific gene, conserved throughout the **chordate** lineage. Orthologs of CKAP2 are found in mammals, birds, and reptiles, and the gene was present in the common ancestor of chordates ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=Orthologs%20for%20CKAP2%20Gene)). For example, **mouse Ckap2** (the murine ortholog) shares significant sequence identity with human CKAP2 and exhibits the same functional characteristics of microtubule stabilization and spindle localization ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=functions%20remain%20unknown,wild%20type%2C%20expression%20of%20a)). Studies in mouse cells have confirmed that murine CKAP2 also associates with microtubules and can cause spindle defects if misexpressed, indicating the protein’s role has been functionally conserved between mice and humans ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=functions%20remain%20unknown,We%20also%20show%20that)). Likewise, other mammals (such as cows, dogs, etc.) possess CKAP2 orthologs with high sequence homology, and these orthologs likely fulfill the same role in cell division.

Interestingly, no true CKAP2 orthologs are found in non-chordate model organisms like yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* or *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*), fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*), or nematodes. The absence of CKAP2 in invertebrates and unicellular eukaryotes suggests that this gene emerged or became important in the context of multicellular vertebrate evolution – possibly correlating with the increasing complexity of spindle regulation in larger, longer-lived organisms. Lower eukaryotes rely on other MAPs (e.g. the XMAP215/Dis1 family, etc.) for similar microtubule regulatory functions. CKAP2 may represent a vertebrate innovation to fine-tune mitotic stability and genome maintenance. 

In humans, CKAP2 has a notable paralog: **CKAP2L** (CKAP2-like). CKAP2L likely arose from a gene duplication event and retains similar microtubule-binding and cell-cycle regulated properties ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=CKAP2%20,of%20this%20gene%20is%20CKAP2L)). Indeed, recent studies show human CKAP2L is also a microtubule-stabilizing protein with a cell cycle expression pattern, though it is distinct in sequence and associated with certain developmental diseases when mutated (e.g. CKAP2L mutations cause Filippi syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by microcephaly and cutaneous abnormalities, highlighting the importance of this protein family in development). The existence of CKAP2L underlines the evolutionary conservation and diversification of the CKAP2 family in mammals. 

Overall, **CKAP2 is conserved in vertebrate species and has no orthologs in yeast, flies, or worms ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CKAP2#:~:text=Orthologs%20for%20CKAP2%20Gene))**, indicating its functions became essential in more complex organisms. Its conservation across mammals, and the retention of key motifs (like the KEN-box and Aurora B site), reinforce the critical nature of its role in mitosis. Conservation of these sequence features across species implies strong selective pressure to maintain CKAP2’s function in preserving genomic stability during cell division.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes

CKAP2 has attracted interest due to its frequent dysregulation in cancers and its potential role in driving genomic instability. It is not a classical tumor suppressor or oncogene by mutation; instead, **CKAP2 is often **overexpressed** in a variety of human cancers**, linking it to oncogenic processes. The gene was first identified in the context of malignancy – for example, an early study found CKAP2 (as “LB1”/“TMAP”) upregulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, as well as in gastric cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=Cytoskeleton,does%20not%20share%20significant%20homology)). This association with proliferative diseases suggested CKAP2 might contribute to tumor cell division or serve as a marker of proliferation. Subsequent research has reinforced that idea: high CKAP2 expression is correlated with increased cell proliferation and poorer clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types.

**Prognostic marker in cancer:** In breast cancer, CKAP2 has been shown to be a strong proliferation marker. Tumor cells often display CKAP2 localized on mitotic chromatin (hence the term “chromatin CKAP2”), and the level of CKAP2-positive dividing cells correlates with tumor aggressiveness. A 2014 study demonstrated that CKAP2 frequency in tumor samples was an independent prognostic indicator for relapse-free survival in early-stage breast cancer ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=9,clinical%20evaluation%20of%20proliferation%20activity)). It was proposed that assessing CKAP2 in tumor biopsies could even substitute for the mitotic index or Ki-67 index as a measure of tumor proliferation activity ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=9,clinical%20evaluation%20of%20proliferation%20activity)). Similarly, in **gliomas**, especially high-grade glioblastomas, CKAP2 is often elevated; patients with **high CKAP2 expression have worse prognosis** than those with low expression ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=7,associated%20with%20highgrade%20glioma)). CKAP2 immunoreactivity correlates with glioma tumor growth rates, making it a potential prognostic marker in brain tumors.

**Oncogenic roles:** Beyond being a marker, CKAP2 may actively contribute to tumor progression. Because CKAP2 loss causes genomic instability, cells that manage to tolerate CKAP2 overexpression could accumulate aneuploidy, which can fuel cancer evolution. In line with this, enforced CKAP2 expression in cell models enhances proliferation and can promote transformation phenotypes. In **cervical carcinoma** cells, CKAP2 was found to act as a functional oncogene: overexpression of CKAP2 increased cellular proliferation and motility, partly by activating the FAK–ERK2 signaling pathway ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=5,ERK2%20signaling%20pathway)). This suggests CKAP2’s influence might extend to cytoskeleton-related signaling (FAK is focal adhesion kinase, linking the cytoskeleton to growth signals). **Ovarian cancer** studies also report CKAP2 as a contributor to tumor growth – high CKAP2 levels promote ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through the FAK-ERK pathway, analogous to the cervical cancer findings ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=8,associated%20with%20Ovarian%20Cancer)). Furthermore, **lung adenocarcinoma** clinical analyses showed that patients whose tumors overexpress **CKAP2 have significantly worse overall survival** than those with lower expression ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=1,in%20patients%20with%20lung%20adenocarcinoma)). CKAP2 overexpression in lung cancer was associated with advanced disease stages and was identified as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9333529/#:~:text=Adenocarcinoma%20is%20a%20non%E2%80%93small,and%20lung%20adenocarcinoma%20driver%20genes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9333529/#:~:text=The%20expression%20of%20CKAP2%20was,used%20to%20examine%20the%20prognostic)). These data across cancers suggest that CKAP2 upregulation confers a growth advantage or more aggressive phenotype to tumor cells. It may do so by enabling tolerance to chromosomal instability or by interacting with signaling networks that drive cell cycle progression.

Apart from solid tumors, CKAP2 is implicated in hematologic malignancies as well. Its initial discovery in lymphomas hinted that rapidly proliferating lymphocytes express CKAP2. Indeed, some leukemia studies indicate CKAP2 expression is elevated in certain leukemic blasts compared to normal blood cells ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=10,leukaemia%20patients%20and%20healthy%20donors)). However, CKAP2 is not known to be recurrently mutated in cancers; it’s the expression level that is key. Because CKAP2 lies on chromosome 13q14.3, a region often deleted in diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), one might suspect a tumor-suppressive angle, but CKAP2’s role appears predominantly pro-proliferative (in CLL, the 13q14 deletion encompasses other genes like miR-15/16 and RB1; CKAP2’s deletion impact is not clear). Instead, it’s the overexpression in many carcinomas that is noteworthy.

In terms of non-cancer phenotypes, germline mutations in CKAP2 have not been well documented in humans. CKAP2 is not a known Mendelian disease gene, and there are no common congenital disorders tied to CKAP2 mutations according to current literature (contrasting with its paralog CKAP2L, which when mutated causes Filippi syndrome). This could be due to redundancy (partial compensation by CKAP2L) or because CKAP2 function is essential and loss-of-function might be embryonic lethal. Mouse knockout models for Ckap2 have been reported to have mitotic defects and increased aneuploidy, but comprehensive phenotypic analysis in vivo is still limited in published sources. One study noted that depletion of Ckap2 in mouse hepatocytes led to centrosome amplification and genomic instability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=Previously%2C%20we%20have%20reported%20that,S608%20were%20phosphorylated%20by%20CDK1%E2%80%93cyclin)), aligning with cell culture findings. It’s plausible that complete CKAP2 loss in a whole organism could compromise high-turnover tissues (like bone marrow or intestine) due to chromosomal instability.

In summary, **CKAP2 is broadly associated with cancer phenotypes**. Its overexpression is a hallmark of highly proliferative tumors and correlates with poor patient prognosis in cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, high-grade glioma, ovarian carcinoma, and breast cancer ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=1,in%20patients%20with%20lung%20adenocarcinoma)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=7,associated%20with%20highgrade%20glioma)). Functionally, CKAP2 can drive oncogenic behaviors (enhanced proliferation, migration) when aberrantly expressed, likely by permitting the chromosome instability that gives cancer cells a growth/survival advantage or by activating pro-growth signaling pathways. These findings make CKAP2 a candidate prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target: inhibiting CKAP2 function in tumors might restore proper mitotic checkpoints and reduce tumor cell viability, although no CKAP2-specific inhibitors exist yet. Importantly for GO annotation, CKAP2 is linked to the biological process **“regulation of cell proliferation”** and **“positive regulation of mitotic cell cycle”** in pathological contexts.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature

To support Gene Ontology annotations, below is a summary of key experimental findings and primary literature on CKAP2:

- **Identification and Cancer Association (1998–2007):** CKAP2 was initially identified as a gene upregulated in certain cancers. Maouche-Chretien *et al.* (1998) cloned a cDNA (termed LB1) from lymphoma cells, marking CKAP2 as a novel cytoskeletal protein associated with malignancy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=Cytoskeleton,does%20not%20share%20significant%20homology)). Kyung-Uk Hong and colleagues carried out a series of studies in the 2000s characterizing CKAP2. In **Hong *et al* 2007 (Mol. Cell. Biol.)**, they demonstrated that CKAP2 (then called TMAP) is a microtubule-associated protein required for spindle function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=Cytoskeleton,We%20also%20show%20that)). Overexpression in cells caused abnormal microtubule bundling and monopolar spindles, whereas CKAP2 destruction at mitotic exit (mediated by an N-terminal KEN-box and APC/C^Cdh1) was shown to be crucial for normal cytokinesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=resulted%20in%20cell%20cycle%20arrest,destruction%20during%20mitotic%20exit%20serves)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=degradation%20of%20TMAP%2FCKAP2%20during%20mitotic,and%20in%20the%20maintenance%20of)). They created a non-degradable CKAP2 mutant which, when expressed, led to increased spindle defects and failed cytokinesis, solidifying the importance of timely CKAP2 degradation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=degradation%20of%20TMAP%2FCKAP2%20during%20mitotic,and%20in%20the%20maintenance%20of)).

- **Aurora B Phosphorylation (2010):** **Kim *et al.* 2010 (Cell Cycle)** discovered that CKAP2 is a substrate of Aurora B kinase, identifying **Ser^627** as a specific Aurora B phosphorylation site ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=we%20report%20that%20TMAP%20is,Ser627)). They showed that this phosphorylation regulates CKAP2’s localization in late mitosis: mutants at Ser^627 remained abnormally on microtubules and centrosomes instead of disassociating, indicating the modification is needed for proper mitotic progression ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20458174/#:~:text=substrate%20phosphorylation,However%2C%20the)). This study provided direct evidence of a molecular mechanism by which a mitotic kinase controls CKAP2 function.

- **Role in Spindle Stability (2013):** **Case *et al.* 2013 (PLoS ONE)** used RNAi to probe CKAP2’s function, revealing that **CKAP2 is required for maintaining focused spindle poles and microtubule nucleation sites** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=into%20daughter%20cells.%20Cytoskeleton,mitotic%20block%2C%20consisting%20of%20dispersal)). CKAP2-depleted cells exhibited multipolar spindles and an unusual dispersion of microtubules after release from mitotic arrest, leading to merotelic kinetochore attachments and lagging chromosomes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=understood,mediated%20nucleation)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=one%20hour%20of%20mitotic%20release,minus%20ends%20to%20the%20spindle)). They concluded that CKAP2 concentrates microtubule minus-ends at spindle poles and its absence compromises spindle integrity and chromosomal stability. This provided functional evidence aligning CKAP2 with GO processes like spindle organization and chromosome segregation.

- **CDK1 Phosphorylation and Centrosomes (2017):** **Yoo *et al.* 2017 (Exp. Mol. Med.)** identified **Thr^603/Ser^608 in mouse CKAP2 (Thr^596/Ser^601 in human)** as targets of CDK1/cyclin B1 phosphorylation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). They demonstrated that CKAP2-depleted cells suffer centrosome amplification and segregation errors, which could be rescued by wild-type CKAP2 but not by CKAP2 mutants lacking those phosphorylation sites ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=Previously%2C%20we%20have%20reported%20that,S608%20were%20phosphorylated%20by%20CDK1%E2%80%93cyclin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5565958/#:~:text=among%20the%20various%20aspects%20of,biogenesis%20and%20bipolar%20spindle%20formation)). This established that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of CKAP2 is crucial for controlling centrosome duplication and ensuring bipolar spindle formation, reinforcing CKAP2’s role in centrosome-related processes.

- **Microtubule Polymerization Factor (2022):** **McAlear & Bechstedt 2022 (eLife)** provided biochemical evidence for CKAP2’s activity on microtubules. Using purified components, they showed **CKAP2 is an exceptionally potent microtubule nucleator and growth promoter**, far exceeding the activity of classic MAPs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)). CKAP2 lowered the tubulin concentration needed for nucleation by two orders of magnitude and increased microtubule growth rates 50-fold in vitro ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8798059/#:~:text=misregulation%20can%20lead%20to%20aneuploidy,protein%2C%20proliferation%20marker%2C%20and%20oncogene)). It also suppressed microtubule catastrophes, thereby strongly stabilizing microtubules. This study explained at a mechanistic level why CKAP2 is critical for spindle assembly and provided a molecular function basis (“microtubule polymerase/stabilizer”) for GO annotation.

- **Cancer Biomarker Studies (2014–2022):** Multiple clinical studies have solidified CKAP2 as a proliferation marker in cancer. For example, **Kim *et al.* 2014 (PLoS ONE)** showed that chromatin-bound CKAP2 positively correlates with proliferation index in breast cancer and is an independent prognostic marker for patient outcomes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=9,clinical%20evaluation%20of%20proliferation%20activity)). Subsequent analyses in other cancers found that **elevated CKAP2 expression is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis**, including in **lung adenocarcinoma** (worse overall survival) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=1,in%20patients%20with%20lung%20adenocarcinoma)), **high-grade gliomas** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=7,associated%20with%20highgrade%20glioma)), and **ovarian cancer** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=26586#:~:text=8,associated%20with%20Ovarian%20Cancer)). These studies often use immunohistochemistry to measure CKAP2 in tumor tissues and statistical models to link it with survival, supporting GO annotations related to cell proliferation and cell cycle in a disease context.

Each of the above findings contributes to the GO knowledge of CKAP2. In summary, CKAP2 is a **microtubule-binding protein** (Molecular Function) that localizes to the **centrosome/spindle pole** (Cellular Component) and is involved in **mitotic microtubule organization, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis** (Biological Process). The curated evidence from diverse experiments – from biochemical assays and cell imaging to animal models and clinical samples – provides a strong foundation for accurate Gene Ontology annotations of CKAP2’s functions and roles ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23737987/#:~:text=into%20daughter%20cells.%20Cytoskeleton,mitotic%20block%2C%20consisting%20of%20dispersal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1900002/#:~:text=spindle%20defects%20and%20cytokinesis%20failure,bipolarity%20in%20the%20next%20mitosis)).
