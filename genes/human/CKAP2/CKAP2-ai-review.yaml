description: CKAP2 is a potent microtubule-associated protein that functions as the most powerful known
  microtubule growth factor and stabilizer. Essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis,
  CKAP2 promotes microtubule nucleation (~100-fold enhancement), dramatically increases growth rates (~20%),
  and suppresses catastrophic depolymerization. Required for proper mitotic spindle organization, bipolar
  spindle assembly, and genomic stability. Cell cycle-regulated protein that peaks at G2/M phase and is
  degraded by APC/C during mitotic exit.

      core molecular function of CKAP2.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is a cytoplasmic protein that functions throughout the cytoplasm to regulate microtubule
      dynamics. During interphase, it is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, and during mitosis it
      concentrates at specific cytoplasmic structures like the mitotic spindle.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cytoplasmic localization is fundamental for CKAP2's function as a microtubule-associated protein
      that must be present in the cytoplasm to interact with cytoplasmic microtubules and regulate their
      nucleation, polymerization, and stability throughout the cell cycle.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is indeed a cytoskeleton-associated protein, specifically a microtubule-associated
      protein (MAP). However, this term is too general - the more specific microtubule cytoskeleton term
      better captures CKAP2s function. This annotation is correct but lacks specificity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is accurate but lacks specificity. CKAP2 specifically associates with the
      microtubule cytoskeleton rather than the broader cytoskeleton. The more specific microtubule-related
      annotations capture CKAP2s function more precisely. This general term provides limited functional

    summary: PMID:16061649 explicitly states that "In p53-competent cells, Ckap2 does not induce tetraploidy
      but activates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis." This demonstrates that CKAP2 overexpression
      can directly activate apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. However, this is based on overexpression
      studies and may not represent normal physiological function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is supported by experimental evidence but represents a consequence of CKAP2
      overexpression rather than a core physiological function. The apoptosis occurs as a p53-mediated
      response to genomic instability caused by CKAP2 dysregulation, not as a direct function of CKAP2.

    summary: This annotation is based on immunofluorescence data (GO_REF:0000052), but neither PMID:16061649
      nor PMID:21399614 mention nucleolar localization. PMID:16061649 shows CKAP2 is absent in G1 phase
      when nucleolar localization might be expected. This localization is not functionally significant
      compared to CKAP2s core mitotic functions.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While some immunofluorescence data may suggest nucleolar localization, this is not supported
      by functional literature or the deep research findings. CKAP2 is primarily active during mitosis
      and largely absent during G1 when nucleolar functions are most active. Any nucleolar localization
      appears to be non-functional and peripheral to CKAP2s core mitotic roles.

    action: ACCEPT

      are in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. This appears to be an over-annotation
      possibly due to cross-reactivity or mislocalization artifacts.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While immunofluorescence data suggests ciliary localization, this is not supported by functional
      literature. CKAP2s core functions are in mitotic spindle assembly and microtubule dynamics during
      cell division. Ciliary localization may represent cross-reactivity or technical artifacts rather
      than functional significance. The deep research reveals no evidence for ciliary functions.

      nor PMID:21399614 provide evidence for ciliary basal body localization or function. CKAP2s well-characterized
      functions are in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, not ciliary processes. This
      appears to be an over-annotation possibly due to immunofluorescence artifacts.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Similar to cilium localization, this annotation lacks functional support from the literature.
      While the ciliary basal body and centrosome share structural similarities, there is no evidence

      interaction domains for spindle organization.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 exhibits protein domain-specific binding through several characterized motifs including
      its KEN-box that specifically binds APC/C^Cdh1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and multiple
      phosphorylation consensus sites that bind specific mitotic kinases (CDK1/cyclin B1 and Aurora B).
      These domain-specific interactions are essential for CKAP2's cell cycle regulation and proper function.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is essential for microtubule organizing center (centrosome) organization and function.
      It localizes to centrosomes, is required for centrosome integrity, and organizes spindle pole microtubule
      nucleation sites during mitosis.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 plays a critical role in organizing microtubule organizing centers, particularly centrosomes.
      It localizes to centrosomes during the cell cycle, is required for maintaining centrosome integrity
      and duplication, and organizes microtubule nucleation from spindle poles. Loss of CKAP2 leads to
      centrosome abnormalities and compromised MTOC function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: CKAP2-deep-research.md
  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is one of the most potent positive regulators of microtubule polymerization, dramatically
      accelerating microtubule growth rates by approximately 20% and lowering the critical concentration
      for assembly by 100-fold.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 is biochemically characterized as an exceptionally powerful positive regulator of microtubule
      polymerization. In vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that CKAP2 dramatically enhances
      microtubule growth rates and reduces the tubulin concentration needed for polymerization. This positive
      regulation is fundamental to its role in rapid spindle assembly during mitosis.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: CKAP2-deep-research.md
  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase and contains
      a KEN-box degradation signal. APC/C^Cdh1-mediated degradation of CKAP2 during mitotic exit is essential
      for proper cytokinesis and cell cycle progression.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 is directly involved in APC/C-dependent catabolic processes as a target substrate. It
      contains an N-terminal KEN-box that serves as a recognition signal for APC/C^Cdh1-mediated ubiquitination
      and degradation. This timely degradation during late mitosis is functionally critical - non-degradable
      CKAP2 mutants cause cytokinesis defects and spindle abnormalities.

    label: mitotic cell cycle phase transition
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: CKAP2-deep-research.md
  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is essential for multiple mitotic cell cycle phase transitions, particularly G2/M transition
      where it accumulates and becomes active, and mitotic exit where it must be degraded for proper cytokinesis
      and return to interphase.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 plays critical roles in mitotic cell cycle phase transitions through its cell cycle-regulated
      expression, phosphorylation, and degradation. Its accumulation during G2/M transition is required
      for mitotic entry, while its APC/C-mediated destruction is essential for mitotic exit. Defects in
      CKAP2 regulation disrupt these transitions and cause cell cycle abnormalities.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 directly promotes microtubule polymerization by dramatically accelerating growth rates,
      suppressing catastrophic depolymerization, and lowering the critical tubulin concentration required
      for assembly. This is a core biochemical activity of CKAP2.
    action: NEW
    reason: Microtubule polymerization is a fundamental biological process directly catalyzed by CKAP2.
      Biochemical studies demonstrate that CKAP2 is one of the most potent microtubule polymerization
      factors, increasing growth rates and promoting assembly. This activity is the molecular basis for

      assembly defects including multipolar spindles.
    action: NEW
    reason: Spindle assembly is a core biological process requiring CKAP2. Multiple experimental approaches
      demonstrate that CKAP2 is essential for proper spindle assembly - its microtubule nucleation and
      stabilization activities drive the rapid formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus. Loss of CKAP2

      CKAP2 depletion or dysfunction leads to centrosome amplification and abnormal centrosome numbers,
      which disrupts bipolar spindle formation.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 plays an essential role in controlling centrosome duplication. Studies demonstrate that
      CKAP2-depleted cells exhibit centrosome amplification and abnormal centrosome numbers, while CDK1-mediated
      phosphorylation of CKAP2 is specifically required for proper centrosome biogenesis. This centrosome

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 regulates chromosome segregation by ensuring proper spindle assembly, kinetochore-microtubule
      attachments, and preventing chromosome segregation errors. CKAP2 dysfunction leads to increased
      aneuploidy and segregation defects.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 functions as a key regulator of chromosome segregation through its effects on spindle
      organization and microtubule dynamics. Loss of CKAP2 results in merotelic kinetochore attachments,
      lagging chromosomes, and increased aneuploidy frequency. By maintaining proper spindle architecture
      and microtubule stability, CKAP2 ensures accurate chromosome distribution during mitosis.
