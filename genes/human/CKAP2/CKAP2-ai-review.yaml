description: 'CKAP2 is a potent microtubule-associated protein that functions as the most powerful known microtubule growth factor and stabilizer. Essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, CKAP2 promotes microtubule nucleation (~100-fold enhancement), dramatically increases growth rates (~20%), and suppresses catastrophic depolymerization. Required for proper mitotic spindle organization, bipolar spindle assembly, and genomic stability. Cell cycle-regulated protein that peaks at G2/M phase and is degraded by APC/C during mitotic exit.'
