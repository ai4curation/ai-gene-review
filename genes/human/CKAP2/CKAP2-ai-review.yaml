description: CKAP2 is a potent microtubule-associated protein that functions as the
  most powerful known microtubule growth factor and stabilizer. Essential for faithful
  chromosome segregation during mitosis, CKAP2 promotes microtubule nucleation (~100-fold
  enhancement), dramatically increases growth rates (~20%), and suppresses catastrophic
  depolymerization. Required for proper mitotic spindle organization, bipolar spindle
  assembly, and genomic stability. Cell cycle-regulated protein that peaks at G2/M
  phase and is degraded by APC/C during mitotic exit.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is indeed present in the cytoplasm, particularly during interphase
      when it is largely diffuse in the cytosol. However, this is a very general localization
      term that does not capture CKAP2s specific and functionally important localizations.
      This annotation is correct but not informative.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While technically correct, this annotation provides minimal functional
      information. CKAP2s core functions are better captured by more specific subcellular
      localizations like mitotic spindle, spindle pole, and centrosome. General cytoplasmic
      localization is peripheral to understanding CKAP2s essential mitotic functions.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is indeed a cytoskeleton-associated protein, specifically a microtubule-associated
      protein (MAP). However, this term is too general - the more specific microtubule
      cytoskeleton term better captures CKAP2s function. This annotation is correct
      but lacks specificity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is accurate but lacks specificity. CKAP2 specifically
      associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton rather than the broader cytoskeleton.
      The more specific microtubule-related annotations capture CKAP2s function more
      precisely. This general term provides limited functional insight.

      not induce tetraploidy but activates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis."
      This demonstrates that CKAP2 overexpression can directly activate apoptosis
      in a p53-dependent manner. However, this is based on overexpression studies
      and may not represent normal physiological function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is supported by experimental evidence but represents a
      consequence of CKAP2 overexpression rather than a core physiological function.
      The apoptosis occurs as a p53-mediated response to genomic instability caused
      by CKAP2 dysregulation, not as a direct function of CKAP2. This is a contextual

    summary: This annotation is based on immunofluorescence data (GO_REF:0000052),
      but neither PMID:16061649 nor PMID:21399614 mention nucleolar localization.
      PMID:16061649 shows CKAP2 is absent in G1 phase when nucleolar localization
      might be expected. This localization is not functionally significant compared
      to CKAP2s core mitotic functions.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While some immunofluorescence data may suggest nucleolar localization,
      this is not supported by functional literature or the deep research findings.
      CKAP2 is primarily active during mitosis and largely absent during G1 when nucleolar
      functions are most active. Any nucleolar localization appears to be non-functional
      and peripheral to CKAP2s core mitotic roles.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation reflects a functionally important aspect of CKAP2s cellular

      function. CKAP2s well-characterized functions are in mitotic spindle assembly
      and chromosome segregation. This appears to be an over-annotation possibly due
      to cross-reactivity or mislocalization artifacts.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While immunofluorescence data suggests ciliary localization, this is not
      supported by functional literature. CKAP2s core functions are in mitotic spindle
      assembly and microtubule dynamics during cell division. Ciliary localization
      may represent cross-reactivity or technical artifacts rather than functional

      body localization or function. CKAP2s well-characterized functions are in mitotic
      spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, not ciliary processes. This appears
      to be an over-annotation possibly due to immunofluorescence artifacts.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Similar to cilium localization, this annotation lacks functional support
      from the literature. While the ciliary basal body and centrosome share structural
      similarities, there is no evidence that CKAP2s centrosome functions extend to
      ciliary basal body organization. This likely represents over-interpretation

      domain and acts as a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). This binding is
      the molecular basis for its microtubule stabilization and bundling activities.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 is fundamentally a microtubule-binding protein with direct biochemical
      evidence for microtubule association. The C-terminal CKAP2_C domain mediates
      this binding, and experimental studies consistently show CKAP2 colocalizes
      with and directly associates with microtubules. This represents the core molecular
      function that underlies all of CKAP2's cellular activities.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 contains multiple functional domains including a KEN-box that
      binds APC/C for targeted degradation, phosphorylation sites that bind specific
      kinases (CDK1, Aurora B), and likely protein-protein interaction domains for
      spindle organization.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 exhibits protein domain-specific binding through several characterized
      motifs including its KEN-box that specifically binds APC/C^Cdh1 for ubiquitin-mediated
      degradation, and multiple phosphorylation consensus sites that bind specific
      mitotic kinases (CDK1/cyclin B1 and Aurora B). These domain-specific interactions
      are essential for CKAP2's cell cycle regulation and proper function.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is essential for microtubule organizing center (centrosome) organization
      and function. It localizes to centrosomes, is required for centrosome integrity,
      and organizes spindle pole microtubule nucleation sites during mitosis.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 plays a critical role in organizing microtubule organizing centers,
      particularly centrosomes. It localizes to centrosomes during the cell cycle,
      is required for maintaining centrosome integrity and duplication, and organizes
      microtubule nucleation from spindle poles. Loss of CKAP2 leads to centrosome

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is one of the most potent positive regulators of microtubule polymerization,
      dramatically accelerating microtubule growth rates by approximately 20% and
      lowering the critical concentration for assembly by 100-fold.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 is biochemically characterized as an exceptionally powerful positive
      regulator of microtubule polymerization. In vitro reconstitution experiments
      demonstrate that CKAP2 dramatically enhances microtubule growth rates and
      reduces the tubulin concentration needed for polymerization. This positive
      regulation is fundamental to its role in rapid spindle assembly during mitosis.

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is a substrate of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) ubiquitin
      ligase and contains a KEN-box degradation signal. APC/C^Cdh1-mediated degradation
      of CKAP2 during mitotic exit is essential for proper cytokinesis and cell
      cycle progression.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 is directly involved in APC/C-dependent catabolic processes as
      a target substrate. It contains an N-terminal KEN-box that serves as a recognition
      signal for APC/C^Cdh1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. This timely
      degradation during late mitosis is functionally critical - non-degradable
      CKAP2 mutants cause cytokinesis defects and spindle abnormalities.

    label: mitotic cell cycle phase transition
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: CKAP2-deep-research.md
  review:
    summary: CKAP2 is essential for multiple mitotic cell cycle phase transitions,
      particularly G2/M transition where it accumulates and becomes active, and
      mitotic exit where it must be degraded for proper cytokinesis and return
      to interphase.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 plays critical roles in mitotic cell cycle phase transitions
      through its cell cycle-regulated expression, phosphorylation, and degradation.
      Its accumulation during G2/M transition is required for mitotic entry, while
      its APC/C-mediated destruction is essential for mitotic exit. Defects in
      CKAP2 regulation disrupt these transitions and cause cell cycle abnormalities.

      lowering the critical tubulin concentration required for assembly. This is
      a core biochemical activity of CKAP2.
    action: NEW
    reason: Microtubule polymerization is a fundamental biological process directly
      catalyzed by CKAP2. Biochemical studies demonstrate that CKAP2 is one of

      formation. CKAP2 depletion results in severe spindle assembly defects including
      multipolar spindles.
    action: NEW
    reason: Spindle assembly is a core biological process requiring CKAP2. Multiple
      experimental approaches demonstrate that CKAP2 is essential for proper spindle
      assembly - its microtubule nucleation and stabilization activities drive
      the rapid formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus. Loss of CKAP2 causes

      Studies demonstrate that CKAP2-depleted cells exhibit centrosome amplification
      and abnormal centrosome numbers, while CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of CKAP2

  review:
    summary: CKAP2 regulates chromosome segregation by ensuring proper spindle assembly,
      kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and preventing chromosome segregation
      errors. CKAP2 dysfunction leads to increased aneuploidy and segregation defects.
    action: NEW
    reason: CKAP2 functions as a key regulator of chromosome segregation through
      its effects on spindle organization and microtubule dynamics. Loss of CKAP2
      results in merotelic kinetochore attachments, lagging chromosomes, and increased
      aneuploidy frequency. By maintaining proper spindle architecture and microtubule
      stability, CKAP2 ensures accurate chromosome distribution during mitosis.
