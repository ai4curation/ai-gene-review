description: >-
  Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 (COX4-1), the ubiquitously expressed
  nuclear-encoded regulatory subunit of mitochondrial Complex IV (cytochrome c
  oxidase). COX4-1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein of the inner
  mitochondrial membrane with a large matrix-facing regulatory domain and a
  C-terminal intermembrane-space segment that contacts COX2 to help shape the
  cytochrome c docking site. Although noncatalytic, COX4-1 is the primary
  regulatory subunit of Complex IV, carrying an allosteric ATP/ADP-binding site
  in its matrix domain that mediates feedback inhibition of CIV activity at high
  ATP/ADP ratios. Phosphorylation of Ser58 by intramitochondrial PKA (via the
  sAC-cAMP-PKA axis) prevents ATP binding and relieves this inhibition, acting
  as a rapid bioenergetic switch. COX4-1 participates in early assembly modules
  (COX4-COX5A) and contributes to Complex IV stability and respirasome
  (CI-CIII2-CIV) formation. A tissue-specific isoform, COX4I2, is expressed
  under hypoxia and in lung/brain, and isoform switching between COX4-1 and
  COX4-2 modulates oxygen affinity and redox signaling. Pathogenic COX4I1
  variants (e.g., K101N, P152T) cause autosomal recessive Complex IV deficiency
  (MC4DN16) with growth failure, developmental regression, and chromosomal
  instability.
