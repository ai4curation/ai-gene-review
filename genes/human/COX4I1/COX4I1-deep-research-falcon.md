### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "COX4I1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'COX4I1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **COX4I1** (gene ID: COX4I1, UniProt: P13073) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation of human COX4I1 (P13073): structure, regulation, and disease relevance

Executive summary
COX4I1 encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 (COX4-1), the ubiquitously expressed, nuclear-encoded regulatory subunit of mitochondrial complex IV. COX4-1 contributes to complex IV assembly and supercomplex organization, positions elements of the cytochrome c docking site, and carries an ATP/ADP-responsive allosteric regulatory site that is toggled by intramitochondrial PKA phosphorylation at Ser58. Exchange between COX4-1 and the hypoxia-inducible isoform COX4-2 (COX4I2) modulates oxygen affinity and redox signaling. Pathogenic COX4I1 variants cause complex IV deficiency with growth failure and chromosomal instability, and recent disease studies implicate altered COX4I1 expression in heart failure and systemic responses to viral infection.

1. Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: COX4I1 (HGNC:2265) encodes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 (COX4-1), a member of the cytochrome c oxidase IV family and the principal human isoform of subunit IV of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) (cunatova2020roleofcytochrome pages 5-7, reguera2020cytochromecoxidase pages 1-3).
- Cellular localization and topology: COX4-1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein with a single transmembrane helix adjacent to MT-CO1; a large matrix-facing regulatory domain; and an intermembrane-space C-terminal segment contacting COX2 to help shape the cytochrome c docking site (cunatova2022theroleofa pages 23-27, cunatova2022theroleofa pages 101-103, reguera2020cytochromecoxidase pages 1-3).
- Primary role: Although noncatalytic, COX4-1 regulates complex IV turnover and assembly, contributes to docking of cytochrome c with COX2, and integrates metabolic signals via adenine nucleotide binding in its matrix-exposed domain (cunatova2020roleofcytochrome pages 5-7, cunatova2022theroleofa pages 23-27).

2. Mechanism and pathway context
- Complex IV catalysis: Complex IV reduces O2 to H2O using electrons from cytochrome c and pumps protons to build proton-motive force for ATP synthesis; COX4-1 modulates this pacemaker step of the electron transport chain through allosteric control (acinperez2011proteinphosphorylationand pages 1-3, kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).
- Allosteric ATP/ADP regulation: An ATP-binding site in COX4-1’s matrix domain mediates allosteric inhibition of complex IV when ATP/ADP is high; phosphorylation of Ser58 by intramitochondrial PKA (sAC–cAMP–PKA axis) prevents ATP binding and relieves inhibition, functioning as a rapid bioenergetic switch (acinperez2011proteinphosphorylationand pages 1-3, cunatova2020roleofcytochrome pages 5-7).
- Isoform biology and hypoxia signaling: Mammals express COX4I1 (ubiquitous) and COX4I2 (hypoxia/tissue-regulated, lung-enriched). CRISPR KO/knock-in in HEK293 cells showed both isoforms support assembly and respiration but differ in oxygen kinetics: COX4-2 increases p50 ≈2-fold versus COX4-1 (lower O2 affinity), with effects on NADH oxidation and ROS; HIF-1-dependent programs drive COX4I2 under low O2 (reguera2020cytochromecoxidase pages 1-3, cunatova2022theroleofa pages 101-103, cunatova2022theroleofb pages 101-103).
- Supercomplex organization: COX4 participates in early assembly modules (COX4–COX5A) and contributes to respirasome (CI–CIII2–CIV) formation, which can tune electron flux and efficiency under varying physiological conditions (cunatova2022theroleof pages 23-27, kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).

3. Recent developments (priority 2023–2024)
- Heart failure: Contemporary reviews of human heart failure highlight complex IV regulation and its phosphorylation state as components of mitochondrial dysfunction in failing myocardium, positioning COX4-1 within modifiable nodes of OXPHOS control (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2). Transcriptomic analyses in ischemic cardiomyopathy show OXPHOS dysregulation with increased COX4I1 expression among complex IV subunits, correlating with ventricular remodeling metrics (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).
- Viral infection: In COVID-19, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes are transcriptionally suppressed in patient tissues; complex IV assembly factors (e.g., SCO2) are specifically affected, situating COX4-1 within a vulnerable OXPHOS program during infection and recovery (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).
- Supercomplex function: A 2023 EMBO Reports review synthesizes evidence on how supercomplexes, including CI–CIII2–CIV (respirasomes), impact bioenergetics, reinforcing the contextual role of nuclear subunits such as COX4 in organizing and regulating electron transfer (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).

4. Current applications and real-world implementations
- Bioenergetic control points: The ATP/ADP allosteric site and Ser58 phosphorylation in COX4-1 provide actionable levers in experimental models to tune respiration, with implications for ischemia–reperfusion paradigms and metabolic modulation in disease (acinperez2011proteinphosphorylationand pages 1-3).
- Biomarkers and stratification: Changes in COX4I1 expression appear within disease transcriptomes (e.g., ischemic heart failure) and proteomic hubs in injury models, supporting exploration of COX4I1 as part of composite mitochondrial biomarkers (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).

5. Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Integrative reviews from leading groups emphasize that noncatalytic nuclear subunits (including COX4) primarily regulate complex IV and often determine tissue- and condition-specific function; they also discuss competing models for supercomplex function, underscoring context-dependence (kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2, cunatova2020roleofcytochrome pages 5-7).

6. Human genetics, disease associations, and quantitative data
- Pathogenic variants: Homozygous COX4I1 K101N causes a primary complex IV deficiency with growth failure and chromosomal instability mimicking Fanconi anemia; patient fibroblasts show decreased COX activity and ATP production, increased ROS, and rescue upon wild-type COX4I1 complementation (abulibdeh2017mutationinthe pages 1-2).
- Statistics/data: In the Fanconi-like case, diepoxybutane testing showed 29% of patient cells with ≥1 chromosomal break/cell; functional rescue restored COX activity and ATP production to control ranges (details within primary report) (abulibdeh2017mutationinthe pages 1-2).

7. Synthesis: function, localization, and pathway role of COX4I1
- COX4-1 integrates matrix adenine nucleotide/PKA signals to adjust complex IV turnover to cellular energy state, supports cytochrome c docking via COX2 interactions, and participates in assembly and supercomplex formation in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Isoform exchange with COX4-2 under HIF programs modulates oxygen affinity and redox dynamics, tailoring respiratory control to tissue oxygenation and stress (cunatova2020roleofcytochrome pages 5-7, acinperez2011proteinphosphorylationand pages 1-3, reguera2020cytochromecoxidase pages 1-3, cunatova2022theroleof pages 23-27, kadenbach2017regulationofmammalian pages 1-2).
