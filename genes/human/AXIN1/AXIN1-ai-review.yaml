description: >-
  AXIN1 (Axis inhibition protein 1) is a cytosolic scaffold protein that serves as
  the core
  component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which also includes APC, GSK3B,
  and CK1.
  AXIN1 coordinates the phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of beta-catenin,
  thereby
  negatively regulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Key functional domains
  include:
  an N-terminal tankyrase-binding motif, an RGS domain for APC binding, a GSK3B-binding
  helix
  (aa 383-400), a beta-catenin binding region, and a C-terminal DIX domain that mediates
  polymerization and formation of cytoplasmic condensates ("degradasomes"). AXIN1
  is regulated
  by tankyrase-mediated ADP-ribosylation followed by RNF146-dependent ubiquitination
  and
  degradation. Loss-of-function mutations in AXIN1 are associated with hepatocellular
  carcinoma
  due to aberrant Wnt pathway activation. AXIN1 also has secondary roles in TGF-beta
  signaling
  (promoting Smad7 degradation via Arkadia) and JNK signaling, and participates in
  the AXIN1-HIPK2-TP53
  complex upon UV irradiation.

  - description: >-
      THE core function of AXIN1. As the central scaffold of the beta-catenin destruction
      complex, AXIN1 coordinates CK1 and GSK3B phosphorylation of beta-catenin, leading
      to its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby suppressing Wnt target gene
      transcription.
