## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O15169
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Axin-1; AltName: Full=Axis inhibition protein 1; Short=hAxin;
- **Gene Information:** Name=AXIN1; Synonyms=AXIN;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Axin-like. (IPR043581); Axin_b-cat-bd. (IPR014936); Axin_TNKS-bd. (IPR032101); DIX. (IPR001158); DIX_dom_sf. (IPR038207)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AXIN1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AXIN1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AXIN1** (gene ID: AXIN1, UniProt: O15169) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human AXIN1 (UniProt O15169)

Verification of target identity and domains
- Identity and organism: The report focuses on human AXIN1 (Axis inhibition protein 1; Axin-1), a scaffold protein essential to canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Contemporary functional and structural literature consistently describes human AXIN1 with the domain organization expected from UniProt: an N‑terminal β‑catenin-binding region, a GSK3β-binding helix, a central RGS/APC-binding region, a tankyrase-binding region, and a C‑terminal DIX domain that mediates polymerization/condensate formation (consistent with DIX/IPR001158; Axin_TNKS-bd/IPR032101; Axin_b-cat-bd/IPR014936). Domain mapping and functional tests in human cells are detailed in 2024 Cancer Research by Zhang et al. (https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-2268, May 1, 2024), which experimentally delineates these regions (tankyrase, RGS/APC, MEKK1, GSK3β, β‑catenin, CK1, PP2A, DIX) and their roles (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 9-10, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Primary role: AXIN1 is the core cytosolic scaffold of the β‑catenin destruction complex (DC), coordinating CK1 and GSK3β phosphorylation of β‑catenin and recruiting APC to promote β‑catenin ubiquitination and degradation, thereby restraining Wnt/β‑catenin signaling (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 16-17, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 9-10). Key binding interfaces include: (i) a GSK3β-binding α‑helix (P385–E421; helix visible as E384–V399 in AXIN1–GSK3β structure) whose integrity is required for β‑catenin regulation (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 5-6); (ii) a β‑catenin-binding region; (iii) the RGS/APC interaction domain; and (iv) the C‑terminal DIX domain that supports polymerization/degradasome formation (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 9-10).
- Material state/condensates: AXIN1 self-assembles into cytoplasmic “degradasomes” or puncta via its DIX domain; these assemblies function as biomolecular condensates for β‑catenin turnover and are observed as cytoplasmic puncta in cells (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 6-7). Reviews of β‑catenin regulation recognize AXIN1/APC scaffolding and condensate-like assemblies of the destruction complex (wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7).

Cellular localization and context of action
- Predominantly cytosolic; forms cytoplasmic puncta/condensates (“degradasomes”) where destruction-complex catalysis occurs (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 6-7, wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7). Wnt receptor signalosome dynamics at the plasma membrane are organized at submicron clusters, with cytosolic scaffolds (including DIX-domain proteins) participating downstream; recent single-molecule rbTALM imaging demonstrates long-lived co-clustering of Wnt co-receptors LRP6 and FZD, providing nanoscale spatiotemporal context for upstream assembly prior to AXIN1 recruitment (bioRxiv, June 22, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.18.599024) (philippi2024longtermsinglemolecule pages 31-35).

Pathways and precise mechanistic role
- Canonical Wnt/β‑catenin: In the absence of Wnt, AXIN1 scaffolds CK1 and GSK3β to phosphorylate β‑catenin, promotes β‑catenin binding to β‑TrCP, and enables proteasomal degradation. Loss of AXIN1 function elevates β‑catenin signaling (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 16-17, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11). The GSK3β-binding helix (V383–T402 region) is a critical determinant; tumor-associated missense mutations or deletions in this helix impair GSK3β binding and increase β‑catenin reporter activity (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 5-6). The DIX domain supports higher-order assembly essential for efficient β‑catenin turnover (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11, wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7).
- Crosstalk: AXIN1’s regulation by tankyrase and RNF146 links PARylation and ubiquitination pathways to Wnt output (see regulation below). Reviews synthesize the dual pools of β‑catenin (adhesive and signaling) and the AXIN/APC scaffolding that balances them (Open Biology, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.200267) (wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7).

Molecular regulation of AXIN1
- Tankyrase-mediated PARylation and RNF146-dependent ubiquitination: Tankyrase PARP enzymes (TNKS1/2; PARP5a/b) PARylate AXIN1, which is recognized by the WWE domain of the E3 ligase RNF146, triggering AXIN1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; this axis activates Wnt signaling by reducing AXIN1 levels. A 2024 ACS Chemical Biology study developed a fluorescence polarization assay to discover RNF146 WWE inhibitors, summarizing the tankyrase–RNF146–AXIN1 axis and providing the structural basis (RNF146 WWE–isoADPr PDB 3V3L) (published Jan 18, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.3c00512) (peng2024isoadpribosefluorescencepolarization pages 1-2).
- Phosphorylation in condensates counteracts degradation: In human cells, CK1α phosphorylation of an N‑terminal CK1 consensus motif within the tankyrase-binding region of AXIN1, enriched within Axin condensates, electrostatically/sterically hinders tankyrase binding and opposes tankyrase-mediated AXIN1 degradation; PP1 antagonizes this phosphorylation. This establishes a condensate-localized CK1α–PP1 rheostat that stabilizes AXIN1 and restrains Wnt signaling (Journal of Cell Science, Oct 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.261214) (klement2023phosphorylationofaxin pages 8-11).
- SUMOylation of RNF146 modulates AXIN1 turnover: In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RNF146 is SUMOylated (major sites K19, K61, K174, K175), with PIAS3/SENP1 acting at K19/K175 to promote nuclear localization and increase association with AXIN1, accelerating AXIN1 ubiquitination and Wnt activation; genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of RNF146 SUMOylation decreases HCC progression in vitro/in vivo (Oncogene, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-023-02689-4) (li2023sumoylationofrnf146 pages 18-22).
- Tankyrase inhibition vs degradation (emerging concept): A 2025 mechanistic preprint argues that catalytic tankyrase inhibitors stabilize AXIN but also accumulate TNKS scaffolds that induce large AXIN puncta and “rigidify” the DC, limiting β‑catenin turnover; targeted degradation of TNKS (e.g., IWR1-POMA) stabilizes AXIN without excess puncta and yields stronger Wnt suppression in APC-mutant CRC cells, highlighting non-catalytic TNKS scaffolding roles (bioRxiv, Sep 22, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.22.677768) (wang2025roleoftankyrase pages 4-7).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Functional annotation of AXIN1 variants (2024): Systematic testing of 80 tumor-associated missense variants defined domain vulnerabilities. Removing GSK3β- and β‑catenin-binding domains produced the largest signaling defects, followed by precise removal of the RGS/APC domain. Eighteen missense variants were functionally defective in β‑catenin regulation; truncation length inversely correlated with residual function. Liver cancers carrying AXIN1 missense variants frequently co-occurred with high-activity β‑catenin mutations (5/15, 33.3%) versus 1/49 among truncating AXIN1 cases (P = 0.0139), supporting that many AXIN1 missense variants are passengers, while truncations are stronger drivers (Cancer Research, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-2268) (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 9-10).
- High-resolution mapping of the GSK3β-binding helix (2024): Variants/deletions within V383–T402 disrupt binding to GSK3β and increase β‑catenin reporter activity; structural modeling aligns an α‑helix (P385–E421) that packs against GSK3β, with R395 participating in a stabilizing salt bridge (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 5-6). These data sharpen the mechanistic definition of AXIN1’s catalytic scaffold element essential for DC function (Cancer Research, 2024) (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 5-6).
- Condensate-centered regulation (2023): CK1α phosphorylation within condensates reduces TNKS interaction and AXIN1 degradation, refining the view of condensate-localized post-translational control (J Cell Sci, 2023) (klement2023phosphorylationofaxin pages 8-11).
- Nanoscale receptor signalosomes (2024): rbTALM single-molecule localization microscopy shows cooperative, long-lived LRP6/FZD clustering in live cells upon Wnt, contextualizing AXIN1 recruitment downstream of membrane assemblies (bioRxiv, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.18.599024) (philippi2024longtermsinglemolecule pages 31-35).
- Therapeutic toolmaking (2024): First high-throughput fluorescence polarization assay for RNF146 WWE inhibitors (TAMRA-isoADPr tracer) enables discovery of small molecules that could stabilize AXIN1 by blocking PAR-recognition (ACS Chem Biol, 2024) (peng2024isoadpribosefluorescencepolarization pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology genomics: In a 111-patient HCC cohort (China) sequenced with 508/688-gene panels, AXIN1 mutations were detected in 14.41% (16/111), contributing to frequent Wnt pathway activation; the study linked mutational profiles to prognosis and identified that ~50% of patients harbored clinically actionable mutations guiding therapy/trials (BMC Cancer, June 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-024-12407-2) (song2024genomicprofilinginforms pages 3-7).
- Pharmacologic targeting of the AXIN1 axis:
  - Tankyrase catalytic inhibitors (e.g., IWR compounds) stabilize AXIN1 but face safety and efficacy concerns; mechanistic updates suggest TNKS degraders may better suppress Wnt signaling by eliminating non-catalytic scaffolding (bioRxiv, 2025) (wang2025roleoftankyrase pages 4-7).
  - RNF146 WWE inhibition: the 2024 FP assay opens a route to small-molecule RNF146 WWE inhibitors, a strategy expected to phenocopy AXIN stabilization with potential to avoid tankyrase-related toxicities (ACS Chem Biol, 2024) (peng2024isoadpribosefluorescencepolarization pages 1-2).
- Regulatory biology informing interventions: CK1α-driven protection of AXIN1 from TNKS in condensates suggests that modulating CK1/PP1 activities or condensate composition could tune AXIN1 stability and Wnt output (J Cell Sci, 2023) (klement2023phosphorylationofaxin pages 8-11).

Expert opinions and perspectives
- A synthesis from Open Biology (2020) emphasizes AXIN1–APC scaffolding at the core of the DC and notes evidence for liquid–liquid phase separation (“AXIN degradosome”) contributing to β‑catenin regulation, integrating biochemical and biophysical models of β‑catenin pools (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.200267) (wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7).
- The 2024 functional genomics study provides an authorial perspective that most AXIN1 truncations are (partial) loss-of-function drivers in β‑catenin–active tumors, whereas most missense variants are likely passengers unless they map to critical binding interfaces; clinical co-mutation patterns in liver and colorectal cancers support this view (Cancer Research, 2024) (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11).

Relevant quantitative statistics and data (recent)
- Domain-function correlations (2024): Deleting GSK3β- and β‑catenin-binding domains produced the largest increases in β‑catenin reporter activity; 18/80 (22.5%) missense variants tested were defective; truncation length inversely correlated with residual function (Cancer Research, 2024) (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11).
- Liver cancer co-mutation patterns (2024): In liver tumors, 33.3% (5/15) of cases with AXIN1 missense variants harbored high-activity β‑catenin mutations versus 6.1% (3/49; including two AXIN2 truncations) among tumors with truncating AXIN1 mutations (Fisher’s exact P = 0.0139) (Cancer Research, 2024) (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11).
- HCC cohort prevalence (2024): AXIN1 mutated in 14.41% (16/111) of sequenced patients; Wnt/β‑catenin pathway aberrant in ~50% of cases (BMC Cancer, 2024) (song2024genomicprofilinginforms pages 3-7).

Conclusions
Human AXIN1 (O15169) is a multidomain, intrinsically disordered scaffold that nucleates the β‑catenin destruction complex via defined interfaces for GSK3β, β‑catenin, APC, and DIX-mediated assembly. Its function is dynamically regulated by tankyrase-mediated PARylation leading to RNF146-dependent ubiquitination, CK1α phosphorylation that shields the TNKS-binding region within condensates, and by condensate assembly itself. Recent work (2023–2024) refined domain-level mechanisms (especially the GSK3β-binding helix), functionally annotated disease variants, quantified co-mutation patterns in HCC and CRC, and enabled new therapeutic strategies via RNF146 WWE assays and emerging tankyrase degraders. Together, these data provide a precise, experimentally grounded functional annotation of AXIN1 with direct translational implications in Wnt-driven diseases and oncology (zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 5-6, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 10-11, zhang2024analysisoftumorassociated pages 6-7, wal2020walkingthetight pages 6-7, peng2024isoadpribosefluorescencepolarization pages 1-2, klement2023phosphorylationofaxin pages 8-11, li2023sumoylationofrnf146 pages 18-22, wang2025roleoftankyrase pages 4-7, song2024genomicprofilinginforms pages 3-7).
