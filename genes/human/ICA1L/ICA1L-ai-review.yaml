description: Islet cell autoantigen 1-like protein (ICA1L), paralog of ICA1/ICA69,
  containing N-terminal arfaptin/BAR domain (amino acids 46-248). BAR domains are
  curvature-sensing and membrane-binding modules that form dimeric banana-shaped scaffolds,
  enabling detection and induction of membrane curvature during vesicle trafficking.
  Functions as cytosolic membrane scaffolding/adaptor protein involved in secretory
  pathway and vesicle biogenesis. BAR domain mediates membrane interactions, dimerization,
  and membrane tubulation. Binds PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) via BAR-BAR
  domain interactions. Like ICA69, functions in dense-core secretory granule biogenesis
  and maturation. Predicted to participate in Golgi-to-vesicle trafficking, acting
  as effector for small GTPases (Rab/ARF family). May regulate AMPA receptor trafficking
  in neurons by forming complexes with PICK1. Expression tissue-enriched in brain
  and also in testis. In spermatids, predicted to localize to acrosomal vesicle, contributing
  to acrosome formation. Proteomic studies link ICA1L to cerebral small vessel disease
  - reduced ICA1L in brain cortex associated with lacunar stroke and intracerebral
  hemorrhage risk. Enriched in cortical glutamatergic neurons. Immunofluorescence
  unexpectedly shows mitochondrial localization in some cell lines, suggesting potential
  dual roles. C-terminal region may confer tissue-specific interactions. Functions
  primarily in secretory pathway through membrane scaffolding and protein complex
  assembly at Golgi and secretory vesicles.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from ICA1/ICA69 paralogs
      that localize to secretory granule membranes in neuroendocrine cells. ICA69
      is well-established to function at immature secretory granules in pancreatic
      beta cells and neurons, where it regulates dense-core vesicle biogenesis and
      maturation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately reflects ICA1L's predicted core function at
      secretory vesicle membranes. The paralog ICA69 localizes to Golgi and immature
      secretory granules where it controls insulin granule formation via interaction
      with PICK1. ICA1L shares the BAR domain architecture and PICK1-binding capacity,
      suggesting conserved localization. While direct experimental evidence for ICA1L
      at secretory granule membranes is limited, the phylogenetic inference is well-supported
      by structural homology and known function of the ICA69/PICK1 complex in dense-core
      vesicle biogenesis.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation indicating involvement in regulation of secretion, inferred

      insulin granule maturation. Similar role predicted for ICA1L in regulating
      secretory processes in neurons and other cell types.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core biological process for ICA1L. The protein functions as
      a membrane scaffolding adapter at the trans-Golgi network and secretory vesicles,
      where it regulates dense-core vesicle biogenesis and maturation. Evidence from
      paralog ICA69 demonstrates that the ICA69/PICK1 heterodimer is required for
      proper insulin secretory granule formation, and mice lacking either protein
      show defects in granule maturation and secretion. ICA1L's structural similarity,
      PICK1-binding capacity, and expression pattern support conserved function in
      secretion regulation, particularly in brain neurons and potentially in testis
      during acrosome formation.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on BAR domain structure. BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs)
      domains form dimeric banana-shaped scaffolds that bind to membrane surfaces
      and induce membrane curvature, essential for vesicle budding and tubulation.
      ICA1L contains an arfaptin/BAR domain (amino acids 46-248) that mediates this
      membrane deformation activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function directly attributable to ICA1L's BAR
      domain. The arfaptin homology domain present in ICA1L (and ICA69) is a well-characterized
      membrane curvature-inducing module. BAR domains are known to detect and drive
      membrane curvature through their dimeric crescent-shaped structure that scaffolds
      lipid bilayers. This membrane bending activity is fundamental to ICA1L's role
      in secretory vesicle biogenesis, where membrane deformation is required for
      budding nascent vesicles from the Golgi or other organelles. The annotation
      accurately reflects the biochemical activity conferred by the protein's domain
      architecture.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for membrane curvature sensing, a key molecular function
      of BAR domain proteins. This term captures the ability to recognize curved
      membrane surfaces, which is mechanistically distinct but functionally coupled
      to membrane bending (GO:0097753). BAR domains both sense existing curvature
      and induce additional curvature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary molecular function term for ICA1L and accurately
      describes the BAR domain's activity. Membrane curvature sensor activity is
      fundamental to how ICA1L operates at organelle membranes - the protein recognizes
      regions of membrane curvature (such as budding vesicles at the Golgi) and stabilizes
      or amplifies that curvature through its banana-shaped dimeric structure. This
      sensing function enables ICA1L to localize specifically to sites of vesicle
      formation and coordinate with other trafficking machinery. The dual capacity
      to sense and induce curvature is a hallmark of BAR domain proteins and central
      to their role in membrane remodeling during secretory vesicle biogenesis.

      not secreted and has no signal peptide or transmembrane domains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct broad localization term. ICA1L is a cytosolic/peripheral membrane
      protein that associates with organelle membranes (Golgi, secretory vesicles,
      and reportedly mitochondria in some cell lines) but is not an integral membrane
      protein. The cytoplasm annotation is appropriately general and accurate. While
      more specific subcellular localizations (secretory granule membrane, Golgi)
      are also annotated and represent the functional sites, cytoplasm remains valid

      functions at trans-Golgi network and secretory granule membranes, both components
      of the endomembrane system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurate general localization term that appropriately captures ICA1L's
      association with the secretory pathway. The protein operates at endomembrane
      compartments involved in vesicle trafficking, specifically at the Golgi-to-granule
      transport interface. This term is complementary to the more specific annotations
      for secretory granule membrane and provides useful context that ICA1L functions
      within the interconnected membrane network of the secretory pathway. The annotation
      is well-supported by evidence that ICA1L (like ICA69) localizes to Golgi membranes

      interactions with the BAR domain of PICK1, representing domain-domain binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurate molecular function term that describes ICA1L's protein-protein
      interaction mechanism. The arfaptin/BAR domain of ICA1L recognizes and binds
      to the BAR-like domain of PICK1, forming heterodimers analogous to the well-characterized
      ICA69-PICK1 interaction. This is a clear example of protein domain-specific
      binding where the BAR domain serves as both the binding module and the binding
      target. The term is more informative than generic "protein binding" (GO:0005515)

      The study provides direct experimental evidence for protein binding activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation has direct experimental support from a systematic interactome

    summary: IEA annotation from Ensembl Compara orthology transfer, based on mouse
      ICA1L localization to acrosomal vesicle. The acrosome is a large secretory
      vesicle derived from Golgi in developing spermatids. PICK1 knockout mice show
      male infertility due to failed acrosome formation, and the ICA69/PICK1 complex
      is required for proacrosomal granule biogenesis in testis.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation represents a tissue-specific function in male germ cells
      rather than the core ubiquitous function of ICA1L. While ICA1L is expressed
      in testis and the orthology-based inference is mechanistically plausible (given
      PICK1's established role in acrosome formation and ICA1L's capacity to bind
      PICK1), this represents a specialized deployment of ICA1L's general vesicle
      trafficking function in a specific developmental context. The core function
      of ICA1L is membrane scaffolding in secretory vesicle biogenesis, which occurs
      broadly in many cell types, particularly neurons and endocrine cells. The acrosomal
      vesicle localization is a tissue-restricted application of this broader function.
      Therefore, this should be retained but marked as non-core to distinguish it
      from the primary neuronal and secretory cell functions.

      step in spermiogenesis where a large secretory vesicle is assembled from Golgi-derived
      proacrosomal granules. The annotation uses qualifier "acts_upstream_of_or_within"
      suggesting indirect or supporting role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This represents a tissue-specific developmental process rather than the
      core molecular/cellular function of ICA1L. While the protein may contribute
      to spermatid development through its role in acrosomal vesicle formation (as
      predicted from mouse ortholog), this is a specialized application of its general
      membrane trafficking function. The annotation is mechanistically reasonable
      given that PICK1 is essential for acrosome biogenesis and ICA1L can form complexes
      with PICK1, but spermatid development represents a narrow developmental context.
      ICA1L's primary and most broadly relevant function is in secretory vesicle
      biogenesis in neurons and other secretory cells, where it is highly expressed
      (particularly brain). The testis-specific role, while potentially valid, is
      peripheral to understanding the gene's main biological importance. Retain as

      The deep research explicitly states that ICA1L functions at the trans-Golgi
      network for vesicle budding and maturation. This annotation should be added
