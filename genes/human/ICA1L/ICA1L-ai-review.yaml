  label: Homo sapiens
description: Islet cell autoantigen 1-like protein (ICA1L), paralog of ICA1/ICA69,
  containing N-terminal arfaptin/BAR domain (amino acids 46-248). BAR domains are
  curvature-sensing and membrane-binding modules that form dimeric banana-shaped scaffolds,
  enabling detection and induction of membrane curvature during vesicle trafficking.
  Functions as cytosolic membrane scaffolding/adaptor protein involved in secretory
  pathway and vesicle biogenesis. BAR domain mediates membrane interactions, dimerization,
  and membrane tubulation. Binds PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) via BAR-BAR
  domain interactions. Like ICA69, functions in dense-core secretory granule biogenesis
  and maturation. Predicted to participate in Golgi-to-vesicle trafficking, acting
  as effector for small GTPases (Rab/ARF family). May regulate AMPA receptor trafficking
  in neurons by forming complexes with PICK1. Expression tissue-enriched in brain
  and also in testis. In spermatids, predicted to localize to acrosomal vesicle, contributing
  to acrosome formation. Proteomic studies link ICA1L to cerebral small vessel disease
  - reduced ICA1L in brain cortex associated with lacunar stroke and intracerebral
  hemorrhage risk. Enriched in cortical glutamatergic neurons. Immunofluorescence
  unexpectedly shows mitochondrial localization in some cell lines, suggesting potential
  dual roles. C-terminal region may confer tissue-specific interactions. Functions
  primarily in secretory pathway through membrane scaffolding and protein complex
  assembly at Golgi and secretory vesicles.
