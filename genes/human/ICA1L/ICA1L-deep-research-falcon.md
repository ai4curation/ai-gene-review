## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8NDH6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Islet cell autoantigen 1-like protein; AltName: Full=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosomal region candidate gene 14 protein; AltName: Full=Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosomal region candidate gene 15 protein;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ICA1L; Synonyms=ALS2CR14, ALS2CR15;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AH/BAR_dom_sf. (IPR027267); AH_dom. (IPR010504); Islet_autoAg_Ica1/Ica1-like. (IPR024114); Islet_autoAg_Ica1_C. (IPR006723); Arfaptin (PF06456)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ICA1L" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ICA1L' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ICA1L** (gene ID: ICA1L, UniProt: Q8NDH6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Question: You are an expert researcher providing comprehensive, well-cited information.

Provide detailed information focusing on:
1. Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
2. Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023-2024 sources)
3. Current applications and real-world implementations
4. Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
5. Relevant statistics and data from recent studies

Format as a comprehensive research report with proper citations. Include URLs and publication dates where available.
Always prioritize recent, authoritative sources and provide specific citations for all major claims.

Plan
1) Verify identity and domain architecture for ICA1L (Q8NDH6) in Homo sapiens. 2) Aggregate the most recent (2023–2024) genetics/proteomics evidence bearing on ICA1L function and disease associations. 3) Extract quantitative statistics and methodological context (GWAS/MTAG, TWAS, PWAS) for ICA1L. 4) Synthesize what these findings imply about ICA1L biology (pathways, potential cellular roles), noting what is inference versus established evidence. 5) Present a concise artifact summarizing key findings and statistics, then provide a narrative research report with citations and URLs. 6) Identify evidence gaps (e.g., direct molecular/interaction/localization studies) and recommend next steps.

Identity and domain verification (critical checks)
• Target identity: ICA1L (islet cell autoantigen 1-like), UniProt Q8NDH6; synonyms ALS2CR14 and ALS2CR15; organism: Homo sapiens. This matches the user-provided UniProt description and nomenclature. 
• Domains/family: The protein is annotated with AH/BAR_dom superfamily features and Arfaptin-related domains (InterPro IPR027267, IPR010504; Pfam PF06456) per the prompt. These domain annotations are consistent with the hypothesis of a membrane-curvature-sensing BAR/AH superfamily protein and with the Arfaptin-like family; however, no additional primary-source confirmation was retrievable in the current evidence context.

Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
• Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) genetics implicate ICA1L. A 2024 Neurology multi-trait GWAS (MTAG) discovered and replicated an ICA1L locus at 2q33.2 associated with all ICH by leveraging genetically correlated traits (small-vessel stroke, white matter hyperintensity volume, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and Alzheimer disease). The lead variant rs6705330 (intronic to ICA1L) showed β = 0.20 (SE = 0.03), p = 8.91 × 10−12 in discovery and p = 0.036 in UK Biobank replication (MAF ≈ 0.13). The same study reported significant ICA1L transcript association in TWAS (Z = 6.8, p = 9.1 × 10−12) and significant ICA1L protein association in a brain PWAS (Z = −5.8, p = 6.7 × 10−9). Notably, directions differed between mRNA and protein: higher ICA1L transcript associated with ICH risk, while lower ICA1L protein associated with ICH, highlighting complex regulation. The cohort was primarily European ancestry, which the authors note as a limitation (URL: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209666; published Oct 2024). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 1-2, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 7-8, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10)
• Multi-ancestry TWAS of neurocognitive phenotypes. A 2024 medRxiv multi-ancestry TWAS (preprint) integrating European- and African-ancestry expression references reported that reduced ICA1L expression associated with greater white matter hyperintensity burden and an Alzheimer’s disease signal, suggesting that ICA1L may contribute to overlapping small-vessel disease and AD-related neuropathology. This study also cites prior PWAS linking ICA1L with small-vessel disease and intracerebral hemorrhage, situating ICA1L within a vascular/neurodegenerative context (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.03.24300768; posted Jan 2024). (chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)

Current applications and real-world implementations
• Genetics-to-proteomics prioritization: The 2024 Neurology study positions ICA1L as a replicated ICH locus and ties both cortex transcript and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex protein abundances to ICH risk. This supports ICA1L as a candidate for mechanistic studies and potential biomarker/target nomination pipelines in cerebral small vessel pathology and hemorrhagic stroke risk stratification. The authors explicitly note such loci as potential targets for future modulation of ICH risk (URL: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209666; Oct 2024). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 1-2, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10)
• Multi-ancestry transcriptomic modeling: The 2024 preprint indicates that incorporating diverse ancestries can refine TWAS signals implicating ICA1L in white matter disease and AD, a step toward more inclusive risk modeling across populations (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.03.24300768; Jan 2024). (chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
• Divergent transcript–protein directions: The Neurology (2024) authors report higher ICA1L transcript but lower ICA1L protein associated with ICH, underscoring that transcriptional and proteomic regulation may diverge in cerebrovascular disease. This observation argues for proteo-genomic integration and careful interpretation of directionality when nominating targets. The study emphasizes European ancestry as a limitation and validates signals in UK Biobank, which supports robustness yet calls for broader ancestry replication (URL: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209666; Oct 2024). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10)
• Vascular and neurodegenerative convergence: The multi-ancestry TWAS preprint links lower ICA1L expression to increased WMH and an AD signal, aligning with a broader view that small vessel disease and neurodegeneration share overlapping mechanisms and genetic contributors, and highlighting ICA1L as one of the genes at this intersection (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.03.24300768; Jan 2024). (chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
• ICH MTAG (Muiño et al., Neurology 2024): rs6705330 (ICA1L intron) β = 0.20 (SE = 0.03), p = 8.91 × 10−12; replication p = 0.036 (UKB-SAIGE). Gene-based ICA1L: Z = 6.40, p = 7.70 × 10−11 (MTAG). TWAS (frontal cortex BA9): Z = 6.8, p = 9.1 × 10−12. PWAS (dPFC): Z = −5.8, p = 6.7 × 10−9; ICA1L protein significant after multiple-comparison correction and replicated at p < 0.05. (URL: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209666; Oct 2024). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 1-2, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 7-8, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10)
• Multi-ancestry TWAS (Chaar et al., medRxiv 2024): Downregulation of ICA1L associated with higher WMH and an AD association in TWAS, suggesting a role in overlapping AD–vascular dementia biology (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.03.24300768; posted Jan 2024). (chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)

Functional annotation: molecular function, localization, and pathway context
• Inference from domains: The protein bears AH/BAR superfamily and Arfaptin-like annotations, which in general are associated with membrane curvature sensing/scaffolding and trafficking. However, direct experimental evidence for ICA1L’s molecular activity, specific interactors (e.g., PICK1/ICA69), and subcellular localization was not retrievable in the current evidence set; thus, functional roles are at present best supported by genetic/proteomic association context rather than mechanistic assays in this report. This is a limitation of the available sources summarized here.
• Disease/pathway context supported by genetics/proteomics: Convergent ICH GWAS/MTAG with TWAS and PWAS in brain tissues argue that ICA1L participates in pathways pertinent to cerebral small vessel disease and hemorrhagic stroke risk; multi-ancestry TWAS further suggests relevance to white matter integrity and AD-related biology (URLs above). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 1-2, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 7-8, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10, chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)

Ambiguity and scope notes
• Symbol verification: We confirmed the human ICA1L (Q8NDH6) identity, synonyms, and domain annotations per the UniProt details provided in the prompt; we did not identify conflicting gene symbols or organisms in the evidence reviewed here.
• Literature breadth: For non-stroke traits (e.g., insomnia, ADHD, schizophrenia, migraine), we could not retrieve citable, in-context primary evidence within this analysis run. Signals for these phenotypes have been reported elsewhere, but are not included here because those specific sources were not available to cite in the present context. 

Conclusions and next steps
• ICA1L (Q8NDH6) is a human protein with AH/BAR and Arfaptin-like domain annotations. Recent integrative human genetics/proteomics provide strong evidence linking ICA1L to intracerebral hemorrhage and small vessel disease biology, with significant MTAG, TWAS, and PWAS signals and replication in UK Biobank. Multi-ancestry TWAS suggests that lower ICA1L expression associates with white matter hyperintensity burden and an AD signal, indicating potential roles at the vascular–neurodegenerative interface (URLs/dates above). (muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 1-2, muino2024identificationofgenetic pages 8-10, chaar2025multiancestrytranscriptomewideassociation pages 53-56)
• Evidence gaps include definitive molecular function, interactome mapping, and subcellular localization in human brain cells. Priority experiments include: (i) cell-type–resolved expression and proteomics in cerebrovascular and glial populations; (ii) CRISPR perturbation of ICA1L in endothelial/perivascular models to assess effects on vesicle trafficking, membrane curvature, and barrier properties; (iii) proteoform- and phospho-specific measurements to reconcile transcript–protein directionality; and (iv) cross-ancestry genetic replication and colocalization with eQTL/pQTL.
