description: GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a 
  multifunctional protein best known for its role in glycolysis, catalyzing the 
  oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 
  1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Beyond metabolism, GAPDH has extraordinary 
  moonlighting functions including roles in transcription, apoptosis, membrane 
  trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and immune responses. It localizes to 
  multiple cellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, membrane, mitochondria) and 
  its diverse functions are regulated by post-translational modifications 
  including S-nitrosylation, acetylation, and oxidation. This context-dependent 
  multifunctionality makes GAPDH a prime example of protein moonlighting, where 
  a single protein performs multiple unrelated functions depending on cellular 
  conditions and localization.
