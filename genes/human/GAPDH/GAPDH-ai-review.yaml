description: GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a multifunctional protein best known for its role in glycolysis, catalyzing the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Beyond metabolism, GAPDH has extraordinary moonlighting functions including roles in transcription, apoptosis, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and immune responses. It localizes to multiple cellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, membrane, mitochondria) and its diverse functions are regulated by post-translational modifications including S-nitrosylation, acetylation, and oxidation. This context-dependent multifunctionality makes GAPDH a prime example of protein moonlighting, where a single protein performs multiple unrelated functions depending on cellular conditions and localization.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is essential for GAPDH's moonlighting function as a peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylase that regulates apoptotic processes by S-nitrosylating nuclear target proteins.
