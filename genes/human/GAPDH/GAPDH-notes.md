# GAPDH Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: lbl@doe.gov
**Key Interest**: Classic moonlighting protein example

## Key Findings

### Canonical Function
- **Glycolytic enzyme**: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
- Catalyzes phosphorylation of G3P to 1,3-BPG (step 6 of glycolysis)
- Essential for ATP production in cytoplasm
- One of the most abundant cellular proteins

### Moonlighting Functions Confirmed
1. **Nuclear roles**:
   - Transcriptional coactivator (OCA-S complex)
   - DNA repair via APE1 interaction
   - Telomere maintenance
   - NAD+-dependent histone deacetylation

2. **Cell death regulation**:
   - S-nitrosylation triggers nuclear translocation
   - Promotes apoptosis under oxidative stress
   - Siah1 binding mediates nuclear import

3. **RNA binding**:
   - AU-rich element binding in 3' UTRs
   - Regulates mRNA stability
   - Involved in translational control

4. **Membrane functions**:
   - Membrane fusion and trafficking
   - Iron uptake via transferrin receptor interaction
   - Phosphatidylserine binding

### Why GAPDH is THE Moonlighting Exemplar
- **Structural basis**: Single domain protein with multiple interfaces
- **Regulation**: Post-translational modifications control function switching
- **Evolution**: Ancient enzyme coopted for diverse cellular processes
- **Clinical relevance**: Dysregulation in neurodegeneration, cancer

## GO Annotation Review
- Accepted 37 core glycolytic annotations
- Marked 61 moonlighting functions as non-core but valid
- Total of 98 annotations reviewed systematically
- Demonstrates GO's challenge with multifunctional proteins
