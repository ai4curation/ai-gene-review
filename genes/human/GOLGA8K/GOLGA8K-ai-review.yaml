  GOLGA8K (Golgin subfamily A member 8K) is a poorly characterized member of the
  GOLGA8/CASP-related golgin subfamily. Like other golgins, it contains extensive
  coiled-coil domains that are predicted to form elongated structures projecting
  from the Golgi membrane. Based on conserved domain architecture and phylogenetic
  inference from characterized golgin family members, GOLGA8K is predicted to
  localize to the cis-Golgi compartment where it likely functions as a vesicle
  tether or scaffold involved in Golgi organization. The gene resides within the
  15q11-q13 region, where GOLGA8 core duplicons are known to mediate recurrent
  chromosomal rearrangements associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.
  Direct experimental characterization of GOLGA8K specifically is lacking; all
  functional inferences derive from domain conservation and family-level evidence.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for cis-Golgi localization inferred from phylogenetic analysis
      using PANTHER. Supporting evidence from orthologs includes FB:FBgn0034697
      (Drosophila), RGD:620282 (rat), and UniProtKB:Q08379 (human golgin-84/CASP).
      Golgin-84/CASP (Q08379) is a well-characterized cis-Golgi tether that interacts
      with other golgins during intra-Golgi trafficking. The annotation is consistent
      with GOLGA8K domain architecture containing GOLGA domains (IPR024858, IPR043937)
      and the conserved coiled-coil structure typical of Golgi-localized golgins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference. GOLGA8K shares
      conserved domain architecture with characterized cis-Golgi golgins including
      golgin-84/CASP. Deep research confirms that golgins occupy the cytoplasmic face
      of the Golgi and function as tethers/scaffolds, with cis-Golgi localization
      being consistent with the GOLGA8/CASP subfamily. The coiled-coil regions and
      GOLGA domains in GOLGA8K strongly support Golgi cisterna localization.

      IBA annotation for cis-Golgi network localization based on phylogenetic inference.
      The annotation derives from orthologs including MGI:MGI:2139395 (mouse),
      RGD:620282 (rat), and UniProtKB:Q08379 (human golgin-84/CASP). The cis-Golgi
      network is the entry point for ER-derived vesicles, and golgins in this region
      function as vesicle tethers. Deep research indicates golgins "occupy the
      cytoplasmic face of the Golgi, functioning as tethers/scaffolds in ER-to-Golgi
      and intra-Golgi trafficking."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The cis-Golgi network annotation is phylogenetically well-supported and
      consistent with the GOLGA8/CASP subfamily function. Family-level evidence
      demonstrates that golgins with GOLGA domains localize to cis-Golgi compartments
      where they participate in vesicle capture. This annotation complements the
      Golgi cis cisterna annotation and represents an appropriate level of specificity
      for a golgin family member.

      IBA annotation for biological process involvement in Golgi organization.
      Phylogenetic inference from orthologs FB:FBgn0034697, RGD:620282, and
      UniProtKB:Q08379. Golgins are established as major structural components of
      the Golgi matrix. Deep research notes that golgins are "Golgi-matrix tethers
      that project into the cytoplasm and mediate vesicle capture, Golgi structural
      integrity, and trafficking." Super-resolution studies describe organized
      arrangements of golgins at the Golgi rim contributing to architecture.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation to Golgi organization is strongly supported by family-level
      evidence. Golgins are well-established as structural scaffolds that maintain
      Golgi integrity. The coiled-coil architecture of GOLGA8K is consistent with
      the extended tether function that golgins use to organize Golgi structure.
      This represents a core function for golgin family members and is appropriate
      for GOLGA8K based on phylogenetic conservation.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for Golgi cisterna membrane localization from phylogenetic
      analysis with PANTHER:PTN000094136 and orthologs including RGD:620282. Golgins
      are known to be membrane-associated through their C-termini while projecting
      coiled-coil domains into the cytoplasm. Deep research confirms that golgins are
      "C-terminus anchored to Golgi membrane or via adaptors" with "long cytosolic
      extensions projecting from Golgi surface."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The Golgi cisterna membrane annotation is consistent with golgin biology.
      GOLGA8K contains the GOLGA_C domain (IPR043937) which is associated with
      C-terminal membrane anchoring in golgins. The annotation appropriately captures
      the membrane-associated nature of golgins while the other cellular component
      annotations capture the specific sub-Golgi localization.

    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping (InterPro:IPR024858 GOLGA,
      InterPro:IPR043937 GOLGA_C). These domains are characteristic of golgins,
      which by definition localize to the Golgi apparatus. The annotation is broader
      than the IBA annotations for cis-Golgi network and Golgi cis cisterna, which
      provide more specific localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The Golgi apparatus annotation is accurate based on the presence of
      GOLGA-family domains. While it is less specific than the IBA annotations
      for cis-Golgi localization, it is not incorrect. IEA annotations from InterPro
      mappings are generally reliable for cellular component when based on
      well-characterized domain families. The GOLGA domains have strong predictive
      value for Golgi localization.

      IEA annotation for cis-Golgi network from InterPro domain mapping
      (InterPro:IPR043937 GOLGA_C). This is the same term as the IBA annotation

      mapping vs phylogenetic inference). The GOLGA_C domain is associated with
      cis-Golgi localization in golgin family members.
    action: ACCEPT

      This annotation is a duplicate of the IBA annotation for the same GO term
      (GO:0005801) but with different evidence. Both IEA (from domain mapping) and
      IBA (from phylogeny) support cis-Golgi network localization. The redundancy
      is acceptable in GO as different evidence types can independently support
      the same annotation. The InterPro-based inference is consistent with the
      phylogenetic inference.

      Based on phylogenetic inference and conserved golgin domain architecture,
      GOLGA8K is predicted to function as a coiled-coil tether/scaffold at the
      cis-Golgi network. Golgins typically function through protein-protein
      interactions to tether vesicles. Direct experimental evidence for
      GOLGA8K-specific molecular function is lacking.
