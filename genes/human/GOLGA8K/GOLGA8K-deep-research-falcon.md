## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** D6RF30
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Golgin subfamily A member 8K;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GOLGA8K {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:38652};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GOLGA8 family. .
- **Key Domains:** GOLGA. (IPR024858); GOLGA_C. (IPR043937); GOLGA_cons_dom. (IPR043976); GM130_C (PF19046); GOLGA2L5 (PF15070)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GOLGA8K" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GOLGA8K' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GOLGA8K** (gene ID: GOLGA8K, UniProt: D6RF30) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan status: All objectives completed. We verified identity and compiled recent evidence. Because gene symbols are often ambiguous, we explicitly anchored all statements to the human GOLGA8K entry provided by UniProt (D6RF30) and then used family- and paralog-level evidence with caution. Where GOLGA8K-specific primary experiments were lacking, we state inference explicitly.

Executive summary
GOLGA8K (UniProt D6RF30) encodes a human golgin of the GOLGA8 subfamily (historically related to CASP paralogs). Golgins are elongated coiled-coil, Golgi-matrix tethers that project into the cytoplasm and mediate vesicle capture, Golgi structural integrity, and trafficking. Recent work refines family-level organization at the Golgi rim, and genomics studies highlight the central role of GOLGA8 core duplicons in recurrent rearrangements at 15q11–q13 that underlie Prader–Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS). CRISPR targeting of GOLGA8 repeats has been used to engineer isogenic human stem-cell models bearing megabase-scale 15q deletions. Direct, protein-specific functional studies for the GOLGA8K isoform remain limited; thus, functional annotation draws from conserved domains and paralog/family evidence.

*Table: Compact evidence table summarizing family‑level functional annotations, genomic context, experimental uses, and limitations for human GOLGA8K (UniProt D6RF30), with key 2023–2024 sources and context IDs for traceability.*

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and family: GOLGA8K (human; UniProt D6RF30) is annotated as Golgin subfamily A member 8K, within the GOLGA8/CASP-related golgin subfamily, part of the broader Golgi matrix “golgin” family of long coiled-coil tethers. Golgins typically anchor via their C-terminus to Golgi membranes and extend 100–600 nm into the cytoplasm to capture vesicles; they are major structural components of the Golgi matrix. (kuodyte2023thegolgicomplex pages 30-35, mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 1-5)
- Conserved domains: Family-level analyses show predominant coiled-coil architecture, C-terminal membrane-anchoring or adaptor-binding motifs, and frequent intrinsic disorder with potential liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) propensity among Golgi matrix proteins (GMPs), including CASP/GOLGA8 family members. (mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 1-5, mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 5-8)
- Localization and role: Golgins occupy the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi, functioning as tethers/scaffolds in ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi trafficking. Some golgins operate as t-tethers at the Golgi, others as v-tethers on vesicles; interactions among tethers (e.g., golgin-84 with CASP; giantin with p115) aid vesicle capture and fusion. (sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16)
- Higher-order organization: Super-resolution studies describe a layered (“tetraplex”) arrangement of rim golgins and their capacity to self-assemble into long filamentous bands that may contribute to Golgi rim architecture, consistent with coiled-coil oligomerization. (Note: preprint family-level finding.) (su2025thegolgirim pages 1-3)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Golgin functions and vesicle recycling: Acute inactivation of the COG tethering complex in human cells causes accumulation of distinct intra-Golgi vesicles and relocalization of specific golgins (giantin, golgin-84, TMF1) into vesicles, supporting roles as v- versus t-tethers and highlighting golgin participation in COG-dependent glycosylation machinery recycling. (Dec 2023; Traffic; https://doi.org/10.1111/tra.12876) (sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16)
- LLPS in Golgi matrix proteins: Bioinformatic and experimental evidence suggests many golgins/GRASPs display disorder and LLPS tendencies, offering a framework for condensate-based Golgi organization (preprint, Mar 2024; bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.21.550027). (mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 1-5, mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 5-8)
- 15q11–q13 structural genomics: Comparative genomics indicates human-specific expansion of directly oriented, high-identity segmental duplications (SDs) flanking GOLGA (GOLGA8) and HERC cores at 15q11–q13, predisposing to recurrent NAHR-mediated PWS/AS deletions/duplications (Oct 2023; IJMS; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115818). (paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 10-11, paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 1-2, paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 7-8)
- CRISPR engineering via GOLGA8 repeats: A 2024 study used a single GOLGA8-targeted gRNA in H9 hESCs to create megabase-scale 15q deletions modeling AS/PWS; 126 clones were screened and multiple multi-Mb deletions recovered, verified by copy-number and methylation analyses (Aug 2024; bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.30.555563). (gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 3-6, gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 14-16, gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 1-3)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Disease modeling: GOLGA8 core duplicons serve as CRISPR targets to engineer isogenic stem-cell models of PWS/AS with precise megabase deletions, enabling allele-specific regulatory studies and potential therapeutic testing. (gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 3-6, gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 1-3)
- Mechanistic inference for GOLGA8K: In the absence of direct GOLGA8K studies, coiled-coil golgin properties, Golgi localization, and roles in tethering/vesicle capture can be cautiously assigned by homology to the GOLGA8/CASP subfamily. (kuodyte2023thegolgicomplex pages 30-35, sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16, mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 1-5)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Golgin conceptual framework: Reviews and primary work converge on golgins as coiled-coil, C-terminally anchored, long-range tethers orchestrating ER–Golgi and intra-Golgi traffic and maintaining Golgi architecture; the COG complex coordinates recycling of glycosylation machinery with specific golgins acting as t- or v-tethers. (kuodyte2023thegolgicomplex pages 30-35, sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16)
- 15q11–q13 instability drivers: Comparative genomics identifies GOLGA8 core duplicons and adjacent HERC repeats as central elements whose directly oriented, high-identity SDs foster NAHR; inversion polymorphisms and repeat content modulate susceptibility but are not strictly required for rearrangements. (paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 10-11, paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 7-8)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- PWS/AS incidence and deletion proportion: Incidence ~1/15,000–1/30,000 live births; recurrent megabase deletions constitute the most common genetic subtype (~70% of cases). (Aug 2024; bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.30.555563) (gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 1-3)
- 15q11–q13 architecture: Four pairs of directly oriented duplication blocks flanking the critical region, expanded ~16-fold in humans relative to macaque; high sequence identity (≈98–99%) promotes NAHR. (Oct 2023; IJMS; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115818) (paparella2023structuralvariationevolution pages 10-11)
- CRISPR engineering metrics: One GOLGA8-targeted gRNA nucleofected into H9 hESCs; 126 clones screened across four transfections; multiple deletions recovered (e.g., ~5.8 Mb, ~8 Mb, and combined ~7 Mb), with allele origin confirmed by methylation assays. (Aug 2024; bioRxiv; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.30.555563) (gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 3-6, gilmore2024generationofisogenic pages 14-16)

Functional annotation for GOLGA8K (inferred with caution)
- Primary function: Non-enzymatic, structural tether/scaffold typical of golgins. Likely participates in vesicle tethering and Golgi organization; substrate specificity does not apply, but potential selectivity could arise via binding to specific vesicle coats/Rabs/SNARE partners as observed for other golgins. Direct GOLGA8K partners remain to be experimentally defined. (sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16, kuodyte2023thegolgicomplex pages 30-35)
- Cellular localization: Cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus (Golgi matrix/rim), likely C-terminally anchored or adaptor-mediated membrane association, projecting a long coiled-coil rod into the cytosol. (kuodyte2023thegolgicomplex pages 30-35, mendes2024exploringliquidliquidphase pages 1-5)
- Pathways: ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi trafficking; coordination with tethering machineries such as COG; potential involvement in retrograde/anterograde flows by analogy to characterized golgins. (sumya2023acutecogcomplex pages 14-16)

Limitations and cautions
- The symbol GOLGA8K is specific to human UniProt D6RF30; no evidence supports conflation with non-human or unrelated GOLGA8-like genes. Literature giving “GOLGA8/CASP” often discusses related paralogs (e.g., GOLGA8A/B) or the GOLGA8 core duplicons at 15q11–q13; we avoided assigning paralog-specific findings directly to GOLGA8K unless supported by conserved family features.

Conclusion
GOLGA8K is best annotated as a human golgin-class coiled-coil tether localized to the Golgi cytoplasmic face, with a presumptive role in vesicle capture and Golgi organization by homology to CASP/GOLGA8 paralogs. The strongest 2023–2024 advances relevant to GOLGA8K concern (i) refined understanding of golgin tethering and recycling roles at the Golgi and (ii) the pivotal role of GOLGA8 core duplicons in recurrent 15q11–q13 rearrangements; the latter has immediate translational relevance, as GOLGA8-targeted CRISPR strategies enable isogenic modeling of PWS/AS in human stem cells. Direct, isoform-specific experiments on GOLGA8K remain an unmet need; until then, domain architecture and family conservation provide the most reliable basis for functional inference.
