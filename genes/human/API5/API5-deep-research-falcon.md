## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BZZ5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Apoptosis inhibitor 5 {ECO:0000305}; Short=API-5; AltName: Full=Antiapoptosis clone 11 protein; Short=AAC-11; AltName: Full=Cell migration-inducing gene 8 protein; AltName: Full=Fibroblast growth factor 2-interacting factor; Short=FIF; AltName: Full=Protein XAGL;
- **Gene Information:** Name=API5 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:594}; ORFNames=MIG8;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the API5 family. .
- **Key Domains:** API5. (IPR008383); ARM-like. (IPR011989); ARM-type_fold. (IPR016024); API5 (PF05918)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "API5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'API5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **API5** (gene ID: API5, UniProt: Q9BZZ5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human API5 (AAC-11/FIF; UniProt Q9BZZ5)

Executive verification of identity
- Gene/protein: API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5), also known as AAC-11 and FIF, matches UniProt Q9BZZ5 and is described as a ~55–58 kDa, largely nuclear, helical repeat protein that functions as a scaffold; it lacks catalytic activity and belongs to the API5 family. Structural analyses and curated reviews describe an elongated, all-helical architecture with N‑terminal HEAT-like and C‑terminal ARM-like repeats, plus an LxxLL motif, a heptad leucine-repeat/leucine zipper segment, and a nuclear localization sequence, consistent with InterPro entries API5/ARM-like folds provided in the prompt (IPR008383; IPR011989; IPR016024; PF05918). Organism: Homo sapiens. Synonyms (AAC‑11/FIF) are consistently used across the literature and map to human API5. Stop conditions for symbol ambiguity are not triggered. (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 2-4, sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary role: API5 is a nuclear scaffold protein that inhibits apoptosis through multiple mechanisms and coordinates transcriptional and post-transcriptional programs affecting cell-cycle progression and stress responses. It is not an enzyme or transporter; its activity is mediated by modular helical-repeat interfaces that bind partner proteins. (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 2-4, sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2)
- Canonical anti-apoptotic mechanisms:
  • Caspase-2: API5 directly binds the CARD of caspase-2, preventing its dimerization/activation; recombinant API5 inhibits full-length but not processed caspase-2, and API5 depletion increases caspase-2 activation and sensitizes cells to caspase‑2–dependent death (EMBO Reports, 2017; DOI 10.15252/embr.201643744). URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201643744 (published online 23 Mar 2017). (imre2017apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 1-3)
  • Acinus/DNA fragmentation: API5 (AAC‑11) binds Acinus, protects it from caspase‑3 cleavage, and blocks Acinus-mediated apoptotic DNA fragmentation; an AAC‑11 LZ-mimicking peptide disrupts the complex and potentiates chemotherapy-induced death (EMBO J., 2009). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2009.106 (published online 23 Apr 2009). (rigou2009theantiapoptoticprotein pages 1-2)
  • E2F1 axis: API5 suppresses E2F1‑dependent apoptosis while positively contributing to E2F1 transcriptional activation of G1/S genes by facilitating E2F1 promoter occupancy, thus promoting proliferation (PLoS ONE, 2013; DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0071443). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071443 (published 7 Aug 2013). (navarro2013api5contributesto pages 1-2, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 7-8, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 4-6)
- Post-translational regulation:
  • Acetylation: K251 acetylation by p300 stabilizes API5; HDAC1 reverses this mark, lowering stability and altering localization; API5 levels peak in G1/G1‑S and support cell-cycle progression (Scientific Reports, 2021; DOI 10.1038/s41598-021-95941-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95941-4 (published 12 Aug 2021). (sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2)
  • DNA-damage turnover: Upon genotoxic stress, ATR phosphorylates API5 (reported S138), promoting cytoplasmic relocalization and SCF‑FBXW2–mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (bioRxiv preprint, 8 Aug 2021; DOI 10.1101/2021.08.08.455545). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.08.455545 (posted 8 Aug 2021). (sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 1-4, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 31-33)
- Subcellular localization: Predominantly nuclear; acetylation status and stress signaling modulate stability and nucleocytoplasmic distribution (p300/HDAC1; ATR–FBXW2 axis). (sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 1-4)
- Additional cellular programs: API5 participates in nuclear FGF-2 complexes and has been implicated in mRNA export (TREX/eIF4E/CRM1 pathways) in some reports; it also acts as a cofactor for ERα via its LxxLL “NR box,” influencing estrogen-responsive transcription. (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 7-8, basset2017api5anew pages 1-2)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- 2024 review synthesis: A comprehensive review (Biomolecules, 2024) consolidates API5’s structural modules (HEAT/ARM-like repeats, LxxLL, heptad leucine repeat), anti-apoptotic mechanisms (Acinus, caspase-2, E2F1), post-translational regulation (K251 acetylation; SUMOylation), and oncologic relevance (aggressive behavior, resistance, prognosis). It also summarizes links to innate immune signaling (TLR4) and viral interference with API5 SUMOylation that dampens IFN-β responses. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14010136 (published Jan 2024). (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 2-4, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 7-8, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 4-6, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 10-11)
- 2023 primary data (breast cancer): In BMC Cancer (2023), perturbation of Api5 in breast models showed that overexpression drives proliferation, EMT-like phenotypes, migration, and polarity disruption; mechanistically, FGF2-driven PDK1–AKT/cMYC and RAS–ERK signaling were implicated; Api5 knockdown reduced FGF2 signaling and in vivo tumorigenicity. URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-10866-7 (published 21 Apr 2023). (kuttanamkuzhi2023alteredexpressionof pages 1-2)
- 2022–2024 immunology: Nature (2022) identified API5 as a protective γδ intraepithelial lymphocyte effector; recombinant API5 protected Paneth cells ex vivo/in vivo and masked genetic susceptibility (ATG16L1 T300A), highlighting a secreted, tissue-protective role for API5 beyond tumor biology. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05259-y (published 12 Oct 2022; PMC 2023). (matsuzawaishimoto2022theγδiel pages 1-3)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Peptide therapeutics derived from AAC‑11 (API5) heptad leucine repeat:
  • RT53 peptide (AAC‑11 LZ fused to a cell-penetrating sequence) selectively kills cancer cells, induces bona fide immunogenic cell death (ICD) marked by calreticulin exposure, ATP and HMGB1 release, and elicits antitumor immunity in vaccination and intratumoral settings (PLoS ONE, 2018). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201220 (published 6 Aug 2018). (pasquereaukotula2018theanticancerpeptide pages 1-2)
  • Clinical/preclinical relevance in chemoresistance and angiogenesis: In TNBC patient-derived xenografts, an “anti‑API‑5” peptide inhibited growth of a chemoresistant model via caspase‑3 activation and anti‑angiogenic effects; in 78 TNBC biopsies, higher endothelial API5 associated with non‑pCR and greater microvessel density (Oncotarget, 2019). URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.27312 (published 12 Nov 2019). (bousquet2019highexpressionof pages 1-2)
  • HIV targeting: AAC‑11–derived LZ peptides preferentially killed metabolically active, HIV‑susceptible CD4+ T cells in vitro, rendering surviving cells resistant to HIV replication, suggesting a strategy to deplete “permissive” reservoirs (J. Virol., 2020). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00611-20 (published 24 Jun 2020). ()
- Vaccine adjuvancy (human DAMP): Purified API5 activates/matures dendritic cells through TLR4–NF‑κB, enhancing antigen‑specific CD8+ T‑cell responses and tumor protection in mice, positioning API5 as a human-origin adjuvant candidate for DC vaccines (OncoImmunology, 2018). URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402X.2018.1472187 (published online 15 Aug 2018). (kim2018anovelfunction pages 1-3)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic anti-apoptotic schema: Recent reviews emphasize four complementary API5 mechanisms—(i) blocking Acinus-mediated DNA fragmentation; (ii) direct inhibition of initiator caspase-2; (iii) suppressing E2F1‑dependent apoptosis while promoting E2F1-driven G1/S gene expression; and (iv) enforcing survival via FGF2→FGFR1→ERK/PKCδ signaling that degrades BIM—collectively explaining chemoresistance and immune escape. (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 4-6, imre2017apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 1-3, navarro2013api5contributesto pages 1-2, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 10-11, jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2)
- Structural/biophysical rationale: HEAT/ARM-like repeats and an LZ region provide adaptable protein–protein interaction surfaces, consistent with API5’s role as a multipartner scaffold (FGF2, Acinus, ERα, caspase-2), a view reiterated in 2024 synthesis. (abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 2-4, sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2)
- Regulation under stress: The 2021 studies collectively suggest a regulatory model where p300/HDAC1 set a basal stability/localization state via K251 acetylation, while ATR–FBXW2 mediates degradation upon DNA damage—consistent with API5 acting as a survival determinant that is actively removed to permit apoptotic execution after genotoxic stress (preprint caveat noted). (sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 1-4, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 31-33)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Breast cancer (2023): In silico analyses (TCGA, GENT2) linked elevated API5 transcripts with poorer prognosis; experimental overexpression in 3D MCF10A acini increased proliferation and motility and induced partial EMT‑like features; API5 knockdown reduced proliferation and in vivo tumorigenicity in malignant models (BMC Cancer, 2023; detailed hazard ratios not provided in the excerpt; study provides mechanistic and phenotypic effect sizes across models). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-023-10866-7 (21 Apr 2023). (kuttanamkuzhi2023alteredexpressionof pages 1-2)
- Cervical cancer (2014): Tissue microarray (173 primary cancers, 306 CINs, 429 normals) showed stepwise API5 increase during progression; API5 correlated with stage (P=0.004), grade (P<0.001), chemo‑radiation response (P=0.004), and pERK1/2; multivariate: API5+ (P=0.039) and combined API5+/pERK1/2+ (P=0.032) were independent predictors of OS (BMC Cancer, 2014). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-14-545 (published 29 Jul 2014). (cho2014apoptosisinhibitor5overexpression pages 1-2)
- TNBC cohort and xenografts (2019): In 78 TNBC biopsies, higher endothelial API5 in non‑pCR vs pCR (70% vs 40% positive endothelial cells; p=0.01); higher microvessel density in non‑pCR (17% vs 7%; p<0.05). Anti‑API5 peptide therapy in resistant PDXs achieved tumor inhibition with caspase‑3 activation and decreased angiogenesis (Oncotarget, 2019). URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.27312 (12 Nov 2019). (bousquet2019highexpressionof pages 1-2)
- Cisplatin resistance (2017): API5high cells acquired cisplatin resistance via FGFR1 signaling that degraded BIM; FGFR1 inhibition (siRNA or SSR128129E) restored sensitivity in vitro and in xenografts (Exp. Mol. Med., 2017; published 8 Sep 2017). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/emm.2017.130. (jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2)
- Metastasis (2015): API5 promoted ERK‑dependent MMP-9 activity, invasion, and pulmonary metastasis; mutating critical leucines in the LZ region abrogated these effects (BMB Reports, 2015; 18 Jun 2015). URL: https://doi.org/10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.6.139. (jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2)
- ERα cofactor and prognosis (2017): In ERα+ breast cancer meta-analysis (n=1228), high Api5 associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR≈1.91, 95% CI 1.57–2.33; p=8.4×10−11); Api5 engages ERα via LxxLL to coactivate estrogen-responsive genes and promotes tumorigenicity in xenografts (Oncotarget, 2017). URL: https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17281 (20 Apr 2017). (basset2017api5anew pages 1-2)
- Immune biology (2022): Recombinant API5 protected Paneth cells in vivo and in human organoids carrying ATG16L1 risk allele, defining a protective γδ IEL effector function with therapeutic implications in intestinal barrier diseases (Nature, 2022). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05259-y (12 Oct 2022). (matsuzawaishimoto2022theγδiel pages 1-3)

Functional pathways and precise molecular placement
- Apoptosis control: API5 acts upstream of apoptotic execution by preventing caspase‑2 activation (initiator-like), shielding Acinus from caspase‑3 cleavage (blocks DNA laddering), and dampening E2F1‑driven apoptotic programs while maintaining cell-cycle gene transcription—integrating transcriptional control with caspase regulation. (imre2017apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 1-3, rigou2009theantiapoptoticprotein pages 1-2, navarro2013api5contributesto pages 1-2, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 4-6)
- Growth factor signaling: API5 elevates FGF2 and activates FGFR1→PKCδ→ERK signaling, promoting survival by BIM degradation; in multiple models, API5 also engages PI3K–AKT/cMYC via FGF2, linking it to proliferation and stemness programs (Kuttanamkuzhi 2023; Jang 2017). (kuttanamkuzhi2023alteredexpressionof pages 1-2, jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 10-11)
- MAPK/ERK and metastasis: API5’s LZ region is required for ERK activation that drives MMP‑9 and invasion/metastasis; this provides a structural–functional bridge to pro-metastatic signaling. (jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2)
- Hormone signaling: Through an LxxLL NR box, API5 binds ERα (C domain), coactivates estrogen-responsive genes upon E2 stimulation, and predicts poorer RFS in ERα+ cohorts, marking an ER‑modulating scaffold function. (basset2017api5anew pages 1-2)
- Innate and adaptive immunity: API5 can function as a DAMP-like signal engaging TLR4 on DCs to induce NF‑κB activation, DC maturation, and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo; viral proteins can subvert API5 SUMOylation to reduce IFN‑β signaling, and influenza A NP antagonizes API5 to enhance E2F1‑dependent apoptosis for viral replication (OncoImmunology 2018; summarized in 2024 review). (kim2018anovelfunction pages 1-3, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 10-11)

Subcellular localization and context dependence
- Basal state: predominantly nuclear, chromatin-associated, with acetylation at K251 stabilizing the protein and supporting nuclear functions in transcription/mRNA export. (sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2, abbas2024apoptosisinhibitor5 pages 7-8)
- Stress state: DNA damage shifts API5 toward cytoplasmic degradation via ATR–FBXW2–proteasome, functionally coupling checkpoint activation to relief of API5-mediated apoptosis suppression (preprint). (sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 1-4, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 31-33)

Recent implementation notes and translational opportunities
- Direct targeting of API5 interactions: AAC‑11 LZ‑mimetic peptides (e.g., RT53) disrupt API5 complexes and have demonstrated cancer-selective cytotoxicity and ICD, supporting development of peptides or small molecules that destabilize API5 scaffolding. (pasquereaukotula2018theanticancerpeptide pages 1-2, rigou2009theantiapoptoticprotein pages 1-2)
- Pathway-interdiction strategies downstream of API5: In API5high cancers, FGFR1 blockade resensitizes to cisplatin; ERK/MMP axes and ERα coactivation may provide additional combinatorial targets. (jang2017api5inducescisplatin pages 1-2, basset2017api5anew pages 1-2)
- Immunotherapeutic adjuvants: API5 protein fragments proximal to the LZ region act as TLR4-dependent DC adjuvants in murine vaccine models, suggesting a human-source adjuvant paradigm requiring safety/translation studies. (kim2018anovelfunction pages 1-3)
- Non-oncology: The γδ IEL–API5 axis indicates potential for recombinant API5 to protect epithelial barrier cell types (e.g., Paneth cells) where genetic susceptibility and viral infections intersect—an emerging therapeutic angle in IBD-like conditions. (matsuzawaishimoto2022theγδiel pages 1-3)

Limitations and open questions
- Some regulatory findings (ATR–FBXW2 pathway) are from a 2021 preprint and require peer‑reviewed confirmation; nevertheless, they fit with established p300/HDAC1 control of API5 stability/localization. (sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 1-4, sharma2021atrfacilitatesthe pages 31-33, sharma2021interplaybetweenp300 pages 1-2)
- While API5 is frequently overexpressed in cancers with adverse associations, prospective clinical validation and standardized assays are needed for use as a prognostic or predictive biomarker.

Conclusion
Human API5 (AAC‑11/FIF; Q9BZZ5) is a conserved, nuclear scaffold with HEAT/ARM-like repeats and regulatory motifs (LxxLL, LZ, NLS) that orchestrates multiple anti-apoptotic mechanisms and pro-survival transcriptional programs. Recent peer‑reviewed and 2023–2024 literature reinforce API5’s placement as a nexus connecting caspase control (caspase‑2; Acinus), E2F1-driven cell-cycle regulation, growth factor signaling (FGF2/FGFR1→ERK/AKT), hormone receptor coactivation (ERα), and immune modulation (TLR4 activation; γδ IEL‑mediated epithelial protection). Translational progress includes AAC‑11–derived peptides (e.g., RT53) inducing ICD and resensitization strategies targeting FGFR1 in API5high tumors. Outstanding questions include full validation of the ATR–FBXW2 turnover pathway and prospective biomarker qualification, but API5 remains a compelling functional node and therapeutic target in oncology and mucosal immunobiology.
