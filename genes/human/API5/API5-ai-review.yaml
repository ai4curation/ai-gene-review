description: >-
  API5 (Apoptosis Inhibitor 5, also known as AAC-11 and FIF) is a nuclear scaffold
  protein
  with HEAT/ARM-like helical repeat architecture that functions as a multi-mechanism
  anti-apoptotic factor. The protein lacks catalytic activity but mediates survival
  through
  protein-protein interactions via its modular helical repeat interfaces, leucine
  zipper (LZ)
  domain, and LxxLL motif. Core anti-apoptotic mechanisms include: (1) direct binding
  to the
  CARD domain of caspase-2, preventing its dimerization and activation; (2) binding
  to Acinus
  and protecting it from caspase-3 cleavage, thereby blocking apoptotic DNA fragmentation;
  (3) suppression of E2F1-dependent apoptosis while promoting E2F1-driven G1/S gene
  transcription. API5 is predominantly nuclear, with acetylation at K251 by p300 stabilizing
  the protein; HDAC1 reverses this mark. Upon DNA damage, ATR phosphorylation promotes
  cytoplasmic relocalization and proteasomal degradation via SCF-FBXW2.

        API5 is predominantly nuclear as confirmed by multiple studies. The protein
        contains
        a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at residues 454-475 and localizes to the
        nucleus
        where it performs its anti-apoptotic scaffold functions [PMID:11075807].
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        Nuclear localization is well-established for API5. The IBA annotation is consistent
        with direct experimental evidence from PMID:11075807 showing nuclear localization,
        and UniProt confirms this with IDA evidence. The protein's functions in transcriptional
        regulation, caspase-2 inhibition, and Acinus binding all occur in the nucleus.

        This annotation captures the interaction between API5 (AAC-11) and Acinus

        While the protein binding annotation is technically correct, it is uninformative.
        The specific interaction with Acinus (a chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation
        factor) is a core mechanistic function of API5. A more specific term describing
        this scaffold/protective binding function would be more informative, but GO
        may
        lack an appropriate term. The key point is this represents meaningful functional
        binding, not generic protein binding.

        FGF2 binding is well-documented and specific. Two regions of API5 (N-terminal
        aa 96-107 and C-terminal aa 274-311) are required for FGF2 binding. This
        interaction may contribute to API5's role in growth factor signaling and
        survival pathways.

        API5 directly binds the CARD domain of caspase-2, preventing its dimerization
