description: >-
  PFDN4 (Prefoldin subunit 4) encodes a beta-type subunit of the heterohexameric
  prefoldin complex (also known as GimC). The prefoldin complex is a jellyfish-shaped
  molecular chaperone composed of two alpha subunits (PFDN3/VBP1, PFDN5) and four beta
  subunits (PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN4, PFDN6). Prefoldin functions as a co-chaperone/holdase
  that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides -- primarily actin and tubulin -- and
  delivers them to the group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding. The
  prefoldin-TRiC interaction is mediated through a conserved electrostatic interface
  (PMID:30955883). Beyond cytoskeletal protein folding, the prefoldin complex has been
  shown to inhibit amyloid-beta fibrillation (PMID:23614719), suggesting roles in
  neuroprotection. PFDN4 (also known as Protein C-1) interacts with URI1 at
  mitochondria in a phosphorylation- and growth-dependent manner (PMID:17936702).
  PFDN4 is ubiquitously expressed and located on chromosome 20q13.2. Structural
  data from cryo-EM places PFDN4 within the PFD-TRiC supra-chaperone complex
  (PDB: 6NR8, 6NR9, 6NRB, 6NRC, 6NRD, 7WU7).

      with evidence from yeast (SGD:S000005097), Arabidopsis (TAIR:locus:2025655),

      operates in the cytosol to capture unfolded nascent polypeptides and deliver
      them to the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC/CCT (PMID:9630229). The deep research
      review describes prefoldin as a predominantly cytosolic complex for the
      canonical chaperone role. This is also supported by the IDA annotation from
      PMID:17936702 for the same term. The term "cytoplasm" is appropriately broad,

      This IBA annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER) with
      evidence from Arabidopsis (TAIR:locus:2025655) and human PFDN4 itself.
      The prefoldin complex is a bona fide co-chaperone that captures unfolded
      nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin) and delivers them to
      TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding (PMID:9630229). Gestaut et al. 2019
      (PMID:30955883) showed that PFD enhances the rate and yield of TRiC-mediated
      folding, directly demonstrating involvement in protein folding. The deep
      research review (PFDN4-deep-research-falcon.md) confirms this as the
      primary function: "Non-enzymatic co-chaperone; assists folding of
      cytoskeletal proteins by handing off clients to TRiC/CCT." This is the
      central biological process for PFDN4.

      This IBA annotation was inferred from phylogenetic analysis (PANTHER) with
      evidence from human PFDN4 itself. While prefoldin does indeed bind unfolded
      proteins, the term "unfolded protein binding" is a pure binding term that
      fails to capture the functional significance of this interaction. Prefoldin
      acts as a holdase/transfer chaperone: it captures unfolded substrates
      (primarily actin and tubulin) and delivers them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin
      for folding. As described in Vainberg et al. 1998 (PMID:9630229), "Prefoldin
      binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-cpn) and transfers target
      proteins to it." The more appropriate term is GO:0044183 "protein folding
      chaperone" which captures the functional chaperone activity rather than just
      substrate binding. Note that unlike PFDN1, PFDN4 does not have an existing
      IBA annotation to GO:0044183, so a NEW annotation for that term is proposed
      separately.

        We describe the discovery of a heterohexameric chaperone protein, prefoldin,
        based on its ability to capture unfolded actin. Prefoldin binds specifically
        to cytosolic chaperonin (c-cpn) and transfers target proteins to it.

        PFD can act after TRiC bound its substrates to enhance the rate and yield
        of the folding reaction, suppressing non-productive reaction cycles.

- description: >-
    PFDN4 is a beta-type subunit of the heterohexameric prefoldin co-chaperone complex
    that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin) and delivers
    them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin for ATP-dependent folding. Cryo-EM structural data
    show PFDN4 as chain 4 in the PFD-TRiC supra-chaperone complex. The prefoldin complex
    alternates between an open "latched" conformation and a closed "engaged" conformation
    that aligns the PFD-TRiC substrate binding chambers, and this conformational cycling
    enhances the rate and yield of TRiC-mediated protein folding. Disrupting the TRiC-PFD
    interaction in vivo leads to accumulation of amyloid aggregates.
