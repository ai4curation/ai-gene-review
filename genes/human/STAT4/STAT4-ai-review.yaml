description: >-
  STAT4 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 4) is a latent cytoplasmic
  transcription factor of the STAT family (748 aa) that serves as the canonical effector
  of interleukin-12 (IL-12) signaling. Upon IL-12 binding to its receptor (IL12RB2),
  JAK2/TYK2 kinases phosphorylate STAT4 at Tyr-693, enabling SH2-mediated homodimerization,
  nuclear translocation, and binding to STAT target sequences in IL-12-responsive genes
  (PMID:7638186, PMID:10961885). Serine phosphorylation at Ser-721 by MKK6/p38 augments
  transcriptional activity and is critical for IFN-gamma production (PMID:12213961).
  STAT4 is essential for Th1 cell differentiation and IFN-gamma production, and also
  participates in T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell programming, NK cell function,
  and dendritic cell inflammatory programs via IL-23 signaling. STAT4 can also be
  activated by type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta), IL-23, IL-35, and IL-21. Two splice
  isoforms exist (STAT4a with TAD and STAT4b lacking TAD). Genetic variants in STAT4
  (notably rs7574865) are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Gain-of-function variants cause disabling pansclerotic
  morphea of childhood (DPMC) (PMID:37256972).

      STAT4 has roles in cell proliferation regulation, particularly in the context of
      T cell expansion during immune responses. IL-12/STAT4 signaling promotes T cell
      proliferation, and STAT4 serine phosphorylation at S721 is required for IFN-gamma
      production but not for cell proliferation. This is a known but non-core function.

      While STAT4 participates in regulation of cell proliferation (particularly T cell
      expansion in response to IL-12), this is a secondary consequence of its role in
      cytokine signaling rather than a primary function. The core function is transcriptional
      regulation downstream of cytokine receptors.

      dimers bind target sequences and recruit coactivators to drive transcription of

      repressor in some contexts (e.g., IL5 repression via IFN-alpha, PMID:26990433),

      Response to IL-6 from the DPMC study. STAT4 gain-of-function variants show
      enhanced signaling in the context of IL-6 family cytokines. However, STAT4
      is not traditionally considered a primary effector of IL-6 signaling (STAT3
      is the canonical IL-6 effector). This annotation may reflect the gain-of-function
      variant context rather than normal STAT4 biology.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      PMID:37256972 is not available in the publications cache for full review. The
      annotation of STAT4 to response to IL-6 is unexpected because STAT4 is primarily
      activated by IL-12 and IL-23, not IL-6 directly. STAT3 is the canonical effector
      of IL-6 signaling. This may reflect the gain-of-function disease context (DPMC
      variants in the SH2 domain could alter cytokine specificity) rather than normal
      STAT4 function. Without access to the full text, marking as UNDECIDED.

    summary: >-
      JAK-STAT pathway from the Yamamoto et al. 1997 cloning paper. STAT4 is
      described as part of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade activated by IL-12.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct. The paper describes STAT4 as a STAT-family member essential for IL-12
      signal transduction, which occurs via the JAK-STAT pathway. This TAS annotation
      is consistent with IBA and NAS evidence for the same term.

          Studies of transcriptional activation by interferons and a variety of cytokines

  review:
    summary: >-
      STAT4 responds to multiple cytokines including IL-12 (the primary activator),
      IL-23, IL-35, IL-21, and type I interferons. This broader term captures the
      multi-cytokine responsiveness of STAT4 beyond just IL-12. While specific
      cytokine response terms exist (GO:0035722 for IL-12), a broader annotation
      would capture the full scope.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      STAT4 is activated by multiple cytokines beyond IL-12, including IL-23, IL-35,
      type I IFNs, and IL-21. The existing annotations capture IL-12 specifically
      (GO:0035722) and cytokine-mediated signaling (GO:0019221), but a direct
      response to cytokine annotation would complement these. However, this may be
      redundant with GO:0019221.

  review:
    summary: >-
      STAT4 also functions as a transcriptional repressor. In response to IFN-alpha/beta
      signaling, STAT4 suppresses IL5 and IL13 mRNA expression during TCR activation
      (PMID:26990433, cited in UniProt). This repressor function is not captured by
      any existing annotation.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      UniProt documents that STAT4 acts as a transcriptional repressor of IL5 and IL13
      in response to IFN-alpha/beta signaling (PMID:26990433). This is a biologically
      significant function not captured by existing annotations, which focus on
      transcriptional activation. Adding negative regulation of transcription would
      provide a more complete picture of STAT4 function.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    STAT4 functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor that is the canonical
    effector of IL-12 signaling in the JAK-STAT pathway. Upon IL-12 binding to
    IL12RB2, JAK2/TYK2 phosphorylate STAT4 at Tyr-693, enabling SH2-mediated
    homodimerization and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, STAT4 dimers
    bind GAS elements in target gene promoters to activate transcription of
    Th1-associated genes including IFNG and IL12RB2. Serine phosphorylation
    at Ser-721 by MKK6/p38 is required for full transcriptional activity and
    IFN-gamma production.
