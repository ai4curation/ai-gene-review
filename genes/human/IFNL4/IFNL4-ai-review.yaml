description: >-
  Interferon lambda-4 (IFNL4) is a type III interferon (IFN-lambda family) that triggers
  antiviral responses by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. IFNL4 is encoded
  upstream of IFNL3 and was discovered in association with hepatitis C virus (HCV)
  clearance. A common dinucleotide polymorphism (ss469415590 TT/ΔG) creates a frameshift
  that either produces functional IFNL4 protein or a pseudogene. Paradoxically, the
  allele producing functional IFNL4 (ΔG) is associated with IMPAIRED HCV clearance,
  while the inactive TT allele correlates with better outcomes. IFNL4 signals through
  the type III interferon receptor complex (IFNLR1/IL10RB), activating JAK1/TYK2
  kinases which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. The protein is secreted and induces
  interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Four isoforms exist but only isoform 1 (p179)
  is functionally active.

    summary: >-
      IFNL4 triggers JAK-STAT signaling via its receptor complex. However, this
      term describes the pathway IFNL4 initiates as a ligand, not a process it
      directly participates in enzymatically. The annotation is reasonable but
      imprecise - IFNL4's role is as the cytokine that activates the pathway.

    summary: >-
      OVER-ANNOTATION: IFNL4 is a type III interferon (cytokine) that INDUCES STAT
      phosphorylation via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but does NOT catalyze the
      phosphorylation reaction itself. PMID:23291588 states "Transient overexpression
      of IFNL4 in a hepatoma cell line induced STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation" -
      the interferon triggers downstream JAK kinases to phosphorylate STAT proteins.
      IFNL4 has no kinase activity (it is a secreted cytokine). The appropriate term
      is GO:0042531 "positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein"
      which correctly describes the regulatory role.
