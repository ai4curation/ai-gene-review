description: >-
  MEX3B is an RNA-binding protein with dual functions: sequence-specific mRNA recognition
  via tandem KH domains and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity via a C-terminal RING finger domain.
  Its primary validated function is binding the 3'-UTR of HLA-A mRNA to promote its destabilization,
  thereby reducing MHC class I surface expression and contributing to tumor immune evasion.
  MEX3B also functions as a TLR3 co-receptor in innate immune sensing and can ubiquitinate
  specific protein substrates (SNUPN, RUNX3, SUZ12) in complexes scaffolded by the lncRNA HOTAIR.
  The protein localizes to P-bodies and cytoplasmic RNA granules, shuttling between cytoplasm
  and nucleus via the CRM1 export pathway. Phosphorylation at Ser-462 creates a 14-3-3 binding
  site that regulates its localization and RNA-binding activity.

        This IEA annotation is well-supported by structural and functional data. MEX3B contains
        two tandem KH domains that mediate sequence-specific RNA recognition. The 2024 structural
        study defined a high-affinity 12-nt HLA-A 3'UTR motif (CUGAGCUGUAAC) and showed tandem
