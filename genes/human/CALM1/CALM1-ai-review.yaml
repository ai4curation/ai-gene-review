description: Calmodulin-1 is a ubiquitous calcium-binding messenger protein that serves
  as the primary intracellular calcium sensor in eukaryotic cells. Through its four
  EF-hand domains, CALM1 binds calcium ions and undergoes conformational changes that
  enable it to interact with and regulate over 100 different target proteins including
  kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and cytoskeletal proteins. It plays essential
  roles in muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, cell cycle progression, and
  calcium homeostasis. Mutations in CALM1 cause severe cardiac arrhythmias including
  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT syndrome
  (LQTS), which can lead to sudden cardiac death. The protein is also exploited by
  bacterial pathogens such as Shigella flexneri whose effector proteins bind the apo
  form of calmodulin to disrupt calcium signaling during infection.
