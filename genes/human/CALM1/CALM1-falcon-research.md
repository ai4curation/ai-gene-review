This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Homo sapiens CALM1 gene (UniProt ID Q96HK3), encoding calmodulin‐1, with particular emphasis on its molecular function, cellular localization, involvement in biological processes, disease associations, protein domains, expression patterns, evolutionary conservation, and the key experimental evidence that supports these annotations. In addition to its well‐established role as a ubiquitous calcium‐binding messenger protein, the CALM1 gene product has now been implicated in microbial infection processes, where it is required for the activity of specific bacterial effector proteins. This multifaceted profile makes CALM1 essential for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation curation, and the following sections synthesize data from multiple high‐quality studies (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5).

1. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
CALM1 encodes calmodulin‐1, a prototypical calcium‐binding messenger protein that plays a central role in intracellular calcium signaling. By virtue of its ability to bind Ca²⁺ ions through highly conserved EF‐hand motifs, calmodulin undergoes a conformational change that enables it to interact with and regulate a wide spectrum of target proteins such as kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and other enzymes involved in signal transduction (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4). In its apo state, calmodulin is pre‐bound to many target proteins, and calcium binding further modifies these interactions by inducing structural rearrangements that modulate target activity (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 5-7). Notably, the current UniProt metadata also highlights a role for CALM1 in microbial infection: it is required for the arginine ADP‐riboxanase activity of CopC from Chromobacterium violaceum and OspC3 from Shigella flexneri, and the bacterial proteins OspC1 and OspC3 bind specifically to the apo form of calmodulin, thereby preventing its typical calcium‐binding capacity (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4). This functional involvement in microbial infection expands the traditional view of calmodulin solely as a regulator of endogenous calcium signaling by positioning it as a critical host factor hijacked by pathogenic bacteria during infection to modulate host cell processes. At the molecular level, these interactions highlight an additional layer of regulation wherein exogenous effectors can commandeer calmodulin’s activity and thereby alter downstream signaling cascades that are normally tightly controlled by Ca²⁺ flux (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 2-4).

2. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
The spatial distribution of calmodulin-1 is crucial to its functional versatility. CALM1 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm, where it is soluble yet can associate dynamically with various subcellular structures such as the cytoskeleton and spindle apparatus (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 2-4, Clinical Trial Search: 1fc52ed050b1). Numerous studies have shown that although calmodulin is ubiquitously distributed throughout the cytosol, it also transiently associates with membranes and specific organelles when engaged in targeted signaling events (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, tsai2021calmodulinopathyininherited pages 1-2). For example, during microbial infections, the interaction of the bacterial effector proteins with the apo form of calmodulin occurs at specific intracellular locales that are critical for modulating the host response (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1). Furthermore, calmodulin’s localization to the spindle during cell division indicates its role in ensuring proper microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal organization during mitosis (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 2-4). These observations underscore that CALM1 is not statically confined, but rather is dynamically distributed between the cytoplasm, membrane-associated complexes, and the cytoskeleton, which is essential for its multifarious roles in signal transduction and regulation of cellular architecture (Clinical Trial Search: 1fc52ed050b1, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5).

3. Biological Processes Involvement  
CALM1 is involved in a wide array of biological processes that are central to cellular physiology. The protein’s primary function is to mediate calcium-dependent signal transduction, which underpins processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, cell cycle progression, and gene expression regulation (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4). Through its ability to bind and sense calcium ions, calmodulin modulates the activity of enzyme complexes including Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and calcineurin, thereby impacting processes such as neuronal plasticity, cardiomyocyte contraction, and even aspects of cell differentiation (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5). Additionally, CALM1 participates in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis, acting as a buffer and transducer that ensures precise temporal and spatial control of calcium signals (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 5-7). In the context of microbial infection, CALM1 plays a unique role by serving as a cofactor for bacterial proteins such as CopC and OspC3, which exploit its calcium-binding properties to manipulate host cellular pathways, thus linking CALM1 function to host-pathogen interactions and innate immune responses (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, eno202114q32.11microdeletionincluding pages 14-23). Collectively, these roles highlight CALM1’s participation in essential cellular pathways that regulate not only basal cellular functions but also responses to external stress, infection, and developmental cues (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 8-9).

4. Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Mutations and dysregulation of CALM1 have been associated with a spectrum of human diseases, most notably calmodulinopathies that manifest as life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome (LQTS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, OpenTargets Search: -CALM1). These disorders often present in infancy or early childhood and are characterized by abnormal cardiac electrical activity, which can lead to sudden cardiac death (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3). Beyond the classical arrhythmic phenotypes, CALM1 mutations have also been implicated in neurological disorders and developmental anomalies, reflecting the protein’s ubiquitous expression and diverse regulatory roles in both the nervous system and cardiac tissue (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 4-5, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 25-27). In addition to these endogenous disease processes, the unique role of CALM1 in microbial infection pathogenesis has also potential clinical ramifications. For instance, the interaction between S. flexneri OspC proteins and calmodulin can influence the outcome of bacterial infections and may become a target for therapeutic intervention in cases where pathogens subvert host cell signaling (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2). The clinical heterogeneity observed in calmodulinopathies, which may include cardiac conduction abnormalities, arrhythmic syncope, and even structural heart defects, underscores the importance of precise genotype-phenotype correlation studies to inform both diagnostic and treatment strategies (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 12-13).

5. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
At the structural level, CALM1 encodes a small protein of 149 amino acids that is organized into two homologous globular domains (the N-terminal and the C-terminal lobes), each containing a pair of EF-hand motifs that form the calcium-binding sites (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 5-7). Each EF-hand motif consists of a helix-loop-helix structure whereby the loop region coordinates Ca²⁺ ions in a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry; this precise metal ion coordination is essential for triggering the conformational changes that allow calmodulin to interact with its downstream targets (tsai2021calmodulinopathyininherited pages 1-2, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5). Structural studies including high-resolution X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have revealed that the Ca²⁺-bound and Ca²⁺-free (apo) forms of calmodulin exhibit markedly different conformations, a feature that is key to its function as a regulatory switch (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 5-7). In the context of microbial infection, the interaction of bacterial effectors with the apo form of calmodulin is particularly significant because these proteins, such as S. flexneri OspC1 and OspC3, selectively bind calmodulin in its calcium-free state and thereby modulate its ability to bind calcium when needed (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 3-5). Moreover, the strict conservation of the EF-hand domains across species underscores their critical functional importance, and mutational analyses have demonstrated that even single amino acid substitutions in these domains can disrupt calcium affinity and lead to disease (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2).

6. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
CALM1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, a reflection of its indispensable role in fundamental cellular processes (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4). Expression analyses indicate particularly high levels in excitable tissues such as the heart and brain, where calcium signaling is critical for proper electrophysiological and synaptic function (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 4-5, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25). Transcriptional regulation of CALM1 is complex, involving multiple promoter elements and regulatory factors that ensure tight spatial and temporal control of its expression. In addition, post-translational modifications and controlled protein turnover further fine-tune the activity of calmodulin, ensuring that it is available in appropriate amounts in response to fluctuating intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5). Recent studies leveraging high-throughput RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics have provided additional detail regarding the distribution of CALM1 mRNA across diverse cell types, corroborating its widespread expression and underscoring its regulatory importance in both normal physiology and disease states (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 12-16). Furthermore, differential regulation of CALM1, compared with its paralogues CALM2 and CALM3, in various tissues emphasizes that despite encoding identical proteins, these genes may be subject to distinct regulatory networks that contribute to tissue-specific functions or compensatory mechanisms in disease (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 2-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 8-9).

7. Evolutionary Conservation  
One of the most striking features of CALM1 is its extraordinary evolutionary conservation. Calmodulin proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins known, with identical amino acid sequences encoded by the three separate genes CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 in Homo sapiens (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 25-27). This conservation extends across vertebrates and even into lower eukaryotes, underscoring the fundamental importance of calcium signaling in cellular physiology (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2). The conservation of the EF-hand motifs, in particular, highlights the critical nature of precise calcium binding for the proper function of calmodulin. Evolutionary studies have shown that mutations in these highly conserved residues are often deleterious and are linked to severe clinical phenotypes such as calmodulinopathy (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, nguyen2022longqtsyndrome pages 9-10). The maintenance of protein structure and function over evolutionary timescales not only reflects the protein’s essential cellular roles but also provides a robust framework for using comparative genomics to further elucidate its function in human disease (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 25-27).

8. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
A wealth of experimental evidence supports the multifaceted role of CALM1 in cellular signaling, disease, and microbial infection. Biochemical assays, including calcium-binding studies using spectroscopic methods, have delineated the precise affinities of each EF-hand domain for Ca²⁺ ions, revealing differential kinetics and capacities between the N- and C-lobes (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 5-7). Structural studies employing X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have provided detailed images of calmodulin in both its calcium-bound and apo conformations, elucidating the conformational shifts that underpin its role as a regulatory switch (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, tsai2021calmodulinopathyininherited pages 1-2). Functional analyses using site-directed mutagenesis in heterologous expression systems such as HEK293 cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have illuminated how specific mutations in CALM1 perturb calcium binding and downstream signaling, leading to arrhythmogenic phenotypes characteristic of calmodulinopathies (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 12-13). In the field of microbial infection, interaction assays have demonstrated that bacterial effector proteins, such as S. flexneri OspC1 and OspC3, bind preferentially to the apo form of calmodulin to inhibit its calcium-binding ability, thereby modulating host cell responses during infection (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 3-5). Moreover, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have contributed additional layers of evidence by mapping the broad tissue expression patterns of CALM1 and linking dysregulation of its expression to disease states including cardiac arrhythmias and neurological disorders (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 4-4). Collectively, these diverse experimental approaches—spanning structural biology, cell biology, electrophysiology, and clinical genetics—provide an integrated view of the essential functions of CALM1 and support its comprehensive annotation within the GO framework (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10).

In summary, the Homo sapiens CALM1 gene encodes calmodulin-1, a highly conserved, versatile calcium-binding protein that operates as a key intracellular sensor and signal transducer. By binding calcium through its EF-hand domains, CALM1 modulates a wide range of biological processes including ion channel regulation, muscle contraction, synaptic plasticity, cell cycle progression, and the host response to microbial infection. Its subcellular localization—predominantly in the cytoplasm with dynamic associations to the cytoskeleton and membrane compartments—enables it to function in varied cellular contexts. Mutations in CALM1 can lead to severe clinical phenotypes such as long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and other calmodulinopathies, reflecting its critical role in maintaining proper calcium homeostasis. Structurally, the protein is characterized by its two lobes, each comprising two EF-hand motifs, whose precision in calcium coordination is essential for downstream target regulation. Expression studies have consistently shown that CALM1 is ubiquitously expressed across tissues, with particularly high levels in excitable tissues like the heart and brain, while its regulatory mechanisms ensure that cellular calcium dynamics are tightly controlled. Evolutionary conservation of CALM1 across species underscores the fundamental role of calcium signaling in cellular physiology and provides a powerful context for functional studies. The integration of biochemical, structural, cellular, and clinical evidence provides a robust foundation for the GO annotation of CALM1, encompassing its molecular function (calcium ion binding and signal transduction), cellular component (cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and spindle), biological process (regulation of ion channels, muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and microbial infection response), and its role in human disease (arrhythmias and microbial pathogenesis) (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10).

This comprehensive body of evidence is critical not only for understanding the normal cellular roles of CALM1 but also for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which its dysfunction leads to disease. The added dimension of CALM1’s involvement in microbial infection, through its interaction with bacterial effectors such as OspC1 and OspC3, highlights its significance as an interface between host cell signaling and pathogen virulence strategies. Future research focused on the nuances of calmodulin-mediated signaling—especially in the context of dynamic subcellular localization, post-translational modifications, and tissue-specific regulation—will further refine our understanding of CALM1’s role in health and disease. Such studies will undoubtedly enhance the precision of GO annotations and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for calmodulin-linked conditions (kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 4-4, OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 12-13).

In conclusion, the diverse roles and robust conservation of calmodulin-1 underscore its importance as a master regulator of calcium signaling in human cells. Its involvement in critical cellular processes, as well as in disease states ranging from cardiac arrhythmias to microbial infections, positions CALM1 as a pivotal gene for detailed Gene Ontology curation. The integration of data from structural, functional, and clinical studies provides a comprehensive framework that supports updated and accurate annotations for CALM1, ensuring that its multifaceted roles are fully captured in genomic databases (OpenTargets Search: -CALM1, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 4-5, Clinical Trial Search: 1fc52ed050b1, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 9-10, kotta2018calmodulinopathyanovel pages 1-2).
