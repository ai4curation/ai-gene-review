## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P0DP23
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Calmodulin-1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:1442};
- **Gene Information:** Name=CALM1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:7925473, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:1442}; Synonyms=CALM, CAM, CAM1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the calmodulin family. .
- **Key Domains:** CALM/Myosin/TropC-like. (IPR050230); EF-hand-dom_pair. (IPR011992); EF_Hand_1_Ca_BS. (IPR018247); EF_hand_dom. (IPR002048); EF-hand_7 (PF13499)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CALM1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CALM1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CALM1** (gene ID: CALM1, UniProt: P0DP23) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein verification
- Identity and nomenclature: CALM1 (HGNC:1442) encodes human calmodulin-1, one of three human genes (CALM1, CALM2, CALM3) that produce an identical 149–amino acid calmodulin protein; the protein is a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor/adaptor rather than an enzyme or transporter (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Domains/family: Calmodulin belongs to the calmodulin family and contains four EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs arranged as two globular lobes (N- and C-lobes) connected by a flexible linker, fully consistent with EF-hand domain annotations in UniProt P0DP23 (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Organism: Homo sapiens is correct for CALM1 (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Calmodulin (CaM) is a 17-kDa, highly conserved, ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor that transduces intracellular Ca2+ signals by binding target proteins directly or activating Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Lobe biophysics: The two EF-hand lobes differ in Ca2+ affinity and kinetics, enabling temporal and spatial decoding of Ca2+ signals. Approximate lobe KDs (context/target dependent) reported in an authoritative 2023 review: C-lobe ~2.4 μM, N-lobe ~16 μM (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Mechanism of action: Ca2+ binding induces conformational changes in each lobe that expose hydrophobic surfaces to engage short linear motifs in targets (e.g., IQ motifs of voltage-gated channels); the N- and C-lobes can bind distinct segments to shape functional modulation, including Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of L-type Ca2+ channels (Jan 2023; May 2024) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25).

Subcellular localization and expression
- Localization: Calmodulin is predominantly cytosolic but dynamically localizes with its binding partners at the plasma membrane (e.g., CaV1.2), sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., RyR2), cytoskeleton and nucleus, reflecting its role as an adaptor in diverse signaling complexes (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Expression: Calmodulin is ubiquitously expressed. Brain analyses show high expression across neuronal cell types, with CALM1/2 transcripts detected in a majority of hippocampal cells in single-cell datasets and RNAscope confirmation of strong neuronal expression (May 22, 2024) (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12). All three genes contribute to total CaM, with developmentally increasing expression; the protein product is identical from CALM1–3 (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).

Biochemical functions and principal binding partners
- Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels: CaM constitutively associates with CaV1.2 (CACNA1C) via the IQ motif and mediates CDI; many pathogenic CALM variants (especially in the C-lobe) reduce Ca2+ affinity and impair CDI, producing gain-of-function CaV1.2 currents and arrhythmogenic phenotypes (Jan 2023; May 2024) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25).
- Ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2): CaM binds RyR2 and modulates its open probability at low and high Ca2+. The arrhythmia-associated CALM E105A mutation significantly weakens CaM binding to two high-affinity RyR2 CaM-binding regions in vitro (isothermal titration calorimetry), implicating disrupted CaM–RyR2 coupling in disease (Oct 2023) (thanassoulas2023arrhythmiaassociatedcalmoduline105a pages 13-14).
- Voltage-gated Na+ channels: Calmodulin interacts with NaV channels and contributes to gating regulation; together with dysregulated CaV1.2 and RyR2, NaV modulation is implicated broadly in calmodulinopathy pathophysiology (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Enzymatic signaling pathways: CaM directly activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (e.g., CaMKII/IV) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and the phosphatase calcineurin (driving NFAT signaling), and regulates certain adenylyl cyclase isoforms (e.g., AC6) as part of Ca2+–cAMP crosstalk (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).

Pathways and cellular roles
- Calmodulin integrates Ca2+ signals to regulate excitation–contraction coupling (via CaV1.2–RyR2 axis), membrane excitability (via CaV/NaV), cytoskeletal dynamics and contraction (via MLCK), and gene expression programs (via CaMKII/IV and calcineurin–NFAT), positioning CALM1 as a central adaptor in cardiac, neuronal, and immune pathways (Jan 2023; Oct 2023; May 2024) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2, thanassoulas2023arrhythmiaassociatedcalmoduline105a pages 13-14, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25).

Recent developments (2023–2024)
- International Calmodulinopathy Registry (ICalmR) update: The 2023 report assembled 140 CALM-positive patients (median age 10.8 years), with CALM-LQTS (53%) and CALM-CPVT (26%) predominant. Symptomatic patients experienced arrhythmic events in 74%. Compared with the 2019 cohort, the frequency of cardiac events fell from 85% to 61% (P = .001), and sudden death from 27% to 9% (P = .008). Neurological manifestations were present in a notable subset, and cardiomyopathy/congenital heart defects occurred in ~30% (Aug 2023; European Heart Journal) (https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad418) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3).
- Neuropsychiatric genetics: A 2024 large-scale sequencing study linked calmodulin C-lobe missense variants to schizophrenia risk. Among 24,248 cases and 97,322 controls, 7 carriers were found in cases and 20 in controls; all seven case variants localized to the C-lobe, with enrichment of C-lobe variation (Fisher P = 0.0009) and an adjusted OR ≈ 5.6 for C-lobe variants. Functional assays revealed two classes: loss-of-function variants reducing Ca2+ affinity and CaV1.2 interaction (LQTS-like), and gain-of-function variants with increased Ca2+ affinity but unchanged CaV1.2 gating, implying additional neuronal targets (May 22, 2024; medRxiv) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.22.24307674) (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 3-5, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12).
- Structural/biophysical insights for RyR2: The CALM E105A mutation significantly reduces binding of CaM to proposed RyR2 CaM-binding regions in both apo and Ca2+-bound states, supporting a model in which EF-hand perturbations alter target selectivity and RyR2 regulation (Oct 2023; IJMS) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115630) (thanassoulas2023arrhythmiaassociatedcalmoduline105a pages 13-14).

Current applications and real-world implementation
- Clinical genetics and risk stratification: CALM1–3 variant testing is part of channelopathy evaluation in LQTS/CPVT. Registry data emphasize early onset, high arrhythmic event rates, and pleiotropy (neurologic, structural) necessitating multidisciplinary management and family screening (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad418) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3).
- Management: Evidence remains insufficient for definitive guidelines; current practice employs pharmacologic and surgical antiadrenergic interventions, sodium channel blockers, and frequent use of implantable cardioverter–defibrillators for secondary prevention (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad418) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3).
- Research tools/models: Variant mechanistic studies leverage recombinant CaM biophysics, target peptide/channel binding, and electrophysiology to map target-specific dysfunction (CaV1.2 CDI defects; RyR2 dysregulation), informing variant interpretation and potential precision strategies (Jan 2023; Oct 2023; May 2024) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2, thanassoulas2023arrhythmiaassociatedcalmoduline105a pages 13-14, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Authoritative reviews underscore calmodulin’s centrality in Ca2+ signaling and the distinctive lobe-specific biophysics that underlie disease mechanisms; pathogenicity often tracks with C-lobe variants that impair Ca2+ binding and target regulation, especially of CaV1.2 and RyR2 in cardiomyocytes (Jan 2023) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- The 2023 registry analysis highlights the expanding phenotypic spectrum and suggests that earlier reports overrepresented the most severe cases; increased recognition of milder and familial forms is emerging, but therapeutic evidence is still limited (Aug 2023) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3).
- The 2024 schizophrenia work expands calmodulinopathy beyond cardiac disease, emphasizes C-lobe variant burden in CALM1/2, and proposes distinct mechanistic classes (loss- vs gain-of-function in Ca2+ binding), pointing to broader neuronal targets and the need for brain-specific functional studies (May 22, 2024) (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 3-5, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 22-25, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Lobe-specific Ca2+ affinity: C-lobe KD ≈ 2.4 μM; N-lobe KD ≈ 16 μM (context dependent) (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/19336950.2023.2165278) (hussey2023calmodulinmutationsin pages 1-2).
- Registry counts and outcomes: N = 140; symptomatic 74%; events reduced 85%→61% vs 2019; sudden death 27%→9% (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad418) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 3-4, crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3).
- Schizophrenia association: 7/24,248 cases vs 20/97,322 controls; C-lobe enrichment (Fisher P = 0.0009); adjusted OR ≈ 5.6 (Padj ≈ 0.043) (May 22, 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.22.24307674) (jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 10-12, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3).
- RyR2 binding perturbation: E105A CaM shows significantly reduced binding to two RyR2 CaM-binding peptides by ITC in apo and Ca2+-bound conditions (qualitative reported reduction) (Oct 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115630) (thanassoulas2023arrhythmiaassociatedcalmoduline105a pages 13-14).

Limitations and open questions
- Despite progress in genotype–mechanism mapping for LQTS/CPVT, therapeutic recommendations for CALM1–3 carriers are data-limited and individualized. The emergence of neuropsychiatric associations requires replication and mechanistic dissection of brain-specific targets beyond CaV1.2 (Aug 2023; May 2024) (crotti2023clinicalpresentationof pages 2-3, jensen2024calmodulinvariantsin pages 1-3).
