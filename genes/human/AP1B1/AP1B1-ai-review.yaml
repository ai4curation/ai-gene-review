description: >-
  AP1B1 encodes beta-1 adaptin (beta1-adaptin), one of four subunits of the heterotetrameric
  AP-1 adaptor protein complex. The AP-1 complex consists of beta1 (AP1B1), gamma (AP1G1/G2),
  mu1 (AP1M1/M2), and sigma1 (AP1S1/S2/S3) subunits. AP-1 is a clathrin-associated adaptor
  that functions at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes to mediate cargo sorting
  and clathrin-coated vesicle formation. The beta1 subunit contributes to coat assembly
  and recruits clathrin and accessory proteins. AP-1 recognizes tyrosine-based and dileucine
  sorting signals on cargo proteins, mediating bidirectional trafficking between the TGN
  and endosomes, including retrograde retrieval of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. In polarized
  epithelial cells, AP-1B (containing mu1B) facilitates basolateral sorting from recycling
  endosomes. Loss-of-function mutations cause KIDAR syndrome, associated with defective
  copper transporter trafficking.

    description: >-
      Beta-adaptins including beta1 directly bind clathrin through their hinge region,
      recruiting clathrin to form coated vesicles. Core molecular function of the AP-1 complex.
      PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of beta1 upon membrane recruitment enables clathrin
      assembly. Nearly 100% of AP-1 vesicles are clathrin-positive.

      label: phospholipid binding
    description: >-
      AP-1 recruitment to membranes requires coincidence detection of Arf1-GTP and
      the phosphoinositide PI(4)P. The gamma subunit recognizes PI(4)P through a binding
      site involving Tyr-45, Arg-48, and Lys-52. This phospholipid binding, together with
      Arf1 interaction at the beta1 N-terminus, determines TGN localization. AP-1 primarily
      mediates retrograde trafficking, retrieving proteins from post-Golgi compartments
      back to the TGN, including recycling of mannose-6-phosphate receptors.
