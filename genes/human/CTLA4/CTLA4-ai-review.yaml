description: >-
  CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, CD152) encodes a type I transmembrane
  inhibitory co-receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. CTLA4 contains an extracellular
  Ig-like V-type domain that binds B7 family ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on
  antigen-presenting cells with higher avidity than the stimulatory co-receptor CD28, thereby
  competitively inhibiting T cell co-stimulation at the priming phase (PMID:11279501,
  PMID:11279502). CTLA4 functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Its surface expression
  is tightly regulated by constitutive clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycling; at steady
  state it resides largely in intracellular vesicles (Golgi, endosomes, perinuclear region),
  with surface expression induced upon T cell activation. CTLA4 is constitutively expressed
  on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it mediates suppressive function including
  trans-endocytosis of CD80/CD86 from dendritic cells (CTLA4-deep-research-falcon.md). The
  cytoplasmic tail contains a YVKM motif whose phosphorylation at Tyr-201 by TXK and JAK2
  regulates AP-2 binding and endocytic trafficking. Haploinsufficiency causes IDAIL (immune
  dysregulation with autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and lymphoproliferation), and common
  variants confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, Graves disease, celiac disease, and SLE.
  Anti-CTLA4 antibodies (ipilimumab, tremelimumab) are used in cancer immunotherapy; CTLA4-Ig
  fusions (abatacept, belatacept) are used to treat autoimmunity and prevent transplant
  rejection.

      CTLA4 is detected on the external side of the plasma membrane of T cells upon
      activation. IBA annotation is supported by phylogenetic inference from CTLA4 orthologs
      including mouse Ctla4 and human CD28. Multiple experimental studies confirm CTLA4
      surface expression, including flow cytometry studies (PMID:18641304) and structural
      studies showing the extracellular domain in complex with B7 ligands (PMID:11279501,
      PMID:11279502). UniProt notes CTLA4 is a cell membrane single-pass type I membrane
      protein with regulated surface expression. The deep research report
      (CTLA4-deep-research-falcon.md) confirms CTLA4 resides largely in intracellular
      vesicles at steady state with regulated surface expression.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for negative regulation of Treg differentiation. CTLA4 is constitutively
      expressed on Tregs and plays complex roles in Treg biology. PMID:18641304 showed that
      activated CD4+CD25- T cells acquiring CTLA4 expression gain suppressive capacity,
      suggesting CTLA4 may regulate the threshold for Treg-like function. CTLA4 haploinsufficiency
      leads to dysregulated Treg function. However, CTLA4 is also required for Treg suppressive
      function, so its role in negatively regulating Treg differentiation is nuanced. The IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically supported and consistent with the IDA annotation from
      PMID:18641304.

    summary: >-
      CTLA4 is a key modulator of T cell receptor signaling. It competes with CD28 for
      B7 ligand binding to attenuate TCR-dependent T cell activation (PMID:11279501,

      negative regulator of T cell proliferation. The neutral "regulation" rather than
      "negative regulation" is acceptable for an IEA, though the more specific term
      GO:0042130 (negative regulation of T cell proliferation) is also present via Ensembl

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct. CTLA4 is a major regulator (specifically negative regulator) of T cell
      proliferation. The broader "regulation" term is acceptable for an InterPro-derived
      IEA since the family includes both CD28 (positive) and CTLA4 (negative).

      IDA for perinuclear region of cytoplasm localization. CTLA4 is known to accumulate
      in intracellular compartments, including the perinuclear region, at steady state due
      to constitutive endocytosis. UniProt notes CTLA4 "exists primarily as an intracellular

    label: signaling receptor inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:11279501
  review:
    summary: >-
      CTLA4 functions as an inhibitor of CD28 signaling receptor activity by competitively
      binding B7 ligands (CD80/CD86) with higher avidity, preventing CD28 from receiving
      co-stimulatory signals. This is a core molecular function. GO:0030547 is defined as
      "Binds to and modulates the activity of a signaling receptor" -- CTLA4 modulates
      CD28 activity by sequestering its ligands.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This molecular function term more accurately describes how CTLA4 functionally
      inhibits CD28 signaling. While receptor decoy activity (GO:0140319) captures the
      ligand sequestration, signaling receptor inhibitor activity captures the functional
      consequence on CD28. Together these provide a more complete picture of CTLA4
      molecular function than the generic "protein binding" annotations currently in place.
