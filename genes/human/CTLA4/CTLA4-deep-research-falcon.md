## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P16410
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4; AltName: Full=Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4; Short=CTLA-4; AltName: CD_antigen=CD152; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CTLA4; Synonyms=CD152;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** CTLA4. (IPR008096); CTLA4/CD28. (IPR040216); Ig-like_dom_sf. (IPR036179); Ig-like_fold. (IPR013783); Ig_sub. (IPR003599)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CTLA4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CTLA4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CTLA4** (gene ID: CTLA4, UniProt: P16410) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human CTLA4 (UniProt P16410), encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA‑4/CD152), an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor with an Ig-like V-set extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The gene symbol CTLA4 matches the protein description; the organism is Homo sapiens; and the domain architecture (Ig-like fold) aligns with literature that treats CTLA‑4 as an Ig superfamily receptor regulating CD80/CD86–CD28 co‑stimulation (review context) (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9, tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains: CTLA‑4 is an inhibitory co‑receptor on T cells with an extracellular Ig-like V-set domain that binds B7 ligands CD80 (B7‑1) and CD86 (B7‑2), outcompeting CD28; a transmembrane helix; and a cytoplasmic tail that regulates endocytosis/trafficking. It is constitutively expressed by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and induced on activated conventional T cells (expert reviews) (https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2024.00136, Apr 2024) (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9); (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1279201, Oct 2023) (tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).
- Mechanism of action: CTLA‑4 inhibits T‑cell activation primarily by binding CD80/CD86 with higher avidity than CD28, thereby limiting “signal 2” co‑stimulation and inducing tolerance/anergy at the priming phase in lymphoid tissues (review) (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9). In Tregs, CTLA‑4 mediates suppression of antigen‑presenting cells (APCs) by removing CD80/CD86 from dendritic cells via trans‑endocytosis/trogocytosis and by limiting DC maturation; surface CTLA‑4 is dynamically regulated by rapid endocytosis and recycling (mechanistic preprint and PIRD review) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.01.569613, Dec 2023) (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31); (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1279201, Oct 2023) (tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).
- Cellular and subcellular localization/regulation: CTLA‑4 resides largely in intracellular vesicles at steady state due to constitutive clathrin‑mediated endocytosis; recycling to the surface (e.g., after TCR stimulation) is regulated by LRBA and Rab11 pathways. DEF6 mutations impair Rab11‑mediated CTLA‑4 trafficking; LRBA deficiency increases lysosomal degradation of CTLA‑4, reducing its surface availability (mechanistic review and cohort analyses) (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6, tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).
- Role in Treg biology: FoxP3+ Tregs constitutively express high CTLA‑4 and use it, together with IL‑10, to restrict DC costimulation (down‑modulating CD80/CD86 and MHC‑II), enforcing peripheral tolerance. An IL‑2 mutein that preferentially expands Tregs increased IL‑10 and CTLA‑4‑dependent suppression of DCs, functionally enhancing CTLA‑4–mediated control (mechanistic advance) (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- CTLA‑4 pathway genetics and modifiers: Recent reviews and cohorts reaffirm CTLA‑4 haploinsufficiency as a Tregopathy presenting with variable autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and hypogammaglobulinemia; overlapping LRBA deficiency reflects LRBA’s role in protecting CTLA‑4 from lysosomal degradation; DEF6 affects CTLA‑4 recycling (review, Oct 2023) (tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9). A 2024–2025 stream of case/series reports further illustrate variant heterogeneity and phenotype breadth, including neurologic and hematologic autoimmunity, and discuss targeted therapy with abatacept (Frontiers in Immunology, Nov 2025; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1665184) (chen2025anovelctla4 pages 9-9) and a 2025 J Clin Immunol report on a pathogenic ligand‑binding‑region variant (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-025-01960-5) (sormani2025anewvariant pages 1-2).
- Treg‑centric mechanistic advance: An Fc‑fused IL‑2 mutein expanded activated Tregs with high CTLA‑4 and IL‑10, limiting DC maturation (reduced MHC‑II upregulation) and promoting CTLA‑4–dependent trans‑endocytosis of CD80/CD86; in NOD mice this induced T‑cell anergy and controlled local inflammation (bioRxiv, Dec 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.01.569613) (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31).
- LRBA deficiency and abatacept: A 2024 longitudinal cohort of LRBA‑deficient patients showed profoundly reduced Helios+ natural/naïve Tregs at baseline, with significant increases and clinical improvement during abatacept (CTLA‑4‑Ig) therapy, supporting restoration of CTLA‑4 pathway function (bioRxiv, Feb 2024; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.10.579765) (donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 12-15).
- CTLA‑4 blockade in oncology—HCC: A 2024 peer‑reviewed synthesis details 48‑month updates of the phase 3 HIMALAYA trial of the STRIDE regimen (single priming dose tremelimumab + durvalumab q4w) in unresectable/advanced HCC, confirming sustained OS benefit and characterizing immune‑mediated toxicities (Targeted Oncology, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-023-01026-9) (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8).
- Real‑world STRIDE outcomes: A 2023–2024 multicenter Japanese cohort (n=120) reported objective response and safety of durvalumab+tremelimumab in practice, with predictors of discontinuation highlighting hepatic function and age (Oncology Letters, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2024.14530) (shimose2024initialclinicalexperience pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Immune checkpoint inhibition—cancer care
  • Tremelimumab (anti‑CTLA‑4) within STRIDE for unresectable/advanced HCC: Phase 3 HIMALAYA demonstrated median OS 16.43 months for STRIDE vs 13.77 with sorafenib (HR 0.78, 96.02% CI 0.65–0.93); 36‑month OS 30.7% vs 20.2%. ORR 20.1% vs 5.1% with sorafenib; median PFS was similar (3.78 vs 4.07 months). Benefits persisted at 48 months, and health‑state/QOL outcomes favored STRIDE. Immune‑mediated AEs were more frequent with STRIDE, but grade 3–4 TRAEs and discontinuations were not higher than sorafenib in some analyses (Targeted Oncology review, Jan 2024) (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-023-01026-9 (published Jan 2024).
  • Real‑world Durvalumab+Tremelimumab (STRIDE‑like) in HCC: In 120 patients treated Mar 2023–Jan 2024, ORR 15.8%, DCR 53.3%, median PFS 3.9 months; any‑grade AEs 83.3%, grade ≥3 AEs 36.7%, with liver injury most frequent. First‑line use had higher DCR than later lines (65.8% vs 45.9%) (Oncology Letters, Jun 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2024.14530 (shimose2024initialclinicalexperience pages 1-2).
- Co‑stimulation blockade—autoimmunity and transplantation
  • Abatacept (CTLA‑4‑Ig): Approved for multiple autoimmune indications; binds CD80/CD86 to block CD28 co‑stimulation, inducing tolerance. A 2024 review summarizes mechanism, benefits, and next‑generation CTLA‑4‑Ig variants with higher CD80/86 affinity and longer half‑life; belatacept (higher CD86/CD80 affinity) is highlighted in kidney transplantation (Exploration of Immunology, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2024.00136) (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9). In LRBA deficiency, abatacept increased circulating FoxP3+Helios+ natural Tregs and improved clinical measures in a 2024 longitudinal cohort (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.10.579765) (donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 12-15).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources (2023–2024)
- PIRD/Tregopathy consensus framing: A 2023 Frontiers in Immunology review outlines CTLA‑4 haploinsufficiency, LRBA and DEF6 as a mechanistic spectrum of Tregopathies, emphasizing variable immunophenotypes and shared pathophysiology via CTLA‑4 trafficking and surface expression (Oct 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1279201) (tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).
- Dendritic cell/co‑stimulation targeting in autoimmunity: A 2024 review synthesizes strategies to induce antigen‑specific tolerance and pharmacologic CD80/86 blockade, highlighting clinical experience with abatacept/belatacept and investigational enhanced CTLA‑4‑Ig constructs (Apr 2024) (https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2024.00136) (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9).
- HCC immunotherapy perspective: A 2024 tremelimumab review synthesizes HIMALAYA efficacy, long‑term OS maintenance, safety, health‑related quality‑of‑life outcomes, and comparative evidence versus atezolizumab+bevacizumab (Jan 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-023-01026-9) (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- HIMALAYA (STRIDE) key outcomes (advanced/unresectable HCC):
  • Median OS 16.43 months with STRIDE vs 13.77 with sorafenib (HR 0.78, 96.02% CI 0.65–0.93); 36‑month OS 30.7% vs 20.2%; ORR 20.1% vs 5.1%; median DOR 22.34 months; PFS ~3.78 vs 4.07 months; piecewise HR 0.87 (0–9 mo) and 0.70 (>9 mo). Immune‑mediated AEs with STRIDE ~34.5%; grade 3–4 TRAEs ~25.8%; TRAE‑related deaths ~2.3% (Targeted Oncology review, Jan 2024; includes 48‑month update) (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8). URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-023-01026-9.
- Real‑world Dur/Tre (Japan, 120 patients, 2023–2024): ORR 15.8%, DCR 53.3%; median PFS 3.9 months; any‑grade AEs 83.3%, grade ≥3 AEs 36.7%; first‑line DCR 65.8% vs 45.9% later‑line; liver injury most frequent AE; poor liver function and age predicted AE‑driven discontinuation (Oncology Letters, Jun 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2024.14530 (shimose2024initialclinicalexperience pages 1-2).
- Co‑stimulation blockade pharmacology: Belatacept exhibits stronger binding to CD86 (~4×) and CD80 (~2×) relative to abatacept, aligning with its potency in transplant settings; newer CTLA‑4‑Ig variants aim for higher avidity and prolonged exposure (Exploration of Immunology, Apr 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2024.00136 (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9).
- Treg mechanistic modulation (preclinical, 2023): IL‑2 mutein expanded CTLA‑4hi, IL‑10hi Tregs that suppressed DCs by CTLA‑4–dependent trans‑endocytosis of CD80/CD86 and limited MHC‑II upregulation; promoted T‑cell anergy in NOD mice (bioRxiv Dec 2023). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.01.569613 (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31).
- LRBA deficiency clinical immunology (2024): Marked baseline reductions in Helios+ natural and naïve Tregs with recovery toward age‑matched norms under abatacept; improved disease activity indices and sIL‑2R reductions in many patients; some proceeded to allo‑HSCT for durable remission (bioRxiv Feb 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.10.579765 (donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 12-15).

Therapeutic implications and pathway placement
- CTLA‑4 functions at the priming phase by setting the CD80/86–CD28 activation threshold on APCs. In cancer, anti‑CTLA‑4 antibodies (tremelimumab, ipilimumab) release this brake, augmenting T‑cell priming and diversification; STRIDE demonstrates survival benefit in HCC with manageable immune‑mediated toxicity (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8). In autoimmunity and Tregopathies (CTLA4 haploinsufficiency, LRBA deficiency), CTLA‑4 insufficiency promotes unchecked co‑stimulation; co‑stimulation blockade with CTLA‑4‑Ig (abatacept) restores tolerance mechanisms and improves immunologic/clinical parameters (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6, tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9).

Notes on evidence strength and gaps
- Several mechanistic insights (IL‑2 mutein/Treg augmentation) are preclinical or preprint and should be validated clinically (jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31). Genetic cohort details and variant reports in 2025 extend 2023–2024 themes but are post‑2024; they substantiate heterogeneity and targeted therapy rationale (chen2025anovelctla4 pages 9-9, sormani2025anewvariant pages 1-2). Oncology efficacy statistics for HIMALAYA/STRIDE are from peer‑reviewed 2024 synthesis of a pivotal phase 3 trial and are robust (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8). Real‑world HCC Dur/Tre data (Japan) provide external validity with expected safety patterns in cirrhotic populations (shimose2024initialclinicalexperience pages 1-2). Co‑stimulation‑targeting reviews summarize approved agents and next‑gen constructs (jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9).

Conclusion
CTLA‑4 (human CTLA4, UniProt P16410) is a canonical Ig‑superfamily inhibitory receptor that enforces early checkpoint control of T‑cell priming via high‑avidity binding to CD80/CD86 and Treg‑mediated trans‑endocytosis of these ligands. Its biology is tightly regulated by intracellular trafficking machinery (LRBA, Rab11; modulated by DEF6), with insufficiency causing a Tregopathy marked by autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation. Therapeutically, anti‑CTLA‑4 antibodies improve survival in selected cancers (e.g., HIMALAYA/STRIDE in HCC), while CTLA‑4‑Ig (abatacept/belatacept) leverages co‑stimulation blockade to treat autoimmunity and prevent rejection. Emerging 2023–2024 data refine clinical efficacy/safety benchmarks in HCC and provide mechanistic avenues—such as IL‑2 muteins—to potentiate CTLA‑4–dependent Treg function. These advances collectively support precise, pathway‑directed use of CTLA‑4 modulators across oncology, autoimmunity, and transplantation (france2024tremelimumabareview pages 4-5, france2024tremelimumabareview pages 7-8, shimose2024initialclinicalexperience pages 1-2, jamal2024dendriticcelland pages 7-9, tsilifis2023toomuchof pages 8-9, jamison2023anil2mutein pages 28-31, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 8-12, donhauser2024abatacepttreatmentin pages 1-6).
