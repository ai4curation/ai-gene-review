description: ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C2 is a paralog of ATP5MC1 that encodes
  an identical 51-amino acid mature protein forming the proton-conducting c-ring rotor
  of mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V). ATP5MC3 is one of three paralogous genes
  (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC3, ATP5MC3) distinguished only by different mitochondrial targeting
  sequences in the precursor proteins. The mature protein oligomerizes into a homooctamer
  (8-subunit c-ring) with each subunit adopting a hairpin conformation of two transmembrane
  α-helices. A conserved glutamic acid (Glu-59) serves as the proton-binding site
  driving directional rotation in response to proton flow through half-channels at
  the rotor-stator interface with subunit a (MT-ATP6). This rotation drives conformational
  changes in the F₁ catalytic domain, coupling the proton gradient to ATP synthesis.
  The three paralogous genes provide functional redundancy with potential tissue-specific
  expression differences. All structural and functional properties described for ATP5MC1
  apply identically to ATP5MC3.
