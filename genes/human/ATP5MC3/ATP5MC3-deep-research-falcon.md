- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATPase C chain family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATP_synth_F0_csu. (IPR000454); ATP_synth_F0_csu_DDCD_BS. (IPR020537); ATP_synth_F0_csu_sf. (IPR038662); ATPase_proteolipid_c-like_dom. (IPR002379); F/V-ATP_Csub_sf. (IPR035921)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5MC3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5MC3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5MC3** (gene ID: ATP5MC3, UniProt: P48201) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human ATP5MC3 (ATP5G3; UniProt P48201) – Fo subunit c3 of mitochondrial ATP synthase

Identity verification and context
- Gene/protein identity: ATP5MC3 (synonym ATP5G3) encodes a proteolipid subunit c (subunit C3) of the Fo rotor ring (c-ring) in the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase of Homo sapiens. This subunit is an inner mitochondrial membrane proteolipid of the ATPase C chain family and confers oligomycin sensitivity, consistent with UniProt P48201 and standard mitochondrial ATP synthase architecture (inner membrane localization, Fo-F1 coupling) (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Structural role: Subunit c is a small hydrophobic proteolipid that oligomerizes into the c-ring rotor within the Fo domain of ATP synthase. In mammals, the Fo c-ring is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and couples proton translocation to rotation of the central rotor, driving ATP synthesis in F1 (α3β3 catalytic head) (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL and date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Core mechanism: Protons traverse half-channels at the a–c interface; protonation/deprotonation of a conserved acidic residue on each c subunit drives stepwise rotation of the c-ring. A full 360° rotation of the rotor-catalytic axis yields three ATP molecules at the F1 catalytic sites (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL and date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Human/mammalian c-ring stoichiometry: Recent reviews summarizing structural work concur that the mammalian mitochondrial Fo c-ring contains eight c subunits (c8) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Updated overviews of inhibitors and safety: A 2023 review consolidated ATP synthase inhibitor classes, reaffirming oligomycin sensitivity as a defining property of mitochondrial Fo via subunit c, with broader discussion of inhibitor toxicities and real-world implications (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, althaher2023anoverviewof pages 15-15). URL/date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459.
- c-ring and permeability transition: Contemporary analyses in model systems continue to evaluate the c-ring’s proposed involvement in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), with the c-ring implicated in Ca2+-activated permeability changes and dimer stabilization dependencies; these mechanistic themes remain under active study (panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URL/date: Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Pharmacology and tool compounds: Oligomycin binding to Fo (subunit c) remains a widely used tool to acutely inhibit ATP synthase proton translocation/rotation, enabling functional dissection of oxidative phosphorylation in cells and tissues (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4). URL/date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459.
- Bioenergetic diagnostics/interventions: Reviews emphasize the practical use of ATP synthase inhibitors to probe OXPHOS capacity and to model pathophysiology; conversely, inhibitor toxicities underscore the need for selectivity and context-aware dosing (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4). URL/date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459.
- Disease-focused c-ring/mPTP research: Experimental work in yeast and comparative systems targeting small supernumerary ATP synthase subunits that modulate dimerization and permeability transition informs strategies to manipulate permeability and apoptosis-related pathways (panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URL/date: Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

4) Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Authoritative reviews converge on a mechanistic model where the c8-ring of mammalian Fo transduces proton motive force into rotary torque that is transmitted via the central stalk to F1, producing three ATP per full turn; the oligomycin-sensitive Fo rotor (subunit c assembly) is the critical energy-conserving element of the motor (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Ongoing debate and investigation continue around the structural basis of the mPTP and the extent to which the c-ring participates, with recent interactome studies in yeast underscoring the influence of small associated subunits on permeability and dimer stability—an area of translational interest but with species-specific complexities (panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URL/date: Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- c-ring stoichiometry in mammals: c8 (eight copies of subunit c per ring) (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- ATP per full rotation: Three ATP formed per 360° rotor turn (F1 catalytic cycle), implying approximately 8 protons per 3 ATP in humans (≈2.7 H+/ATP) given c8 (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URLs/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.

Detailed functional annotation of ATP5MC3
- Primary function: ATP5MC3 encodes one of the proteolipid subunits that polymerize into the Fo c-ring rotor. Each c subunit provides a conserved acidic side chain (typically glutamate or aspartate) that transiently binds a proton at the a–c interface, enabling electrostatic and hydration changes that drive ring rotation. Protonation/deprotonation cycles across ring subunits propagate rotational steps that, through the central shaft, induce conformational changes in F1 for ATP synthesis. The subunit c ring is the binding locus for oligomycin-class inhibitors that block rotation by engaging c subunits within Fo (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URLs/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Substrate/transport specificity: The Fo–c-ring conducts H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane through coupled protonation events at the a/c interface; no other physiological substrates are transported by the c subunits. The c-ring is thus dedicated to proton translocation coupled to rotary catalysis (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Cellular localization: Inner mitochondrial membrane, Fo sector of ATP synthase; participates in oxidative phosphorylation and, potentially, in permeability transition phenomena under stress (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URLs/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

Isoforms, redundancy/specificity, and human variant data
- Isoforms in humans: The mitochondrial c proteolipid is encoded by a small nuclear gene family with multiple paralogs (ATP5MC1–3); ATP5MC3 is one of these paralogs that contribute subunits to the c-ring. Clinical review literature surveying isolated ATP synthase defects includes discussion of ATP5MC3 as the gene for subunit c, consistent with isoform redundancy within the c-ring in humans (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Reported ATP5MC3 variants: The 2024 clinical review compiles structural-gene mutations across ATP synthase, noting reported ATP5MC3 variants (e.g., a c.318C>G substitution), though such cases are rare compared with MT-ATP6/8 and assembly-factor mutations; phenotypes are heterogeneous and severe when present (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.

Oligomycin binding and pharmacology
- Oligomycin binding: Oligomycin classically binds within Fo to the c subunits, blocking rotation and ATP synthesis; oligomycin sensitivity is a defining feature of mitochondrial ATP synthase and is routinely used experimentally to probe OXPHOS capacity (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4). URL/date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459.

Pathways and systems context
- Biochemical pathway: ATP5MC3 functions within oxidative phosphorylation (Complexes I–IV generate proton motive force; Fo–F1 uses pmf to synthesize ATP). The c-ring rotor is the energy-conserving element linking proton flow to mechanical rotation and catalysis (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URLs/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Permeability transition: Experimental analyses (yeast and comparative) implicate ATP synthase components—including the c-ring and small supernumerary subunits—in Ca2+-activated permeability transition; while human-specific molecular determinants remain debated, these findings frame ongoing translational efforts to modulate cell death pathways (panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URL/date: Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

Disease links and clinical relevance
- Rarity and phenotype spectrum: Isolated ATP synthase defects are rare but severe; most frequently involve MT-ATP6 or assembly factors, yet structural nuclear subunits including the c subunit gene ATP5MC3 have been reported with pathogenic variants in isolated cases, causing heterogeneous neuro-metabolic presentations (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URL/date: Physiological Research (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- mPTP and apoptosis/necrosis: The c-ring’s potential role in mPTP formation or regulation suggests that modulating c-ring interactions or ATP synthase dimerization could influence susceptibility to permeability transition and cell death, informing strategies in ischemia-reperfusion and oncology (panja2023atpsynthaseinteractome pages 1-2). URL/date: Scientific Reports (Mar 2023): https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30966-5.

- H+/ATP: ≈8 protons per 3 ATP per full turn; ≈2.7 H+ per ATP synthesized (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4, tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3). URLs/dates: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459; Physiol Res (Aug 2024): https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.935407.
- Oligomycin sensitivity: hallmark inhibitor of Fo, targeting c subunits to block proton-driven rotation (althaher2023anoverviewof pages 2-4). URL/date: Heliyon (Nov 2023): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22459.

Notes on evidence scope
- Literature directly dissecting ATP5MC3 isoform-specific biology in humans is limited; the most authoritative recent clinical review catalogs ATP synthase defects and includes ATP5MC3 among structural subunits implicated in rare cases. Where isoform redundancy and precise variant interpretation are concerned, up-to-date clinical-genetics databases and case series should be consulted alongside the review (tauchmannova2024variabilityofclinical pages 1-3).
