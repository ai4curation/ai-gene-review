# ATP5MC3 Gene Review Notes

## Key Point: Third Paralog - Identical Mature Protein

**ATP5MC3** is the third of three paralogous genes (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, ATP5MC3) encoding the **identical 51-amino acid mature protein** - subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase.

**See ATP5MC1-notes.md for comprehensive functional details** - all information applies identically to ATP5MC3.

## Gene-Specific Information

- **UniProt ID:** P48201
- **Aliases:** ATP5G3, ATPase subunit c, Proteolipid P3
- **Chromosome:** Differs from ATP5MC1 (chr 17) and ATP5MC2 (chr 12)
- **Precursor length:** Varies from ATP5MC1/2 in targeting sequence
- **Mature protein:** 51 amino acids - **IDENTICAL to ATP5MC1 and ATP5MC2**

## Functional Summary

All functional annotations for ATP5MC1 apply identically to ATP5MC3:
- Forms c-ring rotor (8-subunit homooctamer)
- Proton channel activity via Glu-59
- Couples proton gradient to ATP synthesis
- Binds cardiolipin
- Can form mPTP under stress
- Participates in cristae organization

## Annotation Strategy

Identical to ATP5MC2 - all functional annotations accepted as for ATP5MC1.
The three paralogs provide functional redundancy with potential tissue-specific expression regulation.
