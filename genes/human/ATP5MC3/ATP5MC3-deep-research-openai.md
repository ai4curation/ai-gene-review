## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene ATP5MC3 (P48201) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# ATP5MC3 (P48201) – Mitochondrial ATP Synthase Subunit c in Human

## Gene and Protein Overview  
ATP5MC3 (also known by the older symbol **ATP5G3**) encodes one of the proteolipid subunits of mitochondrial **F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase** (Complex V) in humans ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,subunits%20is%20part%20of%20the)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=During%20respiration%2C%20adenosine%20triphosphate%20,of%20the%20complex%20that%20explained)). F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, using the electrochemical proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=the%20intermediate%20electron%20carriers%20quinone,Pi)). The ATP5MC3 gene product is commonly referred to as **subunit c of the F<sub>o</sub> sector** of ATP synthase, and is a member of the conserved ATP synthase **C chain (proteolipid)** family ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=AT5G3_HUMAN%20%3A)). This subunit is an essential component of the enzyme’s rotary motor that **couples proton translocation to ATP production**, thereby playing a critical role in cellular energy metabolism ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=During%20respiration%2C%20adenosine%20triphosphate%20,of%20the%20complex%20that%20explained)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). 

**Subunit c** is a **small hydrophobic protein** localized to the **inner mitochondrial membrane** as part of the F<sub>o</sub> complex ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). It consists of ~75 amino acids that fold into **two transmembrane α-helices** connected by a short loop, forming a hairpin structure within the membrane ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). Notably, subunit c contains a **highly conserved acidic residue** (Aspartate or Glutamate) roughly midway in one of the helices ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). This conserved Asp/Glu is critical for **proton binding and translocation**, as it accepts and releases protons during the enzyme’s operation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). In fact, protonation of this site and its interaction with a complementary charged residue in subunit a are key to the **mechanochemical coupling** that drives ATP synthesis (discussed below).

## F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP Synthase Complex and Subunit Composition  
Mitochondrial ATP synthase is a large multi-subunit complex divided into two functional domains: **F<sub>1</sub>**, the catalytic ATP-producing sector, and **F<sub>o</sub>**, the membrane-embedded proton-conducting sector ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=Mitochondrial%20membrane%20ATP%20synthase%20,subunits%20is%20part%20of%20the)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=During%20respiration%2C%20adenosine%20triphosphate%20,of%20the%20complex%20that%20explained)). The F<sub>1</sub> domain resides in the mitochondrial matrix and is composed of five different subunits (α<sub>3</sub>, β<sub>3</sub>, γ, δ, ε) that form a soluble **α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γδε** complex where ATP is synthesized ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=protons%20across%20the%20inner%20membrane,sequences%20but%20encode%20the%20identical)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=the%20peripheral%20stalk,expose%20the%20central%20%CE%B3%20subunit)). The F<sub>o</sub> domain is embedded in the **inner mitochondrial membrane** and includes the proton channel and rotor/stator elements: major subunits of F<sub>o</sub> are **subunit a** (also called ATP6 in mitochondria), **subunit b** (part of the peripheral stalk), **subunit c** (the proteolipid ring), and several smaller **“supernumerary” subunits** such as d, e, f, g, F6 (OSCP), DAPIT, and 6.8PL ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20Jun%202010)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=Black%20horizontal%20lines%20represent%20the,8)). In total, the **human ATP synthase** consists of *18 distinct protein subunits* (encoded by separate genes) present in a roughly 29-polypeptide assemblage with a total mass of ~590 kDa ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=force%20,14)). Two of the F<sub>o</sub>-sector components (subunit **a/ATP6** and subunit **A6L/ATP8**) are **encoded by mitochondrial DNA**, while all the other subunits – including subunit c – are **nuclear-encoded**, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the mitochondria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=The%20ATP%20synthase%20in%20human,c_%7B8%7D%20complex%20inhibited%20by%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=ATP6%20and%20ATP8%20are%20encoded,subunit%20c%2C%20an%20incomplete%20ATP)). 

**Subunit c** (the ATP5MC3 gene product) is a **core component of the F<sub>o</sub> proton channel**. Multiple copies of subunit c assemble into a **ring-shaped oligomer (the c-ring)** within the inner membrane ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). In mammals, the c-ring is composed of **8 identical subunit c protomers** arranged in a ring (c<sub>8</sub>) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). (For comparison, yeast ATP synthase has 10 c subunits per ring, c<sub>10</sub>, and bacterial ATP synthases range from 9 to 15 c subunits, reflecting an evolutionary variation in stoichiometry ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)).) The c-ring forms the **rotor** of the F<sub>o</sub> motor: it can spin within the membrane relative to the stationary subunit a and peripheral stalk. Each subunit c in the ring is positioned such that its conserved Asp/Glu faces the interface with **subunit a (ATP6)**, which provides access to protons from either side of the membrane ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). Subunit a contains two half-channels – one open to the intermembrane space and one to the matrix – and as the c-ring rotates past subunit a, each c subunit’s acidic residue sequentially binds a proton in the intermembrane-space half-channel and releases a proton into the matrix half-channel ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). In this way, the ring of c subunits and subunit a together form a **proton translocation pathway** across the membrane.

Importantly, **ATP5MC3 is one of three human genes that encode the c subunit**. The paralogous genes **ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2, and ATP5MC3** (historically named ATP5G1, ATP5G2, ATP5G3, respectively) each produce a version of subunit c with an *identical mature amino acid sequence* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=518#:~:text=seems%20to%20have%20nine%20subunits,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). These genes differ in their regulatory regions and the **mitochondrial targeting presequences** of the precursor proteins, but after import and proteolytic processing inside mitochondria, the mature **≈75-amino-acid** subunit c peptides are identical and interchangeable ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=518#:~:text=seems%20to%20have%20nine%20subunits,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). This redundancy ensures a robust supply of subunit c; all three loci contribute to the pool of c subunits that assemble into the oligomeric c-ring. (Each subunit c precursor includes an **N-terminal mitochondrial import signal** that is cleaved off in the matrix, so that only the conserved hydrophobic core remains in the assembled complex ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=518#:~:text=seems%20to%20have%20nine%20subunits,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)).) Because the protein is extremely hydrophobic, subunit c is sometimes referred to as the **“ATP synthase proteolipid”**, and was historically designated as **subunit 9** in earlier studies of the mitochondrial ATPase complex ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=proteolipid%20and%20they%20specify%20precursors,Batten%20disease)). 

## Localization and Structural Features  
The ATP5MC3 protein (subunit c) localizes to the **inner membrane of mitochondria**, embedded within the lipid bilayer as part of the F<sub>o</sub> sector of complex V ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). Both the N- and C-termini of the mature subunit c face the **mitochondrial matrix**, with the protein forming a hairpin-shaped **transmembrane loop** (two membrane-spanning helices connected by a short loop) in the lipid phase ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). The subunit’s **conserved acidic residue** (in human ATP5MC3 this corresponds to a glutamic acid in the mature peptide) is located roughly in the middle of the second transmembrane helix, exactly at the position to interact with protons in the membrane-spanning channel region ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). This acidic side chain is the **proton-binding site** that carries protons across the membrane as the c-ring rotates. Its protonation state and interactions govern the affinity and release of H<sup>+</sup>, which is fundamental to the enzyme’s mechanism. Mutagenesis and biochemical studies have shown that modifying this Asp/Glu (for example, covalently blocking it with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCCD) abolishes proton transport, underlining that this residue is essential for H<sup>+</sup> translocation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). 

Within the inner membrane, **eight subunit c molecules assemble into a ring (c<sub>8</sub>)**, which is part of the **rotor of ATP synthase** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). This **c-ring** is attached to the central γ and ε subunits of F<sub>1</sub>, forming a continuous rotor that spans from the membrane into the soluble F<sub>1</sub> headpiece ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). The c-ring is positioned adjacent to **subunit a (ATP6)**, which does not rotate but instead forms the stator element of the proton channel. Subunit a has two hydrophilic half-channels: one opens to the **intermembrane space (IMS)** side of the inner membrane, allowing protons from the IMS (high [H<sup>+</sup>]) to access the binding sites on c subunits; the other half-channel opens to the **matrix** side, where protons are released into the low [H<sup>+</sup>] environment of the matrix ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). Subunit c thus cycles through these two environments as the ring spins, carrying protons from IMS to matrix. The physical location of ATP5MC3’s product is therefore the **membrane domain of the enzyme at the interface of the proton source and sink** – an ideal position to harness the **proton-motive force (pmf)**. 

It should be noted that ATP synthase complexes in the inner membrane often form **dimeric and oligomeric assemblies**. While the c-ring itself remains part of a single monomer’s rotor, interactions between other F<sub>o</sub> subunits (notably the a, e, g, and A6L/8 subunits) mediate dimerization of two ATP synthase monomers ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=coupled%20to%20ATP%20synthesis%20at,the%20edges%20of%20the%20cristae)). Rows of ATP synthase dimers line the sharp curves of the cristae membranes and are thought to induce or stabilize the curvature of the cristae ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=proteolipid%20,the%20edges%20of%20the%20cristae)). In these structural assemblies, subunit c still performs its same role within each monomer, but the overall **supramolecular arrangement** of ATP synthases contributes to mitochondrial ultrastructure and optimizes the local proton gradient usage. Thus, ATP5MC3’s product is not only critical for enzymatic activity but also indirectly relevant to mitochondrial inner membrane architecture.

## Function: Proton Translocation and ATP Synthesis Mechanism  
**ATP5MC3’s primary function** is to provide the **rotating proton carrier** within the ATP synthase complex. Each subunit c binds a proton and moves – as part of the c-ring – through the membrane, turning the central shaft of the enzyme and driving ATP synthesis in the F<sub>1</sub> sector ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). In essence, subunit c is a **proton-translocating component**: it does not catalyze a chemical reaction by itself, but its coordinated movement is integral to the enzyme’s chemo-mechanical energy conversion. The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is: 

\[ \text{ADP}^{3-} + \text{P}_{i}^{2-} + n~\text{H}^{+}_{\text{IMS}} \;\; \xrightarrow{\text{Complex V}}\;\; \text{ATP}^{4-} + \text{H}_{2}\text{O} + n~\text{H}^{+}_{\text{matrix}}, \] 

where *n* is the number of protons translocated per ATP (in human mitochondria *n* is approximately 2.7, as discussed below). The **substrates** for the F<sub>1</sub> catalytic domain are ADP and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), and the **“substrate” for the F<sub>o</sub> domain (subunit c and a)** can be considered the proton gradient itself – specifically, H<sup>+</sup> ions moving down their electrochemical gradient. The energy from **proton flow** is converted into mechanical rotation, which is then converted into the chemical energy of the ATP bond ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=During%20respiration%2C%20adenosine%20triphosphate%20,of%20the%20complex%20that%20explained)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)).

**Mechanistic details:** The proton translocation process involves a **rotational cycle**. When a proton from the intermembrane space enters the half-channel of subunit a, it protonates the Asp/Glu on a subunit c currently positioned at that interface ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)). Protonation neutralizes the negative charge, making that c-subunit more hydrophobic so it can enter the lipid bilayer environment. The c-ring then **rotates** by one step (one c-subunit moving from the a subunit’s IMS-facing channel to its matrix-facing channel) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). This rotation carries the protonated c-subunit around to the matrix-side half-channel of subunit a. There, the lower proton concentration (and an essential arginine residue on subunit a) promotes **deprotonation** of the Asp/Glu, releasing the proton into the matrix ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). Once the Asp on subunit c is deprotonated, it regains a negative charge, which is electrostatically unfavorable in the lipid bilayer, so that c-subunit now prefers to be adjacent to subunit a’s IMS channel again. This electrostatic cycle ensures that each proton binding and release event pushes the ring forward. In this manner, protons flowing *one-by-one* through the a–c interface cause the **c-ring to spin continuously** like a molecular gear ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). Proton translocation is believed to occur via proton hopping along hydrogen-bonded **water molecules within the half-channels** (a **Grotthuss mechanism**), as suggested by high-resolution structural data identifying ordered water in the proton pathways ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=resolved%20by%20the%20torsional%20flexing,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)). 

Crucially, the **rotational movement of the c-ring is coupled to ATP synthesis** in the F<sub>1</sub> domain. The c-ring is physically connected to the **central stalk** of F<sub>1</sub> (comprising the γ, ε, and δ subunits) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). As the c-ring turns, it drives the rotation of the γ-subunit inside the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> catalytic ring of F<sub>1</sub>. The three β subunits of F<sub>1</sub> are the sites of catalysis, and each cycles through different conformational states (loosely bound, tightly bound, and open) in a mechanism known as **rotational catalysis** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=the%20molecular%20mechanism%20for%20human,channels%2C%20suggesting%20that%20the%20proton)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). In brief, one full revolution (360°) of the γ-subunit causes each β subunit to sequentially adopt conformations that bind ADP + Pi, then convert them to ATP, and finally release ATP ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=Biological%20energy%20currency%20ATP%20is,binding%20is%20coordinated%20during%20synthesis)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). **Three molecules of ATP are produced per full rotation** of the enzyme, corresponding to the three β subunits functioning out-of-phase by 120° steps. 

In the human ATP synthase, the c-ring has 8 subunits, meaning that **8 protons** must be transported to complete one 360° rotation of the ring ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). This corresponds to ~2.7 H<sup>+</sup> per ATP synthesized (8 H<sup>+</sup> / 3 ATP). In organisms with larger c-rings, the proton-to-ATP ratio is higher (e.g., yeast with c<sub>10</sub> requires ~3.3 H<sup>+</sup> per ATP) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). The **smaller c-ring in mammals (c<sub>8</sub>) makes the human ATP synthase more “efficient”**, requiring fewer protons to produce each ATP ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=conferral%20protein%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). However, it also introduces a geometrical challenge: the F<sub>o</sub> rotor has 8-fold symmetry while the F<sub>1</sub> head has 3-fold symmetry. **8 steps per rotation vs. 3 steps per rotation** means the system must accommodate a mismatch (since 8 is not a multiple of 3). **Recent 2023 cryo-EM studies** of the human ATP synthase have illuminated how this **symmetry mismatch** is resolved ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=the%20open%20conformation%2C%20showing%20how,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)). The structures captured the enzyme in three major rotational states (120° apart) and an intermediate sub-state, revealing that the **γ-subunit and entire central rotor can flex torsionally** during the catalytic cycle ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=The%20accommodation%20of%20the%20symmetry,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)). In essence, the rotation of the c-ring is not perfectly uniform – a slight **elastic twist** allows the enzyme to distribute 8 proton-driven increments into 3 roughly equal 120° steps of F<sub>1</sub> ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=the%20open%20conformation%2C%20showing%20how,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)). A small “wobble” or spring-like deformation in the rotor accommodates the offset so that after one full turn, the system resets precisely. These cryo-EM snapshots also showed that when a β subunit reaches the **open conformation (ready to release ATP/ADP)**, it coincides with a particular angular position of the c-ring/γ-shaft, thereby explaining how the mechanical rotation orchestrates the timing of product release ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=Biological%20energy%20currency%20ATP%20is,Water%20molecules%20are)). Such findings provide direct evidence of the **rotary-catalysis model** initially proposed from biochemical studies, and refine our understanding of how subunit c’s movement is coordinated with F<sub>1</sub> catalysis in human mitochondria.

Overall, ATP5MC3’s encoded subunit c **acts as a proton carrier and rotary driver** within this mechanism. It **does not have an independent enzymatic activity** (the actual formation of ATP is catalyzed by β subunits in F<sub>1</sub>), but without the **torque generated by proton-bound c-ring rotation**, the ATP synthase cannot operate ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). In fact, if the proton gradient collapses, the ATP synthase can reverse – the F<sub>1</sub> motor can consume ATP to pump protons – and subunit c will then rotate in the opposite direction to expel protons, effectively functioning as part of an ATP-driven proton pump. This reversal is normally suppressed in cells by the **ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF<sub>1</sub>)**, which binds to F<sub>1</sub> under low pH (mitochondrial matrix) conditions to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=enzyme%20leads%20to%20the%20formation,o)). Thus, subunit c is central to the **bidirectional rotary capability** of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATPase, enabling the machine to either produce ATP when protons flow in or to preserve the proton gradient when ATP hydrolysis is not desirable.

## Biological Context and Pathways  
ATP5MC3 and its protein product participate in the fundamental process of **oxidative phosphorylation**. This gene is expressed in virtually all human tissues, consistent with the ubiquitous need for ATP. **Expression data** indicate ATP5MC3 is **widely expressed**, with particularly high mRNA levels in tissues of high metabolic demand – for example, RNA-seq data show expression in the heart at ~80 RPKM (reads per kilobase million) and in the duodenum at ~52 RPKM, among the highest levels observed ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=518#:~:text=proteins%20have%20been%20identified.%20,other%20tissues%20See%20more%20Orthologs)). Skeletal muscle, brain, liver, kidney, and other energy-dependent tissues also express significant amounts of ATP5MC3, reflecting the universal role of mitochondrial ATP synthase in energy homeostasis. The ATP produced by F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase is the primary energy currency that powers countless cellular processes (muscle contraction, neurotransmission, biosynthesis, etc.), so the gene’s activity is tightly linked to normal physiology.

In the context of **cellular respiration**, ATP5MC3’s role can be framed in the **mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC)** pathway. Complexes I, III, and IV of the ETC pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix, creating a proton-motive force (consisting of a membrane potential and a pH gradient) across the inner membrane ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=the%20intermediate%20electron%20carriers%20quinone,Pi)). Complex V (ATP synthase, containing subunit c) then **harnesses this proton-motive force to drive ATP synthesis** ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=redox%20reactions%20are%20coupled%20to,Pi)). In other words, ATP5MC3 is a critical component of the final step of oxidative phosphorylation – the step that actually converts the energy stored in an electrochemical gradient into the chemical energy of ATP. If ATP5MC3 function is compromised, the proton gradient cannot be effectively utilized for ATP production, leading to a condition known as **oxidative phosphorylation deficiency**. Cells may compensate by increasing glycolysis (the anaerobic production of ATP), but glycolysis is far less efficient and cannot sustain high ATP levels, especially for tissues like brain and muscle that have continuous, heavy energy requirements. This is why defects in the ATP synthase can cause severe, multi-system disorders (discussed below).

It’s worth noting that beyond ATP production, the ATP synthase complex (and thereby its subunits) plays a role in maintaining **mitochondrial structural integrity**. As mentioned, ATP synthase tends to form **dimer rows along cristae membranes**, and this arrangement contributes to shaping the inner membrane folds ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=coupled%20to%20ATP%20synthesis%20at,the%20edges%20of%20the%20cristae)). While subunit c itself is not the dimerization interface, the proper assembly of the c-ring and F<sub>o</sub> domain is a prerequisite for dimer formation. Altered function or assembly of subunit c could indirectly influence cristae structure by preventing normal dimerization or oligomerization of ATP synthase, potentially affecting how protons are funneled locally and how mitochondria adapt to different energy conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=proteolipid%20,the%20edges%20of%20the%20cristae)). 

In summary, ATP5MC3 functions in the **mitochondrial matrix/inner membrane compartment**, executing a specific task within the **OXPHOS pathway**: turning the electrochemical gradient into usable chemical energy. It is a *structural proton carrier* whose performance is vital for sustaining the energy output of aerobic metabolism. Under aerobic conditions, **most cellular ATP (upwards of 90%) is generated by this pathway**, highlighting the importance of every component of the ATP synthase, including subunit c ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=The%20ATP%20synthase%20in%20human,14)). Consistent with this, ATP5MC3 is highly conserved across eukaryotes and even in bacteria (as the analogous **atpE gene** for the F<sub>o</sub>-c subunit in bacterial ATP synthase), indicating that its function and structure have been maintained throughout evolution due to stringent functional requirements ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=a%20proband%20with%20generalized%20dystonia,patient%20cell%20lines%20and%20Drosophila)).

## Experimental Evidence and Clinical Significance  
Multiple lines of experimental evidence underline the **essential role of ATP5MC3’s gene product** in the ATP synthase complex. Genetic manipulation studies in human cell models have shown that removing or disrupting subunit c prevents the assembly of a functional ATP synthase. In a 2018 study, Walker and colleagues created human cells lacking subunit c; as a result, the cells accumulated an **incomplete ATP synthase complex** that lacked the entire c-ring (no proton rotor) and also failed to incorporate the critical mtDNA-encoded subunits ATP6 and ATP8 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=ATP%20synthase%20is%20assembled,These%20incomplete%20vestigial)). In these c-null cells, the F<sub>1</sub> sector was present but disconnected – essentially stuck in an idle state bound to the ATPase inhibitor IF<sub>1</sub>, unable to produce ATP ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=ATP%20synthase%20is%20assembled,These%20incomplete%20vestigial)). This experiment demonstrated that subunit c is **absolutely required for assembling the F<sub>o</sub> membrane domain** and that without it, the proton channel and rotor cannot form, leading to a loss of ATP synthase activity and severely compromised cellular respiration. Similarly, selective deletions of other F<sub>o</sub> subunits (like subunit a or subunit b/OSCP) also abolish ATP synthase function, reinforcing that each piece of this molecular machine is indispensable ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=ATP%20synthase%20is%20assembled,These%20incomplete%20vestigial)). These findings are consistent with observations in yeast and mouse models, and they help delineate the **assembly pathway** of ATP synthase: a sub-complex containing F<sub>1</sub> attached to a c-ring is a necessary intermediate onto which subunit a (ATP6) and others must later attach ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=products%20of%20overlapping%20genes%20in,Their%20association%20with%20the)). Subunit c forms the foundation of this rotary motor, and the enzyme’s assembly and activity depend on having a full ring of c subunits in place.

Clinically, disturbances in ATP5MC3 can lead to **mitochondrial disease** phenotypes. Notably, ATP5MC3 has been implicated in a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by early-onset **dystonia and/or spastic paraplegia** ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATP5MC3#:~:text=ATP5MC3%20,of%20this%20gene%20is%20ATP5MC2)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=Exome%20analysis%20revealed%20a%20variant,mitochondrial%20function%20and%20displayed%20reduced)). A 2021 study identified a **missense mutation** in ATP5MC3 (a single C>G nucleotide change causing a p.Asn106Lys substitution in the protein) in a large family where multiple members presented with generalized dystonia or hereditary spastic paralysis symptoms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=Exome%20analysis%20revealed%20a%20variant,mitochondrial%20function%20and%20displayed%20reduced)). This variant, which affects a highly conserved residue near the C-terminus of subunit c, **segregated with the disease** in the family and was absent in healthy controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=Exome%20analysis%20revealed%20a%20variant,mitochondrial%20function%20and%20displayed%20reduced)). Follow-up functional analyses provided strong evidence that the mutation is pathogenic: **patient-derived fibroblasts** showed significantly **reduced complex V activity**, lowered cellular ATP levels, and impaired oxygen consumption, indicating a defective oxidative phosphorylation capacity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=individuals%20with%20spastic%20paraplegia%20or,function%20and%20displayed%20reduced%20mobility)). In other words, the ATP synthase containing the mutant subunit c was partly uncoupled or inefficient, leading to an energy production deficit in patient cells. To verify causality, researchers modeled the mutation in **Drosophila** (fruit flies) by introducing the analogous change in the fly ATP synthase c-subunit; the transgenic flies exhibited **motor dysfunction (reduced mobility)** and signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, which mirrored the human clinical phenotype at a cellular level ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=limb%20dystonia,function%20and%20displayed%20reduced%20mobility)). 

Mechanistically, the ATP5MC3-Asn106Lys variant appears to **impair the coupling between proton flow and ATP synthesis**. Interestingly, an equivalent mutation had been studied in bacteria decades earlier: the *uncE* gene of *E. coli* encodes the ATP synthase c subunit, and a spontaneous mutant at the corresponding position was found to **“uncouple” F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> – meaning the F<sub>o</sub> sector could still translocate protons, but it no longer drove productive ATP synthesis by F<sub>1</sub> ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar)). In the bacterial mutant, protons leaked or were transported without generating ATP, analogous to a slipping gear. The human Asn106Lys mutation is believed to cause a similar phenomenon of **inefficient torque transmission** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=a%20proband%20with%20generalized%20dystonia,patient%20cell%20lines%20and%20Drosophila)). Asn106 lies in the vicinity of the interface where the c-ring interacts with the γ/ε central stalk, and altering this residue likely disrupts the precise fit or timing needed for mechanical coupling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=a%20proband%20with%20generalized%20dystonia,patient%20cell%20lines%20and%20Drosophila)). Consistent with this idea, **structural mapping** of known disease-causing mutations onto the recent high-resolution structure of human ATP synthase showed that most such mutations cluster at **subunit–subunit interfaces**, where they can destabilize interactions within the complex ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=identified%20in%20the%20inlet%20and,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)). A mutation like Asn106Lys in subunit c, located at a contact point either between c subunits or between subunit c and the stalk/OSCP, could reduce the stability of the rotary assembly or alter conformational dynamics, resulting in a complex that might still burn protons (or ATP) but with reduced efficiency or regulation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=identified%20in%20the%20inlet%20and,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=a%20proband%20with%20generalized%20dystonia,patient%20cell%20lines%20and%20Drosophila)). The clinical consequence, as observed, is a neuron-specific energy deficit manifesting as movement disorder (neurons are particularly sensitive to energy shortfalls, which can manifest as neurodegeneration or dysfunctional motor control).

Beyond this specific dystonia/paraplegia case, **mitochondrial complex V deficiencies** are known in medical genetics, though they are relatively rare compared to defects in complexes I–IV. Mutations in other ATP synthase subunits (for example, in the F<sub>1</sub> β subunit gene **ATP5F1B**, or in the mitochondrial ATP6 gene) and in assembly factors (such as ATPAF2) have been reported to cause lactic acidosis, encephalopathies, cardiomyopathies, and other severe conditions of infancy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10316767/#:~:text=PMC%20pmc,in%20adults%2C%20often%20in%20association)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=,Google%20Scholar)). What is notable about the ATP5MC3 mutation is that it causes a dominantly inherited, milder phenotype (early-adult onset movement disorder) rather than a fatal neonatal disease. This likely reflects the fact that the mutation is **heterozygous** (patients still have one wild-type ATP5MC3 allele and intact ATP5MC1/2 genes) and that it produces a partially functional enzyme rather than completely abolishing function ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=Exome%20analysis%20revealed%20a%20variant,mitochondrial%20function%20and%20displayed%20reduced)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=A%20unique%20form%20of%20familial,reduces%20mitochondrial%20complex%20V%20activity)). The dominant nature suggests the mutant subunits may incorporate into the c-ring and interfere with function (a dominant-negative effect), or that a ~50% reduction in efficient proton coupling crosses a threshold in certain neurons over time. This finding is important as it expands the spectrum of ATP synthase disorders to include adult-onset, tissue-specific diseases. Indeed, due to this discovery, ATP5MC3 has been assigned the locus name **DYTSPG** (dystonia, spastic paraplegia) in some databases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=518#:~:text=P3%3B%20ATP5G3%3B%20DYTSPG%20Summary%20This,The)).

From a **research and therapeutic standpoint**, understanding ATP5MC3’s role has practical implications. The ATP synthase is a target of various compounds; classic bioenergetic inhibitors like **oligomycin** bind to the F<sub>o</sub> sector (near the c-ring and subunit a interface) to block proton transport, demonstrating how disrupting subunit c function can shut down ATP production. In fact, the oligomycin binding site has been mapped to the interface of subunit **c** and **OSCP/F6** on the F<sub>o</sub> side, which is why one of the ATP synthase subunits is named **OSCP (oligomycin-sensitivity conferral protein)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5866602/#:~:text=Black%20horizontal%20lines%20represent%20the,8)). Moreover, a prominent new tuberculosis drug, **bedaquiline**, works by specifically inhibiting the proton-translocating c-ring of *Mycobacterium* ATP synthase, effectively starving the bacteria of ATP ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=regions%20of%20ATP%20synthases,therapies%20to%20treat%20human%20diseases)). These examples illustrate that the subunit c rotor is a “druggable” site and that modulators of its function can have potent biological effects. While **targeting human ATP5MC3** or the mitochondrial c-ring is more challenging (due to toxicity concerns, as human cells need ATP), there is interest in modulating ATP synthase activity in certain contexts – for instance, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cancer metabolism, and pathological mitochondrial hyperactivity. The detailed structural knowledge (e.g. the 2023 cryo-EM human ATP synthase structure) aids in these efforts by revealing binding pockets and conformational states that could be exploited ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=resolved%20by%20the%20torsional%20flexing,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=regions%20of%20ATP%20synthases,therapies%20to%20treat%20human%20diseases)). At the very least, ATP5MC3 serves as a **marker of mitochondrial function**, and its expression or integrity might be assessed in diagnostic evaluations of mitochondrial disorders.

In summary, **ATP5MC3 encodes the c-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, a protein that is central to the enzyme’s ability to convert a proton gradient into ATP**. Its function is well-defined: it forms the rotating proton channel that drives the ATP-generating machinery. Decades of research, from classical biochemistry (identifying the proton-binding Asp and rotary mechanism) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8519776/#:~:text=fold%20across%20the%20membrane%20as,as%20a%20hairpin%20in%20a)) to modern structural biology (visualizing rotor stepping and subunit interfaces) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37244256/#:~:text=the%20open%20conformation%2C%20showing%20how,causing%20instability%20of%20the%20complex)), have built a detailed understanding of how this subunit works. The current understanding emphasizes that subunit c operates as part of a **highly coordinated rotary engine**, with its proton-mediated conformational changes producing mechanical rotation that is synchronized with catalytic events in ATP synthase ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.864006/full#:~:text=possessing%20between%209%20,hexamer%20and%20drives%20ATP%20synthesis)). Its **primary substrate** in functional terms is the proton (H<sup>+</sup>), and its **primary role** is structural/mechanical – it does not catalyze a chemical transformation of the proton, but rather carries it across the membrane and in doing so, transduces energy. The **cellular locale** of its action is the **mitochondrial inner membrane**, within the F<sub>o</sub> sector of complex V. It is intricately involved in the **oxidative phosphorylation pathway**, directly impacting how effectively cells can generate ATP from respiratory chain activity. Given its importance, it is not surprising that the protein is **nearly invariant across species** and that even subtle mutations can have outsized effects on organismal physiology ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840961/#:~:text=a%20proband%20with%20generalized%20dystonia,patient%20cell%20lines%20and%20Drosophila)). ATP5MC3 and its paralogs thus represent critical genes for bioenergetics, and ongoing research continues to uncover nuances of their regulation, assembly, and potential as therapeutic targets in mitochondria-related diseases.
