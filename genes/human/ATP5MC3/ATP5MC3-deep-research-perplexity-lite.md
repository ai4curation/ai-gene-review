## Question

Research the ATP5MC3 (P48201) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

**ATP5MC3** (UniProt: P48201) encodes a membrane subunit c (subunit 9) of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which is essential for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in human cells[1][3][8][12]. The protein is localized to the **mitochondrial inner membrane** as part of the F₀ domain of ATP synthase[1][12].

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Molecular Function:**  
  ATP5MC3 is a component of the **proton channel (F₀ domain)** of mitochondrial ATP synthase (Complex V), facilitating **proton translocation** across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives the rotary mechanism for ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate[1][2][12].

- **Biological Processes:**  
  - **ATP synthesis coupled proton transport** during oxidative phosphorylation[1][8][12].
  - **Electron transport chain** activity as part of cellular energy metabolism[1][3].
  - Involvement in **mitochondrial biogenesis** and maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis[1].

- **Cellular Localization:**  
  - **Mitochondrial inner membrane** as a transmembrane protein within the F₀ sector of ATP synthase[1][12].
  - Ubiquitously expressed as a **housekeeping gene** in human tissues[4].

---

### 2. Protein Domains

- **Transmembrane Domain:**  
  ATP5MC3 contains a **hydrophobic transmembrane domain** that anchors it within the mitochondrial inner membrane, forming part of the c-ring structure of the F₀ complex[1][12].
- **Mature Protein:**  
  The mature protein is identical to other subunit c paralogs (ATP5MC1, ATP5MC2), differing only in their mitochondrial import sequences[1][3].

---

### 3. Known Interactions

- **Complex Assembly:**  
  ATP5MC3 interacts with other subunits of the F₀ domain (a, b, d, e, f, g, F6, and 8) to form the **c-ring rotary element**[1][2][12].
- **Functional Coupling:**  
  The c-ring rotates in response to proton flow, mechanically coupling with the F₁ catalytic core to drive ATP synthesis[1][2][12].
- **Paralogs:**  
  ATP5MC3 is one of three human genes encoding subunit c, with ATP5MC1 and ATP5MC2 as important paralogs[1].

---

### 4. Disease Associations

- **Mitochondrial Disease:**  
  Mutations or dysfunction in ATP5MC3 have been associated with **mitochondrial diseases**, which can manifest as defects in energy metabolism[1].
- **Dystonia, Early-Onset, and/or Spastic Paraplegia:**  
  Disease associations include **early-onset dystonia** and **spastic paraplegia**, likely due to impaired ATP production in neurons[1].
- **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:**  
  Literature links ATP5MC3 to **hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**, suggesting a role in cardiac mitochondrial function[2].
- **Other Phenotypes:**  
  The gene is referenced in studies of mitochondrial permeability transition and may be relevant to broader mitochondrial pathologies[10].

---

### 5. Recent Developments and Latest Research

- **Transcript Variants:**  
  Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified, but they encode the same mature protein[1][3].
- **Genomic Data:**  
  ATP5MC3 is located on chromosome 2 (GRCh38: 175,176,258–175,181,710), with five transcripts and 14 exons[7][9].
- **Expression Analysis:**  
  Recent studies confirm ATP5MC3 is not cell-type-specific but is **ubiquitously expressed**[4].
- **Functional Studies:**  
  Research continues to explore the impact of ATP5MC3 on mitochondrial permeability and its role in disease phenotypes[10].

---

### 6. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Gene Location:**  
  Chromosome 2, 5,453 base pairs, 14 exons[7][9].
- **Protein Structure:**  
  The c-ring is likely composed of **10 subunits** in humans[1][2][12].
- **Expression:**  
  ATP5MC3 is expressed in all tissues, consistent with its role in fundamental cellular energy production[4].
