  TMA7B (Translation machinery-associated protein 7B) is a small 64-amino acid protein
  belonging to the TMA7 family (Pfam: PF09072, InterPro: IPR015157). It is a paralog of
  human TMA7 (Q9Y2S6). No direct experimental studies characterize human TMA7B specifically;
  however, function can be inferred from the well-characterized yeast ortholog TMA7
  (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In yeast, TMA7 associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit in
  an EDTA-sensitive manner and is required for efficient cytoplasmic translation. Yeast
  tma7-null mutants show approximately 95% reduction in protein synthesis (35S-methionine
  incorporation), reduced polysomes relative to monosomes (indicative of a translation
  initiation defect), and resistance to the translation inhibitor anisomycin
  [PMID:16702403]. Cross-species complementation studies demonstrate functional conservation
  of TMA7 family members across eukaryotes, as human MCT-1 (TMA20 homolog) can rescue yeast
  tma20 defects [PMID:16702403]. Recent mammalian proteomics studies link TMA7 family
  protein levels to ribosome quality control pathways (Luo et al. 2023 bioRxiv). Plant
  ribosome proteomics also identified the Arabidopsis TMA7 homolog co-purifying with
  80S cytosolic ribosomes (Salih et al. 2019 bioRxiv), supporting conserved ribosome
  association across eukaryotes.

        EDTA-dependent cosedimentation with ribosomes (particularly 40S subunit) in sucrose

        requires inference across both orthology (yeast→human) and paralogy (TMA7→TMA7B),
        which reduces confidence. TMA7 family conservation across eukaryotes (yeast, plant,

        This annotation is proposed based on yeast TMA7 ortholog evidence. Yeast TMA7
        shows EDTA-dependent cosedimentation with ribosomes [PMID:16702403], and the
        deep research indicates specific association with the 40S ribosomal subunit.
        CAVEAT: Lower confidence due to (1) double inference chain (yeast ortholog → human
        paralog), and (2) TMA7 transiently associates with ribosomes rather than being a
        stable component - "colocalizes_with" may be more appropriate than "located_in".
      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        Biochemical evidence from yeast shows TMA7 co-sediments with 40S ribosomal fractions.
        EDTA sensitivity indicates association with assembled ribosomes. However, TMA7 is
        an associated factor, not a core ribosomal component, so this annotation may
        overstate the relationship. Direct human TMA7B evidence is lacking.

      INFERRED FROM YEAST ORTHOLOG (moderate confidence): TMA7B likely functions as a
      translation machinery-associated protein that transiently associates with the small
      ribosomal subunit and promotes efficient cytoplasmic translation, particularly at
      the initiation step. IMPORTANT CAVEATS: (1) No direct human TMA7B experimental
      evidence exists - function is inferred from yeast TMA7 ortholog via a double
      inference chain (yeast ortholog → human paralog). (2) TMA7 is not a core ribosomal
      structural component but an associated factor. (3) Functional redundancy with human
      TMA7 paralog is unknown. Cross-species complementation studies demonstrate TMA7
      family conservation, supporting but not confirming this inference.
