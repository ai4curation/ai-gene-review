  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that catalyzes removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues of histones (preferentially H4K16, H3K9, H3K14) and numerous non-histone proteins including p53, NF-kB RelA/p65, FOXO factors, HIF1alpha/HIF2alpha, and PGC-1alpha. The core enzymatic function couples NAD+ cleavage to lysine deacetylation, producing nicotinamide and 2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Functions in transcriptional regulation through heterochromatin formation and as a transcription corepressor. Has broad pleiotropic effects on metabolism, stress responses, DNA damage response, and aging through deacetylation of diverse substrates.

SIRT1 core function is NAD-dependent deacetylation with broad substrate specificity including p53, NF-kB, FOXO, HIF, PGC-1alpha, and histones.

  review:
    summary: SIRT1 can deacetylate circadian clock components but this is one of many substrates. Clock regulation is not the core function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: SIRT1 deacetylates many transcription factors including clock proteins. This represents an over-annotation based on one substrate class rather than the core NAD-dependent deacetylase function.

  review:
    summary: SIRT1 regulates circadian clock gene expression through PER2 deacetylation (PMID:18662546). While the experimental evidence supports clock regulation, SIRT1 has broad substrate specificity and clock proteins are just one of many targets.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IMP evidence from PMID:18662546 specifically demonstrates SIRT1 involvement in circadian regulation. However, this is one of many downstream effects of SIRT1 deacetylase activity on diverse substrates. Not a core function.
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: PMID:18662546
        supporting_text: "SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, is required for high-magnitude circadian transcription of several core clock genes, including Bmal1, Rorgamma, Per2, and Cry1."

      label: NAD-dependent protein lysine deacetylase activity
    description: Primary enzymatic function of SIRT1. Catalyzes NAD-dependent removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues of histones and numerous non-histone proteins. The reaction couples NAD+ cleavage to lysine deacetylation, producing nicotinamide and 2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose.
