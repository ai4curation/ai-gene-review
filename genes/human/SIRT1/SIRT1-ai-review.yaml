description: NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that catalyzes removal of acetyl 
  groups from lysine residues of histones (preferentially H4K16, H3K9, H3K14) 
  and numerous non-histone proteins including p53, NF-kB RelA/p65, FOXO factors,
  HIF1alpha/HIF2alpha, and PGC-1alpha. The core enzymatic function couples NAD+ 
  cleavage to lysine deacetylation, producing nicotinamide and 
  2-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Functions in transcriptional regulation through 
  heterochromatin formation and as a transcription corepressor. Has broad 
  pleiotropic effects on metabolism, stress responses, DNA damage response, and 
  aging through deacetylation of diverse substrates.
