description: >-
  TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) is a highly conserved, dosage-sensitive RNA-binding
  protein
  essential for RNA metabolism. It contains an N-terminal domain with a bipartite
  nuclear localization
  signal (NLS), two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1/RRM2) that bind UG-rich RNA and TG-rich
  ssDNA, and
  a glycine-rich C-terminal low-complexity domain (LCD) that mediates phase separation
  and harbors
  most ALS/FTD-associated mutations. TDP-43's core functions include: (1) repression
  of cryptic exon
  inclusion in pre-mRNAs such as STMN2 and UNC13A, (2) regulation of mRNA stability
  and transport
  including axonal transport of neurofilament mRNA, (3) autoregulation of its own
  mRNA levels via
  3'-UTR binding, and (4) participation in stress granule dynamics through liquid-liquid
  phase
  separation. TDP-43 is predominantly nuclear but shuttles to the cytoplasm under
  stress. TDP-43
  proteinopathy (nuclear depletion with cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation
  containing
  hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and C-terminally cleaved TDP-43) is present
  in 95-97% of ALS
  cases and approximately 45-50% of FTLD cases.

        TDP-43 was shown to interact with CRY1/CRY2 proteins and regulate their stability,

        While PMID:27123980 demonstrates that TDP-43 stabilizes cryptochrome proteins

        shortens circadian period in cultured cells, this is not a core function.
        The primary
        function of TDP-43 is RNA metabolism (splicing, mRNA stability). The circadian
        effect
        appears to be a secondary consequence of TDP-43's general role in protein
        stability
        regulation rather than a specific circadian function. The deep research on
        TDP-43 focuses
        entirely on RNA metabolism and ALS/FTD with no mention of circadian biology

      TDP-43 binds 3'-UTR sequences to regulate mRNA stability, including autoregulation
      of its own mRNA and stabilization of neurofilament mRNA. This supports its role
      in splicing regulation and cryptic exon repression.

      label: molecular condensate scaffold activity
    description: >-
      TDP-43 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation via its C-terminal low-complexity
      domain, forming nuclear condensates that support function and stress granules
      under stress conditions.
