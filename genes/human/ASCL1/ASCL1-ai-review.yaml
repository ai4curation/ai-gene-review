description: >-
  ASCL1 (Achaete-scute homolog 1, also known as MASH1/hASH1) is a proneural basic
  helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
  transcription factor that functions as both a classical transcriptional activator
  and a pioneer factor
  capable of accessing closed chromatin. It binds E-box motifs (CANNTG, particularly
  CACCTG) as a heterodimer
  with E-proteins (TCF3/E12/E47, TCF4) to activate neuronal and neuroendocrine gene
  programs. ASCL1 plays
  essential roles in neuronal differentiation, neuronal fate commitment, and neuroendocrine
  cell development.
  It is a master regulator of the SCLC-A (neuroendocrine) subtype of small cell lung
  cancer and directly
  activates targets including INSM1, MYT1, DLL1, and DLL3 (Notch pathway modulators).
  ASCL1 protein
  stability is regulated by CDK2-CyclinA2 phosphorylation, HUWE1-mediated ubiquitination,
  and protection
  via E-protein heterodimerization.

        Neuron differentiation is a core function of ASCL1. The IBA annotation is
        well-supported by phylogenetic
        analysis and extensive experimental evidence. ASCL1 (MASH1) is essential for
        proper development of
        olfactory and autonomic neurons and for neuronal differentiation in the CNS
        and PNS (PMID:10903890).
        ASCL1 overexpression increases neurogenesis in human neural progenitor cells
        (PMID:19008346).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a core function of ASCL1. The protein is classified as a proneural
        bHLH transcription factor
        whose primary role is driving neuronal differentiation. Multiple experimental
        studies confirm this
        function, and the IBA phylogenetic inference is consistent with the extensive
        literature.

      ASCL1 functions as a pioneer factor capable of binding nucleosomal DNA and initiating
      chromatin
      remodeling at neuronal enhancers. Studies reveal ASCL1 operates through two
      distinct mechanisms:
      at ~23.5% of sites it functions as a classical pioneer factor binding closed
      chromatin
      independently, while at ~68% of sites it requires cooperation with mSWI/SNF
      chromatin
      remodeling complexes (PMID:36931659). ASCL1 binds chromatin marked by a trivalent
      signature
