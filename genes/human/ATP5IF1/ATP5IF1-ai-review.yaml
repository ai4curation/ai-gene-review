description: >-
  ATP5IF1 (also known as IF1 or ATPIF1) encodes the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor,
  a small nuclear-encoded protein that reversibly inhibits the F1Fo-ATP synthase
  (complex V) to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis when the mitochondrial membrane
  potential collapses (e.g., during ischemia or hypoxia). IF1 is active as an
  antiparallel dimer at acidic pH (<6.7) and inactive as a tetramer at neutral pH.
  The N-terminal inhibitory region (residues 26-52) binds the alpha/beta catalytic
  interface of the F1 domain and contacts the gamma subunit to block rotary
  catalysis. IF1 also binds the OSCP subunit, which protects cancer cells from
  permeability transition pore-dependent apoptosis. Phosphorylation at Ser39 by
  a mitochondrial PKA-like activity inactivates IF1. The protein is overexpressed
  in many cancers and contributes to the glycolytic Warburg phenotype. IF1 also
  indirectly regulates heme synthesis in erythroid tissues and promotes ATP synthase
  dimerization, which influences cristae morphology.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for cytoplasm based on phylogenetic inference. While IF1 is
      primarily a mitochondrial matrix protein, the precursor form is synthesized
      in the cytoplasm before import. The IBA also includes plant orthologs (TAIR
      locus) and bovine P01096, suggesting broad conservation. However, cytoplasm
      is a very general CC term and the primary active localization of IF1 is
      mitochondrial.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The precursor protein transits the cytoplasm before mitochondrial import,
      and the IBA annotation reflects conserved localization across the family.
      While the primary active location is mitochondrial, cytoplasmic presence
      of the precursor form is biologically valid. UniProt notes a mitochondrial
      transit peptide (residues 1-25) consistent with cytoplasmic synthesis and
      import (PMID:25944712).

      IBA annotation for heme biosynthetic process based on phylogenetic inference
      from mouse (MGI:1196457) and zebrafish (ZFIN:ZDB-GENE-070410-36) orthologs.
      Shah et al. (2012, PMID:23135403) demonstrated that Atpif1 regulates heme
      synthesis in developing erythroblasts by modulating mitochondrial pH and
      redox potential, allowing FECH to catalyze iron incorporation into
      protoporphyrin IX.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This is a genuine but indirect role of IF1. The protein does not directly
      participate in heme biosynthetic enzymology; rather, by inhibiting ATP
      hydrolysis, IF1 maintains mitochondrial pH and redox conditions favorable
      for FECH activity. UniProt explicitly states: "Indirectly acts as a
      regulator of heme synthesis in erythroid tissues: regulates heme synthesis
      by modulating the mitochondrial pH and redox potential, allowing FECH to
      efficiently catalyze the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX to
      produce heme" (PMID:23135403). This is a secondary consequence of its
      primary ATPase inhibitor activity, relevant mainly in erythroid tissues.

      Like heme biosynthesis, erythrocyte differentiation is an indirect
      downstream consequence of IF1's ATPase inhibitor activity. IF1 is not
      an erythroid-specific transcription factor or signaling molecule; it
      supports erythropoiesis by maintaining mitochondrial conditions needed
      for heme synthesis. This represents a tissue-specific pleiotropic effect
      rather than a core molecular function.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately captures the core process-level function
      of IF1 at a somewhat general level. IF1 negatively regulates the
      ATP hydrolase activity of F1Fo-ATP synthase. While GO:1905707
      (negative regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled proton
      transport) is more specific, this term is also accurate as a broader
      description of the mechanism.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While IF1 is indeed an enzyme inhibitor, "enzyme inhibitor activity"
      (GO:0004857) is too general. The more specific term "ATPase inhibitor
      activity" (GO:0042030) is already annotated and better captures the
      specific function. This general term should be replaced with the
      more specific one.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      This term is too broad. IF1 does not generally participate in
      "generation of precursor metabolites and energy" -- it specifically
      inhibits ATP hydrolysis by the F1Fo-ATP synthase. The more specific
      term GO:1905707 (negative regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis
      coupled proton transport) better captures the actual process.
      Alternatively, GO:1903578 (regulation of ATP metabolic process)

  review:
    summary: >-
      The mature IF1 protein functions in the mitochondrial matrix, where
      it binds the F1 catalytic domain on the matrix-facing side of the
      inner membrane. While "mitochondrion" is annotated, the more specific
      sub-compartment (mitochondrial matrix) is not explicitly annotated.
      UniProt states: "Mitochondrion" as subcellular location, and the
      deep research notes that IF1 acts "on the matrix side of the F1
      catalytic domain." Cryo-EM structures (PDB: 8H9E, 8H9L, 8H9S,
      8H9U, 8KI3) place IF1 bound to the F1 domain which projects into
      the matrix.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The mitochondrial matrix is the specific sub-compartment where
      IF1 is active. The F1 domain that IF1 binds faces the matrix.
      This more specific CC annotation is supported by structural data
      and functional characterization. While "mitochondrion" is annotated,
      the matrix localization should be explicitly noted.

  description: >-
    The primary molecular function of ATP5IF1 is ATPase inhibitor activity. IF1
    reversibly inhibits the ATP hydrolase activity of the F1Fo-ATP synthase (complex V)
    by binding the alpha/beta catalytic interface and the gamma subunit of the F1 domain.
    This prevents wasteful ATP consumption when the mitochondrial membrane potential
    collapses during ischemia, hypoxia, or uncoupling. IF1 is active as an antiparallel
    dimer at acidic pH (<6.7) and inactive as a tetramer at neutral pH. Phosphorylation
    at Ser39 by a mitochondrial PKA-like activity inactivates IF1.

    IF1 directly binds the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex in a pH-dependent manner.
    At acidic pH (6.5), IF1 co-purifies with the complex; at pH 8.0, IF1 is released.
    The N-terminal inhibitory region (residues 26-52) contacts the alpha/beta subunit
    interface and the gamma subunit. This binding is the mechanistic basis for the
    ATPase inhibitor activity.
