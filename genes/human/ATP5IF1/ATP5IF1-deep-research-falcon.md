## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UII2
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=ATPase inhibitor, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Inhibitor of F(1)F(o)-ATPase; Short=IF(1); Short=IF1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ATP5IF1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:871}; Synonyms=ATPI, ATPIF1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ATPase inhibitor family. .

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ATP5IF1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ATP5IF1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ATP5IF1** (gene ID: ATP5IF1, UniProt: Q9UII2) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and approach
- Verified identity and scope before research. Target gene/protein matches UniProt Q9UII2: human ATP5IF1 (aliases: IF1, ATPIF1, ATPI) encoding the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor family protein; literature describes membership in ATPase inhibitor family and the characteristic mitochondrial ATPase_inhibitor_mt/IATP domain organization. Reviewed authoritative recent sources (2022–2024) and primary 2023–2024 studies for mechanism, regulation, structure, localization, and disease roles. Where the 2023–2024 primary data were not retrievable in our evidence set, we provide a partial summary and note the gap.

Executive summary
- Identity and definition: ATP5IF1 (IF1) is a small, nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial protein that inhibits the F1Fo-ATP synthase (complex V). It is imported as a precursor and, in its mature form (≈81 aa), binds the F1 catalytic region to block rotary catalysis; IF1 belongs to the ATPase inhibitor family and is conserved in mammals. Tissue expression is variable and subject to post-transcriptional regulation (human > mouse in several tissues) (gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2, gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2, solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-5).
- Core mechanism: IF1 is a reversible, pH-sensitive inhibitor that primarily prevents wasteful ATP hydrolysis when Δψm collapses, but can also inhibit ATP synthesis in some contexts. Acidic matrix pH promotes active dimers; near-neutral pH favors inactive tetramers. Phosphorylation at Ser39 by a mitochondrial PKA-like activity renders IF1 inactive (cannot bind ATP synthase), whereas dephosphorylation restores inhibition (gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2, gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 2-5, cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14, solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8).
- Interfaces and structural insights: IF1 binds the F1 catalytic site formed by α/β subunits and contacts γ; in respiring human cancer cells, IF1 also binds the OSCP subunit, and this IF1–OSCP interaction protects from permeability transition and apoptosis. NMR mapping localizes the OSCP-binding interface to IF1 E29–R39 and OSCP helix/shoulder residues A53–I64; IF1 dimers are detected in complexes (solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8, galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4).
- Physiological and disease roles (recent): In cancer, IF1 and the ATP synthase/IF1 axis are linked to glycolytic reprogramming, oligomerization of ATP synthase and cristae remodeling, and apoptosis resistance. 2023–2024 studies report OSCP binding that protects from apoptosis and peptide disruptors that displace IF1 to sensitize cancer mitochondria (dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6, cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14, galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16).
- Interventions and applications (recent): (i) Mitochondria-targeted peptides can disrupt the IF1–OSCP interaction and modulate mPT without impairing respiration, suggesting a druggable site (2024). (ii) Reviews emphasize S39 phosphorylation as a regulatory node for metabolic control and potential biomarker utility of IF1 in oncology and cardiometabolic settings (2024) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14, dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Gene/protein identity and family: ATP5IF1 encodes ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), an endogenous regulator of mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase (complex V). IF1 is a small, basic protein imported into the matrix; homologs exist across eukaryotes. It is grouped within the ATPase inhibitor family and exerts reversible, non-competitive inhibition of the F1 catalytic rotary mechanism (gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2, gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2, solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-5).
- Fundamental role: IF1 prevents ATP wastage by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis during conditions of low proton motive force (e.g., ischemia/hypoxia), and, depending on cell type and regulation, can also inhibit forward ATP synthesis, thereby promoting glycolytic reprogramming and mitohormetic signaling (gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2, dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6, solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-5).

2) Mechanism of action and regulation
- pH-dependent oligomerization/activation: Matrix acidification (≈pH 6.5–6.7) drives formation of the active antiparallel IF1 dimer that binds two F1 catalytic sites; neutral/alkaline pH promotes higher-order oligomers (e.g., tetramers) that mask the N-terminal inhibitory elements, reducing binding. Histidine protonation (e.g., H49) contributes to this pH switch (Aug 2022; Frontiers in Physiology) (gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2). Reviews concur that oligomer state tightly controls inhibitory competence (Aug 2022; Antioxidants & Redox Signaling) (gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2).
- Catalytic block and binding within F1: Structural/biochemical analyses place the IF1 N-terminal inhibitory helix in a cleft of the α/β catalytic interface, contacting γ and obstructing rotary catalysis during ATP hydrolysis. IF1 can engage the empty βE site and, after two ATP hydrolysis steps (two 120° rotations), fully insert to lock the motor (Apr 2021; Biochem. Soc. Trans.) (solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8).
- Post-translational regulation (Ser39): Phosphorylation of IF1 Ser39 by a mitochondrial PKA-like activity prevents IF1–ATP synthase binding and blocks inhibitory action. Dephosphorylated IF1 is active and associates with the enzyme; several cancers show dephosphorylated (active) IF1. A 2024 review strongly emphasizes S39 phosphorylation as an in vivo regulatory switch linked to the Warburg phenotype (Feb 2024; Cancers) and prior in vivo reports of mitochondrial cAMP–PKA activity (cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14, gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 2-5).
- Additional interface (OSCP) and apoptosis control: In respiring mitochondria from cancer cells, IF1 binds the ATP synthase OSCP subunit (N-terminus), distinct from classical F1 binding. NMR mapping localizes the interface (IF1 E29–R39; OSCP A53–I64), and genetic loss of IF1 sensitizes to permeability transition pore opening and apoptosis without altering oligomycin-sensitive respiration, indicating a structural, protective role of the IF1–OSCP contact under OXPHOS conditions (Jan 2023; Cell Death & Disease) (galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4).

3) Structural/assembly insights (cryo-EM and organization)
- ATP synthase organization and IF1-bound assemblies: Modern cryo-EM has revealed mammalian ATP synthase dimers/oligomers that bend cristae membranes. Reviews summarizing these structures highlight IF1 bound to ATP synthase within higher-order assemblies and discuss how IF1-associated oligomerization could stabilize cristae architecture and modulate activity states (Apr 2021; Biochem. Soc. Trans.; Aug 2022; Front. Physiol.) (solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8, gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2).
- Spatial distribution concept: Functional studies indicate IF1 promotes oligomerization and may segregate inactive (“sluggish”) ATP synthase pools, often localized to cristae microdomains, thereby contributing to membrane potential heterogeneity; these phenomena are discussed in recent reviews on the ATP synthase/IF1 axis in cancer (Jul 2023; Cancers) (dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6).

4) Subcellular localization and tissue expression
- Localization: IF1 is mitochondrial, acting on the matrix side of the F1 catalytic domain and at the peripheral stalk OSCP interface under certain conditions in human cancer cells (galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4, solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8).
- Tissue expression: Reviews document tissue-restricted and species-divergent expression; human heart and brain can exhibit relatively high IF1 protein content compared to liver/kidney, while mice often show lower IF1 in some tissues. Expression is subject to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, leading to variable IF1:ATP synthase ratios between tissues and species (Aug 2022; Front. Physiol.; Aug 2022; Antioxid. Redox Signal.) (gatto2022thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-2, gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2).

5) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Cancer cell survival via OSCP binding (2023): Demonstration that IF1 binds OSCP in respiring mitochondria and protects cancer cells from PTP-dependent apoptosis; IF1 loss reduces tumorigenicity in soft agar and zebrafish xenografts. Mapping of the IF1–OSCP interface supports a defined druggable surface (Jan 2023; Cell Death & Disease) (galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4).
- Peptide disruption of IF1–OSCP (2024): Mitochondria-targeted peptides were engineered to displace IF1 from OSCP; one peptide bound the OSCP N-terminus overlapping the IF1 region, modulating permeability transition in HeLa cells without impairing respiration—proof-of-concept for therapeutics targeting the IF1–OSCP axis (Apr 2024; Int. J. Mol. Sci.) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16).
- IF1 regulation and Warburg effect (2024): A contemporaneous review consolidates evidence that IF1 contributes to the Warburg effect by inhibiting a fraction of ATP synthase under normoxia and that S39 phosphorylation by mitochondrial PKA inactivates IF1, providing a regulatory logic for toggling ATP synthase activity and glycolytic reprogramming (Feb 2024; Cancers) (cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14).
- State-of-the-field oncology review (2023): The ATP synthase/IF1 axis is highlighted as a context-dependent driver of tumor progression and as a target for metabolic therapy; emphasis is placed on cell-type specificity of IF1’s effects on metastasis and apoptosis (Jul 2023; Cancers) (dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting of the IF1–OSCP interface: 2024 peptide studies show feasibility of selectively displacing IF1 from ATP synthase to sensitize cancer mitochondria to mPT without broadly inhibiting respiration, suggesting a novel class of mitochondria-targeted therapeutics (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16).
- Biomarker potential: Reviews note the use of IF1 levels as a biomarker in cardiovascular disease and the broader proposition of IF1 as a cancer biomarker, though clinical implementation requires further validation (Aug 2022; Antioxidants & Redox Signaling; Jul 2023; Cancers) (gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2, dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Consensus and controversy: High-quality reviews converge that IF1 is a central regulator of ATP synthase with strong pH- and phosphorylation-dependent control. There is an ongoing, evidence-based debate regarding the extent to which IF1 inhibits ATP synthesis under normoxia across cell types; recent reviews articulate the case for in vivo inhibition of a subset of ATP synthase molecules contributing to glycolytic reprogramming, balanced against studies emphasizing a primary role only during reverse (hydrolytic) operation (Apr 2021; Biochem. Soc. Trans.; Aug 2022; Antioxid. Redox Signal.; Jul 2023 and Feb 2024; Cancers) (solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 1-5, gore2022themultifacetedatpase pages 1-2, dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6, cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14).

8) Relevant statistics and quantitative data from recent studies
- OSCP binding and tumor biology (2023): In HeLa cells, IF1 deletion did not change oligomycin-sensitive respiration but increased sensitivity to PTP opening; IF1 supported anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in zebrafish xenografts (directional outcomes reported; precise effect sizes not provided in our excerpts) (Jan 2023; Cell Death & Disease) (galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4).
- Peptide displacement (2024): Peptides that disrupt IF1–OSCP reduced mitochondrial permeability transition in situ in HeLa cells (qualitative and directional effects reported; detailed numeric effect sizes not captured in excerpt) (Apr 2024; Int. J. Mol. Sci.) (grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16).
- Note on limitations: Additional 2023–2024 quantitative findings (e.g., in immune cells, AML chemoresistance, heart failure, brown adipose thermogenesis, β-cell function) were referenced in planning but were not retrievable within the present evidence set; therefore, they are not reported here to maintain citation fidelity (pqac-IDs unavailable for those specific claims).

Conclusions and open questions (anchored in current evidence)
- ATP5IF1 (IF1) is a validated mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor in humans, with strong, recent support for nuanced in vivo regulation via pH-dependent oligomerization and Ser39 phosphorylation. In cancer models, IF1 also binds OSCP during OXPHOS to suppress permeability transition and apoptosis, offering a druggable interface now probed by mitochondria-targeted peptides. Unresolved points include the breadth of IF1-mediated inhibition of ATP synthesis under normoxia across tissues and the clinical utility of modulating S39 phosphorylation or OSCP interaction in patients. Targeted, mechanism-informed trials will be needed to translate these insights (solaini2021thef1foatpaseinhibitor pages 5-8, cuezva2024theatpaseinhibitory pages 12-14, galber2023themitochondrialinhibitor pages 2-4, grandi2024peptidestargetingthe pages 15-16, dominguezzorita2023themitochondrialatp pages 4-6).
