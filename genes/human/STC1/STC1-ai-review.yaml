description: >-
  Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is a secreted homodimeric glycoprotein hormone of the stanniocalcin family,
  originally characterized as a calcium-regulating hormone in fish and now known to function as a
  pleiotropic autocrine/paracrine regulator in mammals. STC1 stimulates renal phosphate reabsorption
  and inhibits calcium ion transport, contributing to mineral homeostasis. Recent work has identified
  STC1 as a potent inhibitor (Ki = 68 pM) of the metalloproteinase PAPP-A, thereby modulating IGF
  signaling through preventing cleavage of IGF-binding proteins. STC1 also functions as a selective
  modulator of HGF-induced angiogenic responses and inhibits transendothelial migration of
  inflammatory cells. The protein is widely expressed and is upregulated under hypoxia/stress
  conditions. In the heart, STC1 inhibits L-type calcium channels and may contribute to cardiac
  calcium homeostasis.

        IBA annotation inferred from phylogenetic analysis. STC1 was originally characterized as a
        calcium-regulating hormone in fish where it functions in preventing hypercalcemia [PMID:8700837].
        Human STC1 has been shown to reversibly inhibit transmembrane calcium currents through L-channels
        in cardiomyocytes, slowing endogenous beating rate and diminishing intracellular calcium rise
        with each contraction [PMID:12663264]. The role in intracellular calcium homeostasis is well
        supported by experimental evidence across the stanniocalcin family.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a core conserved function of the stanniocalcin family. Multiple studies demonstrate
        STC1's role in calcium homeostasis - it inhibits calcium uptake in fish [PMID:8700837] and
        inhibits L-channel calcium currents in mammalian cardiomyocytes [PMID:12663264]. The IBA
        annotation appropriately captures this evolutionarily conserved function.

        IBA annotation for cellular component. STC1 is a secreted glycoprotein hormone, consistent
        with its localization to the extracellular space. UniProt clearly indicates "Secreted" as

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the receptor for STC1 in mammalian tissues beyond Notch1? While Notch1 has been
      identified as a receptor in cancer contexts, the broader receptor landscape for STC1
      remains incompletely defined. Understanding the receptor(s) would clarify the signaling mechanism.

  - question: >-
      Does the PAPP-A inhibitory function of STC1 contribute to its effects on bone growth?
      STC1 overexpression causes dwarfism, and STC1 inhibits PAPP-A which regulates IGF signaling.
      It is unclear if growth effects are primarily through phosphate transport or IGF axis modulation.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Test whether STC1 effects on chondrocyte proliferation are blocked by PAPP-A
      overexpression to determine if PAPP-A inhibition contributes to growth plate effects.
      If PAPP-A inhibition is the mechanism, excess PAPP-A should rescue STC1-mediated
      growth suppression.
    hypothesis: >-
      PAPP-A inhibition contributes to STC1-mediated growth suppression in chondrocytes

  - description: >-
      Identify the primary receptor for STC1 in endothelial cells using crosslinking
      and mass spectrometry approaches to identify endothelial cell surface receptor(s)
