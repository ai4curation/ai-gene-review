## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P52823
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stanniocalcin-1; Short=STC-1; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=STC1; Synonyms=STC;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the stanniocalcin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Stanniocalcin. (IPR004978); Stanniocalcin (PF03298)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "STC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'STC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **STC1** (gene ID: STC1, UniProt: P52823) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and identity verification
- Target verified: STC1 (stanniocalcin-1) is a human secreted glycoprotein hormone of the stanniocalcin family, encoded on chromosome 8p11.2–p21, ubiquitously expressed, and functioning largely via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms; these features align with UniProt P52823 and stanniocalcin family/domain annotations (reviewed in 2024) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular class and structure: STC1 is a dimeric, heavily glycosylated secreted phosphoprotein of the stanniocalcin family. Human STC1 contains multiple conserved cysteines and is secreted to the extracellular milieu; it can bind a membrane protein, be internalized, and localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; doi:10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Localization and secretion: STC1 is secreted from human cells (e.g., fibrosarcoma) and detected broadly in human tissues (brain, thymus, spleen, parathyroid, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, gut, placenta, reproductive organs) (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Core biology: Originally described for mineral handling, STC1 is now established as a pleiotropic cytokine-like hormone modulating cell survival, stress responses, and immune interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including macrophage differentiation/activation and phagocytosis checkpoints (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 10-10, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Notch1 as a direct receptor/partner: Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived STC1 directly binds Notch1 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, activating Notch signaling to promote cancer stemness. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in human HCC models demonstrate a physical STC1–Notch1 interaction; a feedforward loop exists in which NICD/CSL directly upregulates STC1 via the promoter, correlating with poor prognosis in patient samples (Journal of Translational Medicine, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04085-8) (bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12).
- Hypoxia and stress-associated induction: Across cancers, STC1 is linked to hypoxia-driven programs and stress responses; a 2024 review synthesizes the role of STC1 in TME remodeling and immune evasion, summarizing hypoxia-inducible regulation and macrophage-centric effects (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 10-10, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Phagocytosis checkpoint activity: STC1 functions as a phagocytosis checkpoint in tumors, modulating macrophage phagocytic balance and contributing to immune escape within the TME; multiple lines of experimental evidence in human tumors support this paradigm (reviewed 2024) (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 10-10, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Chemoresistance mechanisms in glioblastoma (GBM): In 2024, STC1 was shown to drive temozolomide (TMZ) resistance in GBM by increasing STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705), upregulating MGMT, and reducing TMZ-induced DNA damage and apoptosis; STC1 knockdown enhances TMZ sensitivity in vitro and in xenografts (Scientific Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68902-w) (duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10).
- Colorectal cancer (CRC) proliferation/metastasis and immune evasion: An Oct 2024 integrative analysis identified STC1 as a critical component of a recurrence-related gene signature; experimental validation showed that STC1 knockdown reduces proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, and mechanistically supports PD-L1–mediated immune escape (Journal of Cancer, 2024; https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.102605) (xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14).
- miRNA regulation in TNBC: miR‑606 targets STC1 and suppresses TNBC growth and metastasis in vitro and in xenografts; patient data showed opposing survival associations for miR‑606 and STC1 expression (Oncology Reports, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2023.8661) (choi2023microrna‑606inhibitsthe pages 11-11).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarkers and prognosis:
  • Meta-analysis across 16 studies (n=2,942) found high STC1 predicts worse prognosis, with pronounced effects in digestive cancers (HR 1.73; 95% CI 1.36–2.20) and nervous system tumors (HR 2.60; 95% CI 1.29–2.25) (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; synthesis of published cohorts) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
  • CRC risk-stratification and recurrence modeling: Inclusion of STC1 in an 11-gene recurrence-related signature improved prognostic and therapy response prediction across multiple CRC datasets; functionally, STC1 promoted proliferation/metastasis and immune evasion, highlighting translational utility (Journal of Cancer, 2024; https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.102605) (xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14).
  • GBM therapy resistance: STC1 expression correlated with TMZ resistance and adverse outcome; targeting STC1/STAT3–MGMT signaling is a candidate strategy to reverse chemoresistance (Scientific Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68902-w) (duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10).
- TME-targeted strategies: The STC1–Notch1 feedforward loop in HCC underscores a druggable stromal–tumor axis; genetic or pharmacologic Notch blockade (e.g., γ-secretase inhibitor RO4929097) attenuated STC1-driven stemness in model systems (Journal of Translational Medicine, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04085-8) (bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Comprehensive immune-oncology perspective: A 2024 Frontiers in Immunology review consolidates evidence that STC1 is an emerging phagocytosis checkpoint acting via macrophages, integrates mechanistic reports (e.g., secretion, mitochondrial targeting, pathway crosstalk), and interprets multi-cohort clinical data linking high STC1 to poor outcomes in several cancers (https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 10-10, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic consensus points drawn from recent primary studies:
  • Direct receptor engagement: STC1 directly binds Notch1 on human cancer cells, establishing a signaling feedforward loop (J Transl Med, 2023) (bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12).
  • Therapy resistance signaling: STC1 drives STAT3–MGMT chemoresistance in GBM (Sci Rep, 2024) (duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10).
  • Immune escape: In CRC and other tumors, STC1 supports immune evasion, including PD-L1 upregulation and macrophage-linked suppression of phagocytosis (Journal of Cancer, 2024; review 2024) (xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- Prognostic meta-analysis: High STC1 associated with worse overall survival—digestive cancers HR 1.73 (95% CI 1.36–2.20), nervous system tumors HR 2.60 (95% CI 1.29–2.25) (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; meta-analysis summarized) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- CRC functional and prognostic data: STC1 knockdown reduced proliferation and metastasis; the STC1-containing 11-gene signature predicted overall and disease-free survival, with higher scores correlating with stage and poor outcomes across validation cohorts (Journal of Cancer, 2024; https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.102605) (xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14).
- GBM chemoresistance: STC1 overexpression increased p‑STAT3 and MGMT, decreased TMZ-induced DNA damage; STC1 depletion enhanced TMZ response in vitro and in intracranial models (Scientific Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68902-w) (duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10).

Pathways and mechanisms (concise mechanistic map)
- Mineral handling and endocrine crosstalk: Although human STC1’s systemic mineral regulatory role remains less defined than in fish, its secreted, glycoprotein hormone nature and tissue distribution match conserved stanniocalcin biology (review 2024) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- Notch signaling: Direct STC1 binding to Notch1 activates Notch target programs and reinforces STC1 transcription through CSL binding, supporting stemness and therapy resistance in HCC (J Transl Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-023-04085-8) (bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12).
- Stress, hypoxia, and immune regulation: STC1 is upregulated by hypoxia/stress pathways and operates in the TME to modulate macrophage activation and phagocytic checkpoints, contributing to immune escape (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 10-10, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).
- DNA repair/chemoresistance axis in GBM: STC1 augments STAT3 activity, elevates MGMT, and blunts alkylator-induced DNA damage (Scientific Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68902-w) (duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10).
- PD-L1 and immune evasion in CRC: STC1 contributes to PD-L1 upregulation and pro-metastatic programs, linking tumor-intrinsic signaling to immune suppression (Journal of Cancer, 2024; https://doi.org/10.7150/jca.102605) (xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14).

Research gaps and cautions
- Receptor landscape: Beyond the validated STC1–Notch1 binding in HCC, the broader receptor(s) for STC1 in human tissues remain incompletely defined; multiple reports suggest cell-surface binding with internalization and mitochondrial targeting, but high-affinity receptors outside Notch1 are still under active investigation (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1510182; J Transl Med, 2023) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3, bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12).
- Canonical endocrine functions in humans: STC1’s systemic roles in calcium/phosphate homeostasis in humans are not yet as mechanistically established as in fish; current evidence emphasizes local autocrine/paracrine actions in stress response and tumor biology (review 2024) (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3).

Summary
Human STC1 (UniProt P52823) is a secreted, glycosylated stanniocalcin-family hormone with widespread expression and autocrine/paracrine actions. Recent work clarifies that STC1 directly binds Notch1 to drive stemness in HCC, acts as an immune phagocytosis checkpoint through macrophage-centered TME remodeling, and confers chemoresistance in GBM via STAT3–MGMT activation. Clinically, high STC1 is repeatedly associated with worse outcomes across cancers, with recent 2023–2024 studies providing mechanistic depth and prognostic/therapeutic implications. Together, these advances position STC1 as a promising biomarker and candidate target in oncology, while its full receptor repertoire and systemic endocrine roles in humans remain active areas of research (wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 1-2, wang2024stanniocalcin1intumor pages 2-3, bai2023thestromaltumoramplifying pages 7-12, duan2024stanniocalcin1promotestemozolomide pages 8-10, xu2024integrativeanalysisof pages 12-14, choi2023microrna‑606inhibitsthe pages 11-11).
