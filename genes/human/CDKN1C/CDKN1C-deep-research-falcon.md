## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P49918
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C; AltName: Full=Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57; AltName: Full=p57Kip2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CDKN1C; Synonyms=KIP2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the CDI family. .
- **Key Domains:** CDI_dom. (IPR003175); CDI_dom_sf. (IPR044898); CDI (PF02234)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CDKN1C" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CDKN1C' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CDKN1C** (gene ID: CDKN1C, UniProt: P49918) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity and organism: The target is human CDKN1C (UniProt P49918), also known as p57Kip2, a member of the CIP/KIP cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family; this matches the protein description and organism Homo sapiens and aligns with family/domain expectations for CIP/KIP proteins (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24)

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Gene/protein and family: CDKN1C encodes p57Kip2, the least-studied member of the CIP/KIP family (with p21Cip1 and p27Kip1). It is a classical cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that binds Cyclin–CDK complexes to restrain cell-cycle progression, principally at the G1–S transition. It also interacts with PCNA via its C-terminal domain to influence DNA replication-associated processes. Structurally, p57Kip2 contains an N-terminal CDK inhibitory (CDI) region, a central proline/alanine-rich PAPA repeat region, and a C-terminal QT domain that includes a PCNA-binding site. These features match the expected CDI family/domain architecture noted for CIP/KIP proteins. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Canonical function and specificity: p57Kip2 inhibits Cyclin–CDK complexes; in particular, it regulates CDK2- and CDK4/6-containing complexes that govern G1 control, with roles both in inhibiting kinase activity and, contextually, in modulating assembly of Cyclin D–CDK4/6. Non-canonical functions include binding PCNA and roles in differentiation and apoptosis described across developmental contexts. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Subcellular localization: p57Kip2’s cell-cycle inhibitory activity is predominantly nuclear; localization and function are modulated by post-translational modifications (notably phosphorylation) and interacting proteins. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Genomic imprinting and locus context: CDKN1C resides at 11p15.5 in the imprinted IC2 (also called KCNQ1OT1:TSS-DMR/KvDMR1) domain and is primarily expressed from the maternal allele. DNA methylation at IC2 and transcription of the antisense lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 mediate paternal-allele silencing across the domain, including CDKN1C; loss of imprinting (LoI) through hypomethylation or chromatin perturbation can derepress the normally silent allele. (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6; Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Drug-induced loss of imprinting: Using bioluminescent reporters of Cdkn1c, Dimond et al. showed that chromatin-modifying drugs (e.g., DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, BET inhibitors, KDM6 inhibition) can induce paternal Cdkn1c activation in a cell-type–specific manner; imprinting memory is often restored after drug removal, with some sustained effects depending on the perturbation and cellular context (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). These data underscore the layered chromatin requirements for maintaining CDKN1C imprinting relevant to human IC2/KCNQ1OT1 regulation. (dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)
- Updated mechanistic synthesis for CIP/KIP inhibitors: A 2024 review details CDKN1C transcriptional activators (E2F1, SP1, HIF-α, TGF-β, MyoD) and repressors (Jab1/Csn5, HES1), epigenetic repression via DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, and post-translational regulation (SCF–Skp2–Cks1-mediated ubiquitination following Cyclin E–CDK2 phosphorylation; additional F-box E3s; Akt- and p38-linked phosphorylation sites) that collectively tune p57Kip2 localization, stability, and interactions (Cell Division, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24)
- Developmental and disease context consolidation: The 2024 review also integrates evidence for p57Kip2 roles in differentiation (myogenic, neuronal) and tumor biology, including links between low p57 expression and adverse outcomes in several cancers, and the concept that p57-high quiescent tumor cells may contribute to recurrence, emphasizing therapeutic implications of modulating p57 levels or stability (Cell Division, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Epigenetic modulation and imprinting stability: The drug-perturbation framework from Dimond et al. offers a tractable platform to test how candidate therapeutics or environmental exposures might disrupt or restore CDKN1C imprinting, informing safety screens in early development and precision strategies for imprinting disorders. Notably, most drug-induced LoI was reversible upon removal, highlighting resilience but also context-specific vulnerabilities (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). (dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)
- Translational genetics: Clinical sequencing continues to identify CDKN1C variants linked to human growth and metabolic phenotypes. A family bearing a missense variant in the PCNA-interaction region presented intrauterine growth restriction, proportional short stature, and early-adulthood-onset diabetes, illustrating maternal-allele dependence and variable endocrine manifestations relevant to personalized monitoring and counseling (J Clin Endocrinol Metab, Oct 2014; https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-1949). (kerns2014anovelvariant pages 1-2)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative synthesis on CDKN1C regulation and functions: The Cell Division 2024 review frames CDKN1C/p57Kip2 as a bona fide tumor suppressor with extensive, context-dependent regulation at transcriptional, epigenetic, and post-translational levels, and emphasizes the need to harness its tumor-suppressive functions while preventing potential tumor-enhancing contexts (Cell Division, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Imprinting regulation and LoI: The 2023 experimental platform supports a nuanced view that distinct chromatin features and modifying enzymes enact and propagate imprinting memory at CDKN1C, differing across cell types—an expert-level insight into how imprinting might be perturbed by treatments and stress (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). (dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Drug-induced imprinting changes: Dimond et al. directly visualize allelic changes using reporters and show agent-specific and cell-type–specific derepression of the paternal Cdkn1c allele with partial or full reversibility upon drug withdrawal; while quantitative percentages vary by condition, the central finding is robust across multiple perturbations and cell types (Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). (dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)
- Clinical genetics data point: In the growth-restricted family, segregation analysis linked disease to an 11p15 locus and CDKN1C missense variation in the PCNA region with maternal-allele dependence; the study documents co-segregation and clinical parameters including stature and metabolic traits (J Clin Endocrinol Metab, Oct 2014; https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-1949). (kerns2014anovelvariant pages 1-2)

Mechanistic details: pathway role, structure–function, localization
- Pathway position: p57Kip2 restrains Cyclin E–CDK2 and Cyclin D–CDK4/6 activities to enforce G1 control and cell-cycle exit, thereby influencing differentiation decisions; its C-terminal PCNA interaction contributes to replication-associated control. This reflects its role as a checkpoint in developmental lineages and in tumor suppression. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Structure–function: The N-terminal CDI domain binds Cyclin–CDK complexes; the central PAPA repeats are a human-specific proline/alanine-rich segment; the C-terminal QT/PCNA-binding region mediates PCNA-dependent functions and harbors disease-associated variants that alter stability or interactions. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 8-9, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
- Localization and regulation: Predominantly nuclear, with localization dynamically controlled by phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions; multiple kinases and E3 ligases regulate abundance and compartmentalization, shaping its inhibitory function in vivo. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)

Disease associations and imprinting disorders
- Beckwith–Wiedemann spectrum (BWS/BWSp): CDKN1C loss-of-function (usually on the maternal allele) is a recognized cause of BWS within the 11p15 imprinting domain; epigenetic IC2 alterations and KCNQ1OT1-mediated silencing can also reduce CDKN1C expression. While precise frequency fractions vary by cohort and testing strategy, CDKN1C is a key disease gene in the 11p15 IC2 domain. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z; Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11, dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)
- IMAGe syndrome and Silver–Russell presentations: Gain-of-function variants clustered in the PCNA-binding region have been linked to undergrowth disorders; Kerns et al. identified a PCNA-region variant associated with intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, and early-adulthood-onset diabetes, illustrating a spectrum of growth and endocrine phenotypes tied to CDKN1C dosage and interaction surfaces. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab, Oct 2014; https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-1949). (kerns2014anovelvariant pages 1-2)

Regulatory network highlights
- Transcriptional and epigenetic control: Activators include E2F1, SP1, HIF-α, TGF-β, and MyoD; repressors include Jab1/Csn5 and HES1. Epigenetic silencing (promoter CpG methylation, histone deacetylation) and IC2/KCNQ1OT1-mediated imprinting collectively reduce expression in many tumor settings. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z; Scientific Reports, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32747-6). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24, dimond2023druginducedlossof pages 12-13)
- Post-translational control: SCF–Skp2–Cks1 and other E3 ubiquitin ligases mediate degradation following specific phosphorylations; Akt- and p38-linked sites and mitotic C-terminal sites modulate stability and localization, fine-tuning CDK inhibition in time and space. (Cell Division review, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13008-024-00115-z). (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)

Notes on evidence scope
- Quantitative frequencies of CDKN1C variant classes in BWS cohorts and formal surveillance recommendations for tumor predisposition syndromes could not be precisely cited here from 2023–2024 position papers, as those specific documents were not available in the current evidence set. Where needed, I referenced authoritative reviews and primary studies within the available context. (csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 23-24, csergeova2024cipkipandink4 pages 9-11)
