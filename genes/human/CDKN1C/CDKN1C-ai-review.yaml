description: CDKN1C encodes p57Kip2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor of the CIP/Kip family that functions
  as a tumor suppressor by binding to and inhibiting cyclin/CDK complexes, particularly cyclin E/CDK2,
  cyclin A/CDK2, and cyclin D/CDK4. The N-terminal kinase inhibitory domain (KID) blocks ATP binding to
  CDKs through molecular mimicry. The protein contains a unique PAPA (proline-alanine repeat) domain,
  a QT box mediating additional protein interactions, bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS), and
  a C-terminal PCNA-binding domain. p57Kip2 dynamically shuttles between cytoplasm (during proliferation)
  and nucleus (during differentiation) to regulate cell cycle exit. The gene is imprinted and expressed
  exclusively from the maternal allele; loss-of-function mutations cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and
  IMAGe syndrome. Beyond CDK inhibition, p57Kip2 inhibits JNK/SAPK signaling independently and regulates
  E2F1-mediated transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation.

  review:
    summary: Positive regulation of TGF-beta signaling - p57Kip2 mediates TGF-beta-induced growth arrest.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Related to TGF-beta pathway but p57Kip2 is downstream effector of TGF-beta signaling rather
      than a direct pathway regulator.

      supporting_text: silencing of p57 and p15 is associated with marked phenotypic changes in the nucleus
        and cytoplasm in response to TGF-βs, indicating that p57 and p15 are critical downstream mediators
        of TGF-βs in primary cultured human limbal epithelial cells

  review:
    summary: Negative regulation of epithelial cell proliferation from limbal epithelial study.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct. Study demonstrated p57Kip2 inhibits proliferation of limbal epithelial cells.

      supporting_text: These findings demonstrate that TGF-β1 and/or TGF-β2 inhibit proliferation of primary
        cultured human limbal epithelial cells and that p57 and p15 play roles in this process
