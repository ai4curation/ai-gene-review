## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UHV9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Prefoldin subunit 2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PFDN2; Synonyms=PFD2; ORFNames=HSPC231;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the prefoldin subunit beta family.
- **Key Domains:** PFD2. (IPR027235); PFD_beta-like. (IPR002777); Prefoldin. (IPR009053); Prefoldin_2 (PF01920)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PFDN2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PFDN2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PFDN2** (gene ID: PFDN2, UniProt: Q9UHV9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We first verified the target identity to avoid gene symbol ambiguity. Human PFDN2 (UniProt Q9UHV9) encodes prefoldin subunit 2, a beta-class subunit of the canonical heterohexameric prefoldin complex (alpha subunits PFDN3/PFDN5; beta subunits PFDN1/PFDN2/PFDN4/PFDN6) in Homo sapiens, consistent with membership in the prefoldin beta family and associated domains noted for this subunit (IPR002777, IPR009053) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 1-2, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report on PFDN2 (Homo sapiens)
1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and complex architecture: Prefoldin (PFDN) is an evolutionarily conserved heterohexameric co-chaperone that functions as an ATP-independent holdase. Eukaryotic canonical prefoldin is built from two alpha and four beta subunits; PFDN2 is one of the four beta subunits in the human canonical complex (and is also represented in prefoldin-like assemblies) (iScience, Nov 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 1-2). Reviews corroborate the composition (alpha: PFD3, PFD5; beta: PFD1, PFD2, PFD4, PFD6) and jellyfish-like architecture that captures non-native polypeptides via coiled tentacles (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Jan 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214) (tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2) and (PLOS Genetics, Nov 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009183) (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).
- Canonical function—client delivery to TRiC/CCT: In eukaryotes, the canonical role of prefoldin is to bind nascent, non-native actin and tubulin chains co-translationally and deliver them to the group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding. This division of labor is well established biochemically and structurally, and depletion of prefoldin subunits perturbs cytoskeletal assembly in human cells (iScience, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 2-3, herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 1-2, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2).
- Non-canonical functions: Beyond cytosolic proteostasis, prefoldin subunits (including PFDN2) localize to the nucleus and contribute to transcriptional regulation and co-transcriptional RNA processing. Prefoldin associates with transcribed chromatin and supports efficient elongation-linked splicing by sustaining RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) CTD phosphorylation states and recruiting splicing factors (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Ultra-deep proteomic mapping of human prefoldin assemblies (2024): Using DIP-MS, a single-experiment, deep interactome profiling approach, a comprehensive map of human prefoldin family complexes centered on PFDN2 was generated. The study resolved holo- and subcomplex variants, identified alternative assemblies (including a prefoldin homolog complex), and quantified coelution/co-association with TRiC/CCT and known substrates such as tubulin (TUBB2B). Replicate-resolved interaction probabilities and structural modeling aligned predicted assemblies to experimental prefoldin structures (Nature Methods, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y) (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8).
- Canonical and nuclear roles consolidated: Contemporary reviews and functional studies continue to support prefoldin’s dual life in cytosol and nucleus, with evidence that prefoldin’s impact extends to transcription elongation-coupled splicing and global gene expression programs in human cells, including direct perturbation with PFDN2 siRNA (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4) and updated syntheses of canonical cytoskeletal client handling (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214) (tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 2-3, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Proteostasis and cytoskeletal integrity: Prefoldin’s support of actin/tubulin folding is fundamental to cell division and motility. Experimental perturbation of prefoldin subunits (including the beta subfamily to which PFDN2 belongs) leads to microtubule abnormalities and aggregation-prone states for certain client proteins, highlighting potential leverage points for cell biology tools and disease modeling (iScience, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273; PLOS Genetics, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009183) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).
- Complex-centric proteomics: DIP-MS can be used to deconvolute prefoldin isoforms and interaction partners in a single experiment, enabling systems-level dissection of prefoldin function or dysfunction in disease models and drug perturbations (Nature Methods, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y) (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8).
- Nuclear gene regulation: The demonstration that prefoldin supports RNAPII CTD Ser2/Ser5 phosphorylation and co-transcriptional splicing suggests applications where PFDN2 perturbation serves as a tool to modulate elongation rate and splicing efficiency in mammalian gene expression studies (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic consensus: Authoritative reviews converge on the model that canonical prefoldin binds nascent cytoskeletal clients and hands them to TRiC/CCT, acting as an ATP-independent holdase that increases the efficiency of cytoskeletal protein maturation. Eukaryotic prefoldin shows specialized recognition properties compared with archaeal homologs, reflecting adaptation to actin/tubulin clients (iScience, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 2-3, herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 1-2, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2).
- Nuclear roles are substantive: Functional genomics in human cells indicates prefoldin subunits (including PFDN2) are integral to transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing by maintaining RNAPII CTD phosphorylation and recruiting splicing factors to chromatin, extending the prefoldin paradigm into gene regulation (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).
- Client spectrum beyond cytoskeleton: Prefoldin can stabilize tumor suppressor VHL against aggregation and degradation, expanding the functional client pool and pathophysiological relevance (PLOS Genetics, Nov 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009183) (chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Complex architecture and interactions (2024): DIP-MS quantified interaction probabilities across the prefoldin family, resolving distinct prefoldin isoforms, with coelution-based association to TRiC/CCT and known clients, validated in n=3 biologically independent experiments. Structural modeling of alternative assemblies yielded TM-scores consistent with similarity to experimentally determined prefoldin structures, supporting the existence of variant complexes incorporating PFDN2 (Nature Methods, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y) (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8).
- Functional impact on gene expression: siRNA depletion targeting PFDN2 or PFDN5 in HCT116 cells produced genome-wide transcriptional changes with “severe pre-mRNA splicing defects,” most evident after serum stimulation; mechanistically, loss of prefoldin decreased RNAPII CTD Ser2/Ser5 phosphorylation and reduced chromatin association of U2AF65 and PRP19, impairing co-transcriptional splicing of long, intron-rich genes (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).
- Efficiency of cytoskeletal folding: Expert synthesis estimates that prefoldin activity enhances cytoskeletal folding efficiency (e.g., actin/tubulin) several-fold compared with spontaneous folding, consistent with prefoldin’s role as a holdase that routes clients to TRiC/CCT; depletion causes microtubule assembly defects (iScience, Nov 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7).

Function, pathways, and localization of PFDN2
- Primary function: PFDN2 is a structural subunit of the canonical eukaryotic prefoldin holdase. It contributes to the capture of nascent or non-native polypeptides—principally cytoskeletal actins and tubulins—and their targeted delivery to TRiC/CCT, which completes ATP-dependent folding. This positions PFDN2 upstream in the cytosolic chaperone network governing cytoskeletal proteostasis (iScience, 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 2-3, herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 1-2, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2).
- Interacting partners and clients: Partners include TRiC/CCT subunits and cytoskeletal clients (actin/tubulin); modern proteomic mapping detects co-association of PFDN2-containing complexes with TRiC/CCT and tubulin subunits. Prefoldin can also act on additional clients such as VHL, stabilizing it against aggregation (Nature Methods, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y; PLOS Genetics, Nov 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009183) (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).
- Subcellular localization: Prefoldin functions in the cytosol in co-translational capture and transfer of nascent chains. In addition, prefoldin subunits, including PFDN2, are detected on transcribed chromatin in the nucleus, where they support transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing via effects on RNAPII CTD phosphorylation and splicing factor recruitment (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.816214; Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 2-3, tahmaz2022prefoldinfunctionin pages 1-2, payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).
- Pathways: PFDN2 participates in the proteostasis pathway that couples ribosome-associated nascent chain capture (holdase) to group II chaperonin-mediated folding (TRiC/CCT). In the nucleus, PFDN2 contributes to transcription elongation-coupled splicing by maintaining RNAPII CTD phosphorylation states and enabling recruitment of U2AF65/PRP19, impacting gene expression programs, especially for long, intron-rich genes (Nucleic Acids Research, Jun 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.150466) (payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).

Disease relevance and translational notes
- Cancer biology links: Prefoldin family members are implicated in tumorigenesis through effects on cytoskeletal dynamics and client maturation; downregulation or dysfunction leads to cytoskeletal defects, and prefoldin interacts with the tumor suppressor VHL, stabilizing it against aggregation. While PFDN2-specific prognostic statistics vary across studies and tumor types, the established client spectrum (cytoskeleton, VHL) and nuclear gene-regulatory functions position PFDN2 as a potential contributor to cancer phenotypes when dysregulated (iScience, Nov 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103273; PLOS Genetics, Nov 2020; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009183) (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, chesnel2020theprefoldincomplex pages 1-2).
- Systems proteomics utility: DIP-MS provides quantifiable interaction maps that can help track prefoldin (and PFDN2) complex remodeling in disease models or under therapeutic perturbations, potentially informing biomarker or target discovery (Nature Methods, Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02211-y) (fabian2024dipmsultradeepinteraction pages 7-8).

Limitations and open questions
- Although broad roles of prefoldin and its nuclear functions are supported, PFDN2-specific disease associations and quantitative clinical statistics remain less comprehensive in recent primary literature within the retrieved corpus. Further targeted analyses of tumor cohorts and perturbation studies focusing specifically on PFDN2 would refine prognostic and mechanistic inferences (herranzmontoya2021acomprehensiveanalysis pages 5-7, payanbravo2021humanprefoldinmodulates pages 1-4).
