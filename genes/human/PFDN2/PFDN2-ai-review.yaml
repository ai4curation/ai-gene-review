description: >-
  Prefoldin subunit 2 (PFDN2) is a beta-class subunit of the canonical heterohexameric prefoldin
  co-chaperone complex (2 alpha + 4 beta subunits). Prefoldin functions as an ATP-independent
  holdase that captures nascent or unfolded polypeptides, principally actin and tubulin, and
  delivers them to the group II chaperonin TRiC/CCT for ATP-dependent folding. PFDN2 also
  participates in the PAQosome (prefoldin-like/R2TP complex) involved in biogenesis of
  multisubunit complexes. Beyond cytosolic proteostasis, PFDN2 localizes to the nucleus where
  the prefoldin complex supports transcription elongation and co-transcriptional splicing.

    summary: >-
      IDA annotation for negative regulation of amyloid fibril formation from Sorgjerd et al.
      (2013). The study showed hPFD inhibits Abeta fibrillation in vitro. This is a property
      of the intact complex and reflects the general anti-aggregation holdase function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This reflects in vitro anti-aggregation activity of the prefoldin complex rather than
      a primary physiological function. It is a secondary consequence of the holdase activity.
      The annotation is not wrong but represents a non-core function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IPI annotation for protein folding chaperone from Tsao et al. (2006). The study showed
      PFDN2 interacts with HCV F protein, and that this interaction impedes PFDN1-PFDN2
      interaction and perturbs tubulin cytoskeleton. This demonstrates PFDN2's role as a
      chaperone for tubulin folding.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation for positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization from Tsao et al.
      (2006). The study showed that disruption of PFDN2 function (by HCV F protein) leads
      to aberrant tubulin cytoskeleton organization, implying PFDN2 normally promotes
      proper cytoskeleton organization through its chaperone activity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While the study demonstrates that PFDN2 is required for proper cytoskeleton organization,
      this is a downstream consequence of its chaperone function (folding actin and tubulin)
      rather than a direct regulatory role. The annotation captures a true biological effect
      but the mechanism is indirect through protein folding.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      PFDN2 is a beta-type subunit of the heterohexameric prefoldin co-chaperone
      complex that captures unfolded nascent polypeptides (primarily actin and tubulin)
      and delivers them to the TRiC/CCT chaperonin for ATP-dependent folding. Disruption
      of PFDN1-PFDN2 interaction (e.g., by HCV F protein) leads to aberrant tubulin
      cytoskeleton organization, confirming the functional importance of PFDN2 in
      cytoskeletal protein folding.
