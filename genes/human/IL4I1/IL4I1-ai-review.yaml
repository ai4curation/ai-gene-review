description: IL4I1 (Interleukin-4-induced gene 1) encodes a secreted L-amino-acid oxidase (LAAO) belonging
  to the flavin monoamine oxidase family. The enzyme catalyzes oxidative deamination of L-amino acids
  to alpha-keto acids with concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. IL4I1 preferentially
  acts on aromatic amino acids (Phe > Tyr > Trp) and has weak activity on L-arginine. Through tryptophan
  catabolism, IL4I1 generates indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P) which gives rise to indole metabolites (IAA,
  I3A) and kynurenic acid that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). IL4I1 functions as a metabolic
  immune checkpoint, suppressing T cell activation and proliferation, promoting FoxP3+ Treg differentiation,
  and facilitating tumor immune evasion. It is secreted at the immunological synapse and expressed primarily
  by antigen-presenting cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. IL4I1 is also present
  in spermatozoa where it localizes to the acrosomal vesicle and midpiece and may regulate capacitation
  and acrosomal exocytosis.

    label: amino acid catabolic process
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IL4I1 is confirmed as an L-amino-acid oxidase that catalyzes catabolism of aromatic amino
      acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) to their respective alpha-keto acids [PMID:17356132,
      PMID:32818467, PMID:32866000]. This term is appropriately broad as IL4I1 does catabolize amino acids
      as its core enzymatic function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation for amino acid catabolic process is appropriate and supported by extensive
      experimental evidence. IL4I1 has been demonstrated to oxidize aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp)
      to their alpha-keto acid products, which constitutes amino acid catabolism. More specific annotations
      (GO:0006559, GO:0006569, GO:0006572) are also present with IDA evidence, so this broader IBA term
      is retained as phylogenetically inferred and consistent with core function.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While IL4I1 clearly participates in adaptive immune responses through its immunomodulatory

      capture IL4I1's specific roles. This broad term may be retained as non-core but is not particularly

  review:
    summary: This annotation comes from a large-scale neurodegenerative disease interactome mapping study
      that used yeast two-hybrid screening. IL4I1 was found to interact with OPTN (optineurin) and WFS1
      (wolframin) based on IntAct data. However, 'protein binding' is an uninformative term that does
      not describe functional interactions.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The term 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) is too vague to be useful for functional annotation.
      GO guidelines discourage this term as it provides no information about the nature of the binding
      or its biological relevance. The PMID:32814053 study was a high-throughput screen for neurodegenerative
      disease networks and IL4I1 is not primarily associated with neurodegeneration. The reported interactions

    summary: This annotation is inferred from sequence similarity to mouse IL4I1. While IL4I1 was originally
      identified as a B cell IL4-inducible gene, direct experimental evidence for human IL4I1 regulating
      B cell differentiation is limited.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The annotation is based on similarity to mouse ortholog. While IL4I1 is expressed in B cells

      available from the primary literature reviewed. UniProt notes IL4I1 "regulates the development and
