### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL4I1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL4I1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL4I1** (gene ID: IL4I1, UniProt: Q96RQ9) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target verification: The gene symbol IL4I1 refers to human interleukin-4-induced gene 1 (UniProt Q96RQ9), a secreted L-amino-acid oxidase in the flavin monoamine oxidase family. 2023–2024 sources consistently describe human IL4I1 as a secreted LAAO that acts on aromatic L-amino acids and is expressed by antigen-presenting cells and tumor-associated macrophages, matching the UniProt description (organism: Homo sapiens; domains consistent with FAD-dependent amine oxidases). No symbol ambiguity was detected in the surveyed literature (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18, seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, shen2024il4inducedgene1 pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and reaction: IL4I1 encodes a secreted L-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.2/1.4.3.25) that oxidizes L-amino acids to their corresponding alpha-keto acids with concomitant generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ammonia (NH3). It preferentially targets aromatic amino acids—L-phenylalanine (Phe), L-tyrosine (Tyr), and L-tryptophan (Trp)—with Phe/Tyr generally favored over Trp; Trp is oxidized to indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P) (Grobben 2024, Frontiers in Immunology, Aug 2024, doi:10.3389/fimmu.2024.1440269; Seo & Kwon 2023, Experimental & Molecular Medicine, Jul 2023, doi:10.1038/s12276-023-01028-7) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18, seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19).
- AHR-linked immunometabolism: IL4I1’s Trp metabolism provides an endogenous indole–pyruvate pathway that yields I3P and downstream indole derivatives (indole-3-aldehyde, indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-lactic acid) and kynurenic acid (KynA), which are aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists. These metabolites activate AHR signaling and contribute to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Seo & Kwon 2023; Grobben 2024) (seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, zhang2024newinsightinto pages 7-8).
- Cellular sources and location of action: IL4I1 is induced in antigen-presenting cells (APCs)—notably dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells—and is often enriched in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in solid tumors. IL4I1 contains a signal peptide and is secreted; it can also localize to lysosomes and has activity favored by acidic pH. Its immunomodulatory effects are largely mediated extracellularly/pericellularly via H2O2 and diffusible metabolites at immune interfaces (Shen et al. 2024, Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine, Sep 2024, doi:10.31083/j.rcm2509337; Ye et al. 2024, Frontiers in Immunology, Jan 2024, doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1338244) (shen2024il4inducedgene1 pages 1-2, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 15-16, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 1-2, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 16-18).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Enzymology and AHR activation: 2023–2024 reviews consolidate that IL4I1 converts Phe→phenylpyruvate, Tyr→4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, Trp→indole-3-pyruvate, producing H2O2 and NH3. IL4I1-derived indole metabolites (I3P, I3A, KynA) are potent AHR agonists; pan-cancer analyses suggest stronger association of IL4I1 expression with AHR activation than IDO/TDO in some datasets (Grobben 2024; Griffith & Frankel 2024, Cancers, Jan 2024, doi:10.3390/cancers16030472) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12).
- Tumor microenvironment roles: Single-cell and functional analyses in glioma show IL4I1 is predominantly expressed in M2-like TAMs and promotes glioma invasion/migration, correlating with immune checkpoint expression and worse prognosis (Ye et al. 2024) (ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 15-16, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 16-18, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 9-11). Pan-cancer work links high IL4I1 to increased TAM infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression (Chen et al. 2024, Discover Oncology, May 2024, doi:10.1007/s12672-024-01000-5) (chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 5-10).
- Immune regulation through Trp metabolism: 2023 synthesis emphasizes that Trp metabolites—including IL4I1-derived I3P/I3A and KynA—converge on AHR to modulate immune responses and tissue homeostasis, with implications for cancer and inflammatory disease (Seo & Kwon 2023) (seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5).

Catalytic function and substrate specificity
- Reaction: L-amino acid + O2 + H2O → alpha-keto acid + NH3 + H2O2. Preferred substrates are aromatic amino acids: Phe and Tyr (higher efficiency), Trp (lower affinity). Products include phenylpyruvic acid (from Phe), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (from Tyr), and indole-3-pyruvic acid (from Trp); H2O2 and NH3 are co-products (Grobben 2024; Seo & Kwon 2023) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18, seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19).
- AHR-activating metabolites: I3P can convert to I3A, IAA, ILA, and KynA; I3P and I3A notably act as potent AHR agonists, linking IL4I1 activity to AHR signaling (Seo & Kwon 2023; Grobben 2024) (seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, zhang2024newinsightinto pages 7-8).

Localization and where IL4I1 acts
- Expression: Highest in immune organs and in APCs; in cancers, enriched in TAMs and sometimes stromal cells. IL4I1 is secreted and also reported in lysosomal compartments; functional activity is prominent in the extracellular TME, influencing T cells and macrophage polarization via H2O2 and indole metabolites (Shen 2024; Ye 2024) (shen2024il4inducedgene1 pages 1-2, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 15-16, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 16-18).
- Site of action: At immune interfaces in the TME, IL4I1-generated H2O2 can inhibit TCR signaling and proliferation; indole metabolites activate AHR in immune/tumor cells, collectively promoting Treg differentiation, suppressing effector T cells, and favoring M2 polarization (Grobben 2024; Chen 2024) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18, chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 5-10).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker and prognostic associations (pan-cancer): IL4I1 mRNA/protein overexpression is observed across many tumors; IL4I1 levels and methylation associate with pathological stage and survival, variably by tumor type (Chen 2024, Discover Oncology, May 2024, doi:10.1007/s12672-024-01000-5) (chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 5-10, chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 14-18).
- Immunotherapy response: In bladder cancer (IMvigor210 anti–PD-L1 cohort), higher IL4I1 expression marked an inflamed TME, basal subtype, and was associated with higher immunotherapy response rates and improved survival (Peng et al. 2024, Frontiers in Pharmacology, May 2024, doi:10.3389/fphar.2024.1365683) (peng2024il4i1anovel pages 12-13, peng2024il4i1anovel pages 13-15, peng2024il4i1anovel pages 1-2).
- Resistance contexts: IL4I1 is reported to be upregulated after anti–PD-1 therapy and may mediate resistance by suppressing CD8+ T-cell infiltration and inducing PD-1/TIM3 on T cells in ex vivo models (Grobben 2024) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18).

Translational therapies and combinations
- Direct IL4I1 inhibitors: Preclinical probes have been reported, including CB-668 (a selective oral IL4I1 inhibitor) with single-agent activity and synergy with anti–PD-L1 in mice; patent activity for IL4I1 inhibitors (WIPO filings 2021–2022) underscores translational interest (Grobben 2024) (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 29-29).
- Targeting downstream AHR: Given strong associations of IL4I1 with AHR activation, AHR inhibitors are under early clinical study; interim phase I results for the oral AHR inhibitor BAY2416964 noted 32.8% stable disease among 67 patients, highlighting activity of AHR blockade in humans (Griffith & Frankel 2024, Cancers, Jan 2024, doi:10.3390/cancers16030472) (griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12).
- Rational combinations: Reviews propose combining IL4I1 inhibition with IDO/TDO blockade or AHR inhibitors to address compensatory Trp metabolism and AHR-driven immunosuppression (Griffith & Frankel 2024; Grobben 2024) (griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Immunometabolism consensus: 2023–2024 reviews converge on IL4I1 as a metabolic immune checkpoint, with a broader and often stronger linkage to AHR activation than IDO/TDO in some tumor contexts; this may underlie limited efficacy of IDO1 inhibition alone and supports combination strategies (Seo & Kwon 2023; Griffith & Frankel 2024; Grobben 2024) (seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19).
- Macrophage-centric view: Single-cell analyses emphasize IL4I1’s predominant expression in M2-like TAMs, positioning it as a TAM-associated target for immunotherapy and as a prognostic marker in glioma and other solid tumors (Ye 2024) (ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 15-16, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 16-18, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 9-11).

Relevant statistics and data
- Clinical AHR inhibitor: BAY2416964 phase I interim showed 32.8% stable disease among 67 treated patients (Griffith & Frankel 2024, summarizing clinical reports) (griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12).
- Pan-cancer correlations: IL4I1 expression/methylation correlates with survival metrics in multiple tumor types; drug-sensitivity analyses suggest associations with resistance to docetaxel and BMS-754807 and sensitivity to temozolomide (Chen 2024) (chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 14-18).
- Immunotherapy cohort: In IMvigor210 (BLCA), high IL4I1 was associated with improved ICB response and survival, consistent with an inflamed TME signature (Peng 2024) (peng2024il4i1anovel pages 13-15, peng2024il4i1anovel pages 1-2).

Conclusion
Human IL4I1 (Q96RQ9) is a secreted, FAD-dependent L-amino-acid oxidase that preferentially oxidizes aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp) to alpha-keto acids with H2O2 and NH3 production. Its tryptophan metabolism feeds an indole–pyruvate branch that generates potent AHR agonists (I3P/I3A/KynA), linking IL4I1 to immunosuppressive signaling in the tumor microenvironment. 2023–2024 studies localize IL4I1 predominantly to antigen-presenting cells and TAMs, acting extracellularly/pericellularly to inhibit effector T cells, promote Treg and M2 phenotypes, and modulate checkpoint activity. Translationally, IL4I1 serves as a prognostic/immunologic biomarker across cancers, with cohort data supporting predictive value for immunotherapy in bladder cancer, and it is implicated in resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Emerging small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., CB-668) and the clinical development of AHR inhibitors support targeting this axis, with expert analyses endorsing combinatorial strategies (IL4I1±IDO/TDO±AHR) to overcome metabolic immune evasion (grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 16-18, seo2023immuneregulationthrough pages 4-5, grobben2024targetingaminoacidmetabolizing pages 18-19, shen2024il4inducedgene1 pages 1-2, ye2024il4i1inm2like pages 15-16, chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 5-10, griffith2024thearylhydrocarbon pages 10-12, chen2024pancanceranalysisof pages 14-18, peng2024il4i1anovel pages 13-15).
