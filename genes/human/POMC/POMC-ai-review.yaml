  Pro-opiomelanocortin is a paradigm for post-translational polyprotein processing.
  A single
  267 AA precursor is proteolytically cleaved by prohormone convertases (PC1/3, PC2)
  into
  multiple bioactive peptides with distinct and sometimes ANTAGONISTIC functions.
  Key products
  include ACTH (stimulates cortisol release from adrenal cortex), alpha-MSH (anorexigenic,
  increases pigmentation via MC1R), beta-endorphin (orexigenic opiate), and met-enkephalin.
  Critically, tissue-specific processing produces different peptide combinations:
  anterior
  pituitary corticotrophs produce mainly ACTH; hypothalamic neurons produce both alpha-MSH
  (appetite suppression) and beta-endorphin (appetite stimulation). GO annotations
  at the
  gene level conflate functions that are peptide-specific - ideally annotations should
  use
  PRO ontology IDs for peptide-specific functions. POMC mutations cause obesity with
  adrenal
  insufficiency and red hair (PMID:9620771).

    Adrenocorticotropic hormone. Primary product in anterior pituitary corticotrophs.
    Stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol (glucocorticoids). ACTH binds
    MC2R (melanocortin receptor 2), which is exclusively expressed in adrenal cortex.
    This is the primary endpoint of the HPA axis. ACTH itself contains alpha-MSH
    sequence (residues 1-13 of ACTH = alpha-MSH) but ACTH is NOT further processed
    in anterior pituitary - only in intermediate pituitary is ACTH cleaved to alpha-MSH.

    ANOREXIGENIC peptide - suppresses appetite. Produced in hypothalamic arcuate
    nucleus
    (POMC neurons) and intermediate pituitary. Signals through MC4R in hypothalamus
    to
    reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. Also increases pigmentation
    via
    MC1R in melanocytes (hence red hair in POMC-deficient patients). Alpha-MSH has
    OPPOSITE effects to beta-endorphin on appetite - both are produced in the same
    hypothalamic neurons but stored in separate granules with distinct release mechanisms.

    in

# Core Function 2: HPA Axis Regulation via ACTH
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# ACTH (residues 138-176) is the primary product in anterior pituitary
# corticotrophs. ACTH binds MC2R on adrenal cortex cells to stimulate
# glucocorticoid (cortisol) release. This is the endpoint of the HPA axis.
- description: >
    Regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via the cleavage
    product ACTH (corticotropin, residues 138-176). ACTH binds MC2R
    (corticotropin receptor) on adrenal cortex cells to stimulate
    glucocorticoid (cortisol in humans) secretion. Loss of POMC causes
    isolated ACTH deficiency with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

# Core Function 3: Appetite Suppression via Alpha-MSH
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alpha-MSH (residues 138-150, contained within ACTH) is released by
# hypothalamic POMC neurons. It binds MC4R to suppress appetite and
# increase energy expenditure. This is the ANOREXIGENIC function.
- description: >
    Suppresses appetite and promotes negative energy balance via the cleavage
    product alpha-MSH (melanotropin alpha, residues 138-150). In hypothalamic
    arcuate nucleus POMC neurons, alpha-MSH is released and binds MC4R to
    reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. Loss of POMC causes
    severe early-onset obesity due to absence of this anorexigenic signal.
    Note: This is ANTAGONISTIC to beta-endorphin's orexigenic function.

    Stimulates melanin production and skin/hair pigmentation via the cleavage

# Core Function 5: Opioid Signaling and Appetite Stimulation via Beta-Endorphin
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Beta-endorphin (residues 237-267) is an endogenous opioid peptide that
# binds mu-opioid receptor. It is OREXIGENIC (stimulates appetite), which
# is ANTAGONISTIC to alpha-MSH's anorexigenic effect. Both are produced
# from the same precursor in hypothalamic neurons.
- description: >
    Functions as an endogenous opioid via the cleavage product beta-endorphin
    (residues 237-267). Beta-endorphin binds mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) to
    modulate pain perception, stress response, and reward. Critically,
    beta-endorphin is OREXIGENIC (appetite-stimulating), which is
    ANTAGONISTIC to alpha-MSH's anorexigenic function. Both peptides are
    released from the same hypothalamic POMC neurons but stored in separate
    granules with distinct release mechanisms.
