## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q7LBR1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Charged multivesicular body protein 1b; AltName: Full=CHMP1.5; AltName: Full=Chromatin-modifying protein 1b; Short=CHMP1b; AltName: Full=Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 46-2; Short=Vps46-2; Short=hVps46-2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CHMP1B; Synonyms=C18orf2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SNF7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Snf7_fam. (IPR005024); Snf7 (PF03357)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CHMP1B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CHMP1B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CHMP1B** (gene ID: CHMP1B, UniProt: Q7LBR1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
- Identity verification: CHMP1B (UniProt Q7LBR1) corresponds to the human charged multivesicular body protein 1b, an ESCRT-III/SNF7-family subunit with Snf7-type domains. Contemporary reviews place CHMP1B among ESCRT-III proteins that assemble into membrane-associated polymers to remodel and sever membranes, consistent with the SNF7 family/domain assignment and human organism context (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5). No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified in the retrieved literature.

Comprehensive research report on human CHMP1B (Q7LBR1)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Core identity: CHMP1B is an ESCRT-III subunit (SNF7 family) that polymerizes on membranes to drive negative-curvature membrane remodeling and fission in diverse contexts, including endosomal intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation, cytokinetic abscission, nuclear envelope surveillance/repair, plasma membrane repair, and the budding of enveloped viruses. ESCRT-III dynamics are powered by the AAA ATPase VPS4, which disassembles ESCRT-III polymers to complete membrane fission cycles (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).
- Specific partners and roles: CHMP1B directly interacts with the microtubule-severing ATPase spastin to coordinate microtubule severing at the intercellular bridge during cytokinetic abscission. It also engages with the ESCRT-III protein IST1 to form copolymers that coat positively curved endosomal tubules and contribute to tubulation/constriction; these activities are regulated by VPS4 (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121; Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2, wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Chemical tool targeting CHMP1B–IST1: A natural product-like small molecule, Tantalosin, was discovered that selectively disrupts the IST1–CHMP1B interaction and impairs IST1–CHMP1B copolymer formation. In human cells, Tantalosin stalls transferrin receptor recycling at sorting endosomes and triggers noncanonical LC3 lipidation (CASM) on these stalled endosomes, illuminating a causal role for IST1–CHMP1B in endosomal recycling-homeostasis and in coupling ESCRT arrest to noncanonical autophagy machinery recruitment (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).
- Cytokinetic abscission mechanics: A 2024 study refined how actin and ESCRT-III cooperate at the abscission site. CHMP1B intensity correlates with local microtubule severing, consistent with CHMP1B-dependent recruitment of spastin and the separation of microtubule cut from subsequent membrane scission. This work supports a two-step model: actin-dependent microtubule severing followed by ESCRT-III-driven membrane scission, with CHMP1B part of the ESCRT-III cone near the midbody (Nature Communications, 2024-03; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46062-9) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- Genome integrity and nuclear envelope: A 2024 review synthesizes evidence that ESCRT-III, including CHMP1B, contributes to nuclear envelope repair/resealing and abscission checkpoint control, thereby preserving genome integrity. It highlights ESCRT-III recruitment at the nuclear membrane and midbody, with VPS4-mediated turnover critical for proper remodeling (Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307) (torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14).
- Updated ESCRT-III perspectives: A 2024 review consolidates mechanistic advances on ESCRT-III assembly/disassembly, polymer architecture, and roles across endolysosomal trafficking, viral budding, and membrane repair; it specifically notes CHMP1B’s contribution to polymer tension and membrane bending and its interactions in cytokinesis (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Endosomal recycling and cargo trafficking: Chemical perturbation of IST1–CHMP1B with Tantalosin impairs transferrin receptor recycling, demonstrating a practical handle to modulate ESCRT-III–dependent endosomal remodeling and to induce noncanonical LC3 lipidation at arrested endosomes. This provides an experimental platform to dissect ESCRT–autophagy crosstalk (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).
- Cytokinesis and cell division control: CHMP1B participates in forming the ESCRT-III cone near the midbody, where it cooperates with spastin to sever microtubules prior to membrane fission; ESCRT-III filaments of approximately 17 nm diameter assemble at constriction zones. Depletion of CHMP1B impairs abscission in cell models, underlining its functional requirement for division completion (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Nature Communications, 2024-03; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46062-9) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5).
- Viral budding: ESCRT-III components, including CHMP1B, are recruited by enveloped viruses to sites of budding to accomplish membrane neck constriction and fission; retroviruses are a canonical example. This knowledge is used to interpret viral assembly pathways and identify host-dependency factors (Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).

4) Expert opinions and analyses from authoritative sources
- Consensus from 2024 reviews: ESCRT-III serves as a universal, ATP-driven membrane scission machine across compartments; CHMP1B is one of the subunits integrated into context-specific polymers. Reviews emphasize the choreography of assembly (e.g., CHMP4 nucleation followed by incorporation of subunits such as CHMP1B) and Vps4-mediated turnover as critical for function, with CHMP1B’s specific roles in tensioning polymers and recruiting spastin at the midbody highlighted (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- ESCRT in genome integrity and disease: ESCRT-III activity at the nuclear envelope and the abscission checkpoint protects genome integrity; perturbations of ESCRT-III components are linked to pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration. The literature places CHMP1B within these protective pathways, particularly at the midbody and nuclear envelope (Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307) (torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14).

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- ESCRT-III filament geometry at abscission: ESCRT-III assembles into filaments with approximate 17 nm diameter at constriction zones within intercellular bridges, consistent with the physical dimensions required for microtubule severing and membrane scission coordination (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- Functional readouts of CHMP1B–IST1 inhibition: Pharmacological disruption with Tantalosin yields measurable phenotypes—accumulation of transferrin in sorting endosomes and induction of noncanonical LC3 lipidation on these stalled carriers—providing quantitative cell biological endpoints for CHMP1B-dependent endosomal recycling (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).

Mechanistic synthesis: molecular functions, localization, and pathways
- Molecular role and partners: CHMP1B is a polymerizing ESCRT-III subunit that integrates into context-specific assemblies. It interacts with IST1 to form copolymers on positively curved endosomal tubules, promoting tubulation, constriction, and membrane thinning; VPS4 engagement is required for polymer turnover and productive fission. At the midbody, CHMP1B interacts with spastin via MIT-interactions to couple microtubule severing to subsequent ESCRT-III-driven membrane scission (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121; Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Nature Communications, 2024-03; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46062-9) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- Cellular localization: CHMP1B localizes dynamically to endosomal membranes (notably recycling/sorting endosomes where IST1–CHMP1B act), to the intercellular bridge/midbody during cytokinesis, and to the nuclear membrane in late anaphase/repair situations, consistent with ESCRT-III’s broad deployment (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8).
- Pathways and processes:
  • Endosomal sorting/recycling: IST1–CHMP1B copolymers facilitate tubule formation and scission in endosomal recycling; chemical disruption causes cargo (transferrin) accumulation and activates noncanonical LC3 lipidation at stalled endosomes (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).
  • Cytokinetic abscission: CHMP1B is required for abscission, functioning within the ESCRT-III cone to recruit spastin and coordinate sequential microtubule severing and membrane fission. Depletion blocks abscission and ESCRT-III filaments at abscission zones are ~17 nm in diameter (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Nature Communications, 2024-03; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46062-9) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 7-8, park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5).
  • Nuclear envelope repair/reassembly and genome integrity: ESCRT-III, including CHMP1B, is recruited to nuclear membranes during anaphase/telophase and in nuclear envelope quality control, contributing to sealing and checkpoint functions that safeguard genome integrity (Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307) (torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14).
  • Autophagy-related processes: When ESCRT function is pharmacologically impeded at endosomes, noncanonical LC3 lipidation (CASM) is induced on stalled endosomes, linking ESCRT-III arrest to ATG8 conjugation machinery; this highlights ESCRT-III’s interface with noncanonical autophagy pathways (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).
  • Viral budding: Enveloped viruses recruit ESCRT machinery, including CHMP subunits such as CHMP1B, to effect membrane neck scission and release; this is a conserved host-dependency exploited during budding (Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).

Disease links and biomedical relevance
- Neurodegeneration and cell division: CHMP1B’s interaction with spastin directly ties the protein to a pathway in which mutations in spastin cause hereditary spastic paraplegia; more broadly, ESCRT-III pathway defects are implicated in neurodegeneration and tumorigenesis through failures in abscission checkpoints and nuclear envelope integrity (Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307; Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14, wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).

Tools and resources
- Small-molecule probe: Tantalosin, a selective inhibitor of the IST1–CHMP1B interaction, enables acute perturbation of CHMP1B-dependent endosomal remodeling and assays of endosome–autophagy crosstalk in human cells (PNAS, 2024-04; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2317680121) (knyazeva2024achemicalinhibitor pages 1-2).

Limitations and outlook
- While the cited 2024–2023 studies refine CHMP1B’s roles and provide a first-in-class inhibitor for IST1–CHMP1B, high-resolution CHMP1B-specific structural dynamics within cellular polymers and quantitative kinetics of VPS4-coupled turnover in human cells remain areas for further work. Nevertheless, convergent reviews and primary studies support CHMP1B as an integral ESCRT-III effector in endosomal recycling, cytokinetic abscission, nuclear envelope maintenance, and virus budding (Animal Cells and Systems, 2024-07; https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2024.2380294; Cells, 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13151307; Frontiers in Microbiology, 2023-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1261651) (park2024escrtiiiaversatile pages 4-5, torre2024preservinggenomeintegrity pages 13-14, wang2023insightsintothe pages 3-5).
