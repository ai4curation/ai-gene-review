# CHMP1B: Structural Organization, Membrane Remodeling Functions, and Cellular Roles in Protein Sorting and Trafficking

## Executive Summary

CHMP1B (Charged Multivesicular Body Protein 1B) is a member of the ESCRT-III (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport III) protein family that serves as a critical component of the cellular machinery governing membrane remodeling and protein sorting throughout multiple subcellular compartments[2][7]. This protein belongs to the SNF7 family and functions as a peripherally associated component of ESCRT-III complexes involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation, intraluminal vesicle (ILV) biogenesis, and cargo protein sorting[2][10]. Rather than functioning in isolation, CHMP1B operates through dynamic interactions with partner proteins, most notably IST1, to orchestrate distinct membrane deformation processes with opposing topologies. Recent structural and biochemical studies have revealed that CHMP1B undergoes substantial conformational changes from a closed, cytoplasmic autoinhibited state to open polymerized filaments that coat and sculpt cellular membranes[35][36]. The protein exhibits regulated ubiquitination via the USP8/UBPY deubiquitinase, a mechanism that controls its activity at endosomal membranes in response to growth factor stimulation[14][26][35]. Beyond its canonical roles in MVB biogenesis, CHMP1B participates in cytokinetic abscission, HIV-1 virion release, and endosomal recycling pathways, thereby linking membrane topology remodeling to fundamental cellular processes. Mutations in CHMP1B-related pathways have been identified in pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8, establishing direct connections between ESCRT-III dysfunction and human neurodevelopmental disease[31][34].

## Protein Structure and ESCRT-III Complex Organization

### Structural Architecture and Domain Organization

CHMP1B is a 199-amino acid protein that shares significant structural homology with other ESCRT-III family members while maintaining distinct functional properties[2][7]. The protein comprises a highly conserved core domain composed of four central alpha helices arranged in a characteristic hairpin-like arrangement that defines the SNF7 protein family[2][5]. The core structural organization includes helices α1 and α2, which form a compact hairpin motif at the N-terminal region, connected through helical elements α3 and α4 to additional C-terminal helical structures[20][32]. This core domain architecture establishes the fundamental organizational principle shared across ESCRT-III proteins, though the specific arrangement and conformational dynamics of these helical elements in CHMP1B confer its unique functional properties[33].

A crucial distinguishing feature of CHMP1B is its C-terminal tail region, which contains the MIT-interacting motif (MIM) that enables high-affinity interactions with MIT domain-containing proteins such as VPS4 ATPases and the microtubule-severing protein spastin[21][58]. This MIM region demonstrates bifunctional capacity, capable of binding to the MIT domains of both VPS4 and spastin through distinct binding interfaces despite utilizing the same conserved leucine residues[21]. The structural basis for this dual functionality reveals that the spastin MIT domain recognizes the CHMP1B MIM with approximately twelve-fold higher affinity than does the VPS4A MIT domain, suggesting specialized recruitment mechanisms for distinct cellular processes[21][58].

The protein exists in a highly dynamic conformational equilibrium between distinct states. In the cytoplasm, CHMP1B adopts a closed, autoinhibitory conformation wherein the C-terminal helical element folds back against the core domain structure, effectively masking protein-protein interaction surfaces and preventing premature polymerization[32][35][48]. This autoinhibited state maintains the protein in a monomeric configuration through intramolecular interactions that stabilize the closed conformation. Upon membrane recruitment and activation, CHMP1B undergoes dramatic conformational rearrangement, transitioning to an extended open state wherein the C-terminal regions extend away from the core domain, exposing previously buried interaction surfaces[20][35][48]. This activation process requires approximately half of the monomeric protein structure to reorganize, including melding of helices α2 and α3 into an extended helical structure and reorientation of helix α4[56]. The energetic barrier to this conformational transition is a key control point for ESCRT-III function, and recent evidence indicates that various upstream factors and binding partners work in concert to facilitate this activation transition[35][48].

### ESCRT-III Complex Context and Hierarchical Assembly

CHMP1B functions as one component within the larger ESCRT-III complex, which is itself one of five sequential ESCRT complexes (ESCRT-0 through ESCRT-III plus VPS4) that orchestrate endosomal cargo sorting and membrane scission[2][14][19][26]. The ESCRT-III complex represents the catalytic core of the ESCRT pathway, directly mediating membrane deformation and fission reactions through the assembly of protein polymers that encircle and constrain membranes[12][24]. The sequential recruitment of these complexes involves initial recognition of ubiquitinated cargo by ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complexes, followed by ESCRT-II-mediated clustering and initial membrane bending, which in turn recruits ESCRT-III subunits to sites of active membrane remodeling[2][14][26][38].

Within the ESCRT-III complex, CHMP1B belongs to the CHMP1 subfamily, which includes the related protein CHMP1A and exhibits distinct functional properties compared to other ESCRT-III members such as the CHMP2, CHMP3, and CHMP4 families[8][24][32]. Notably, HIV-1 budding studies revealed that depletion of CHMP2 or CHMP4 family members produces dramatically greater defects (95-166 fold reductions in viral titers) than depletion of CHMP1 proteins (only 2-8 fold reductions), indicating that CHMP1 proteins have more specialized or context-dependent functions[8]. Despite this functional specialization, CHMP1B participates in diverse membrane remodeling processes through distinct molecular mechanisms that depend on its interaction partners and the specific membrane topology involved[9][24].

## Molecular Mechanisms in MVB Formation and Membrane Remodeling

### Classical Role in MVB Biogenesis and Intraluminal Vesicle Formation

The primary established function of CHMP1B derives from its participation in multivesicular body (MVB) formation, a critical process in which cargo-containing membrane invaginations at the limiting membrane of late endosomal compartments undergo scission to generate intraluminal vesicles (ILVs)[2][14][19][26]. ILVs are small membrane-enclosed vesicles contained within the lumen of MVBs that eventually fuse with lysosomes, enabling proteolytic degradation of sequestered cargo proteins[2][14]. This process represents a major cellular mechanism for downregulation of activated cell surface receptors, particularly receptor tyrosine kinases, and constitutes a critical regulatory node for signal transduction termination[14][26][38].

The formation of ILVs requires extensive membrane remodeling: the plasma membrane of the endosome must undergo inward invagination to generate a bud-like protrusion, the narrow neck of this invaginating membrane must be severely constricted, and ultimately the membrane neck must undergo scission to release the ILV into the endosomal lumen[9][12][24][33]. CHMP1B participates in these steps by assembling into helical polymer structures that encircle invaginating membrane regions. The ESCRT-III filaments composed of CHMP1B and related proteins generate mechanical forces that facilitate membrane deformation and reduce the energetic barrier to membrane fission[9][24][33][36].

The involvement of CHMP1B in this process is particularly important for trafficking of ubiquitinated cargo destined for lysosomal degradation. Studies in plant model systems demonstrated that double mutant plants lacking both CHMP1A and CHMP1B fail to properly sort transmembrane proteins such as auxin carriers (PIN1, PIN2) and auxin receptor AUX1 into ILVs, resulting in their retention within the limiting membrane of MVBs rather than sequestration within ILVs[29]. These mutant MVBs contained significantly fewer ILVs compared to control cells, indicating that CHMP1 proteins are required for efficient intraluminal vesicle formation[29]. The consequence of this sorting defect is altered auxin signaling and disrupted developmental patterning, underscoring the physiological significance of proper MVB cargo sorting[29].

### Positive Versus Negative Membrane Curvature Specificity

A remarkable discovery emerging from structural studies has revealed that CHMP1B exhibits distinct membrane curvature specificity compared to other ESCRT-III proteins, with profound implications for understanding its cellular functions[9][24][56]. Most ESCRT-III proteins, exemplified by CHMP4A, assemble into filaments that stabilize negatively curved (or reverse-topology) membranes, wherein the membrane bends away from the cytoplasm into the cytoplasmic lumen of forming vesicles[9][24][43][56]. However, CHMP1B, particularly when functioning in partnership with IST1, assembles into filaments that encircle and stabilize positively curved membranes, wherein the membrane bends toward the cytoplasm[9][12][24][43][56].

This functional dichotomy has profound structural explanations revealed by electron cryomicroscopy analyses. When CHMP1B oligomerizes to form helical filaments by itself, it generates flexible structures with moderate membrane curvature specificity[33][36][43][56]. However, the lumenal cavity of CHMP1B filaments possesses a strongly positively charged interior lined with basic amino acids, particularly lysine and arginine residues, while maintaining an electronegative exterior surface[9][12][56]. This electrostatic architecture enables specific recognition and stabilization of negatively charged membrane surfaces, positioning CHMP1B filaments to interact with acidic phospholipid headgroups from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, thereby wrapping around the external surface of positively curved membrane tubules[9][12][24][56].

This positive-curvature specificity contrasts sharply with canonical ESCRT-III proteins like CHMP4, which polymerize into tight, rigid helical tubes with negatively charged interiors that fill negatively curved membrane invaginations[9][24][43][56]. The functional consequence is that CHMP1B contributes to distinct cellular membrane remodeling events compared to other ESCRT-III proteins, particularly processes involving the scission of tubular endosomal membrane projections that extend into the cytoplasm[9][12][17][24].

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Distribution

### Endosomal and Vesicular Localization

CHMP1B exhibits predominantly cytoplasmic distribution under steady-state conditions, where it exists in a monomeric, autoinhibited conformation[2][14][26]. However, upon cell stimulation or during specific phases of the cell cycle, CHMP1B undergoes rapid translocation to distinct endosomal compartments where it participates in active membrane remodeling processes[14][26][35][38][48]. Early endosomal markers such as EEA1 show limited overlap with CHMP1B localization, whereas CHMP1B shows more robust colocalization with late endosomal markers including Lamp1, suggesting preferential recruitment to MVBs and late endosomal compartments where degradative cargo sorting occurs[14][26][38][48].

Recent live-cell imaging studies with improved spatial resolution have revealed that CHMP1B occupies discrete subdomains on early/sorting endosomes, distinct from compartments marked by classical MVB sorting machinery components[17][37][40]. Using fluorescently labeled transferrin receptor tracking and high-resolution microscopy, researchers identified that CHMP1B colocalizes with SNX15, a sorting nexin that regulates endosomal recycling, at distinct endosomal subdomains separate from those marked by HRS (a component of the ESCRT-I complex) or VPS35 (a retromer component)[17][37][40]. This spatial segregation suggests that CHMP1B participates in specific recycling pathways originating from sorting endosomes rather than contributing uniformly to all MVB-mediated cargo sorting processes[17][37][40].

### Midbody Localization During Cytokinesis

Beyond its endosomal roles, CHMP1B undergoes striking relocalization to the midbody during cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division wherein dividing cells remain connected by a membrane bridge containing concentrated microtubules[11][21][55][58]. CHMP1B localizes prominently to midbodies in dividing HeLa cells, where it colocalizes with the microtubule-severing protein spastin and other ESCRT components including CHMP5[58]. The functional significance of this midbody localization relates to the process of abscission, wherein the membrane bridge connecting daughter cells must be severed to complete cell division[11][21][55][58].

The recruitment of CHMP1B to midbodies appears to be essential for proper spastin localization, as knockdown of CHMP1B results in dramatic reduction of spastin at midbodies despite spastin remaining unaffected at other cellular locations[58]. These findings indicate that CHMP1B actively recruits spastin to the midbody through direct binding of spastin's MIT domain to CHMP1B's MIM motif, thereby establishing a functional nexus between ESCRT machinery and the microtubule-severing machinery required for cytokinetic abscission[21][58].

### Lipid Droplet-Peroxisome Contact Sites

A emerging but less well-characterized localization of CHMP1B involves membrane contact sites between lipid droplets and peroxisomes[9][13][16]. The membrane-bound AAA ATPase spastin isoform (M1 spastin) recruited to lipid droplets via an N-terminal hydrophobic hairpin motif recruits CHMP1B and IST1 to lipid droplet membranes through its MIT domain[13][16]. At these contact sites, the IST1-CHMP1B copolymer appears to facilitate membrane remodeling that facilitates fatty acid trafficking from lipid droplets to peroxisomes for oxidative catabolism[13][16]. This represents a relatively recently discovered function of CHMP1B in lipid metabolism and cellular bioenergetics, expanding understanding of ESCRT-III roles beyond classical endosomal trafficking[13][16].

## Protein-Protein Interactions and Regulatory Mechanisms

### VPS4 Interaction and MIT-MIM Recognition

CHMP1B engages in high-affinity interactions with VPS4 ATPases through specific recognition of the VPS4 MIT (microtubule-interacting and trafficking) domain by the CHMP1B MIM (MIT-interacting motif) located at its C-terminus[2][21][58]. This MIT-MIM interaction has been structurally characterized, revealing that CHMP1B MIM residues including leucine 188 and leucine 192 insert into hydrophobic pockets within the VPS4 MIT domain[21]. The interaction surface measures approximately 12 × 22 Ångströms and involves burial of approximately 1,200 Ų of surface area, consistent with the measured binding affinity of approximately 33 μM[21]. This interaction serves as the primary recruitment mechanism enabling VPS4 localization to membrane-associated ESCRT-III filaments.

VPS4 functions as an AAA ATPase that powers energy-dependent disassembly of ESCRT-III filaments through ATP hydrolysis, thereby recycling ESCRT-III subunits back into the cytoplasmic pool and driving progressive membrane fission[12][24][56][57]. The MIT-MIM interaction enables VPS4 hexamerization around CHMP1B-containing filaments and facilitates conformational changes within these filaments that progressively constrict membranes. The sequential action of VPS4-mediated filament remodeling and subunit exchange generates forces sufficient to drive membrane fission, though the precise molecular mechanism remains an area of active investigation[12][24][56][57].

### Spastin MIT Domain Recognition with High Affinity

While CHMP1B interacts with VPS4 through its MIM motif, the protein also engages in even higher-affinity interaction with spastin, the microtubule-severing AAA ATPase encoded by the SPG4 gene[21][58][60]. The spastin MIT domain recognizes CHMP1B with a dissociation constant of approximately 12 μM, approximately 2.75-fold higher affinity than VPS4 MIT domain binding[21]. Structural analysis revealed that the spastin MIT domain utilizes a distinct binding surface compared to VPS4, employing a groove formed between helices α1 and α3 of the MIT domain rather than the α2-α3 groove used by VPS4[21].

This dual-function capacity of the CHMP1B MIM for selective binding to both VPS4 and spastin represents a remarkable example of molecular adaptation wherein the same CHMP1B sequence achieves specificity for distinct protein partners through recognition of distinct binding surfaces on their respective MIT domains[21][58]. The bifunctional MIM permits CHMP1B to alternate between interaction with VPS4 (primarily involved in reverse-topology ESCRT processes at MVBs) and interaction with spastin (primarily involved in endosomal recycling and cytokinetic abscission), thereby enabling context-dependent protein partnerships[21][58].

### IST1 Partnership and Copolymer Formation

Perhaps the most functionally significant interaction involving CHMP1B is its association with IST1 (increased sodium tolerance 1), the CHMP8-encoded ESCRT-III protein that mediates normal-topology membrane remodeling[9][11][12][17][24][32][33][37][40]. CHMP1B and IST1 interact through distinct surfaces compared to their respective interactions with other ESCRT-III proteins. The CHMP1B-IST1 interaction involves a groove formed by the autoinhibitory helix α5 of IST1 against the core domain helix α2, creating a high-affinity binding site with multiple contributing residues[11][32][33].

The functional consequence of IST1-CHMP1B interaction is assembly into copolymeric filaments rather than separate homopolymers[9][24][33][36]. These copolymers exhibit extraordinary structural properties: cryo-EM reconstructions at near-atomic resolution reveal that IST1 and CHMP1B form parallel double-stranded helical filaments with 1:1 stoichiometry, wherein IST1 comprises the external strand while CHMP1B forms the internal strand[9][24][33][36]. The two strands interweave extensively, with CHMP1B helix α4 binding to multiple segments of the IST1 N-terminal domain helix α1, creating a tightly interlocked structure. Additionally, the CHMP1B C-terminal MIM region "snorkels" from the inner strand to the outer strand, where it packs antiparallel against IST1 helix α5 at the closed IST1 interface[24][33].

---

## IST1-CHMP1B Copolymer Formation and Unique Functions

### Sequential Polymerization Mechanism and Membrane Constriction

Detailed structural and biochemical studies have illuminated a remarkable sequential polymerization mechanism whereby CHMP1B initially polymerizes into flexible single-stranded filaments that wrap around target membranes to induce moderate curvature, followed by subsequent IST1 assembly onto CHMP1B to progressively constrict the membrane[9][33][36]. Initial CHMP1B assembly generates membrane-bound helical filaments with right-handed chirality, moderate outer diameter (~24 nm), and moderate lumenal diameter (~12 nm at the inner leaflet) that wrap around the external surface of positively curved membrane tubules[33][36][43][56]. The lumenal cavity possesses strong positive charge capable of shaping negatively charged phospholipid membranes into tube-like configurations[9][24][33][56].

The flexibility of CHMP1B filaments enables variable curvature, with both right-handed and left-handed helical orientations observed, and adjustable helical parameters accommodated through motion at specific hinge points including the "elbow" joint between helices α3 and α4 and the "wrist" joint between α2 and α3[33][36][43][56]. This conformational flexibility contrasts sharply with the rigidity of canonical ESCRT-III filaments composed of CHMP4, enabling CHMP1B to adapt to variable membrane geometries[9][24][33][56].

Upon IST1 addition, a second strand assembles atop CHMP1B through an intricate network of protein-protein interactions, driving further membrane constriction[9][33][36]. The sequential IST1 polymerization reduces the lumenal inner leaflet diameter from approximately 12 nanometers in CHMP1B-only filaments to approximately 4.8 nanometers in IST1-CHMP1B copolymers (right-handed configuration) or 4.4 nanometers in the left-handed configuration[33][36]. This constriction brings the membrane nearly to the fission point, wherein opposing bilayer leaflets approach hemi-fusion geometry[33][36].

Concurrent with progressively tighter membrane constriction, sequential bilayer thinning occurs as CHMP1B and IST1 apply constrictive forces to the underlying membrane[9][33][36]. Measurements of phosphate-to-phosphate distances between outer and inner membrane leaflets revealed progressive compression: relaxed liposomes maintained approximately 31 Ångströms thickness, CHMP1B-constricted membranes compressed to 29.9 Ångströms, and IST1-CHMP1B copolymers further compressed membranes to 28.6 or 28.4 Ångströms (right- and left-handed respectively)[36]. This progressive bilayer thinning dramatically reduces the energetic barrier to membrane fission by bringing the membrane to the critical geometry for spontaneous fission[9][33][36].

### Normal-Topology Membrane Remodeling in Endosomal Recycling

While most canonical ESCRT-III complexes mediate reverse-topology membrane scission (wherein membrane invaginations bud away from the cytoplasm into the cytoplasm), the IST1-CHMP1B copolymer uniquely facilitates normal-topology membrane scission wherein tubular membrane projections bud away from the cytoplasm into the cytoplasm, with ESCRT proteins coating the external membrane surface[9][12][17][24][22][52][56]. This functional dichotomy has been functionally confirmed through targeted chemical inhibition: the compound Tantalosin specifically disrupts IST1-CHMP1B interaction while leaving other ESCRT-III interactions intact, enabling selective interrogation of IST1-CHMP1B function[22][27][52][59].

Treatment with Tantalosin rapidly blocks transferrin receptor (TfR) recycling from early/sorting endosomes, causing accumulation of transferrin in stalled sorting endosomal compartments[22][27][52][59]. This recycling defect is selective for pathways mediated by the IST1-CHMP1B complex, as Tantalosin does not inhibit multivesicular body cargo sorting, extracellular vesicle biogenesis, or cytokinetic abscission[22][27][52][59]. These functional findings establish that IST1-CHMP1B copolymers mediate selective recycling endosomal cargo trafficking through normal-topology membrane remodeling processes distinct from reverse-topology scission[17][22][27][37][40][52][59].

Further analysis demonstrated that IST1 localizes to early/sorting endosomes in partnership with SNX15 and CHMP1B at endosomal subdomains distinct from those marked by HRS or VPS35, establishing a specialized compartmental identity[17][37][40]. Depletion of IST1 or CHMP1B individually increases both the frequency and persistence of tubular carriers emerging from early/sorting endosomes, consistent with impaired tubule scission[17][37][40]. The IST1-CHMP1B complex thus mediates scission of tubulovesicular carriers enriched in recycling cargo, directing transferrin receptor and mannose 6-phosphate receptor back toward the endocytic recycling compartment and plasma membrane[17][37][40].

### Friction-Driven Membrane Scission Independent of VPS4

A surprising recent discovery emerged from in vitro reconstitution studies demonstrating that the IST1-CHMP1B complex is capable of membrane scission through a friction-driven mechanism that does not require VPS4 or spastin AAA ATPase activity[57]. Using optical trap-based nanotube pulling assays, researchers reconstituted membrane fission with IST1-CHMP1B filaments coating the external surface of lipid bilayer nanotubes, finding that membranes spontaneously fission following a characteristic time course[57]. Importantly, this scission occurred without addition of ATP or ATPase activity, distinguishing it from classical VPS4-dependent ESCRT-mediated membrane fission[57].

The proposed mechanism involves progressive friction-driven membrane scission wherein the CHMP1B-IST1 copolymer coat constricts the membrane while simultaneously applying viscous drag forces that progressively thin the bilayer, ultimately driving spontaneous membrane fission without requiring additional ATP hydrolysis[57]. This represents a potentially more primitive membrane scission mechanism compared to the VPS4-dependent processes involved in MVB biogenesis, perhaps reflecting evolutionary optimization for distinct membrane remodeling contexts[12][24][56][57].

In contrast, VPS4 addition to these systems resolubilized CHMP1B and IST1 from the membrane without promoting membrane fission, indicating that VPS4-mediated ESCRT disassembly occurs via a distinct mechanism from friction-driven scission[57]. Spastin similarly colocalized with CHMP1B-enriched sites but did not disassemble the coat or promote scission[57]. These findings suggest that while VPS4 and spastin interact with CHMP1B through its MIM domain, their primary roles may involve regulation of membrane constriction dynamics and recruitment to specific cellular sites rather than direct catalysis of membrane fission[57].

## Role in Distinct Cellular Processes

### HIV-1 Virion Release and Budding

CHMP1B contributes to HIV-1 budding, though its role is less essential than other ESCRT components[8]. Co-depletion of CHMP1A and CHMP1B reduced HIV-1 virus release modestly (>2-fold), whereas co-depletion of CHMP2A and CHMP2B or CHMP4A, CHMP4B, and CHMP4C produced dramatically more severe defects (95-fold and 166-fold reductions respectively)[8]. Individual CHMP1B depletion reduced viral titers 8-fold, making it a moderate contributor to HIV budding[8]. The mechanisms likely involve CHMP1B's capacity to mediate reverse-topology membrane scission required for completion of virion release, though this process is partially redundant with other ESCRT-III members[8].

HIV-1 budding specifically requires CHMP2A and CHMP4B interaction, as mutations disrupting this interface severely inhibit virus release[8]. In contrast, CHMP1 proteins appear to have accessory roles, potentially facilitating membrane deformation or cooperating with other ESCRT components to enhance efficiency of virion scission[8]. The relative redundancy of CHMP1 function in HIV budding compared to other ESCRT-III members reflects its more specialized role in normal-topology membrane remodeling, which may only partially contribute to the reverse-topology scission required for virion release[8].

### Cytokinetic Abscission and Midbody Dynamics

During cytokinesis, CHMP1B localizes to the midbody and plays a demonstrated role in recruitment of the microtubule-severing protein spastin[21][58][59]. CHMP1B depletion significantly reduces spastin localization to midbodies (from 82.3% in control cells to 39.0% in CHMP1B-depleted cells), indicating that CHMP1B actively recruits spastin through MIT-MIM interaction[58]. However, IST1-CHMP1B copolymer-mediated normal-topology membrane scission does not appear to be required for cytokinetic abscission, as Tantalosin treatment (which specifically inhibits IST1-CHMP1B interaction) does not impair cytokinesis[22][27][52][59].

This apparent paradox suggests that CHMP1B's role in cytokinesis primarily involves recruitment and scaffolding functions for spastin and other ESCRT components rather than direct participation in normal-topology membrane scission[21][52][59]. The IST1-CHMP1B copolymer may serve additional reverse-topology scission roles during cytokinesis, or CHMP1B functions in other contexts through interaction with distinct partners[52][59]. Future studies with more specific inhibitors targeting individual CHMP1B interaction surfaces may clarify these distinctions[21][52][59].

### Endosomal Recycling and Receptor Trafficking

As detailed above, IST1-CHMP1B complexes mediate endosomal recycling of cargo proteins including transferrin receptor and mannose 6-phosphate receptor, maintaining proper cellular localization of receptors and trafficking machinery[17][37][40][22][27][52][59]. This process involves tubule scission from sorting endosomes, enabling rapid recycling of these cargo-laden tubules back to the plasma membrane or to the endocytic recycling compartment[17][37][40]. Disruption of IST1-CHMP1B function causes cargo missorting and accumulation in peripheral endosomes, underscoring the importance of this complex for proper cellular trafficking[17][37][40][22][27][52][59].

Interestingly, recent studies identified that IST1 depletion also enhances rapid recycling of transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane via peripheral endosomes enriched in clathrin adaptor AP-1, suggesting that IST1 normally suppresses fast-recycling pathways to favor slower recycling through the recycling endosomal compartment[17][40]. This suggests a more nuanced role for IST1-CHMP1B in fine-tuning endosomal traffic distribution rather than simply mediating univocal trafficking to one destination[17][40].

### Fatty Acid Trafficking and Lipid Droplet Biology

An emerging function for CHMP1B involves fatty acid trafficking from lipid droplets to peroxisomes, a process mediated through the M1 spastin-CHMP1B-IST1 complex at membrane contact sites between these organelles[13][16]. M1 spastin recruits CHMP1B and IST1 via its MIT domain, and this recruitment promotes fatty acid transport from lipid droplets toward peroxisomes for β-oxidation[13][16]. Importantly, M1 spastin-mediated fatty acid trafficking reduces peroxidated lipids within lipid droplets, suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress[13][16].

This function represents a relatively recently discovered role of ESCRT-III proteins in metabolic processes beyond endosomal sorting. The IST1-CHMP1B copolymer at LD-peroxisome contact sites likely facilitates membrane remodeling or tethering that enables efficient lipid transfer, though detailed molecular mechanisms remain to be established[13][16].

## Regulatory Mechanisms and Post-Translational Modifications

### Ubiquitination-Dependent Regulation by USP8

Recent studies have revealed that CHMP1B undergoes dynamic ubiquitination in response to growth factor stimulation, with ubiquitin removal mediated by the USP8 deubiquitinase (also designated UBPY)[14][26][35][38][48][51]. CHMP1B contains multiple lysine residues susceptible to ubiquitination, with lysine 87 and lysine 90 representing major ubiquitination sites located within the flexible linker region between helices α2 and α3[26][35][38][48][51]. This linker region becomes helical in the active polymerized state, suggesting that ubiquitination may preferentially target the inactive monomeric form while deubiquitination facilitates polymerization[26][35][38][48][51].

Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of cells, endogenous CHMP1B undergoes rapid ubiquitination followed by accumulation at cellular membranes, particularly at late endosomal compartments marked by Lamp1[14][26][35][38][48][51]. This ubiquitination-dependent membrane recruitment occurs with rapid kinetics, peaking within minutes of EGF stimulation[14][26][35][38][48][51]. The USP8 deubiquitinase interacts with CHMP1B through the USP8 MIT domain binding to the CHMP1B C-terminal MIM region, an interaction localized to late endosomes[14][26][35][38][48][51].

Functionally, ubiquitination of CHMP1B is required for proper EGFR degradation following EGF stimulation. Mutation of the four major lysine ubiquitination sites (CHMP1B-4K>R) renders the protein non-functional in EGFR trafficking, as this mutant cannot rescue defects in EGFR degradation kinetics observed in CHMP1B-depleted cells[14][26][38][48][51]. CHMP1B-silenced cells show delayed EGFR degradation compared to control cells, with EGFR remaining at plasma membranes longer before degradation[14][26][38][48][51]. Reconstitution with wild-type CHMP1B restores normal EGFR degradation kinetics, whereas the non-ubiquitinatable CHMP1B-4K>R mutant fails to rescue this defect[14][26][38][48][51].

The proposed mechanism suggests that CHMP1B ubiquitination serves as a temporal checkpoint controlling the spatial and temporal localization of CHMP1B polymerization activity at endosomal membranes in response to signaling inputs[14][26][35][38][48][51]. Ubiquitination may increase local CHMP1B concentration at membranes through enhanced recruitment, or alternatively may promote the conformational transition from closed monomeric to open polymerized states[14][26][35][38][48][51]. The catalytic deubiquitination by USP8 provides a subsequent inactivation or recycling step, enabling dynamic regulation of CHMP1B activity[14][26][35][38][48][51].

### Autoinhibition and Activation Mechanisms

CHMP1B, like other ESCRT-III proteins, exists in equilibrium between autoinhibited and activated conformational states[32][35][48]. The cytoplasmic monomeric CHMP1B adopts a closed conformation wherein the C-terminal region including helices α5 and α6 fold back against the core domain, particularly engaging the α1-α2 hairpin[32][35][48]. This autoinhibition masks protein-protein interaction surfaces and prevents premature polymerization in the cytoplasm[32][35][48].

Activation requires conformational rearrangement triggered by membrane binding and/or interaction with upstream ESCRT components and accessory proteins[32][35][47][48]. The transition to the open state involves extension of the helices, melding of α2 and α3 into a continuous helix, and reorientation of helix α4, dramatically reorganizing approximately half of the protein structure[20][35][48][56]. This extensive conformational change represents a significant energetic transition, and regulation of this activation step controls ESCRT-III function[32][35][47][48].

Binding of the Bro1 domain-containing protein ALIX can relieve autoinhibition of Snf7 (the yeast CHMP4 ortholog), and analogous mechanisms likely apply to CHMP1B activation[47][48]. The interaction with IST1 during normal-topology membrane processes may provide an alternative activation pathway, as IST1 binding to CHMP1B stabilizes the open conformation and promotes polymerization[11][32][33][48]. The sequential timing of IST1 addition to preexisting CHMP1B polymers suggests IST1 acts as an activation scaffold, locking CHMP1B into productive polymerization configurations[33][36][48].

## Disease Associations and Clinical Significance

### Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 8

Mutations in the CHMP1A gene (not CHMP1B itself, but the closely related paralog) cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 (PCH8), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, progressive cerebellar and pontine underdevelopment, severe developmental delay, and various neurological manifestations[31][34][15]. PCH8 differs from most other PCH subtypes by representing a non-degenerative form, with brain MRI showing profound pontocerebellar hypoplasia with severe hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and decreased cerebral white matter volume but without evidence of progressive neurodegeneration on serial imaging[31][34][15].

While CHMP1B mutations have not been directly reported in PCH8 (which is caused by CHMP1A mutations), the functional conservation between CHMP1A and CHMP1B suggests that CHMP1B dysfunction could contribute to similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes[2][31][34][53]. The ESCRT-III pathway is essential for cell division and cytokinesis, and disruption of normal ESCRT function during neurogenesis could impair proper neural progenitor cell division and neuronal differentiation, leading to impaired brain development[31][34].

Additional CHMP-related ESCRT pathway disruptions have been identified in other PCH subtypes. PCH9 is caused by mutations in AMPD2, which encodes an adenosine monophosphate deaminase, and PCH10 is caused by CLP1 mutations, with CLP1 functioning in tRNA processing and splicing[31][34]. These findings collectively indicate that disruption of various cellular processes required for neurogenesis, including ESCRT-mediated membrane dynamics, tRNA processing, and nucleotide metabolism, converge on pontocerebellar hypoplasia phenotypes[31][34].

### Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Association

While CHMP1B itself is not directly mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), mutations in SPAST (the spastin-encoding gene) are the most common genetic cause of autosomal dominant HSP[21][58][60]. Because spastin recruits to CHMP1B through their high-affinity MIT-MIM interaction, proper CHMP1B function is presumably required for spastin-mediated microtubule dynamics and cellular processes involving spastin[21][58][60].

Spastin mutations causing HSP may impair binding to CHMP1B or other binding partners, disrupting normal ESCRT-mediated endosomal recycling or cytokinetic processes[21][58][60]. The specificity of the CHMP1B-spastin interaction and its higher affinity compared to other protein-protein interactions in this pathway suggests it represents a key functional interface, and disruption could contribute to HSP pathogenesis[21][58][60].

## Evolutionary Conservation and Structural Insights

### Conservation Across Eukaryotic Lineages

CHMP1B belongs to the highly conserved SNF7 family of ESCRT-III proteins, with orthologs present across eukaryotic evolution from single-celled protists through plants, fungi, and animals[2][5][7][53]. The fundamental architecture of CHMP1B, including the core helical domain and the C-terminal MIM motif, is conserved across these diverse eukaryotic lineages, indicating that this protein represents an ancient component of eukaryotic membrane trafficking machinery[2][5][7][53].

Comparison of CHMP1B sequences across organisms reveals high sequence conservation within the core domain and the MIM region, with greater sequence divergence in the linker regions and peripheral elements[2][5][53]. This conservation pattern is consistent with functional constraints on the core domain structure and interaction surfaces, while permitting regulatory variation through divergence of peripheral elements[2][5][53].

In plants, CHMP1 orthologs were shown to be essential for developmental processes, with double mutants lacking CHMP1A and CHMP1B displaying severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality[29]. The conservation of CHMP1 function in MVB biogenesis and the involvement in developmental processes across plant and animal kingdoms indicates that CHMP1B's role in regulated protein degradation and recycling represents a fundamental requirement for multicellular development[29].

### Structural Homology to BAR Domain Proteins

A striking evolutionary insight has emerged from structural comparison of IST1-CHMP1B copolymers with BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain proteins, a distinct protein family that also mediates normal-topology membrane tubulation and scission[12][24][56]. BAR domain proteins form banana-shaped dimeric structures with positively charged cavities that interact with negatively charged membrane surfaces to stabilize positive membrane curvature[12][24][56]. The IST1-CHMP1B copolymer exhibits analogous organization, with IST1 and CHMP1B assembling into tubular structures with positively charged lumens capable of interacting with acidic phospholipids to stabilize positive curvature[9][12][24][56].

This convergent evolution of structurally distinct protein systems (ESCRT-III versus BAR domains) toward similar functional outcomes (normal-topology membrane remodeling) provides strong evidence that the physical requirements of this cellular process constrain evolutionary solutions to a limited set of mechanisms[12][24][56]. The discovery that ESCRT-III proteins can mediate both reverse and normal-topology membrane scission through distinct protein combinations (reverse-topology: canonical ESCRT-III members; normal-topology: IST1-CHMP1B) suggests evolutionary optimization of the ESCRT pathway for diverse membrane remodeling contexts[12][24][56].

## Conclusion

CHMP1B represents a multifunctional ESCRT-III component that coordinates diverse cellular membrane remodeling processes through dynamic assembly into homo- and heteropolymeric filaments with distinct membrane curvature specificities and topological preferences. The protein's central role in MVB biogenesis and intraluminal vesicle formation reflects its primary characterized function in endosomal cargo sorting, whereby ubiquitinated cargo destined for lysosomal degradation is segregated into ILVs through CHMP1B-mediated membrane scission[2][14][26][35][38]. However, emerging evidence reveals CHMP1B's participation in equally important but less characterized processes including normal-topology endosomal recycling through IST1-CHMP1B copolymer formation, cytokinetic abscission through spastin recruitment, and metabolic processes including lipid trafficking at lipid droplet-peroxisome contact sites[9][13][16][17][21][37][40][58].

The remarkable structural and functional properties of CHMP1B—its conformational flexibility, positive membrane curvature specificity, high-affinity dual interaction capacity with both VPS4 and spastin, dynamic ubiquitination-dependent regulation, and capacity for sequential polymerization with IST1—enable this single protein to participate in multiple distinct cellular processes while maintaining proper specificity and regulation[9][12][21][24][33][35][36][48][56][57][58]. The recent advances in cryo-EM structural biology have provided unprecedented atomic-resolution insights into CHMP1B filament architecture and membrane interaction mechanisms, establishing molecular foundations for understanding ESCRT-III function[9][33][36][43][56].

Future research directions should focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms through which CHMP1B and IST1 catalyze friction-driven membrane fission, determining how post-translational modifications including ubiquitination regulate CHMP1B activity in response to distinct cellular signals, characterizing the roles of CHMP1B in understudied processes including lipid droplet biology and nuclear envelope dynamics, and exploring therapeutic implications of ESCRT pathway modulation for diseases including cancer, viral infection, and neurodevelopmental disorders[12][22][27][31][34][52][57][59]. The chemical inhibitor Tantalosin has proven valuable for selectively interrogating IST1-CHMP1B complex function, and development of additional selective inhibitors for distinct ESCRT-III complexes promises powerful tools for functional dissection of the ESCRT pathway[22][27][52][59]. Understanding CHMP1B biology thus provides insights into fundamental cell biological processes and potential therapeutic targets for numerous human diseases.
