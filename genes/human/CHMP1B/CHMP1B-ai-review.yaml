description: 'CHMP1B is an ESCRT-III complex component that mediates membrane remodeling processes with dual topology specificity. It functions in reverse-topology membrane scission for MVB formation and cargo sorting to lysosomes, and in normal-topology membrane scission via IST1-CHMP1B copolymers for endosomal recycling. CHMP1B recruits spastin to midbodies for cytokinetic abscission, participates in plasma membrane repair and autophagosome maturation, and has moderate roles in HIV-1 budding. The protein is regulated by USP8-mediated deubiquitination and localizes to late endosomes, MVB membranes, midbodies, autophagosomes, nuclear pore, and kinetochores.'

    description: CHMP1B binds MIT domains of VPS4 ATPases and spastin via its C-terminal MIM motif, with particularly high affinity for spastin (12 μM KD) enabling recruitment of spastin to midbodies for cytokinetic abscission and VPS4 for ESCRT-III disassembly. This bifunctional binding enables context-dependent protein partnerships for diverse membrane remodeling processes including MVB formation, endosomal recycling, and cytokinesis.

        supporting_text: "The spastin MIT domain recognizes CHMP1B with a dissociation constant of approximately 12 μM, approximately 2.75-fold higher affinity than VPS4 MIT domain binding. This dual-function capacity of the CHMP1B MIM for selective binding to both VPS4 and spastin represents a remarkable example of molecular adaptation"

    description: CHMP1B self-associates to form helical filaments on membranes, either as homopolymers or as 1:1 copolymers with IST1. These polymers mediate membrane constriction and scission with dual topology specificity - reverse-topology for MVB ILV formation and normal-topology for endosomal recycling tubule scission.

        supporting_text: "CHMP1B initially polymerizes into flexible single-stranded filaments that wrap around target membranes to induce moderate curvature, followed by subsequent IST1 assembly onto CHMP1B to progressively constrict the membrane. The two strands interweave extensively, with CHMP1B helix α4 binding to multiple segments of the IST1 N-terminal domain helix α1, creating a tightly interlocked structure"
