description: 'RAS p21 protein activator 3, bifunctional GTPase-activating protein
  for both RAS and RAP1 small GTPases. Member of GAP1 family characterized by two
  N-terminal C2 domains (Ca2+ and phospholipid binding), central pleckstrin homology
  (PH) domain, and C-terminal RasGAP catalytic domain. Originally identified as first
  known receptor for inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). Unique among RasGAPs
  for dual substrate specificity: stimulates GTP hydrolysis on both Ras family GTPases
  (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, R-Ras) and Rap1, using arginine-finger mechanism for both
  substrates. PH domain binds multiple lipids - high affinity for PIP3, PI(4,5)P2,
  and soluble IP4. Critically, PIP3 binding INHIBITS RASA3''s GAP activity, providing
  negative feedback link between PI3K and Ras/Rap signaling - when PI3K generates
  PIP3, RASA3 is inactivated, relieving restraint on Ras/Rap1. Cytoplasmic protein
  with regulated membrane association via C2 and PH domains. Essential non-redundant
  role in vertebrate hematopoiesis: mouse scat mutant (G125V, disrupts membrane targeting)
  exhibits severe anemia and thrombocytopenia with ~94% lethality by 30 days due to
  bone marrow failure from unchecked Ras activity in erythroid cells. In platelets,
  RASA3 is major Rap1-GAP counterbalancing CalDAG-GEFI activator - loss causes spontaneous
  platelet activation, aberrant integrin αIIbβ3 activation, and consumptive thrombocytopenia.
  In T lymphocytes, acts as gatekeeper of activation and adhesion: restrains Rap1-driven
  LFA-1 integrin activation until proper TCR/costimulation occurs; RASA3-deficient
  T cells show increased Rap1-GTP, constitutive integrin high-affinity state, impaired
  egress from lymph nodes, and dysregulated immune responses. Human biallelic RASA3
  loss-of-function mutations cause Rasopathy-like syndrome with developmental abnormalities
  and bone marrow failure. Expression in hematopoietic cells, platelets, megakaryocytes,
  T cells, and various tissues. Critical negative regulator that sets activation thresholds
  in signaling pathways to prevent overactivation.'
