description: >-
  RASA3 (RAS p21 protein activator 3, also known as GAP1(IP4BP)) is a bifunctional
  GTPase-activating protein that catalyzes GTP hydrolysis on both RAS family GTPases
  (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras, R-Ras) and RAP1, converting them from active GTP-bound to
  inactive GDP-bound states. The protein has a characteristic domain architecture:
  two N-terminal C2 domains for calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, a central
  RasGAP catalytic domain containing the arginine finger mechanism, a pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domain that binds phosphoinositides (PIP3, PI(4,5)P2) and inositol
  1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), and a C-terminal Btk-type zinc finger. RASA3 was
  originally identified as the first known high-affinity receptor for IP4. Critically,
  PIP3 binding to the PH domain inhibits RASA3's GAP activity, providing a negative
  feedback link between PI3K signaling and Ras/Rap1 activity - when PI3K generates
  PIP3, RASA3 is inactivated, relieving its restraint on Ras/Rap1 signaling. RASA3
  is predominantly cytosolic with regulated membrane association via its C2 and PH
  domains; proper membrane targeting is essential for function. In platelets, RASA3
  is the major Rap1-GAP that counterbalances CalDAG-GEFI (Rap-GEF), setting the
  activation threshold to prevent inappropriate platelet activation and integrin
  alphaIIbbeta3 engagement. Mouse scat mutant (G125V, disrupts membrane targeting)
  exhibits severe thrombocytopenia and anemia with ~94% lethality by 30 days due
  to unchecked Ras activity in hematopoietic cells. In T lymphocytes, RASA3 acts
  as a gatekeeper restraining Rap1-driven LFA-1 integrin activation until proper
  TCR/costimulation occurs; RASA3-deficient T cells show constitutive high-affinity
  integrin states, impaired lymph node egress, and dysregulated immune responses.
  Human biallelic RASA3 loss-of-function mutations cause Rasopathy-like syndrome
  with developmental abnormalities and bone marrow failure. Expression is enriched
  in hematopoietic cells, platelets, megakaryocytes, and T cells.

      RASA3 functions as a GTPase-activating protein with dual specificity for both

      The PMID:10828023 study examined IP3 receptors and GAP1(IP4BP)/RASA3 in platelet
      membranes. It showed that IP4 could induce Ca2+ flux through plasma membrane,
      and GAP1(IP4BP) was found in plasma membrane fractions. However, the paper
      does
      not demonstrate that RASA3 directly regulates calcium channels - rather it
      shows
      that IP4 (which binds RASA3) can trigger Ca2+ entry.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The original paper (PMID:10828023) shows that IP4 can induce Ca2+ flux in

      plasma membranes and that GAP1(IP4BP)/RASA3 is present in those membranes.
      However,
      this does not establish that RASA3 itself has "calcium channel regulator activity".
      The study shows IP4-mediated Ca2+ flux but does not demonstrate RASA3 directly
      regulates calcium channels. RASA3's established function is as a GTPase activator.
      The annotation may conflate IP4 binding with calcium channel regulation.

      RASA3 is a critical regulator of platelet activation through its Rap1-GAP
      activity. It counterbalances CalDAG-GEFI to set the threshold for platelet
      activation. However, PMID:10828023 specifically focuses on IP4 receptor
      localization in platelet membranes, not the regulatory role in platelet
      activation per se. More definitive evidence comes from later studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the specific PMID cited focuses on IP4 binding/localization, RASA3's
      role in platelet activation is extensively documented. RASA3 is the major
      Rap1-GAP in platelets that restrains Rap1-dependent integrin alphaIIbbeta3
      activation. Loss of RASA3 causes spontaneous platelet activation and
      thrombocytopenia. The term accurately describes a core physiological
      function even if the original reference is not the most direct evidence.

  description: >-
    The PH domain of RASA3 binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)
    with high affinity. This binding has dual effects: it recruits RASA3 to the
    plasma membrane and simultaneously inhibits its GAP catalytic activity. This
    creates a negative feedback loop where PI3K activation (generating PIP3)
    suppresses RASA3, allowing sustained Ras/Rap1 signaling until PIP3 levels
    decline. The PH domain also binds PI(4,5)P2 and soluble IP4.

suggested_questions:
- question: Is RASA3 preferentially a Rap1-GAP or Ras-GAP in vivo, or does 
    substrate preference depend on cellular context?
- question: What is the precise mechanism by which PIP3 binding to the PH domain
    inhibits GAP activity?
- question: Are there tissue-specific or isoform-specific differences in RASA3 
    function?
- question: Does RASA3 have scaffolding or adapter functions beyond its 
    catalytic GAP activity?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Structural studies (cryo-EM or crystallography) of RASA3 with and
    without PIP3 bound to understand inhibitory mechanism

    types
