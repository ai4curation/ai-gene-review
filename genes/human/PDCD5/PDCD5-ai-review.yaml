description: >-
  PDCD5 (Programmed cell death protein 5, also known as TFAR19) is a pro-apoptotic regulatory
  adaptor protein that functions primarily as a positive regulator of the p53/TP53 tumor suppressor
  pathway. Under normal conditions, PDCD5 helps maintain basal levels of p53 and Tip60 (a histone
  acetyltransferase). Upon DNA damage or genotoxic stress, PDCD5 is phosphorylated at Ser-119 by
  CK2, which stabilizes the protein and promotes its translocation from cytosol to nucleus. In the
  nucleus, PDCD5 performs two key functions: (1) it binds to and activates Tip60, enhancing its HAT
  activity and Tip60-dependent K120 acetylation of p53; (2) it directly binds p53 and antagonizes
  MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, thereby stabilizing p53 and promoting
  p53-dependent transcription of pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, PUMA). PDCD5 is also regulated by OTUD5
  (deubiquitinase that stabilizes it) and JMJD4/PPEF-1 (which promote its degradation). Beyond
  apoptosis, PDCD5 interacts with FOXP3 to enhance Treg function and suppress autoimmunity. It also
  inhibits beta-tubulin folding by binding to the CCT chaperonin complex, which may contribute to
  its anti-proliferative effects.

    summary: >-
      PDCD5 nuclear localization is well-documented and represents a key functional location,
      particularly during genotoxic stress responses. Multiple primary studies demonstrate nuclear
      localization by immunofluorescence and fractionation [PMID:19308289, PMID:22914926,
      PMID:28051100, PMID:24012345]. The IBA annotation is consistent with phylogenetic conservation
      and experimental data.

      PDCD5 is found in the cytosol under basal conditions and translocates to the nucleus upon
      DNA damage or genotoxic stress. The cytosolic localization represents its resting state

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping (PDCD5-like domain, dsDNA_bind PF01984).
      While the structural similarity suggests potential DNA binding capability, there is limited
      direct experimental evidence for PDCD5 DNA binding activity in primary literature. The deep
      research report notes that "Structural and domain annotations... were not retrievable within
      the 2023-2024 sources."
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The annotation is based on domain homology but lacks direct experimental validation. PDCD5
      functions primarily through protein-protein interactions (with Tip60, p53, MDM2, FOXP3, CCT)
      rather than direct DNA binding. The ChIP experiment in PMID:22914926 shows PDCD5 association
      at the p21 promoter, but this may be indirect through p53 binding rather than direct DNA binding.

      This annotation is derived from the UniProt keyword "Apoptosis" (KW-0053). PDCD5 is indeed

    summary: >-
      High-throughput detection of PDCD5 in B-cell exosomes. The biological significance
      of exosomal PDCD5 is not characterized.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While the localization in exosomes may be real (HDA evidence from proteomics),
      this does not represent a functional location for PDCD5's characterized activities.
      It may represent secretion/clearance rather than active function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the original paper identifying PDCD5 (TFAR19). It shows overexpression of
      PDCD5 "enhances apoptosis triggered by growth factor or serum deprivation" in tumor
      cells. This established PDCD5 as a pro-apoptotic factor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the foundational paper for PDCD5 function. Positive regulation of apoptosis
      is the core function of PDCD5, extensively validated by subsequent studies.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    PDCD5 promotes apoptosis through multiple mechanisms: enhancing Tip60 HAT activity,
    stabilizing p53 by antagonizing MDM2, and promoting cytochrome c release. This is
    the primary function for which PDCD5 was discovered and named.

      label: nucleus
    - id: GO:0005829
      label: cytosol

- description: >-
    PDCD5 sequesters p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation by directly binding both proteins
    and disrupting the MDM2-p53 interaction, thereby stabilizing p53 protein levels.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the structural basis for PDCD5's dual functions in Tip60 activation and CCT inhibition?
- question: Is the heparin binding activity physiologically relevant?
- question: What determines whether PDCD5 promotes p53 stabilization vs. its role in Treg function?

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    ChIP-seq for PDCD5 to determine genome-wide chromatin binding. This would clarify
    whether PDCD5 has DNA binding activity or only associates with chromatin indirectly
    through p53.
  hypothesis: >-
    PDCD5 associates with chromatin indirectly through p53 rather than via direct DNA binding.
- description: >-
    Structural studies of PDCD5-Tip60 complex to reveal the molecular mechanism of
    Tip60 activation by PDCD5.
  hypothesis: >-
    PDCD5 binding to Tip60 induces conformational changes that enhance HAT activity.
