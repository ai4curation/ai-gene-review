  DAP1 (Death-associated protein 1) is a small (~15 kDa, 102 amino acids) intrinsically disordered,
  proline-rich cytoplasmic protein that functions primarily as a negative regulator of autophagy.
  DAP1 is a direct substrate of mTORC1. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTOR phosphorylates DAP1
  at Ser3 and Ser51, keeping it inactive. During starvation or mTOR inhibition, DAP1 is rapidly
  dephosphorylated and becomes functionally active to suppress autophagy, acting as a "brake"
  to prevent overactivation of autophagic flux (PMID:20537536). DAP1 was originally identified
  as a mediator of IFN-gamma-induced programmed cell death (PMID:7828849). Recent studies also
  implicate DAP1 in ribosome hibernation through association with ribosomes and interaction with
  eIF5A, preventing mRNA translation, which is particularly important in oocyte maturation
  (UniProt ISS evidence from zebrafish ortholog).

      its autophagy-regulatory role, given the known crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis.

suggested_questions:
- question: >
    What is the precise molecular mechanism by which dephosphorylated DAP1 suppresses
    autophagy? Does it directly interact with ATG proteins or act through intermediate
    effectors? While DAP1's role as an autophagy suppressor is well-established, the
    downstream molecular targets of active (dephosphorylated) DAP1 remain incompletely
    characterized. Recent work suggests involvement of the ATG16L1-LC3 axis but direct
    binding partners have not been fully defined.
- question: >
    Is DAP1's ribosome hibernation function in human cells as significant as in zebrafish,
    and does it operate in cell types beyond oocytes? The ribosome hibernation function
    is primarily characterized from zebrafish studies and inferred by sequence similarity.
    Direct experimental evidence in human cells and non-oocyte contexts would strengthen
    these annotations.
- question: >
    How does DAP1 contribute to the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, and is
    its original identification as a cell death mediator a direct or indirect effect?
    The relationship between DAP1's autophagy-suppressive function and its role in
    IFN-gamma-induced cell death remains unclear.

suggested_experiments:
- description: >
    Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays to identify direct binding
    partners of dephosphorylated DAP1 in the autophagy machinery. This would clarify
    the molecular mechanism of autophagy suppression and potentially justify more
    specific molecular function annotations.
- description: >
    Ribosome profiling and eIF5A co-localization studies in human cell lines under
    various nutrient conditions. This would provide direct experimental evidence for
    human DAP1's ribosome hibernation function, currently supported only by similarity
    to zebrafish ortholog.
