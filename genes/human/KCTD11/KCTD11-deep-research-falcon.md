## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q693B1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD11; AltName: Full=KCASH1 protein {ECO:0000303|PubMed:21472142}; AltName: Full=Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 11; AltName: Full=RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase subunit KCTD11 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:20081843};
- **Gene Information:** Name=KCTD11; Synonyms=C17orf36, REN;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** KCTD11/21_C. (IPR045763); SKP1/BTB/POZ_sf. (IPR011333); T1-type_BTB. (IPR003131); BTB_2 (PF02214); KCTD11_21_C (PF19329)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "KCTD11" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'KCTD11' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **KCTD11** (gene ID: KCTD11, UniProt: Q693B1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human KCTD11 (KCASH1/REN; UniProt Q693B1)

Identity verification and gene/protein context
- Identity and aliases: KCTD11 is also known as KCASH1 (KCTD-containing Cullin3 adaptor, suppressor of Hedgehog 1) and REN; it encodes a 232-aa KCTD family protein. It is mapped to human chromosome 17p13.2 and is expressed in brain and cerebellum. These names and features are consistently used in foundational and review literature, aligning with UniProt Q693B1 and the BTB/POZ-containing annotation (Jul 2004; Nov 2021) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: PNAS 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0400690101); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Domain architecture: KCTD11 contains an N‑terminal BTB/POZ domain (mediates oligomerization and Cul3 binding) and a divergent C‑terminal region often denoted KCTD11/21_C. Structural descriptions of KCASH/KCTD BTB assemblies support oligomeric (tetrameric/pentameric) adaptors that dock Cul3 (2025 review; 2019 KCTD15–KCASH2 BTB interaction) (navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35, spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4). URL/DOI: J Cell Sci 2016 (contextual BTB/KCTD with USP21; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.188516); Oncogenesis 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-019-0175-6).
- Organism: Homo sapiens (Human). All cited studies referencing REN/KCTD11/KCASH1 in medulloblastoma and cancer are human or human cell models (Jul 2004; Jun 2010; Sep 2023) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5).

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular role: KCTD11/KCASH1 is a BTB/POZ-domain substrate adaptor for a CRL3 (Cullin 3–Rbx1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its principal identified substrate is HDAC1. By promoting HDAC1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, KCASH1 increases GLI1 acetylation, thereby repressing GLI1-dependent transcription in the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway (Nov 2021 review; primary data summarized therein) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Pathway definition: In vertebrate Hh signaling, SHH relieves PTCH inhibition of SMO, leading to GLI activation via primary cilia/centrosome trafficking and nuclear transactivation. KCASH proteins oppose this by degrading HDAC1 so that GLI1 remains acetylated/inactive and less nuclear (Nov 2021; background schema) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 7-9). URL/DOI: Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Gene family context: KCASH1/KCTD11 is one member of the KCASH subfamily with KCASH2/KCTD21 and KCASH3/KCTD6. KCASH3 cannot recruit HDAC1 alone and functionally requires KCASH1 hetero-oligomerization to downregulate Hh, highlighting BTB-mediated combinatorial assemblies (Nov 2019; Nov 2021) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: Oncogenesis 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-019-0175-6); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- 2023: KCTD1 modulates KCASH proteins. Di Fiore et al. showed KCTD1 stabilizes KCASH1 and KCASH2 by reducing their ubiquitination, increasing their half-lives, which secondarily increases HDAC1 ubiquitination/degradation and suppresses GLI1 transcriptional activity and proliferation in SHH‑dependent medulloblastoma lines (DAOY, D283) (Sep 2023) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 2-3, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 5-8). URL/DOI: Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926).
- Family regulation theme: Prior KCTD15 work (2019) reported BTB–BTB interaction with KCASH2 that stabilizes KCASH2 and inhibits Hh signaling; the 2023 KCTD1 study generalizes and extends this inter-KCTD stabilization to include KCASH1, expanding potential regulatory nodes within the KCTD/KCASH network (Nov 2019; Sep 2023) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 2-3). URL/DOIs: Oncogenesis 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-019-0175-6); Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926).
- Structural/assembly perspective: A recent synthesis depicts REN/KCTD11 BTB oligomers engaging Cul3 with models where a BTB tetramer can recruit multiple Cul3 molecules. This supports avidity/stoichiometry considerations in substrate ubiquitination, although high-resolution structures specific for KCTD11 remain to be fully resolved (2025 synthesis citing BTB–Cul3 assemblies) (navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35). URL: not provided in excerpt (navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Disease biomarker and tumor suppressor: KCTD11 deletion/downregulation in SHH‑medulloblastoma supports its use as a tumor suppressor marker; expression is widely reduced in multiple carcinomas (e.g., prostate, ovarian, gastrointestinal, lung, breast) per aggregated datasets and pathology surveys (Jun 2010; Nov 2021) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOIs: Mol Cancer 2010 (https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-4598-9-172); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Mechanism-informed targeting: Preclinical MB models demonstrate that enhancing KCASH1/2 stability (via KCTD1) reduces GLI1 targets and cell proliferation, suggesting potential strategies to stabilize KCASH adaptors or mimic their function to suppress SHH pathway activity (Sep 2023) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 5-8). URL/DOI: Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926).
- Therapeutic concepts: Reviews propose reactivating KCASH1/2 (e.g., demethylating agents in cases of promoter methylation; or stabilizers such as KCTD1-like interventions), direct HDAC1 inhibition, and GLI antagonists for SHH-driven tumors. This leverages the KCASH–HDAC1–GLI axis (Oct 2023 review of E3/adaptors; Aug 2015 GLI-targeting overview; Nov 2021 KCASH review) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 1-2, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 2-3, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOIs: Exp Mol Med 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-023-01087-w); Trends Pharmacol Sci 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2015.05.006); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Foundational identification: REN/KCTD11 was identified as a Hedgehog antagonist deleted in human medulloblastoma, establishing its tumor suppressor function and pathway context (Jul 2004) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4). URL/DOI: PNAS 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0400690101).
- Family-level consensus: The KCASH subfamily acts as negative regulators of GLI transcription by mediating HDAC1 degradation within CRL3 complexes; KCASH1 (KCTD11) is frequently downregulated in tumors and is considered a biomarker/therapeutic reactivation candidate (May 2021) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 7-9). URL/DOI: Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Cilium/centrosome hub: Regulation of GLI1 involves centrosomal/ciliary processes where KCTD6 and the DUB USP21 converge; although this focuses on KCTD6/GLI1, it frames how KCTD adaptors can influence GLI1 activation state and trafficking (Nov 2016) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4). URL/DOI: J Cell Sci 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.188516).

5) Relevant statistics and data
- Genomic loss: Allelic deletions encompassing 17p13.2–13.3 occur in up to approximately 50% of SHH‑medulloblastomas in some cohorts; REN/KCTD11 is among tumor suppressors in this interval (review synthesis; foundational work) (Nov 2021; Jul 2004) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7, spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4). URL/DOIs: Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8); PNAS 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0400690101).
- Expression downregulation across cancers: A 177-patient multi-cancer panel showed reduced KCTD11 protein levels are a widespread event, with regulatory involvement of Sp1 and promoter methylation (Jun 2010) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: Mol Cancer 2010 (https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-4598-9-172).
- Functional half-lives and stabilization (2023): KCASH1 is short-lived (<2 h) and KCASH2 has a 6–12 h half-life; KCTD1 overexpression decreases KCASH1/2 ubiquitination, extends their half-lives comparably to MG132, increases HDAC1 ubiquitination, diminishes GLI1, and suppresses proliferation in SHH‑MB lines (Sep 2023) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 5-8). URL/DOI: Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926).

Primary functional mechanism and localization
- Mechanism: KCTD11 assembles a CRL3-KCASH1 E3 ligase via its BTB/POZ domain to recruit HDAC1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This shifts GLI1 toward the acetylated (inactive) state, impairing nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of Hh targets (Nov 2021 synthesis; foundational/cited studies) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Localization and cellular context: KCASH1/KCTD11 is enriched in brain/cerebellum; functional suppression of GLI1 activity occurs downstream of ciliary/centrosomal signal integration and manifests as reduced GLI1 nuclear transcription. The centrosome/primary cilium is a central GLI regulatory hub, with other KCTDs (e.g., KCTD6) and USP21 modulating GLI1 stability/activity at this locale, supporting a model where KCASH1’s control of HDAC1 intersects with ciliary GLI activation and nuclear entry (Nov 2016; review context; 2025 synthesis) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 7-9, navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35). URL/DOIs: J Cell Sci 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.188516); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).

Interactions and complex assembly
- Partners: Cul3 and RBX1 (CRL3), HDAC1 (substrate), GLI1 (downstream readout), KCTD6/KCTD21 (KCASH3/2) via oligomerization, and regulatory interactions with KCTD15 and KCTD1 that stabilize KCASH proteins (Nov 2019; Sep 2023; Nov 2021) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 2-3, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOIs: Oncogenesis 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-019-0175-6); Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Oligomerization/stoichiometry: BTB/POZ domains mediate homo- and hetero-oligomers among KCASH/KCTD proteins. Modeling suggests REN/KCTD11 oligomers can engage multiple Cul3 molecules (2025 synthesis), implying potential multivalent substrate presentation; KCASH3 requires KCASH1 to engage HDAC1 (Nov 2021; Nov 2019) (navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7, spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4). URL: not provided in excerpt (navacci2025dissectingtherole pages 31-35); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8); Oncogenesis 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41389-019-0175-6).

Disease relevance and genetics
- Medulloblastoma (SHH subgroup): REN/KCTD11 identified as a Hedgehog antagonist deleted in MB; reduction or loss of KCASH1 contributes to unchecked GLI activation and tumorigenesis in cerebellar granule neuron precursors (Jul 2004; Nov 2021) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOIs: PNAS 2004 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0400690101); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Broad cancer relevance: Downregulation of KCTD11 is common across multiple tumor types, with promoter methylation and Sp1 involvement in regulation documented (Jun 2010) (angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOI: Mol Cancer 2010 (https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-4598-9-172).
- Constitutional microdeletions: 17p13 region microdeletions including KCTD11/REN occur in patients with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, emphasizing regional instability and potential tumor risk; this underscores KCTD11’s inclusion among tumor suppressors in the interval (Jul 2009 review of cases) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5). URL/DOI: Cytogenet Genome Res 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1159/000218743).

Therapeutic implications and directions
- Reactivation strategies: In tumors with epigenetic silencing of KCASH1/2, demethylating agents or interventions that increase transcription could restore KCASH function; Sp1/p53 balance and DNMT1-mediated promoter methylation have been implicated for KCASH2 and may analogously inform KCASH1 regulation (Apr 2021 KCASH2 promoter study; Nov 2021 review) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 1-2, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7). URL/DOIs: Front Cell Dev Biol 2021 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.638508); Cell Commun Signal 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-021-00737-8).
- Stabilization of KCASH adaptors: KCTD1 overexpression stabilizes KCASH1/2 and suppresses SHH signaling in MB cells; drug-like strategies that mimic this stabilizing effect could augment endogenous KCASH tumor suppressor activity (Sep 2023) (fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 5-8). URL/DOI: Neoplasia 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neo.2023.100926).
- Targeting the axis: Pharmacologic HDAC1 inhibition and direct GLI antagonists are orthogonal means to reduce GLI-driven transcription downstream of SMO, potentially overcoming SMO inhibitor resistance (Oct 2023 E3/adaptor review; Aug 2015 GLI review) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 1-2, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 2-3).

Notes on subcellular localization
- While direct imaging/localization data for human KCASH1 are limited in the sources summarized here, the functional axis places KCASH1 action in proximity to cytosolic/nuclear interfaces affecting GLI1 transcriptional output, and within the broader Hh architecture centered on the primary cilium/centrosome where GLI processing is orchestrated (Nov 2016; Nov 2021 synthesis) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 7-9).

Conclusion
Human KCTD11 (KCASH1/REN) is a BTB/POZ-domain CRL3 adaptor that suppresses Hedgehog signaling by targeting HDAC1 for ubiquitin‑proteasome degradation, thereby increasing GLI1 acetylation and repressing GLI transcription. It is frequently deleted or downregulated in SHH‑medulloblastoma and reduced across multiple cancers. Recent 2023 work identifies KCTD1 as a stabilizer of KCASH1/2, offering a tractable route to augment the KCASH axis. Therapeutically, strategies that restore KCASH1/2, stabilize KCASH adaptors, inhibit HDAC1, or block GLI provide converging approaches to dampen oncogenic Hh signaling (Jul 2004; Jun 2010; Nov 2016; Nov 2019; May 2021; Sep 2023; Oct 2023) (spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 3-4, angrisani2021theemergingrole pages 6-7, fiore2023kctd1isa pages 4-5, spiombi2019kctd15inhibitsthe pages 1-2).
