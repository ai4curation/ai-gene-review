description: >-
  KCTD11 (also known as KCASH1/REN) is a BTB/POZ domain-containing substrate adaptor
  for the CRL3 (Cullin3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its primary molecular function
  is to recruit HDAC1 as a substrate for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  By reducing HDAC1 levels, KCTD11 maintains GLI1 in an acetylated (inactive) state,
  thereby suppressing Hedgehog signaling pathway activity. The protein forms homopentameric
  assemblies via its BTB domain and can hetero-oligomerize with related KCASH family members
  (KCTD6/KCASH3, KCTD21/KCASH2). KCTD11 functions as a tumor suppressor, with frequent
  deletions or downregulation observed in SHH-subtype medulloblastoma and multiple other
  cancers. Expression is enriched in brain and cerebellum.

  review:
    summary: >-
      KCTD11/REN is induced by neurogenic signals and acts as a marker and regulator
      of neuronal differentiation. By suppressing Hedgehog signaling through HDAC1
      degradation and GLI1 inactivation, KCTD11 promotes differentiation of cerebellar
      granule cell precursors. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically consistent
      (file:human/KCTD11/KCTD11-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The deep research confirms KCTD11 functions as a differentiation regulator.
      PMID:15249678 states it is "previously reported to be expressed in differentiating
      and low proliferating neuroblasts." PMID:21472142 describes KCASH proteins as
      having expression in cerebellum and affecting Hedgehog-dependent development.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping. KCTD11 does not itself possess
      transferase catalytic activity - it is an adaptor/substrate-recognition subunit of the
      CRL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The E3 ligase activity is conferred by the RBX1 RING
      subunit, not by KCTD11.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      PMID:21237243 describes KCTD11 as "cullin E3 ligase adaptor" not as an enzyme.
      It acts as an adaptor bringing together Cul3 and the substrate HDAC1 for ubiquitination,
      but does not catalyze any reaction itself.

  review:
    summary: >-
      KCTD11 forms homo-oligomers via its BTB domain. While this is technically correct,
      "identical protein binding" is a low-information term. The more meaningful annotation
      is protein homooligomerization (GO:0051260) which captures the functional consequence.

      The identical protein binding is captured by the more informative term
      GO:0051260 (protein homooligomerization) which is also present. Keeping as non-core

      This IPI annotation from PMID:27152988 documents the physical self-interaction of

      The experimental evidence from PMID:27152988 is valid - the BTB domain oligomerization
      was directly demonstrated. However, this is captured more informatively by GO:0051260
      (protein homooligomerization). Keeping this as non-core since it has direct experimental
      evidence but is redundant with the more specific term.
