description: >-
  BICC1 (BicC family RNA-binding protein 1) encodes an evolutionarily conserved
  RNA-binding protein that functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of gene
  expression. The protein contains three N-terminal KH (K Homology) domains that
  mediate RNA binding, and a C-terminal SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain that
  enables self-polymerization and protein-protein interactions. BICC1 acts primarily
  as a translational repressor, binding specific mRNA 3'UTRs and recruiting the
  CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex or microRNA machinery to silence target transcripts.
  Key functions include negative regulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
  and modulation of cAMP signaling through regulation of target mRNAs such as PKD2,
  ADCY6, and DVL2. BICC1 localizes to cytoplasmic P-bodies where it forms oligomeric
  silencing platforms. Loss of BICC1 function causes polycystic kidney disease in
  mice and humans, and mutations are associated with cystic renal dysplasia. BICC1
  is also involved in left-right axis determination during embryonic development.

      BICC1 is well-established as a cytoplasmic protein. Studies show that
      endogenous BICC1 concentrates in discrete cytoplasmic foci that co-localize
      with P-body markers (GW182, HEDLS). The SAM domain drives self-polymerization
      leading to formation of cytoplasmic puncta (Rothe et al. 2015, PMC4561730).

      activity, while a SAM domain mutation reduced activity by 22%. BICC1
