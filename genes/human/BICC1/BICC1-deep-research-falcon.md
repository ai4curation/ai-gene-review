## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9H694
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein bicaudal C homolog 1; Short=Bic-C;
- **Gene Information:** Name=BICC1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the BicC family. .
- **Key Domains:** BICC1_KH. (IPR054727); BICC1_KH-I_rpt1. (IPR047549); BICC1_KH-I_rpt2. (IPR047554); BICC1_KH-I_rpt3. (IPR047553); BICC1_SAM_dom. (IPR037974)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "BICC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'BICC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **BICC1** (gene ID: BICC1, UniProt: Q9H694) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity verified: The target is human BICC1 (UniProt Q9H694), a BicC family RNA-binding protein with multiple N‑terminal KH/KH‑like domains and a C‑terminal self‑polymerizing SAM domain; this domain architecture and family membership are consistently described in recent reviews and structural work on human BICC1/Bicc1 (Structure 2018; Cellular Signalling 2020; PLOS Biology 2023) (rothe2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3, rothe2020roleofthe pages 1-5, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2).

Executive summary
BICC1 is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that assembles multivalent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates via a self‑polymerizing SAM domain to control translation and stability of select mRNAs bound by its KH domains. In embryos, Bicc1 directs left–right axis specification by promoting asymmetric decay of DAND5 mRNA in node crown cells; this RNA-binding activity is dynamically licensed by ANKS3/ANKS6 through SAM- and coiled-coil–mediated remodeling of Bicc1 RNPs. In kidney epithelia, Bicc1 regulates transcripts that impinge on ADPKD pathways, including repression of Adcy6 to restrain cAMP, modulation of PKD gene expression, and links to Wnt/PCP signaling. Disruption of BICC1 or its ANKS partners yields cystic kidney phenotypes and laterality defects across species. 2023–2024 studies refine a mechanistic model in which ANKS6 relieves ANKS3-mediated inhibition to enable Bicc1–mRNA engagement and RNP assembly, thereby coupling ciliary signaling modules to post-transcriptional control of developmental and renal homeostasis (PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302; Cells 2024, doi:10.3390/cells13242116; Biophys. Physicobiol. 2024, doi:10.2142/biophysico.bppb-v21.0018) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains: BICC1 (Bic-C homolog 1) is an RNA-binding protein with three KH and two KH-like (KHL) domains separated from a C‑terminal SAM domain by a disordered intervening sequence. KH1/KH2 confer sequence-specific RNA recognition; the SAM domain forms head‑to‑tail polymers that scaffold higher-order assemblies (Structure 2018, doi:10.1016/j.str.2017.12.002; PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302) (rothe2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2).
- Primary biochemical function: Bicc1 binds specific 3′UTR elements of target mRNAs to modulate translation and/or decay, acting via recruitment or antagonism of deadenylation (CCR4–NOT) and Argonaute/RISC machineries, and through interactions with translation initiation factors; the output (repression vs activation) is context‑dependent (Cellular Signalling 2020, doi:10.1016/j.cellsig.2019.109499; 2019 review) (rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8, smith2019themechanisticfunction pages 251-255).
- Higher-order assembly: SAM-driven polymerization concentrates Bicc1 and client mRNAs into cytoplasmic RNP foci that interface with P-bodies; ANKS3 disperses or caps these assemblies, while ANKS6 counteracts ANKS3 to restore Bicc1 polymerization and RNA binding (Structure 2018; PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302) (rothe2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2).
- Developmental role: At the left–right organizer, Bicc1 promotes left‑sided decay of DAND5 mRNA, enabling lateralized Nodal signaling and organ laterality (PLOS Biology 2023; review syntheses from 2024) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- Renal role: In kidney tubules, Bicc1 regulates transcripts controlling cAMP (e.g., Adcy6) and polycystins, and interfaces with ciliopathy modules (ANKS3/ANKS6/NEK8/INVS), constraining cystogenesis (Cellular Signalling 2020; 2019 review) (rothe2020roleofthe pages 17-20, rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8, smith2019themechanisticfunction pages 251-255).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Licensing model for Bicc1–RNA binding by ANKS3/ANKS6: A 2023 PLOS Biology study reconstituted Bicc1 RNPs and demonstrated that ANKS3 binds Bicc1 and inhibits KH‑mediated RNA access via a C‑terminal coiled‑coil; ANKS6 binds ANKS3 with higher affinity, remodeling ANKS3 to relieve inhibition and thus “license” Bicc1 to bind DAND5 3′UTR GAC motifs. In vivo, ANKS3 truncation increased Dand5 decay and randomized laterality, consistent with dysregulated Bicc1 activity (PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14).
- Integration with left–right organizer signaling: Contemporary reviews in 2024 synthesize that immotile cilia sense leftward flow via PKD2, triggering Ca2+ signals that activate Bicc1‑dependent DAND5 mRNA decay at left crown cells, initiating left‑sided Nodal expression (Cells 2024, doi:10.3390/cells13242116; Biophys. Physicobiol. 2024, doi:10.2142/biophysico.bppb-v21.0018; both summarizing and updating prior mechanistic work) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- ANKS3–BICC1 regulation of ciliopathy transcripts: A 2024 preprint reports that the ANKS3–BICC1 complex post‑transcriptionally regulates NPHP1 and related ciliopathy‑gene transcripts via RISC and P‑bodies, and that an ANKS3 P269L variant drives nephronophthisis‑like renal and laterality phenotypes in zebrafish and rats (bioRxiv 2024, doi:10.1101/2024.04.18.588747) (mahuzier2024theanks3bicc1protein pages 1-5, mahuzier2024theanks3bicc1protein pages 5-7).
- Clinical genetics in 2024: Prenatal/neonatal cases with ANKS6 variants extend ciliopathy spectra leading to echogenic/polykystic kidneys, reinforcing functional linkage among ANKS6, ANKS3, and BICC1 modules at the cilium–RNP interface (Genes 2024, doi:10.3390/genes15111374) (almohlesy2024anks6variantsunderlie pages 9-9).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Developmental diagnostics: The mechanistic axis “PKD2 Ca2+ → Bicc1‑dependent DAND5 decay → Nodal asymmetry” is increasingly referenced in embryology and clinical genetics of laterality disorders, aiding interpretation of variants affecting ANKS3/ANKS6/NEK8/BICC1 in heterotaxy and congenital heart disease workups (Cells 2024; PLOS Biology 2023; Biophys. Physicobiol. 2024) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- Nephrology/ciliopathy genetics: Recognition that ANKS6 and ANKS3 variants phenocopy cystic kidney disease supports early exome sequencing and module-based variant interpretation in prenatal echogenic kidneys; this module functionally converges with BICC1-driven post‑transcriptional control (Genes 2024, doi:10.3390/genes15111374; 2024 preprint) (almohlesy2024anks6variantsunderlie pages 9-9, mahuzier2024theanks3bicc1protein pages 1-5).
- Research tools and targets: The defined GAC motif recognition by Bicc1 KH domains in DAND5 3′UTR and the SAM‑polymerization surfaces (ML/EH) provide sequence and structural handles for biochemical reconstitution, AlphaFold-guided modeling, and potential small‑molecule or peptide modulators of the ANKS3–BICC1–ANKS6 axis (Structure 2018; PLOS Biology 2023) (rothe2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Constam and colleagues (PLOS Biology 2023) propose a unifying model in which ANKS3 acts as a negative regulator of Bicc1 RNA binding and polymerization, with ANKS6 as an allosteric remodeler that potentiates Bicc1 RNP assembly on client mRNAs. This directly explains how altered ANKS3/6 dosage or conformation leads to either excessive or insufficient DAND5 decay and laterality defects (PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14).
- Contemporary embryology reviews emphasize that the Bicc1–DAND5 decay step is the proximal molecular effector of cilia‑sensed flow and Ca2+ signals, placing Bicc1 RNP control as a nexus linking biomechanics to asymmetric gene expression (Cells 2024; Biophys. Physicobiol. 2024) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- Earlier comprehensive review (Cellular Signalling 2020) frames Bicc1 as a multivalent RBP integrating with P‑bodies, CCR4–NOT, and miRNA machinery to regulate kidney cAMP (via Adcy6), to modulate PKD2 expression, and to intersect Wnt/PCP signaling; this remains concordant with and mechanistically elaborated by 2023–2024 findings (doi:10.1016/j.cellsig.2019.109499) (rothe2020roleofthe pages 17-20, rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8, rothe2020roleofthe pages 20-25).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Laterality robustness vs Bicc1 licensing: Genetic perturbation of ANKS3 in the 2023 study produced symmetric Dand5 3′UTR-mediated decay and randomized organ laterality in embryos, demonstrating that both insufficient and excessive Bicc1 activity can disrupt left–right patterning; in vitro, ANKS6 showed ~order‑of‑magnitude higher affinity for ANKS3 than Bicc1 SAM, favoring ANKS3 remodeling and Bicc1 activation (PLOS Biology 2023, doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3002302) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- Ciliopathy phenotypes with ANKS3 variants: An ANKS3 P269L variant in animal models caused collecting‑duct dilation with urine-concentrating defects and altered cilia length; zebrafish anks3−/− embryos exhibited abnormal heart looping consistent with laterality defects, with partial rescue by WT ANKS3 (bioRxiv 2024, doi:10.1101/2024.04.18.588747) (mahuzier2024theanks3bicc1protein pages 5-7).
- Prenatal genetics of echogenic/polykystic kidneys: Case series in 2024 identified homozygous ANKS6 variants underlying antenatal echogenic kidneys/polykystic kidneys in three consanguineous families, underscoring the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing for this ciliopathy module (Genes 2024, doi:10.3390/genes15111374) (almohlesy2024anks6variantsunderlie pages 9-9).

Mechanisms, targets, and pathways in detail
- RNA recognition and client mRNAs: Bicc1 KH1/KH2 recognize bipartite GAC motifs within DAND5 3′UTR to promote decay on the left side of the node; beyond DAND5, Bicc1 represses Adcy6 to restrain cAMP and can positively regulate Pkd2 by antagonizing miR‑17, situating Bicc1 within ADPKD‑relevant signaling (PLOS Biology 2023; Cellular Signalling 2020; 2019 review) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8, smith2019themechanisticfunction pages 50-53).
- Condensate formation and subcellular localization: The SAM domain assembles head‑to‑tail polymers that scaffold cytoplasmic RNP foci interfacing with P‑bodies; ANKS3 disperses these foci, whereas ANKS6 recruitment and/or client mRNA binding restores their size. In kidney and embryonic cells, these assemblies coordinate mRNA silencing/activation with ciliary signaling modules (Structure 2018; Cellular Signalling 2020; PLOS Biology 2023) (rothe2018crystalstructureof pages 1-3, rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22).
- Ciliary signaling links: Bicc1 complexes intersect ciliary pathways through ANKS3/ANKS6 and NEK8/INVS; mechanistic crosstalk with Wnt/PCP governs cilia orientation and flow, while regulation of cAMP (Adcy6) and polycystin expression links Bicc1 to PKD pathogenesis (Cellular Signalling 2020; PLOS Biology 2023; 2019 review) (rothe2020roleofthe pages 20-25, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, smith2019themechanisticfunction pages 47-50).

Real-world disease associations
- Cystic kidney disease: Bicc1 inactivation causes cysts across tissues and elevates renal cAMP; human pediatric BICC1 mutations and strong genetic interactions with ANKS3/ANKS6 support a shared ciliopathy module relevant to ADPKD/nephronophthisis‑like phenotypes (Cellular Signalling 2020; PLOS Biology 2023) (rothe2020roleofthe pages 1-5, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2).
- Laterality defects and heterotaxy: Dysregulation of Bicc1‑licensed DAND5 decay randomizes laterality; ANKS3 variants produce laterality phenotypes in animals; clinical reviews highlight Bicc1/DAND5 as a core effector of flow‑sensing in the node (PLOS Biology 2023; Cells 2024; Biophys. Physicobiol. 2024) (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 13-14, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2).

Conclusions and outlook
Human BICC1 (Q9H694) is a modular RBP whose KH‑encoded RNA recognition and SAM‑encoded polymerization enable formation of regulatory condensates that control key developmental and renal transcripts. 2023–2024 work establishes a decisive licensing mechanism by which ANKS6 remodels ANKS3 to gate Bicc1 access to mRNA, thereby coupling cilium‑derived cues to post‑transcriptional control of DAND5 and other targets. In the kidney, Bicc1 converges on cAMP and polycystin pathways and interfaces with Wnt/PCP via ciliary modules, rationalizing cystic phenotypes from perturbations across this network. These insights provide concrete biochemical surfaces and sequence motifs for targeted perturbation and suggest translational avenues for diagnostics in laterality disorders and ciliopathies. Further priorities include quantitative delineation of Bicc1 clientomes in human kidney epithelia in vivo and therapeutic exploration of the ANKS3–ANKS6–BICC1 axis to restore balanced RNP licensing in disease (rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 1-2, rothe2023bicc1ribonucleoproteincomplexes pages 21-22, rothe2020roleofthe pages 5-8).
