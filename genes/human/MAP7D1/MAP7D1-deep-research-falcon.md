1. **Check if the gene symbol "MAP7D1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MAP7D1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MAP7D1** (gene ID: MAP7D1, UniProt: Q3KQU3) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene research report: MAP7D1 (UniProt Q3KQU3) — MAP7 domain-containing protein 1 (Human)

Identity verification and nomenclature
We verified that MAP7D1 (synonyms: KIAA1187, PARCC1, RPRC1) encodes the human MAP7 domain-containing protein 1, a member of the MAP7 family with an N‑terminal MAP7 microtubule-binding domain and a C‑terminal coiled-coil/kinesin-binding region. Studies cited below explicitly investigate the human paralog MAP7D1 or MAP7 family roles that include MAP7D1 in human cells. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found. (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts, definitions, and current understanding
MAP7D1 is a non-motor microtubule-associated protein (MAP) of the MAP7 family that serves two principal, conserved roles: (i) microtubule engagement via an N‑terminal MAP7 domain; and (ii) recruitment and activation of the kinesin-1 motor (KIF5) via interactions mediated by its C‑terminal region. In cells, MAP7 family members act redundantly to license kinesin-1 for processive transport on microtubules and to promote cargo trafficking. In neuronal and epithelial contexts, MAP7/7D1 also couples to Dishevelled (Dvl) to connect Wnt5a signaling with cortical microtubule remodeling. (Hooikaas et al., J Cell Biol, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065, published Feb 2019; Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, 2018, https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471, published Jun 2018) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 12-14)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- DNA damage and cell-cycle control (2023): Quantitative proteomics and functional assays reported that MAP7D1 (with MAP7) interacts with key DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins (RAD50, BRCA1, 53BP1). MAP7D1 knockdown caused a strong G1 arrest and impaired G1-phase DSB repair, including reduced RAD50 chromatin recruitment and diminished 53BP1 foci after γ-irradiation, suggesting a role for MAP7D1 in the DNA damage response. (Dullovi et al., bioRxiv, Jan 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.17.524354) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)
- Activity-dependent phosphorylation in neurons (2023): In human iPSC-derived motor neurons, phosphoproteomics after BDNF stimulation detected transient phosphorylation of MAP7D1 at S460 at 1 hour, indicating activity-dependent regulation of MAP7D1 within cytoskeletal programs that govern axonal transport and regeneration. (Vargas et al., bioRxiv, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.06.565775) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)
- Mechanistic distinctions in microtubule stabilization (2022): In neuronal cells, MAP7D1 was shown to be specifically required for maintaining acetylated, stable microtubules, distinguishing its mechanism from MAP7D2, which stabilizes microtubules through direct filament binding. Loss of MAP7D1 increased microtubule dynamics and altered cell motility and neurite outgrowth. (Kikuchi et al., Life Science Alliance, Mar 2022, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.27.466197) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 1-4, kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 38-38)

3) Molecular function, domains, and biochemical mechanism
- Domain architecture and mechanism: The MAP7 family contains two conserved regions separated by a flexible linker; the N‑terminal MAP7 domain binds the microtubule lattice, while the C‑terminal region binds the kinesin-1 stalk. Purified-protein reconstitution showed that MAP7 family proteins (including MAP7D1) increase kinesin-1 microtubule landing rate and processivity. A MAP7 C‑terminal fragment that binds kinesin (with low MT affinity) still promoted kinesin recruitment, indicating both tethering and allosteric activation of kinesin-1. (Hooikaas et al., J Cell Biol, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14)
- Wnt5a/Dishevelled coupling: MAP7/7D1 binds Dishevelled (Dvl) and stabilizes it; Wnt5a stimulation and kinesin-1 (KIF5B) activity promote MAP7/7D1 movement toward microtubule plus ends, facilitating cortical targeting of plus ends and Dvl localization. These data define MAP7/7D1 as adaptors linking non-canonical Wnt signaling to microtubule remodeling at the cortex. (Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, 2018, https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745471) (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 12-14)

4) Cellular localization and context
- HeLa cells: MAP7, MAP7D1 and MAP7D3 are coexpressed and function redundantly to support kinesin-1–dependent transport and recruitment to microtubules. (Hooikaas et al., 2019, J Cell Biol) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3)
- Epithelia (mouse, Drosophila): Endogenous MAP7/7D1 (and the Drosophila ortholog Ensconsin) display planar-polarized distributions, consistent with roles in cortical microtubule organization and cell polarity. (Kikuchi et al., 2018, EMBO Reports) (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 12-14)
- Neuronal cells: MAP7D1 contributes to stable, acetylated microtubules; loss increases microtubule dynamics, cell motility, and neurite outgrowth, implying roles in centrosome-proximal microtubule organization and neurite morphology. (Kikuchi et al., 2022, Life Sci Alliance) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 1-4, kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 38-38)

5) Effects on transport: kinesin-1 recruitment/activation and organelle trafficking
- Requirements and redundancy: In HeLa cells, at least one MAP7-family member (including MAP7D1) is necessary and sufficient to enable kinesin‑1–driven transport. Family members elevate KIF5B landing frequency and processivity by transient interaction with the kinesin stalk. (Hooikaas et al., 2019, J Cell Biol) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14)
- Context of secretory trafficking: Secretory vesicle transport to microtubule plus ends depends dominantly on KIF5B, which critically relies on MAP7-family proteins on older microtubule lattices. This positions MAP7D1 (with paralogs) as part of the cofactor system that determines where secretion occurs by licensing kinesin-1 engagement. (Serra-Marques et al., eLife, Nov 2020, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.61302) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14)

6) Signaling and pathway integration
- Wnt5a–Dvl–MAP7/7D1 feedback: MAP7/7D1 binds Dvl and directs its cortical localization; Wnt5a signaling enhances MAP7/7D1 plus-end dynamics, requiring KIF5B. FRAP analyses across cell regions (peripheral n=30, internal n=22, leading edge n=21 ROIs; controls n=121; siWNT5A n=112; siKIF5B n=106) demonstrated Wnt5a/KIF5B dependence of MAP7/7D1 dynamics and Dvl positioning. (Kikuchi et al., EMBO Reports, 2018) (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 12-14, kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)
- DNA damage response: MAP7D1 interacts with DDR proteins and supports DSB repair in G1; knockdown elevates p53 phosphorylation post-irradiation, induces G1 arrest, and reduces RAD50 and 53BP1 damage recruitment. (Dullovi et al., 2023) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)

7) Post-translational regulation
- Phosphorylation: Neuronal phosphoproteomics after BDNF exposure detected a transient MAP7D1 S460 phosphorylation at 1 hour, supporting activity-dependent regulation of MAP7D1 in axonal transport and regeneration programs. (Vargas et al., 2023, bioRxiv) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)

8) Phenotypes upon knockdown/knockout
- Transport licensing: Disabling MAP7 family members (including MAP7D1) in HeLa reduces kinesin‑1 recruitment to microtubules and disrupts kinesin‑dependent transport; reintroducing a MAP7-family member rescues transport competence. (Hooikaas et al., 2019) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14)
- Wnt5a/Dvl and cortical microtubules: Combined depletion of MAP7 and MAP7D1 more strongly disrupts cell adhesion/migration and cortical microtubule plus-end targeting than single depletion, indicating partial redundancy. (Kikuchi et al., 2018) (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 1-2)
- Neuronal microtubule stability: MAP7D1 knockdown reduces acetylated microtubules and elevates microtubule dynamics with increased random migration and neurite outgrowth. (Kikuchi et al., 2022) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 1-4, kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 38-38)
- DNA damage response: MAP7D1 depletion causes G1 arrest and impaired DSB repair phenotypes (reduced RAD50 recruitment and 53BP1 foci). (Dullovi et al., 2023) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)

9) Disease associations and real-world relevance
- Cancer: Epigenomic profiling in breast cancer identified MAP7D1 as associated with lymph-node metastasis and regulated by TET1, suggesting roles in metastatic progression. (Wu et al., Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics, Feb 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2019.05.005) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12)
- Toxicological modulation: In rat kidney exposed to thioacetamide for 28 days, global proteomics and Western blot validation found MAP7D1 protein downregulated, linking MAP7D1 abundance to tissue stress responses. (Lim et al., Sci Rep, Apr 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11011-3) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)

10) Statistics and data highlights from key studies
- Kinesin licensing: Hooikaas et al. quantified increases in kinesin‑1 landing rate/processivity in vitro in the presence of MAP7 family members and showed in cells that at least one MAP7 paralog (including MAP7D1) is required to recruit KIF5B‑560 to microtubules; a MAP7 C‑terminal fragment enhanced KIF5B‑560 recruitment despite low MT affinity, indicating an allosteric contribution. (J Cell Biol, 2019) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 11-14)
- Wnt5a/Dvl dynamics: FRAP datasets across multiple regions and perturbations (control n=121 ROIs; siWNT5A n=112; siKIF5B n=106; regional ROIs as above) established that Wnt5a and KIF5B are necessary for MAP7/7D1 cortical dynamics and Dvl localization. (EMBO Reports, 2018) (kikuchi2018map77d1anddvl pages 12-14)
- DDR phenotypes: MAP7D1 knockdown produced measurable deficits in DSB repair readouts—reduced RAD50 chromatin recruitment and 53BP1 damage foci—alongside increased p53 phosphorylation and G1 arrest following γ‑irradiation. (bioRxiv, 2023) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)
- Neuronal PTM regulation: BDNF-induced MAP7D1 S460 phosphorylation was temporally restricted (detected at 1 h), consistent with rapid remodeling of cytoskeletal regulatory MAPs under neurotrophic signaling. (bioRxiv, 2023) (dullovi2023microtubuleassociatedproteinsmap7 pages 1-5)

Expert synthesis and implications
MAP7D1 is best understood as a microtubule-tethered adaptor and activator for kinesin‑1, with additional roles integrating cortical Wnt5a/Dvl signaling to microtubule plus‑end remodeling. In neurons, MAP7D1 contributes to the stable, acetylated microtubule pool—an attribute that likely tunes the selectivity and efficiency of plus‑end-directed transport for defined cargos and supports neurite morphogenesis. Its emerging roles in the DNA damage response, coupled with epigenomic links to metastasis and stress-induced changes in expression, point to broader cellular functions at the interface of cytoskeletal organization, signaling, and genome maintenance. Functionally, MAP7D1’s allosteric activation of kinesin‑1 and maintenance of acetylated microtubules make it a potential node for pharmacologic modulation of transport and stability in disease contexts (e.g., neurodegeneration and cancer), though causal clinical evidence remains preliminary and warrants targeted validation in human tissues and models.
