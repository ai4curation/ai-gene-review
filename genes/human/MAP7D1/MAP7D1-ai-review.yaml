description: >-
  MAP7D1 (MAP7 domain-containing protein 1) is a microtubule-associated protein of the MAP7 family
  that serves dual roles in cytoskeletal function. The protein contains an N-terminal MAP7 domain
  that binds the microtubule lattice and a C-terminal coiled-coil region that binds and activates
  kinesin-1 (KIF5). MAP7D1 functions as a microtubule-tethered adaptor and activator for kinesin-1,
  increasing kinesin-1 microtubule landing rate and processivity, thereby promoting plus-end-directed
  cargo transport. In neuronal cells, MAP7D1 specifically maintains acetylated, stable microtubules
  and regulates cell motility and neurite outgrowth. MAP7D1 also participates in Wnt5a signaling by
  binding Dishevelled (Dvl) and facilitating cortical microtubule remodeling. The protein localizes
  to the spindle during mitosis, to the centrosome, midbody, and generally to the microtubule
  cytoskeleton. MAP7 family members (MAP7, MAP7D1, MAP7D3) function redundantly in kinesin-1
  recruitment, though MAP7D1 has distinct roles in microtubule stabilization through acetylation
  maintenance. Recent studies also implicate MAP7D1 in DNA double-strand break repair during G1
  phase.

    summary: >-
      MAP7D1 is a microtubule-associated protein that plays key roles in microtubule organization.
      Studies show MAP7D1 maintains acetylated stable microtubules and regulates microtubule dynamics.
      Loss of MAP7D1 increases microtubule dynamics and alters cell motility (Kikuchi et al. 2022).
      The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is well-supported by direct experimental
      evidence from the deep research review.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately reflects the core function of MAP7D1. Multiple studies demonstrate
      that MAP7D1 is required for maintenance of acetylated/stable microtubules, and loss of MAP7D1
      reduces MT stability and alters microtubule dynamics (Kikuchi et al. 2022). The MAP7 family
      proteins including MAP7D1 are essential for proper microtubule cytoskeleton function and
      kinesin-1-dependent transport.

      MAP7D1 is a member of the MAP7 family of microtubule-associated proteins. It contains an

      required for kinesin-1 recruitment to microtubules.
