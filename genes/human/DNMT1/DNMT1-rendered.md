|description[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/description)|DNMT1 is the predominant mammalian maintenance DNA methyltransferase responsible for preserving CpG methylation patterns during DNA replication. It plays essential roles in genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, heterochromatin formation, and silencing of repetitive elements. The protein contains multiple regulatory domains including RFTS, CXXC, BAH domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain that uses SAM as methyl donor to methylate cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, with 2-fold preference for hemimethylated sites.|

|summary[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/summary)|This IBA annotation correctly identifies DNMT1 as having DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase activity. This is the core catalytic function of DNMT1, well-established through extensive biochemical studies showing it methylates cytosine at the 5-position using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as methyl donor, with preference for hemimethylated CpG sites.|
|action[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/action)|ACCEPT|
|reason[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/reason)|This represents the primary and most fundamental molecular function of DNMT1. Multiple studies confirm DNMT1 catalyzes the methylation of cytosine residues at CpG sites, particularly hemimethylated sites during DNA replication maintenance. The IBA evidence represents phylogenetic analysis supporting this core function.|

|---|---|
|summary[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/summary)|DNMT1 negatively regulates gene expression through CpG island methylation, leading to transcriptional silencing. This is a core biological process function of DNMT1, particularly important in cancer where hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes and in normal development for silencing tissue-inappropriate genes.|

|reason[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/reason)|This accurately describes a key biological process mediated by DNMT1. CpG island methylation by DNMT1 leads to transcriptional repression through recruitment of methyl-CpG binding proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes.

|reason[?](https://w3id.org/ai4curation/gene_review/reason)|While SUMOylation enhances DNMT1 activity, this annotation focuses on post-translational modification rather than protein-protein interactions. The generic protein binding term does not capture the regulatory significance of SUMOylation in DNMT1 function.|

## core_functions


|description|
|---|
|DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity (GO:0003886) - catalyzes the methylation of cytosine residues at the 5-position in CpG dinucleotides using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as methyl donor, with preference for hemimethylated sites during DNA replication|
|chromosomal DNA methylation maintenance following DNA replication (GO:0141119) - maintains DNA methylation patterns during replication by targeting hemimethylated CpG sites on newly synthesized DNA strands|
|negative regulation of gene expression via chromosomal CpG island methylation (GO:0044027) - silences genes through CpG island hypermethylation, leading to recruitment of methyl-CpG binding proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes|

## suggested_questions


|question|
|---|
|How does DNMT1 maintain DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication while allowing for dynamic changes in gene expression?|
|What determines the specificity of DNMT1 for hemimethylated CpG sites and how does it avoid de novo methylation?|
|How do DNMT1-interacting proteins like PCNA and UHRF1 coordinate replication-coupled maintenance methylation?|
|What are the mechanisms by which DNMT1 dysfunction leads to genome instability and cancer development?|
