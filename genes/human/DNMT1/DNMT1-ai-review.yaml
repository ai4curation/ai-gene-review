description: DNMT1 is the predominant mammalian maintenance DNA methyltransferase responsible for preserving CpG methylation patterns during DNA replication. It plays essential roles in genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, heterochromatin formation, and silencing of repetitive elements. The protein contains multiple regulatory domains including RFTS, CXXC, BAH domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain that uses SAM as methyl donor to methylate cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, with 2-fold preference for hemimethylated sites.

    label: DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation correctly identifies DNMT1 as having DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase activity. This is the core catalytic function of DNMT1, well-established through extensive biochemical studies showing it methylates cytosine at the 5-position using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as methyl donor, with preference for hemimethylated CpG sites.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents the primary and most fundamental molecular function of DNMT1. Multiple studies confirm DNMT1 catalyzes the methylation of cytosine residues at CpG sites, particularly hemimethylated sites during DNA replication maintenance. The IBA evidence represents phylogenetic analysis supporting this core function.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: DNMT1 negatively regulates gene expression through CpG island methylation, leading to transcriptional silencing. This is a core biological process function of DNMT1, particularly important in cancer where hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes and in normal development for silencing tissue-inappropriate genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This accurately describes a key biological process mediated by DNMT1. CpG island methylation by DNMT1 leads to transcriptional repression through recruitment of methyl-CpG binding proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes. Well-supported by literature showing DNMT1 role in silencing genes via promoter hypermethylation.

  review:
    summary: DNMT1 binds DNA through multiple domains including the CXXC domain (recognizes unmethylated CpG), catalytic domain (substrate binding), and other regions that interact with chromatin. While DNA binding is necessary for function, this term is quite general and less informative than the specific methyltransferase activity term.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: DNA binding is a prerequisite molecular function for DNMT1 to carry out its methyltransferase activity, but it is a general term that does not capture the specific enzymatic function. The more specific GO:0003886 (DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity) is preferred as the core function. This term represents necessary but non-specific binding activity.

    summary: DNMT1 does bind chromatin through interactions with nucleosomes, histones, and chromatin proteins. It associates with heterochromatin and replication foci. However, this is a somewhat general term that could be made more specific.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DNMT1 binding to chromatin is well-documented, including association with nucleosomes, modified histones, and heterochromatin.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DNMT1 recruitment to replication forks is well-documented and functionally crucial for its maintenance methylation activity. The interaction with PCNA targets DNMT1 to sites of active DNA replication where it can access hemimethylated CpG sites on newly synthesized DNA.

    summary: DNMT1 regulates DNA-templated transcription through methylation-mediated gene silencing, but this broad term does not specify the regulatory nature (negative regulation).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While DNMT1 does affect DNA-templated transcription, it primarily acts as a negative regulator through DNA methylation. More specific terms like negative regulation of transcription (GO:0045892) or negative regulation by RNA polymerase II (GO:0000122) better capture DNMT1 function.

  review:
    summary: DNMT1 does not typically bind methylated CpG sites - it preferentially binds hemimethylated CpG sites for maintenance methylation. Methyl-CpG binding is more characteristic of MBD proteins.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: DNMT1 primary function involves binding hemimethylated CpG sites rather than fully methylated CpG sites. Methyl-CpG binding is more characteristic of methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins that read methylation marks. This appears to be a computational annotation error confusing DNMT1 function with MBD protein function.

    reason: This general DNA methyltransferase activity term is less specific than GO:0003886 (DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity) which is already annotated. DNMT1 specifically performs cytosine-5-methylation, so the more specific term is preferred over the general parent term.

    summary: While some proteomic studies have detected DNMT1 in mitochondrial fractions, DNMT1 function is primarily nuclear. The mitochondrial localization is likely due to contamination during fractionation or represents a minor, non-functional pool. DNMT1 lacks mitochondrial targeting signals and DNA methylation does not occur in mitochondrial DNA.

- description: negative regulation of gene expression via chromosomal CpG island methylation (GO:0044027) - silences genes through CpG island hypermethylation, leading to recruitment of methyl-CpG binding proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes
