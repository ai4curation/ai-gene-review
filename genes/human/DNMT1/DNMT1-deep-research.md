# DNMT1 (DNA Methyltransferase 1) - Deep Research

## Overview

DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is the predominant mammalian DNA methyltransferase responsible for maintaining genomic DNA methylation patterns during cell division. It is a large, multidomain protein of 1616 amino acids (UniProt: P26358) with a molecular weight of approximately 183-190 kDa when accounting for post-translational modifications. DNMT1 is essential for epigenetic inheritance, playing crucial roles in gene regulation, genomic stability, X-chromosome inactivation, and genomic imprinting.

## Gene and Protein Structure

### Basic Information
- **Gene location**: Human chromosome 19p13.2
- **Protein size**: 1616 amino acids
- **Molecular weight**: ~183 kDa (theoretical), 185-190 kDa (observed on SDS-PAGE due to extensive post-translational modifications)
- **UniProt ID**: P26358

### Domain Architecture

DNMT1 exhibits a complex three-layer architecture revealed by crystal structures (PDB: multiple structures including 5WVO, 7XI9):

1. **N-terminal Regulatory Region (aa 1-1100)**
   - **RFTS Domain (Replication Foci Targeting Sequence)**: Recognizes H3K9me3 marks and H3 ubiquitylation; acts as an autoinhibitory domain that can occlude the catalytic site
   - **CXXC Domain**: Zinc finger domain that specifically recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides
   - **BAH Domains (Bromo-Adjacent Homology)**: Two tandem domains (BAH1 and BAH2); BAH1 recognizes H4K20me3 marks

2. **Linker Region (aa 1109-1120)**
   - Contains Gly-Lys linker segment
   - Autoinhibitory linker positioned in catalytic cleft when binding unmethylated CpG

3. **C-terminal Catalytic Domain (aa 1121-1616)**
   - Contains 10 conserved motifs shared with prokaryotic methyltransferases
   - Active site with conserved FxGxG motif for S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding
   - Catalytic cysteine residue (Cys1226) essential for mechanism

## Enzymatic Mechanism

### Catalytic Mechanism
DNMT1 catalyzes methylation through a well-characterized three-step mechanism:

1. **Base Flipping**: Target cytosine is extracted from DNA double helix and inserted into catalytic pocket
2. **Nucleophilic Attack**: Cys1226 attacks C6 position of cytosine, forming covalent intermediate
3. **Methyl Transfer**: SAM donates methyl group to C5 position of cytosine; β-elimination releases 5-methylcytosine

The methyl transfer step is rate-limiting, occurring via a loose SN2 mechanism distinguishing DNMT1 from other methyltransferases.

### Substrate Specificity
- Strong preference for hemimethylated CpG sites (2-fold higher activity than unmethylated)
- Maintenance methyltransferase function during DNA replication
- Activity enhanced by interaction with UHRF1 (~5-fold stimulation)

## Protein Interactions and Regulation

### Key Protein Partners

1. **UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger domains 1)**
   - Primary recruitment factor for DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA
   - SRA domain binds hemimethylated CpG sites
   - Stimulates DNMT1 activity through allosteric mechanism
   - E3 ubiquitin ligase activity modifies histones and DNMT1

2. **PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)**
   - Recruits DNMT1 to replication forks during S-phase
   - Interaction through DNMT1 PIP box motif
   - Highly dynamic, transient interactions
   - Enhances methylation efficiency ~2-fold

3. **Histone Modifications**
   - H3K9me2/3 recognition through RFTS domain
   - H3 ubiquitylation (K18/K23) binding
   - H4K20me3 recognition through BAH1 domain

### Post-Translational Modifications

#### Phosphorylation
- **Ser143**: Phosphorylated by AKT1, creates stability switch with Lys142 methylation
- **Ser154**: Phosphorylated by CDK1/2/5, enhances activity and stability
- **Ser410/414**: GSK3β sites, affect protein accumulation

#### Acetylation
- Destabilizing acetylation by Tip60
- Stabilizing deacetylation by HDAC1 and SIRT1
- KG linker acetylation impairs USP7 interaction

#### Methylation
- Lys142 methylation by SET7 promotes degradation
- Creates mutually exclusive switch with Ser143 phosphorylation

#### Ubiquitination
- UHRF1-mediated ubiquitination for degradation
- USP7 (HAUSP) deubiquitination for stabilization
