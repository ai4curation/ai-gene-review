  NEUROD1 (Neurogenic differentiation factor 1, also known as NeuroD, NeuroD1, BETA2, or BHLHA3) is a Group A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor with dual essential roles in neuronal and pancreatic endocrine development. The protein functions in the nucleus where it binds E-box motifs (CANNTG) to activate lineage-specific transcriptional programs. NEUROD1 heterodimerizes with class I bHLH E proteins (e.g., TCF12/E2-2, E47) and cooperates with lineage-specific transcription factors to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression. In the nervous system, NEUROD1 is essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, and maturation in multiple regions including hippocampus and inner ear, directly activating neural genes such as Pou3f2, Insm1, Nhlh1, Atoh1, Neurod4, and Nhlh2. In the pancreas, NEUROD1 is critical for endocrine differentiation and β-cell development, supporting expression of key β-cell transcription factors (MAFA, NKX6-1, PDX1, INSM1, NKX2-2, ISL1, PAX6, RFX6) and insulin gene transcription. Human NEUROD1 mutations cause MODY6 diabetes. NEUROD1 can act as a pioneer-like factor in context-dependent manner and is widely used in cellular reprogramming protocols. NEUROD1-high expression defines a molecular subtype of small cell lung cancer.

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: NEUROD1 is a bHLH transcription factor that binds E-box DNA motifs and activates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. The deep research confirms NEUROD1 binds regulatory DNA and regulates transcription of neuronal and endocrine genes. Multiple experimental papers demonstrate direct transcriptional activation (PMID:19619559, PMID:14752053, PMID:10545951).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This accurately captures NEUROD1's core molecular function as a transcriptional activator. The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference and consistent with extensive experimental evidence showing NEUROD1 activates transcription through E-box binding.

  review:
    summary: This is a duplicate annotation with different evidence (ISA based on TFClass database). Same term, same gene, same core function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The TFClass-based ISA annotation correctly classifies NEUROD1 as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor. While duplicate of the IBA annotation above, it is acceptable to have multiple evidence codes supporting the same core function.

    summary: Enteroendocrine cell differentiation inferred from mouse ortholog.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: NEUROD1 is required for secretin and CCK-producing enteroendocrine cells in intestine (shown in PMID:9308961). While this is a legitimate endocrine differentiation role, it is more peripheral than the pancreatic β-cell role. Keep as non-core tissue-specific function.

  review:
    summary: Regulation of intestinal epithelial structure maintenance inferred from mouse ortholog.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: NEUROD1 knockout affects intestinal structure, but this is likely an indirect consequence of loss of enteroendocrine cells that produce secretin/CCK (pancreatic secretagogs affecting exocrine function). This is a very indirect downstream phenotype. Keep as non-core peripheral consequence.

# Glucocorticoid Response - KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
- term:
    id: GO:0071385
    label: cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus
  evidence_type: IEP
  original_reference_id: PMID:19619559
  review:
    summary: Cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus based on expression pattern (IEP) from PMID:19619559.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The paper shows NEUROD1 expression is regulated by glucocorticoids (dexamethasone downregulates it). However, this is about NEUROD1 being regulated by glucocorticoids, not NEUROD1 having a function in glucocorticoid response. IEP (Inferred from Expression Pattern) shows NEUROD1 is responsive to the stimulus but doesn't indicate this is a core function. Keep as non-core regulatory context.

core_functions:
- description: "NEUROD1's core function is as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional activator that binds E-box motifs (CANNTG) in the nucleus to activate lineage-specific transcriptional programs. It has dual essential roles: (1) in the nervous system, activating programs for neuronal differentiation, survival, and maturation, directly regulating genes like Pou3f2, Insm1, Nhlh1, Atoh1, Neurod4, and Nhlh2; and (2) in the pancreas, driving endocrine differentiation and β-cell development/maturation, supporting expression of critical β-cell transcription factors (MAFA, NKX6-1, PDX1, INSM1, NKX2-2, ISL1, PAX6, RFX6) and insulin gene transcription. NEUROD1 functions through heterodimerization with E-proteins (E47/TCF12) and cooperation with other lineage-specific transcription factors. It engages chromatin and can act as a pioneer-like factor in context-dependent manner. This is a genuinely pleiotropic gene with two core functional domains (neural and endocrine) rather than one core function with peripheral roles."
