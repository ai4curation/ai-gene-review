description: >-
  DRAM2 (DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 2) is a 266 amino acid
  lysosomal membrane protein with six predicted transmembrane helices, belonging
  to the DRAM/TMEM150 family. DRAM2 functions as a regulator/adaptor in
  endolysosomal trafficking and autophagic flux rather than as an enzyme. It
  localizes to lysosomal membranes where it co-localizes with LAMP1/2, clathrin,
  and adaptor protein complexes AP-1/AP-3. Loss of DRAM2 function results in
  impaired LC3 lipidation, reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity (cathepsin D,
  GBA, PPT1), and sphingolipid accumulation. Biallelic mutations in DRAM2 cause
  cone-rod dystrophy 21 (CORD21), an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy with
  early macular involvement. In the retina, DRAM2 localizes to photoreceptor
  inner segments and the apical surface of retinal pigment epithelial cells,
  where it is essential for photoreceptor renewal and recycling.

      DRAM2 regulates autophagic flux as demonstrated by impaired LC3 lipidation
      in DRAM2-deficient cells. The protein name itself (DNA damage-regulated
      autophagy modulator protein 2) reflects this core function. However, this

  title: Deep research review of DRAM2 function
  findings:
    - statement: DRAM2 deficiency causes impaired autophagic flux
      supporting_text: >-
        DRAM2 deficiency led to impaired autophagic flux (blunted LC3-II changes

      supporting_text: >-
        reduced activities of key lysosomal enzymes (cathepsin D, GBA,
        a-mannosidase; severe PPT1/NPC2 deficiency with extracellular
        mis-secretion)

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the precise biochemical mechanism by which DRAM2 regulates
      autophagic flux? Does it directly scaffold LC3 lipidation machinery or
      primarily modulate adaptor-coat recruitment?
  - question: >-
      What are the specific protein-protein interactions of DRAM2 with AP-1/AP-3
      adaptor complexes?
  - question: >-
      What is the functional significance of the different DRAM2 isoforms
      (DRAM2a vs DRAM2c) in human retina?
  - question: >-
      Why do photoreceptors and RPE show particular vulnerability to DRAM2 loss
      compared to other cell types?
