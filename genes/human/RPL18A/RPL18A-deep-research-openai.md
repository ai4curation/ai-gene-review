## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene RPL18A (Q02543) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Overview of RPL18A and Its Ribosomal Role

**RPL18A (ribosomal protein L18a)** is a human gene encoding a ribosomal protein that is an integral component of the large 60S subunit of cytosolic ribosomes ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). Ribosomes are the molecular machines that catalyze protein synthesis, consisting of a small 40S and a large 60S subunit in eukaryotes. Together these subunits are composed of 4 ribosomal RNAs and approximately 80 distinct proteins ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). RPL18A belongs to the L18AE family of ribosomal proteins and is also known by the nomenclature **“eL20”**, reflecting its classification as the eukaryotic large-subunit protein L20 ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Eukaryota%3B%20Metazoa%3B%20Chordata%3B%20Craniata%3B%20Vertebrata%3B,proteins%20that%20is%20a%20component)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=RPL18A#:~:text=,3)). (Note that RPL18A is distinct from **RPL18 (eL18)**; despite the similar name, they encode different ribosomal proteins in humans.) RPL18A is evolutionarily conserved and, like many ribosomal protein genes, has multiple processed **pseudogenes** in the genome arising from its abundant expression and evolutionary duplication ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=encodes%20a%20member%20of%20the,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). Its mRNA is expressed **ubiquitously** at high levels in many tissues (for example, it shows robust expression in ovary and lymph nodes), consistent with an essential housekeeping role in general protein production ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Jul%202012,Orthologs%20%2013%20all)). The broad and high expression of RPL18A underscores its fundamental importance in cellular physiology as part of the core translation machinery.

## Structural Function in the Ribosome

The primary function of RPL18A is **structural** and supportive within the ribosome. It does **not act as an enzyme** with its own substrate, but instead serves as one of the scaffold proteins that organize and stabilize ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to form the functional ribosome. Specifically, RPL18A is a part of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, which contains the peptidyl transferase center responsible for forming peptide bonds during protein synthesis ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). By binding rRNA and neighboring ribosomal proteins, RPL18A helps maintain the proper architecture of the ribosome required for accurate translation. Structural studies of eukaryotic ribosomes have resolved the positions of RPL18A (eL20) within the 60S subunit, showing that it is embedded in the ribosomal complex where it contacts rRNA and contributes to the assembly of the subunit’s functional sites ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). Like many ribosomal proteins, RPL18A is rich in basic residues that facilitate tight binding to the negatively charged rRNA. Although RPL18A is not itself the catalytic entity (the rRNA ribozyme carries out peptide bond formation), it is **required for the assembly and stability** of the large subunit and thereby indispensable for effective translation. In line with this, experimental disruptions of L18a homologs in model organisms result in defective large subunit biogenesis or function, highlighting its essential role in ribosome assembly ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). In summary, the **primary role** of RPL18A is as a **structural component of the ribosome**, ensuring that the translational machinery is properly formed and operational.

## Biological Processes and Pathway Involvement

As a component of the ribosome, RPL18A is fundamentally involved in the biological process of **translation**, i.e. protein biosynthesis. It plays a role in the **elongation phase of translation** as part of the 60S subunit, which joins amino acids into a growing polypeptide chain. Proper functioning of RPL18A is necessary for translating messenger RNA into proteins, and thus it impacts global protein synthesis capacity of the cell. RPL18A is also inherently linked to **ribosome biogenesis**, the multi-step pathway by which ribosomal subunits are assembled in the nucleus. Ribosomal proteins like L18a are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the nucleus/nucleolus to be incorporated into nascent ribosomal subunits along with rRNAs. In fact, the **RPL18A gene is co-transcribed with a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA U68) from one of its introns ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=encodes%20a%20member%20of%20the,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed))**, which is a common mechanism coordinating ribosomal protein production with rRNA processing. (The intronic U68 snoRNA guides specific chemical modifications on rRNA, emphasizing how production of RPL18A is tied to proper rRNA maturation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=encodes%20a%20member%20of%20the,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)).) This gene architecture ensures that when RPL18A is produced, so too is a snoRNA needed for ribosome assembly, highlighting RPL18A’s role in the **ribosome assembly pathway**. 

In pathway databases like Reactome and KEGG, RPL18A is catalogued as part of the core translation apparatus in the cytosol ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=Ribosomes%2C%20the%20organelles%20that%20catalyze,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). It participates in the **canonical translation pathway**, joining other ribosomal proteins and initiation/elongation factors to carry out protein synthesis. There is no specific “substrate” for RPL18A since its function is structural; however, one can say its “substrate” is the assembling ribosome itself – it binds rRNA to help form a functional 60S subunit. Notably, RPL18A’s function is largely constitutive (essential for general protein synthesis), rather than being restricted to a single specialized pathway. Unlike enzymes or signaling molecules, it does not have a regulatory target of its own, but by virtue of being part of ribosomes it influences *all* protein production in the cell. This broad impact means that perturbations in RPL18A can have widespread effects on cell physiology, though those effects are a secondary consequence of impaired ribosome function rather than a direct signaling role of RPL18A itself.

## Subcellular Localization and Expression

Consistent with its role in ribosome assembly and function, RPL18A is localized to intracellular compartments associated with ribosome biogenesis and activity. **Immunolocalization studies indicate that RPL18A concentrates in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm of the nucleus, as well as in the cytosol** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A#:~:text=Subcellular%20location,i%7D%20Intracellular%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). The nucleolus is the site of rRNA transcription and early ribosomal subunit assembly; newly made RPL18A protein is transported into the nucleolus where it integrates into pre-60S ribosomal particles. Within the nucleus, RPL18A (along with other ribosomal proteins) can also be found in the broader nucleoplasm during transit or storage before assembly ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A#:~:text=Subcellular%20location,i%7D%20Intracellular%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). After ribosome assembly and export, RPL18A resides in the cytoplasm as part of mature 60S subunits and actively translating 80S ribosomes. Thus, the protein shuttles between nuclear and cytosolic compartments: it is **nucleolar/nuclear** during ribosome biogenesis and **cytosolic** when functioning in protein synthesis. In the cytosol, RPL18A is present in **free ribosomes** as well as ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) for secretory and membrane protein translation (the protein itself is not membrane-bound, but the ribosome can attach to the ER). Importantly, RPL18A is **not secreted or located outside the cell** – its predicted and observed location is intracellular, reflecting its role in internal cellular machinery ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A#:~:text=Subcellular%20location,i%7D%20Intracellular%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). High-throughput proteomics and imaging confirm RPL18A’s presence in ribosome-rich regions of the cell, and even in specialized subcellular locales requiring local protein production (for example, ribosomes containing RPL18A have been detected in neuronal dendrites/postsynaptic densities where local translation occurs) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A#:~:text=Subcellular%20location,i%7D%20Intracellular%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). The pervasive presence of RPL18A in these cellular compartments is in line with its classification as an **intracellular protein** with **evidence at the protein level** for its expression and localization (e.g. identified in human tissue and cell line proteomic analyses) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A/structure%2Binteraction#:~:text=UniProt%20Q02543%20%28UniProt%20,i)).

## Interactions and Functional Insights Beyond Core Translation

Despite being a core ribosomal protein, RPL18A has been implicated in a few context-specific interactions and functions beyond simply building the ribosome. One notable finding is its interaction with viral RNA. **Experimental studies have shown that human RPL18A can bind to the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). In a 2006 study (Dhar et al., *Arch. Virology*), RPL18A was identified as a host factor that directly interacts with the HCV IRES element of the viral RNA ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). The HCV IRES is a structured RNA element that allows the virus to recruit ribosomes and initiate translation of viral proteins in a cap-independent manner. Binding of RPL18A to the HCV IRES suggests that this ribosomal protein might act as an **IRES-transacting factor**, stabilizing or enhancing the association of the viral IRES with the ribosome ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). In other words, RPL18A may help remodel or position the 60S subunit (or the translating 80S ribosome) on the HCV RNA to facilitate translation initiation of the viral polyprotein. This interaction implies a role for RPL18A in **viral replication**: by influencing HCV IRES-mediated translation, RPL18A could affect how efficiently HCV proteins are produced in infected cells ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=of%204%20RNA%20species%20and,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)). (Indeed, the NCBI RefSeq summary for RPL18A notes that the protein *“may play a role in viral replication by interacting with the hepatitis C virus IRES.”* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=of%204%20RNA%20species%20and,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed))) This finding is significant because it reveals a **hijacking of a ribosomal component by a virus**; from a practical perspective, it raises the possibility that disrupting the RPL18A–IRES interaction might inhibit HCV protein synthesis, though targeting an essential host protein comes with challenges. It’s worth noting that different viruses exploit different ribosomal proteins as IRES cofactors – in the case of HCV, along with RPL18A, other ribosomal proteins (and initiation factors) also contact the IRES ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434006/#:~:text=HEV%20IRESl%20with%20several%20host,fide%20internal%20translation%20initiation%20site)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434006/#:~:text=HCV%20IRES%20element,DHX9%20during%20different%20modes%20of)).  The RPL18A–HCV IRES interaction exemplifies how a ribosomal protein can moonlight in a **specialized regulatory role** under certain conditions.

Another intriguing extra-ribosomal interaction involves **RPL18A and the c-Jun oncoprotein**. c-Jun is a transcription factor (part of the AP-1 complex) that contains a leucine zipper domain important for dimerization and DNA binding. A study in 1995 reported that the **leucine zipper region of c-Jun physically binds to ribosomal protein L18a** ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). In this work (Gramatikoff et al., 1995), the authors found an association between c-Jun and RPL18A and speculated it could play a role in regulating c-Jun protein function or turnover. The interaction was proposed as a mechanism for **Jun protein regulation**, though the detailed consequences remain not fully clear ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). One possibility is that RPL18A, when not incorporated into ribosomes (or perhaps on the ribosome surface), might sequester c-Jun or influence its stability or synthesis. It has been observed for some other ribosomal proteins that they can bind to and regulate transcription factors or other cell cycle regulators (often as part of stress responses). While c-Jun’s binding to RPL18A needs further elucidation, this finding indicates RPL18A might have **nuclear roles beyond ribosome assembly**, potentially linking ribosomal protein abundance to the control of gene expression programs (since c-Jun controls many growth-related genes). At minimum, it demonstrates that RPL18A has interaction interfaces that other cellular proteins (like c-Jun) can recognize ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)). This kind of moonlighting function is a theme seen with several ribosomal proteins; as one review remarked, *“moonlighting is particularly widespread among ribosomal proteins, many of which have extra-ribosomal employment.”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2679180/#:~:text=functions%2C%20particularly%20by%20the%20viruses%2C,of%20this%20review%20is%20to)). RPL18A’s interactions with viral RNA and c-Jun underscore that although its principal role is within the ribosome, it can be **recruited into other molecular contexts**, especially under stress or special conditions.

In addition to these specific examples, large-scale interaction studies show that RPL18A, unsurprisingly, interacts with many other proteins. High-throughput proteomic interaction databases report **hundreds of interactors** for RPL18A – for instance, BioGRID lists RPL18A as having on the order of 400–700 interactions detected in various experiments ([thebiogrid.org](https://thebiogrid.org/112062/protein/homo-sapiens/rpl18a.html#:~:text=Homo%20sapiens%20,Terms%20and%20Conditions)). The vast majority of these are likely its fellow ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing factors, and translation factors that physically or functionally associate with the ribosome. Such data reinforces that RPL18A is embedded in a dense network of protein–RNA interactions that make up the ribosome and its assembly machinery. It’s also frequently pulled down in complexes involving mRNA translation initiation and elongation factors, reflecting its presence in actively translating ribosomes. Recent research continues to explore whether variations in ribosomal protein composition (including RPL18A) can modulate translation of specific mRNAs in processes like development, stress responses, or disease states. For example, some studies in cancer biology have observed changes in the expression or utilization of certain ribosomal proteins like RPL18A in tumor cells, which might contribute to altered translation programs in cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434006/#:~:text=HEV%20IRESl%20with%20several%20host,fide%20internal%20translation%20initiation%20site)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434006/#:~:text=HCV%20IRES%20element,DHX9%20during%20different%20modes%20of)). While RPL18A itself is not a classic “signaling” molecule, its differential availability or modification could influence ribosome function under certain conditions – a topic of ongoing investigation.

## Concluding Remarks

In summary, **RPL18A (Q02543)** encodes a **core structural protein of the 60S large ribosomal subunit**, with a **primary role in facilitating protein synthesis**. It helps build the ribosome’s structure that in turn catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation. RPL18A operates mainly in the **nucleolus** (during ribosome assembly) and the **cytoplasm** (during active translation) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105640-RPL18A#:~:text=Subcellular%20location,i%7D%20Intracellular%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). Through its incorporation into ribosomes, it partakes in fundamental processes of gene expression and cell growth. Beyond its central housekeeping function, RPL18A has been linked to specialized roles: notably, it **interacts with viral IRES elements** (such as that of HCV) to possibly aid viral protein production ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=of%204%20RNA%20species%20and,proteins%2C%20there%20are%20multiple%20processed)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)), and it **binds certain cellular regulatory proteins** like the c-Jun transcription factor ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6142#:~:text=1,1%20to%20Drive%20Glioblastoma)), hinting at regulatory crosstalk between the protein synthesis machinery and signaling pathways. These findings illustrate that even highly conserved “hardware” of the cell like ribosomal proteins can have nuanced influences on cellular regulation. Ongoing studies (including those in 2023–2024) are examining how ribosomal components like RPL18A might be involved in disease mechanisms – for instance, whether changes in RPL18A contribute to cancer cell translational reprogramming or if its viral interactions can be therapeutically exploited. Authoritative reviews emphasize the emerging concept that ribosomal proteins can have **“other lives”** aside from ribosome assembly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2679180/#:~:text=functions%2C%20particularly%20by%20the%20viruses%2C,of%20this%20review%20is%20to)), and RPL18A is a telling example of this duality: it is indispensable for the basic life-sustaining process of translation, and at the same time, it has connections to specific regulatory phenomena. All claims about RPL18A’s functions and interactions are backed by experimental evidence from the scientific literature – from the molecular characterization of ribosomes to targeted studies of virus-host interactions – underscoring our current understanding of this gene’s role in human biology.
