## Question

Research the RPL18A (Q02543) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The human **RPL18A (Q02543)** gene encodes the **60S ribosomal protein L18a**, a structural component of the large ribosomal subunit essential for protein synthesis. Below is a comprehensive overview of its molecular function, biological processes, cellular localization, protein domains, interactions, and disease associations, with emphasis on recent and authoritative sources.

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Gene Name:** RPL18A (Ribosomal Protein L18a)
- **UniProt Accession:** Q02543
- **Protein Family:** L18AE family of ribosomal proteins[1][3][7].

---

### 2. Molecular Function

- **Structural Constituent of Ribosome:** RPL18A is a core component of the **60S large ribosomal subunit**, directly involved in the assembly and structural integrity of the ribosome[1][3][7].
- **RNA Binding:** It binds ribosomal RNA (rRNA), contributing to the ribosome’s function in translation[1][6][7].
- **Gene Ontology (GO) Annotations:**  
  - **RNA binding**  
  - **Structural constituent of ribosome**[1][6][9].

---

### 3. Biological Processes

- **Protein Synthesis:** RPL18A is essential for **peptide chain elongation** during translation, facilitating the assembly of amino acids into polypeptides[1][3][7].
- **Nervous System Development:** It is implicated in pathways related to nervous system development, though its specific regulatory roles remain under investigation[1].
- **Viral Replication:** RPL18A may interact with the **hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES)**, suggesting a role in viral translation and replication[1].

---

### 4. Cellular Localization

- **Cytoplasm:** RPL18A is predominantly localized in the **cytoplasm** as part of the ribosomal machinery[3][7].
- **Ribosome:** Specifically, it is integrated into the **large (60S) ribosomal subunit**[1][3][7].

---

### 5. Protein Domains

- **L18AE Domain:** The protein contains a conserved **L18AE domain**, characteristic of the L18AE family, which is involved in rRNA binding and ribosome assembly[1][7].
- **Length:** The mature protein consists of 187 amino acids[7].

---

### 6. Known Interactions

- **Ribosomal Proteins:** RPL18A interacts with other proteins of the 60S ribosomal subunit, including RPL19, RPL22, RPL23, RPL24, RPL27, and RPL27A, forming the structural core of the ribosome[2].
- **Viral RNA:** It has been shown to interact with the HCV IRES, potentially facilitating viral protein synthesis[1].
- **Ribonucleoprotein Complexes:** As a ribosomal protein, RPL18A is part of large ribonucleoprotein complexes essential for translation[1][2].

---

### 7. Disease Associations

- **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection:** RPL18A’s interaction with the HCV IRES suggests a role in the viral life cycle, potentially influencing susceptibility or response to infection[1].
- **Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever:** The gene is also associated with this viral disease, though the mechanism is not fully elucidated[1].
- **Cancer:** While not directly implicated as a driver, ribosomal proteins including RPL18A are often dysregulated in cancer, and their altered expression can affect cell growth and proliferation[1][2]. No direct mutations or causative roles for RPL18A in specific cancers have been established as of 2024.

---

### 8. Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)

- **Proteome-wide studies** continue to map the interactome of ribosomal proteins, confirming RPL18A’s integration with other ribosomal components and its RNA-binding capacity[2].
- **No recent reports** (as of 2023–2024) indicate novel disease mutations or direct therapeutic targeting of RPL18A, but its role in viral translation remains a subject of virology research[1][2].

---

### 9. Expression and Regulation

- **Ubiquitous Expression:** RPL18A is expressed in all tissues, reflecting its fundamental role in protein synthesis[5].
- **Co-transcription with snoRNA:** The gene is co-transcribed with the U68 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), located within its third intron, which may play a role in rRNA modification[1][3].

---

### 10. Expert Analysis

- **Essential Housekeeping Role:** As a ribosomal protein, RPL18A is indispensable for cell viability and growth.
- **Potential as a Biomarker:** While not a primary disease gene, changes in ribosomal protein expression, including RPL18A, are being explored as biomarkers for cellular stress and disease states, especially in oncology and virology[1][2].
