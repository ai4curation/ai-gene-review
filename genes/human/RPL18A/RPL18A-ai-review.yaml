description: >-
  RPL18A (also known as eL20 in the standardized ribosomal protein nomenclature) encodes
  a structural component of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. The protein is essential for
  ribosome assembly and function, contributing to the architecture of the mature 60S subunit
  that participates in cytoplasmic translation. RPL18A is 176 amino acids in length and is
  expressed ubiquitously across human tissues. The RPL18A gene co-transcribes with snoRNA
  U68 from its third intron, coordinating ribosomal protein production with rRNA processing.
  Cryo-EM structural studies have directly visualized RPL18A within the human 80S ribosome
  and pre-60S assembly intermediates. Beyond its core ribosomal function, RPL18A has been
  reported to interact with the Hepatitis C virus IRES element, potentially influencing
  viral translation.

        RPL18A (eL20) is a well-characterized structural component of the 60S large ribosomal
        subunit. Multiple cryo-EM structures (PMID:23636399, PMID:32669547, PMID:25957688,
        PMID:25901680) have directly resolved RPL18A within the human ribosome. The protein
        contributes to ribosomal architecture by binding rRNA and neighboring ribosomal
        proteins. This IBA annotation is strongly supported by phylogenetic inference across
        eukaryotes and is consistent with direct structural evidence.

        While ribosomes are known to be present in neuronal dendrites and postsynaptic

        This annotation derives from a study of pestivirus Npro protease interactions
        with host ribonucleoprotein complex components. While interesting for viral
        biology, protein binding is uninformative for a ribosomal protein.

        Protein binding is too general and uninformative for a ribosomal protein.

        This HDA annotation from a membrane proteome study likely reflects ribosomes
        associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during translation of
