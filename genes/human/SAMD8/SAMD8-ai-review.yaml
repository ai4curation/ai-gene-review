description: 'SAMD8 (SMSr) is an ER-resident enzyme that catalyzes ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthesis using phosphatidylethanolamine as donor. Despite producing only trace amounts of CPE, it serves as a critical ceramide sensor and regulator in the ER, preventing ceramide accumulation and apoptosis. SAMD8 also functions as a PE-specific phospholipase C, and its PE-PLC activity has been linked to NAFLD pathogenesis.'
