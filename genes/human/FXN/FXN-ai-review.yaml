description: Frataxin (FXN) is a mitochondrial iron chaperone that functions as 
  a transient allosteric activator within the core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) 
  assembly complex in the mitochondrial matrix. The mature form (residues 
  81-210) acts as a key component of the ISC machinery composed of NFS1, LYRM4 
  (ISD11), ACP1, ISCU, FDX2, and FXN. FXN binds ferrous iron (Fe2+) and 
  accelerates persulfide transfer from the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 to the 
  scaffold protein ISCU, facilitating de novo [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly. The 
  protein binds to a preformed ISCU/NFS1/ISD11 complex rather than individual 
  components. FXN also functions as an iron donor for ferrochelatase in heme 
  biosynthesis. The oligomeric form exhibits ferroxidase activity for 
  detoxifying redox-active iron. Loss of FXN causes Friedreich ataxia, the most 
  common inherited ataxia, due to impaired Fe-S cluster biogenesis and 
  mitochondrial iron accumulation.

    review:
      summary: Iron-sulfur cluster assembly is the core biological process for 
        FXN. FXN functions within the mitochondrial ISC assembly complex to 
        promote de novo [2Fe-2S] cluster synthesis. This annotation is 
        well-supported by phylogenetic inference and extensive experimental 
        evidence.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: FXN is a key component of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster 
        assembly machinery. Multiple studies demonstrate its role in 
        accelerating persulfide transfer from NFS1 to ISCU during [2Fe-2S] 
        cluster assembly (PMID:12785837, PMID:24971490, PMID:29576242). The IBA 
        annotation correctly reflects the conserved function across eukaryotes.
