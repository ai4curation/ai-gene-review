- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the frataxin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Frataxin. (IPR017789); Frataxin/CyaY. (IPR002908); Frataxin/CyaY_sf. (IPR036524); Frataxin_CS. (IPR020895); Frataxin_Cyay (PF01491)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "FXN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'FXN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **FXN** (gene ID: FXN, UniProt: Q16595) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: FXN (UniProt Q16595) – human frataxin

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Target confirmed: FXN encodes human frataxin (mitochondrial), a member of the conserved frataxin/CyaY family. The literature consistently places human frataxin within the mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster assembly machinery and as the protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), aligning with UniProt Q16595, Homo sapiens, and the frataxin family/domain annotations provided (frataxin/CyaY folds) (Schulz et al., Nature Communications, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47310-8; Apr 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3). Doni et al. (Cell Death & Disease, 2023) explicitly identify human frataxin as the FRDA-deficient protein and confirm mitochondrial localization, further supporting identity (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-06320-y; Dec 2023) (doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2).

Key concepts and current mechanistic understanding
- Core role in mitochondrial ISC biogenesis: Human frataxin functions in the core iron–sulfur cluster assembly complex in the mitochondrial matrix composed of NFS1–ISD11–ACP1 (cysteine desulfurase subcomplex), the ISCU scaffold, ferredoxin 2 (FDX2), and frataxin (FXN). De novo [2Fe–2S] clusters are assembled on ISCU from Fe2+ and a cysteine-derived persulfide provided by NFS1 (Schulz et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3).
- Allosteric activator of sulfur transfer: High-resolution anaerobic cryo-EM snapshots captured Fe-dependent persulfide transfer from Cys381NFS1 to Cys138ISCU2 and showed that frataxin optimally positions ISCU assembly-site residues to enable rapid sulfur transfer. Biochemical/Mössbauer analyses demonstrated that FXN shifts a dynamic equilibrium between pre- and post-sulfur-transfer iron coordination states to promote transfer efficiency (Schulz et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3). Complementary cryo-EM states and modeling further support transient FXN binding that modulates the ISCU2 assembly site to facilitate sulfur transfer (Steinhilper et al., bioRxiv, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.19.580858; Feb 2024) (steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 17-23, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 13-16).
- Coordination with FDX2 and dynamic binding: Structural snapshots indicate staged FDX2 binding to the ISC complex (distal then proximal), with FXN and FDX2 contacting overlapping surfaces and tuning iron coordination at ISCU. Proximal FDX2 positions its [2Fe–2S] cluster close to the ISCU assembly site to permit electron transfer. These data integrate sulfur delivery (NFS1 loop Cys381), iron coordination on ISCU, and electron donation (Steinhilper et al., 2024) (steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 17-23, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 13-16).
- Cross-regulation by FXN and FDX2: Recent in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates FXN and FDX2 can bind competitively to the ISC assembly surface and cross-regulate [2Fe–2S] synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, providing a mechanistic explanation for sensitivity to FXN or FDX2 levels (Want et al., Nature, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09822-1; Dec 2025). While beyond 2024, this supports the 2023–2024 structural snapshots by showing mutually exclusive binding and its impact on persulfide generation and transfer (want2025crossregulationof[2fe–2s] pages 7-8).

Subcellular localization and processing
- Mitochondrial localization and cristae association: In healthy cells, frataxin is closely attached to mitochondrial cristae where the ISC machinery and respiratory complexes co-localize; in FRDA cells, residual frataxin is largely displaced toward the matrix. Proximity ligation shows interactions with respiratory chain complexes I–III, and complex I Fe–S cluster content is decreased in FRDA mitochondria (Doni et al., 2023) (doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2).
- Precursor and maturation: Human frataxin is synthesized with an N-terminal targeting sequence as a mitochondrial precursor and undergoes two-step maturation to the mitochondrial mature form(s). Experimental and review synthesis cited in 2024 work documents in vivo two-step mitochondrial maturation by processing peptidases and the existence of extra-mitochondrial proteoforms detectable by targeted MS assays (Rojsajjakul et al., Research Square, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3788652/v1; Dec 2024) (rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13).
- Species differences and gene therapy context: After AAVrh.10hFXN delivery in mice, human FXN (hFXN) was expressed in heart and liver in a dose-dependent manner and processed predominantly to mature mitochondrial hFXN, with lower-level truncated forms. Truncation positions differed from endogenous mouse FXN proteoforms, underscoring species-specific processing patterns relevant to translational dosing and safety (Rojsajjakul et al., 2024) (rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13).

Pathway context and disease mechanism
- Pathway placement: FXN acts within the mitochondrial ISC pathway at the de novo [2Fe–2S] assembly stage with NFS1–ISD11–ACP1, ISCU, and FDX2. Its actions have downstream consequences for Fe–S delivery and installation into a wide array of client proteins, including mitochondrial respiratory complexes and enzymes, and are upstream of cytosolic/nuclear Fe–S assembly via the CIA pathway; impaired ISC assembly compromises downstream Fe–S maturation (Schulz et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3).
- Friedreich ataxia mechanism and clinical context: FRDA is caused by biallelic FXN defects, most commonly intronic GAA expansions resulting in transcriptional silencing and markedly reduced frataxin. Typical patients harbor 56–1300 GAA repeats (vs 6–36 in controls) and have ~4–29% of normal frataxin; carriers ~40–68% and are asymptomatic. Onset averages 10–15 years; wheelchair dependence often occurs ~11.5 years after onset; mean survival for typical onset is ~39 years. Residual frataxin inversely correlates with expansion size and severity, but expansion size accounts for only part of phenotypic variability (Scott et al., CNS Drugs, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-024-01113-z; Aug 2024; Doni et al., 2023) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2, doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Mechanistic and structural advances (2023–2024): Multiple studies have captured high-resolution cryo-EM snapshots of the human core ISC complex in states that directly visualize the sulfur transfer cascade and the conformational roles of FXN, NFS1’s Cys loop, ISCU residues, and FDX2 distal/proximal binding. These data firmly establish FXN as an allosteric activator that optimally positions residues for rapid persulfide transfer and tune iron coordination during cluster assembly, providing a structural bridge to understand pathogenic FXN deficiency (Schulz et al., 2024; Steinhilper et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 17-23, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 13-16).
- Mitochondrial respiratory chain interface (2023): New data show physical interactions of frataxin with complexes I–III and a specific reduction in complex I Fe–S content in FRDA mitochondria, linking FXN deficiency to respiratory chain defects beyond general Fe–S scarcity (Doni et al., 2023) (doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2).
- Processing and translational toxicology (2024): Preclinical AAV studies quantified therapeutic hFXN expression and processing in mouse heart/liver and emphasized that excessive FXN overexpression may be toxic, aligning with prior cautionary reports; dosing must aim for physiologic restoration of mature mitochondrial FXN (Rojsajjakul et al., 2024) (rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- First approved therapy: Omaveloxolone (an NRF2 activator) received US FDA approval in 2023 for FRDA patients aged ≥16 years, representing the first disease-modifying therapy; reviews outline milestones to approval and its clinical positioning (Lee, Drugs, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-023-01874-9; May 2023; Scott et al., 2024) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2).
- Real-world and ongoing programs: 2024–2025 reviews summarize active clinical development including pediatric pharmacokinetic/safety programs and long-term safety/observational cohorts for omaveloxolone, and multiple gene therapy initiatives are entering or in early clinical stages, including cardiac-directed AAVrh.10hFXN trials (Scott et al., 2024; Rojsajjakul et al., 2024 for preclinical AAV processing data) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2, rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13). Note: Specific trial identifiers and statuses are evolving; see sponsor/registry updates for current recruitment.

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Therapeutic landscape: Scott et al. (CNS Drugs, 2024) provide an authoritative synthesis of drug and gene therapy pipelines, emphasizing the reliance on sensitive clinical outcome measures and natural history data that supported the omaveloxolone approval and ongoing gene therapy strategies (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2).
- Mechanism consensus: The 2024 structural/mechanistic works converge on a consensus that FXN acts as a transient allosteric activator within the ISC complex, promoting rapid persulfide transfer and proper iron coordination at ISCU, while dynamic interplay with FDX2 is essential for timing sulfur delivery and electron transfer (Schulz et al., 2024; Steinhilper et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 17-23, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 13-16).

Relevant statistics and data (from recent studies)
- Genetics and protein levels in FRDA: GAA repeat ranges—patients typically 56–1300 repeats, controls 6–36; residual frataxin in patients ~4–29% of normal and ~40–68% in carriers; typical onset 10–15 years; wheelchair dependence ~11.5 years post-onset; mean survival ~39 years for typical onset (Scott et al., 2024; Aug 2024) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic kinetics and structural snapshots: Rapid transfer of the persulfide from NFS1 Cys381 to ISCU2 Cys138 occurs without a detectable intermediate; FXN shifts the equilibrium to favor productive sulfur transfer states, as shown by cryo-EM and Mössbauer spectroscopy (Schulz et al., 2024; Apr 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3).
- Mitochondrial interface: In FRDA patient mitochondria, complex I Fe–S cluster content is specifically reduced compared to healthy controls, consistent with FXN’s role in ISC and respiratory chain function (Doni et al., 2023; Dec 2023) (doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2).
- Gene therapy processing and dosing: Following intravenous AAVrh.10hFXN in mice, mature mitochondrial hFXN was induced in heart and liver at levels approximating endogenous mFXN, with lower-level truncated forms; truncation patterns differed from mouse FXN, informing species-specific processing and safety margins (Rojsajjakul et al., 2024; Dec 2024) (rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13).

Clinical translation highlights (2023–2024 priority)
- Omaveloxolone approval: FDA first approval in 2023 for adults ≥16 years with FRDA, with regulatory summaries detailing development milestones (Lee, 2023; May 2023) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2). A 2024 therapeutic landscape review confirms omaveloxolone as the first approved FRDA therapy and outlines the need for continued randomized and real-world evidence, including pediatric studies (Scott et al., 2024; Aug 2024) (scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2).

Conclusions
Human FXN (UniProt Q16595) is a mitochondrial frataxin-family protein that acts as a transient allosteric activator within the core ISC assembly complex, accelerating sulfur transfer from NFS1 to ISCU and tuning iron coordination to enable efficient [2Fe–2S] cluster synthesis. Structural snapshots in 2024 define FXN’s positioning role and dynamic interplay with FDX2, providing a mechanistic basis for FRDA pathogenesis and guiding therapeutic restoration goals. Clinically, omaveloxolone’s 2023 approval marks the first disease-modifying therapy, while gene therapy efforts continue to refine dosing and processing to achieve physiologic restoration of mature mitochondrial frataxin safely (Schulz et al., 2024; Steinhilper et al., 2024; Doni et al., 2023; Lee, 2023; Scott et al., 2024; Rojsajjakul et al., 2024) (schulz2024mechanismandstructural pages 1-3, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 17-23, steinhilper2024structuralevidencefor pages 13-16, doni2023humanfrataxinthe pages 1-2, scott2024newandemerging pages 1-2, rojsajjakul2024expressionandprocessing pages 12-13).
