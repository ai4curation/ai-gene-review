### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ERLEC1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ERLEC1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ERLEC1** (gene ID: ERLEC1, UniProt: Q96DZ1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation research report — Human ERLEC1 (UniProt Q96DZ1; ER lectin 1 / Erlectin / XTP3TPB / XTP3B)

1. Target verification (gene/protein identity)
ERLEC1 (UniProt Q96DZ1) corresponds to the ER-resident lectin historically named XTP3-B / erlectin, a ~483 amino acid protein containing two mannose-6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains implicated in N-glycan binding and ER protein quality control. Foundational experimental characterization described erlectin as an ER luminal resident protein that colocalizes with ER markers in mammalian cells and contains two MRH domains (often denoted D1/D2). (cruciat2006themrhprotein; publication date May 2006; URL https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m511872200) (cruciat2006themrhprotein pages 2-3)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
2.1 ER quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
ERAD is a proteostasis pathway that recognizes terminally misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen or membrane and targets them for retrotranslocation to the cytosol, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. In mammals, a central ERAD branch is organized around the SEL1L–HRD1 (SYVN1) complex (“dislocon”), which recruits luminal substrate-recognition factors, including lectins that decode glycan-based degradation signals on N-glycoproteins. (hosokawa2010theroleof; publication date Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof pages 1-2)

2.2 MRH domains and glycan decoding in ERAD
MRH domains are carbohydrate-recognition modules found in several secretory-pathway lectins; in ERAD-related lectins (including OS9 and ERLEC1/XTP3B), MRH-mediated binding can recognize specific high-mannose N-glycan features that emerge during glycan processing/demannosylation of unproductively folding proteins. (hosokawa2010theroleof; publication date Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof pages 1-2)

3. Molecular function of ERLEC1 (experimentally supported)
3.1 Subcellular localization and topology
Experimental cell biology and biochemical fractionation/protease protection assays support ERLEC1/erlectin as a luminal ER-resident protein. In mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged erlectin, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization with an ER marker, and microsome/protease protection experiments were used to probe ER localization/topology consistent with luminal residency. (cruciat2006themrhprotein; May 2006; URL https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m511872200) (cruciat2006themrhprotein pages 2-3)

A commonly cited schematic places signal sequence and MRH domains in the luminal region of XTP3-B (human long vs short isoforms), consistent with an ER luminal lectin role. (hosokawa2010theroleof; Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof media 808f4af7)

3.2 Domain architecture
ERLEC1/XTP3-B contains two MRH domains. Early work annotated and experimentally used this domain structure to analyze glycan-dependent binding to glycoproteins. (cruciat2006themrhprotein; May 2006; URL https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m511872200) (cruciat2006themrhprotein pages 2-3)

A review of MRH lectins in ERAD presents a domain schematic for human XTP3-B with signal sequence and two luminal MRH domains (long and short splice variants). (hosokawa2010theroleof; Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof media 808f4af7)

3.3 Lectin activity and N-glycan binding specificity
Multiple primary studies support that the C-terminal MRH domain (MRH2) mediates ERLEC1 glycan binding.

• Man5-type recognition motif and glycan dependence in cell binding: ERLEC1/XTP3-B binding to Lec1 cell glycans depended on the C-terminal MRH domain and was abolished by Endo H treatment, supporting high-mannose N-glycan dependence. The study further implicated a terminal Manα1,6Man motif (within Man5GlcNAc2 context) in recognition and demonstrated statistically significant Endo H effects (reported p < 0.001 in binding assays). (Yamaguchi et al., Glycobiology; publication date Nov 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp182) (yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-2)

• M9 (Man9GlcNAc2) binding in vitro and in vivo: Using frontal affinity chromatography and in vitro binding assays, ERLEC1/XTP3-B’s C-terminal MRH domain showed specific binding to Man9GlcNAc2 (M9), whereas the N-terminal MRH domain did not show binding under the tested conditions. (Fujimori et al., FEBS Journal; publication date Mar 2013; URL https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12157) (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4, fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 1-2)

• Connection to demannosylation signals recognized by ER lectins: A mechanistic genetic study framed glycoprotein ERAD as depending on lectin decoding of progressively demannosylated high-mannose glycans (Man5–7GlcNAc2) exposing a terminal α1,6-linked mannose, and positioned XTP3B/ERLEC1 as one of the lectins participating in this decoding. (van der Goot et al., Molecular Cell; publication date May 2018; URL https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.03.026) (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3)

These findings indicate ERLEC1 is a lectin rather than an enzyme; its primary biochemical “substrate specificity” is for defined high-mannose N-glycan features (Man5/Man9 and, in ERAD contexts, demannosylated high-mannose signals). (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4, goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3, yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-2)

3.4 Protein–protein interactions and ERAD complex membership
3.4.1 Association with SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD machinery
ERLEC1/XTP3-B associates with the HRD1–SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex, consistent with being a stable component of a large ERAD complex. Co-fractionation and interaction evidence indicates ERLEC1 connects luminal recognition to the membrane ubiquitination/retrotranslocation machinery. (Fujimori et al., FEBS Journal; Mar 2013; URL https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12157) (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4)

A review schematic of mammalian ERAD explicitly depicts OS-9 and XTP3-B associating with the SEL1L–HRD1 complex in the pathway that routes misfolded glycoproteins toward degradation. (hosokawa2010theroleof; Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof media bdd75ee9)

3.4.2 Stabilization by SEL1L
SEL1L appears to stabilize ERLEC1 protein. In SEL1L depletion experiments, ERLEC1/XTP3-B displayed accelerated degradation in a cycloheximide chase (approximately 40% loss over 10 hours, with unchanged mRNA), consistent with proteasomal turnover when not assembled into the complex. (Fujimori et al., FEBS Journal; Mar 2013; URL https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12157) (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4)

3.4.3 Interactions preserved in SEL1L hypomorphic variant models (2024)
In a Nature Communications 2024 study dissecting SEL1L–HRD1 complex formation, ERLEC1 is listed among SEL1L-interacting components (“including OS9 and ERLEC1”), and a SEL1L hypomorphic variant (SEL1LS658P) was reported to attenuate SEL1L–HRD1 interaction while having no detectable effect on SEL1L–lectin interactions with OS9/ERLEC1. Quantitatively, the SEL1L–HRD1 interaction was reduced by ~5-fold in knock-in livers; SEL1L and HRD1 levels were reduced by 20% and 60% in KI cerebellum, and by 20% and 30% in KI HEK293T cells (relative to WT), respectively. (Lin et al., Nature Communications; publication date Feb 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45633-0) (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 6-7)

3.4.4 Expert synthesis: ERLEC1 as a luminal “binder/escort” to SEL1L–HRD1
A 2024 JCI expert commentary summarized ERLEC1/XTP3B (along with OS9 and EDEM1) as luminal factors that bind misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and bring them to SEL1L/SEL1L–HRD1 for ubiquitination and degradation, reflecting a consensus pathway model in which lectins act upstream of the dislocon. (Umphred-Wilson & Adoro, J Clin Invest; publication date Jan 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.1172/jci175448) (umphredwilson2024hypomorphichumansel1l pages 1-2)

4. Functional role in ERAD and proteostasis (including substrate dependence)
4.1 Substrate-specific inhibitory role (negative regulator) — misfolded α1-antitrypsin NHK
A primary mechanistic study concluded that ERLEC1/XTP3-B inhibits ER-associated degradation of a misfolded α1-antitrypsin variant (NHK) carrying M9 glycans, proposing that ERLEC1 can act as a negative regulator that protects newly synthesized/immature glycoproteins from premature degradation. The same study linked lectin activity (glycan binding) to substrate engagement (NHK binding required lectin activity), while ERLEC1’s association with SEL1L did not require lectin activity. (Fujimori et al., FEBS Journal; Mar 2013; URL https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12157) (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 1-2)

Complementary evidence showed ERLEC1 binds an ERAD substrate (α1-antitrypsin nullHong Kong) via the C-terminal MRH domain in a glycan-dependent manner. (Yamaguchi et al., Glycobiology; Nov 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp182) (yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-1, yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-2)

4.2 Redundant and antagonistic roles with OS9 (triage of glycan vs non-glycan degrons)
A genetic deletion study of the two major metazoan Yos9 orthologs (OS9 and XTP3B/ERLEC1) concluded:
• OS9 and XTP3B redundantly promote glycoprotein degradation and stabilize the SEL1L/HRD1 complex.
• XTP3B strongly inhibits degradation of non-glycosylated substrates, and OS9 antagonizes this inhibition.
• The relative abundance of OS9 vs XTP3B and the distribution of glycan and non-glycan degrons within the same substrate influence ERAD “fidelity and processivity,” shaping protein fate in the early secretory pathway.
(van der Goot et al., Molecular Cell; May 2018; URL https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.03.026) (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3)

These findings reconcile apparently conflicting observations (ERLEC1 inhibiting ERAD for some substrates) by supporting a model in which ERLEC1 can both facilitate glycoprotein ERAD (with OS9) and restrain degradation of certain proteins (especially non-glycosylated substrates and specific glycoprotein contexts), thereby tuning triage rather than acting as a simple “on/off” ERAD factor. (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3, fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 1-2)

5. Pathways and cellular processes involving ERLEC1
5.1 Core pathway placement: SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD branch
ERLEC1 is best supported as a luminal substrate-recognition/triage factor positioned upstream of and interacting with the SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD complex. The mammalian pathway model illustrates ERLEC1/XTP3-B and OS9 associating with SEL1L–HRD1 and participating in routing misfolded glycoproteins toward ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. (hosokawa2010theroleof; Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof media bdd75ee9)

5.2 Crosstalk with ER stress (UPR) as a functional context
Because ERAD is a major ER proteostasis pathway, ERLEC1 function is often discussed in the context of ER stress/unfolded protein response (UPR). In multiple myeloma, experimental disruption of ERAD genes induces BiP (an ER stress marker), illustrating that perturbing ERAD increases ER stress in secretory-lineage cancers (see Section 6.1). (de Matos Simoes et al., Nature Cancer; May 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-023-00550-x) (simoes2023genomescalefunctionalgenomics pages 9-10)

6. Recent developments (2023–2024 prioritized)
6.1 Cancer vulnerabilities: multiple myeloma dependency mapping (Nature Cancer 2023)
A genome-scale functional genomics study in multiple myeloma (MM) used CRISPR dependency mapping to identify MM-preferentially essential genes. The authors note that several ERAD-related genes, explicitly including ERLEC1, are more essential in MM versus B-cell lymphomas, aligning ERAD/proteostasis as a lineage-specific vulnerability of immunoglobulin-secreting malignancies. (de Matos Simoes et al., Nature Cancer; publication date May 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-023-00550-x) (simoes2023genomescalefunctionalgenomics pages 7-9)

In the same work, the authors contextualize ERAD as a biological vulnerability in MM due to proteostatic stress from immunoglobulin production and experimentally validate ERAD gene knockouts (e.g., UBE2J1, SYVN1, HERPUD1) as affecting MM viability and ER stress markers. Although ERLEC1 is not individually validated in the excerpted sections, it is grouped within ERAD-related dependencies enriched in MM. (de Matos Simoes et al., Nature Cancer; May 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-023-00550-x) (simoes2023genomescalefunctionalgenomics pages 9-10)

6.2 ERAD machinery in human disease: SEL1L/HRD1 variants (JCI 2024) and mechanistic definition of ERAD complex assembly (Nat Comms 2024)
Mechanistic work in 2024 emphasized that proper SEL1L–HRD1 interaction is required to form a functional HRD1 ERAD complex and documented that SEL1L–lectin interactions with OS9/ERLEC1 are preserved despite compromised SEL1L–HRD1 binding in a hypomorphic variant model. (Lin et al., Nature Communications; Feb 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45633-0) (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 6-7)

An authoritative 2024 JCI commentary framed ERLEC1/XTP3B as part of the luminal recognition/escort layer (with OS9 and EDEM1) that brings misfolded proteins to SEL1L–HRD1 for degradation, highlighting expert consensus on ERLEC1’s pathway role as ERAD biology becomes clinically relevant through pathogenic SEL1L/HRD1 variants. (Umphred-Wilson & Adoro, J Clin Invest; Jan 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.1172/jci175448) (umphredwilson2024hypomorphichumansel1l pages 1-2)

6.3 Disease-associated transcriptomic signatures featuring ERLEC1
6.3.1 Cancer-therapy–related cognitive impairment model (Brain Sciences 2023)
In a mouse model of cognitive impairment after cancer therapy, combined doxorubicin + hindlimb radiation (DOX-RT) altered brain gene expression and significantly increased Erlec1 expression. Table data reported Erlec1 mean normalized counts: control 497.7 (SEM 14.78), DOX 533.0 (SEM 8.97), RT 498.3 (SEM 8.82), DOX-RT 558.3 (SEM 8.70); overall ANOVA F = 7.634, p = 0.0014; with RT vs DOX-RT Tukey p = 0.0037 (n = 6 mice per group). (Demos-Davies et al., Brain Sciences; publication date Dec 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci14010022) (demosdavies2023thedistantmolecular pages 8-10)

6.3.2 Interstitial cystitis host gene expression (Frontiers in Immunology 2024)
A study combining Mendelian randomization and bulk RNA-seq in interstitial cystitis reported ERLEC1 among upregulated “hub genes” (along with CHAC2, ASB3, STAT5A, STAT3), suggesting ERLEC1 can appear in inflammatory/autoimmune-associated transcriptional programs. (Fu et al., Frontiers in Immunology; publication date Sep 2024; URL https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395580) (fu2024gutmicrobiotaand pages 9-10)

7. Current applications and real-world implementations
7.1 Functional genomics and target discovery in secretory cancers
ERLEC1’s inclusion among ERAD-related genes more essential in MM vs B-cell lymphomas supports its use as part of an ER proteostasis vulnerability map for secretory-lineage malignancies; such maps inform prioritization of pathway nodes for therapeutic development, especially in combination with proteasome inhibitors that induce ER stress. (de Matos Simoes et al., Nature Cancer; May 2023; URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-023-00550-x) (simoes2023genomescalefunctionalgenomics pages 7-9, simoes2023genomescalefunctionalgenomics pages 9-10)

7.2 Biomarker/omics signatures (expression panels)
ERLEC1 appears in differential-expression panels in diverse contexts (therapy-induced brain expression changes; inflammatory bladder disease hub-gene set), illustrating a real-world use pattern where ERLEC1 is a feature in transcriptomic signatures rather than a stand-alone biomarker with a mature clinical assay. (demosdavies2023thedistantmolecular pages 8-10, fu2024gutmicrobiotaand pages 9-10)

7.3 Mechanistic pathway modeling of ERAD
The ERAD model depicting ERLEC1 (XTP3-B) together with OS-9 interfacing with the SEL1L–HRD1 complex is used as a canonical representation for how N-glycan-binding lectins feed substrates into the ubiquitination/retrotranslocation machinery. (hosokawa2010theroleof; Jun 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq013) (hosokawa2010theroleof media bdd75ee9)

8. Expert opinion and analysis (authoritative synthesis)
Two complementary lines of evidence shape expert interpretation of ERLEC1 function:
• Biochemical/interaction studies support ERLEC1 as a lectin bound to SEL1L–HRD1 and capable of binding high-mannose glycans (Man5/Man9) via its C-terminal MRH domain. (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4, yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-2)
• Genetic dissection of ER lectins supports ERLEC1 as a triage regulator that (i) redundantly promotes glycoprotein ERAD and stabilizes the SEL1L–HRD1 complex, but (ii) inhibits degradation of non-glycosylated proteins and can restrain ERAD in certain substrate contexts, with OS9 acting antagonistically in the non-glycosylated case. (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3)

This supports a current model in which ERLEC1 is not merely a “degradation receptor,” but a context-dependent triage factor controlling flux and selectivity in ER protein quality control, potentially balancing retention/refolding opportunities versus commitment to degradation. (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3, fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 1-2)

9. Key statistics and quantitative data highlights
• SEL1L stabilizes ERLEC1 protein: ~40% ERLEC1 loss over a 10-hour cycloheximide chase upon SEL1L depletion (protein turnover effect; mRNA unchanged). (Fujimori et al., FEBS J; Mar 2013; URL https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12157) (fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 2-4)
• Glycan-dependence statistical support: Endo H treatment significantly reduced XTP3-B binding in cell-binding assays (reported p < 0.001). (Yamaguchi et al., Glycobiology; Nov 2010; URL https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp182) (yamaguchi2010humanxtp3bbinds pages 1-2)
• ERLEC1 differential expression in a cancer-therapy brain model: Erlec1 ANOVA F = 7.634, p = 0.0014; control mean 497.7 vs DOX-RT mean 558.3 normalized counts (n = 6/group), with RT vs DOX-RT Tukey p = 0.0037.

10. Limitations and open questions for ERLEC1 functional annotation
Despite clear evidence for ER residency, MRH-domain–mediated glycan binding, and ERAD pathway involvement, several items remain incompletely resolved in the provided literature subset:
• High-resolution structural determinants of glycan binding and how ERLEC1’s Man5/Man9 binding relates quantitatively to ERAD “mannose-trimmed” signals (e.g., Man5–7 terminal α1,6 mannose exposure) across diverse substrates.
• Substrate rules that determine whether ERLEC1 promotes ERAD, inhibits ERAD, or stabilizes the dislocon, especially in relation to OS9 abundance and the presence of non-glycan degrons.
These questions are directly motivated by the context-dependent behaviors reported across substrate-focused and genetic studies. (goot2018redundantandantagonistic pages 1-3, fujimori2013endoplasmicreticulumlectin pages 1-2)
