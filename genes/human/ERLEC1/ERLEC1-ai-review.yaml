description: >-
  ERLEC1 (also known as XTP3-B or Erlectin) is an ER-resident lectin containing
  two mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains. It functions as a
  context-dependent triage factor in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradation (ERAD) pathway, recognizing misfolded glycoproteins via their
  trimmed N-glycan sugar moieties and delivering them to the HRD1-SEL1L ubiquitin
  ligase complex for retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. The
  C-terminal MRH domain (MRH2) mediates glycan binding with specificity for
  Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) and Man5-type high-mannose N-glycans exposing a terminal
  alpha-1,6-linked mannose motif (DOI:10.1093/glycob/cwp182,
  DOI:10.1111/febs.12157). ERLEC1 forms a large ER quality control scaffold
  complex together with OS-9, BiP (HSPA5), and the HRD1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase.
  The long isoform (hXTP3-B-long) associates with this scaffold and can retard
  ERAD of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated substrates, while the short
  isoform is excluded from scaffold formation. SEL1L stabilizes ERLEC1 protein;
  SEL1L depletion causes accelerated ERLEC1 degradation (~40% loss over 10 hours
  in cycloheximide chase) without change in mRNA levels (DOI:10.1111/febs.12157).
  Genetic studies reveal that ERLEC1 and OS9 play redundant and antagonistic roles
  in ERAD: both redundantly promote glycoprotein degradation and stabilize
  SEL1L-HRD1, but ERLEC1 strongly inhibits degradation of non-glycosylated
  substrates, with OS9 antagonizing this inhibition, thereby tuning ERAD substrate
  selectivity (DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2018.03.026). Mannose trimming by ER
  mannosidase I is required for substrate delivery from EDEM1 to XTP3-B,
  consistent with its role as a lectin-based ERAD cargo receptor rather than a
  chaperone.

      IBA annotation placing ERLEC1 in the ER lumen, inferred from phylogenetic

      studies. Cruciat et al. (PMID:16531414) showed that Erlectin is a luminal

      subcellular location as ER lumen with experimental evidence. ERLEC1 has a

      IEA annotation from InterPro (IPR045149, OS-9-like domain) mapping to the
      ER unfolded protein response. ERLEC1 is part of the ER quality control
      machinery but its primary role is in ERAD, not the canonical unfolded
      protein response (UPR) signaling pathway. The UPR is a transcriptional
      signaling response involving IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways that activates
      gene expression to cope with ER stress. ERLEC1 does not participate in
      UPR signaling; rather, it functions downstream as a cargo receptor in
      ERAD, recognizing misfolded glycoproteins and delivering them to the
      HRD1-SEL1L complex for retrotranslocation (PMID:18264092, PMID:18502753).

      is GO:0036503 (ERAD pathway), which is already annotated separately.
      This IEA annotation likely arises from an overly broad InterPro-to-GO

      inhibition of mannose trimming blocks substrate association with XTP3-B
      and with E3 ubiquitin ligases HRD1 and SCF(Fbs2). This establishes

      The suggested replacements are holdase chaperone activity or protein folding
      chaperone (GO:0044183), neither of which applies to ERLEC1. ERLEC1/XTP3-B is
      an ER lectin that recognizes misfolded glycoproteins via their trimmed N-glycan
      moieties as part of the ERAD pathway (PMID:21062743, PMID:18502753). It is not

      ER mannosidase I is required for substrate delivery from EDEM1 to XTP3-B,
      establishing ERLEC1 as a lectin-based cargo receptor rather than a protein that
      directly binds unfolded polypeptide chains. Christianson et al. (PMID:18264092)
      demonstrated that the MRH domains of XTP3-B are required for interaction with
      SEL1L but not with substrate, and that XTP3-B and OS-9 are components of
      quality control surveillance pathways that coordinate protein folding with
      membrane dislocation and ubiquitin conjugation. Hosokawa et al. (PMID:18502753)
      showed that hXTP3-B forms a scaffold with HRD1-SEL1L and BiP, and that the
      long isoform retarded ERAD of both glycosylated (NHK) and non-glycosylated
      (NHK-QQQ) substrates. While ERLEC1 does interact with misfolded proteins,
      this interaction is in the context of ERAD substrate recognition and delivery
      to the ubiquitin ligase complex, not chaperone-like unfolded protein binding.
      The ERAD pathway involvement is already captured by GO:0036503.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. The replacement terms (holdase chaperone,
      foldase chaperone) do not apply to ERLEC1, which is a lectin-based ERAD cargo
      receptor, not a chaperone. ERLEC1 recognizes misfolded glycoproteins through
      their N-glycan sugar moieties (requiring mannose trimming) and delivers them
      to the HRD1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex for degradation. This is substrate
      recognition for ERAD targeting, not chaperone-like binding to unfolded
      polypeptide chains. The relevant biological function is already captured by
      the ERAD pathway annotation (GO:0036503) and retrograde protein transport
      annotation (GO:0030970). Similar to SYVN1, ERLEC1 interacts with misfolded
      proteins as part of the ERAD machinery, which does not constitute unfolded
      protein binding in the chaperone sense.

    summary: >-
      IMP annotation for negative regulation of retrograde protein transport
      (ER to cytosol) based on Zhong et al. (PMID:25660456). This paper used
      RNAi knockdown and a dislocation-reconstituted GFP (drGFP) assay to
      assess the requirement of ERAD components for dislocation of NHK (null
      Hong Kong variant of alpha1-antitrypsin). The study found that knockdown
      of 7 of 21 ERAD components enhanced NHK dislocation. If ERLEC1 knockdown
      enhanced dislocation, this would be consistent with a negative regulatory
      role. However, this seemingly contradicts the established role of ERLEC1
      as a facilitator of ERAD (delivering substrates to the ubiquitin ligase).
      Hosokawa et al. (PMID:18502753) showed that overexpression of the long
      isoform of hXTP3-B retarded ERAD of both NHK and NHK-QQQ, which is
      consistent with a negative regulatory effect when in excess. This
      paradoxical role may reflect that excess ERLEC1 sequesters substrates or
      blocks the retrotranslocation channel. The annotation captures the
      experimental observation but should be interpreted cautiously as possibly
      reflecting an overexpression/dosage artifact rather than a normal
      physiological function.

    reason: >-
      The annotation captures a real experimental observation (IMP evidence)
      but the negative regulation of retrotranslocation is likely not the
      primary physiological role of ERLEC1. Its core function is as a cargo
      receptor that facilitates ERAD. The negative regulatory effect may
      reflect dosage-dependent or context-dependent modulation. Hosokawa et al.
      (PMID:18502753) also observed that hXTP3-B overexpression retards ERAD,
      consistent with a scaffolding role where excess cargo receptor can
      sequester substrates away from the retrotranslocation machinery.

      glycoproteins in the ER. Christianson et al. (PMID:18264092) showed

    ERLEC1 functions as a lectin-based cargo receptor and context-dependent triage
    factor in the ERAD pathway. Its C-terminal MRH domain (MRH2) binds
    Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) and Man5-type high-mannose N-glycans, specifically
    recognizing a terminal alpha-1,6-linked mannose motif that is exposed during
    progressive demannosylation of misfolded glycoproteins (DOI:10.1093/glycob/cwp182,
    DOI:10.1111/febs.12157). ERLEC1 delivers recognized substrates to the
    HRD1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex for retrotranslocation and proteasomal
    degradation. Mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I is required for substrate
    delivery from EDEM1 to ERLEC1. SEL1L stabilizes ERLEC1 protein within the
    ERAD complex (DOI:10.1111/febs.12157). Genetic studies reveal that ERLEC1 and
    OS9 have redundant roles in promoting glycoprotein ERAD but antagonistic roles
    regarding non-glycosylated substrates: ERLEC1 inhibits degradation of
    non-glycosylated proteins, with OS9 counteracting this inhibition, thereby
    tuning ERAD substrate selectivity and fidelity (DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2018.03.026).

        this large ER quality control scaffold complex, containing ER lectins,
        a chaperone, and a ubiquitin ligase, provides a platform for the
        recognition and sorting of misfolded glycoproteins as well as
        nonglycosylated proteins prior to retrotranslocation into the cytoplasm
        for degradation
