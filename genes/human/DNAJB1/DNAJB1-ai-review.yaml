description: >-
  DNAJB1 (also known as HSP40, HDJ1) is a class II (class B) J-domain protein that
  functions as a co-chaperone for HSP70 family members. Its domain architecture comprises
  an N-terminal J-domain (with conserved HPD motif), a glycine/phenylalanine-rich (G/F)
  region, and C-terminal beta-sandwich client-binding domains (CTD-I and CTD-II) plus a
  dimerization domain; notably, class B JDPs lack the zinc-finger-like region present in
  class A members (DOI:10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004). DNAJB1 stimulates the ATPase activity
  of HSP70 and delivers substrates to the HSP70 chaperone machinery, promoting protein
  folding (foldase-type activity). A key regulatory mechanism is G/F-mediated
  autoinhibition of the J-domain, which is relieved by a secondary contact between the
  Hsp70 C-terminal EEVD motif and a positively charged groove in DNAJB1 CTD-I, enabling
  productive Hsp70 engagement (DOI:10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004). Beyond simple refolding,
  DNAJB1 participates in JDP scaffolding and hetero-oligomerization to create potent
  Hsp70-based disaggregases, remaining associated with aggregates to recruit multiple
  Hsp70 molecules (DOI:10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004). DNAJB1 also negatively regulates
  HSF1 transcriptional activity during the attenuation phase of the heat shock response
  by binding HSF1 in complex with HSP70. It can modulate the p53/MDM2 axis by binding
  and stabilizing MDM2 and destabilizing PDCD5, with context-dependent effects on p53
  signaling (DOI:10.3390/ijms222413527). DNAJB1 is stress-inducible and translocates
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and nucleolus upon heat shock. Notably, the
  DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion drives fibrolamellar carcinoma and is a distinct chimeric
  oncoprotein that should not be conflated with wild-type DNAJB1 co-chaperone function.

      DNAJB1 is a class II J-domain co-chaperone that promotes protein folding through the
      HSP70 chaperone machinery. Rauch and Gestwicki (PMID:24318877) showed that combinations
      of J proteins including DnaJB1 with NEFs and HSP70 produce potent chaperone activities
      in luciferase refolding assays. Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) showed that DNAJB1
      supports luciferase refolding when paired with HSP70, classifying it as a foldase-type
      co-chaperone. The IBA annotation for protein folding is well supported by phylogenetic

      While experimentally validated (PMID:9499401), negative regulation of transcription
      is not a core molecular function of DNAJB1 but rather a downstream consequence of
      its co-chaperone activity in the HSP70 complex. DNAJB1 represses HSF1 transcription

      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962).
      DNAJB1 is a class II J-domain protein that functions as a foldase-type co-chaperone
      for HSP70, not as an independent holdase. Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) showed that
      DNAJB1 promotes efficient luciferase refolding when paired with HSP70, placing it in
      the foldase category. UniProt describes DNAJB1 as stimulating ATP hydrolysis and the
      folding of unfolded proteins mediated by HSPA1A/B. The correct replacement term is
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which accurately describes DNAJB1's role in
      binding to proteins to assist the protein folding process as part of the HSP70
      chaperone machinery.

      foldase-type co-chaperone, not a holdase. Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) demonstrated
      that chaperones supporting luciferase refolding (foldase activity) were poor suppressors
      of polyQ aggregation (holdase activity), and vice versa. DNAJB1 promotes refolding
      when paired with HSP70, classifying it as a foldase. This IBA annotation by phylogenetic
      inference correctly identified the general chaperone activity of DNAJB1, but the term

      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962). This
      IDA annotation from Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) demonstrated that DNAJB1 interacts
      with unfolded/denatured substrates in the context of the HSP70 chaperone machinery.
      The study assessed effects of overexpression of HSP70/HSPA and HSP40/DNAJ family
      members on refolding of heat-denatured luciferase and suppression of polyQ aggregation.
      DNAJB1 promoted efficient luciferase refolding when paired with HSP70, classifying it
      as a foldase-type co-chaperone. Unlike DNAJB6 and DNAJB8, which have independent
      holdase/anti-aggregation activity, DNAJB1 primarily functions by delivering substrates
      to HSP70 and stimulating HSP70 ATPase activity for the protein folding cycle. UniProt
      confirms that DNAJB1 stimulates ATP hydrolysis and the folding of unfolded proteins
      mediated by HSPA1A/B in vitro (PMID:24318877). The appropriate replacement is
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which accurately captures DNAJB1's role in
      binding proteins to assist folding as part of the HSP70 machine.
    action: MODIFY

      GO:0051082 is scheduled for obsoletion (go-ontology#30962), with the recommended

      or holdase chaperone activity for holdases. Hageman et al. (PMID:21231916) is the
      key reference for this IDA annotation. The paper showed that DNAJB1 belongs to the
      foldase class of J-domain co-chaperones: it promotes luciferase refolding when
      combined with HSP70 but is a poor suppressor of polyQ aggregation. This functional
      classification is consistent with DNAJB1's known mechanism as a class II J-domain
      protein that stimulates HSP70 ATPase activity and delivers substrates to the HSP70
      folding machinery. Additionally, DNAJB1 is a component of the Hsp70 disaggregation
      machinery, working with Hsp70 and HSPA4 to disassemble protein aggregates in an
      ATP-dependent process. The correct replacement term is GO:0044183 (protein folding
      chaperone), defined as binding to a protein or protein-containing complex to assist
      the protein folding process.

      DNAJB1 is a class B J-domain co-chaperone (foldase-type) that binds unfolded/misfolded
      protein substrates via its C-terminal beta-sandwich domains (CTD-I and CTD-II) and
      delivers them to HSP70 for productive ATP-dependent refolding. DNAJB1 stimulates the
      ATPase activity of HSP70 via its J-domain HPD motif and promotes substrate release
      and refolding. A distinctive feature of DNAJB1 is G/F-mediated autoinhibition of
      its J-domain, which is relieved by a secondary contact between Hsp70's EEVD motif
      and a positively charged groove in CTD-I, enabling productive Hsp70 engagement
      (DOI:10.1016/j.tcb.2022.05.004). DNAJB1 also participates in disaggregation by

  findings:
    - statement: >-
        Class B JDPs (including DNAJB1) have G/F-mediated autoinhibition of the
        J-domain; interaction between Hsp70's EEVD motif and DNAJB1 CTD-I relieves
        this autoinhibition for productive Hsp70 engagement.
    - statement: >-
        JDP scaffolding and hetero-oligomerization, including DNAJB1 participation,
        creates potent Hsp70-based disaggregases; DNAJB1 remains associated with
        aggregates to recruit multiple Hsp70 molecules.

  findings:
    - statement: >-
        DNAJB1/HDJ1 binds and stabilizes MDM2 and destabilizes PDCD5, modulating
        p53-mediated apoptosis; can also support mutant p53 gain-of-function
        phenotypes in context-dependent manner.
