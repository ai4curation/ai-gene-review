You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Title: Functional annotation research report for human DNAJB1 (UniProt P25685)

1. Executive summary and target verification

DNAJB1 (UniProt P25685; aliases HDJ1/HSP40/DNAJ1) encodes a canonical cytosolic/nuclear class B J-domain protein (JDP; “Hsp40”) that functions primarily as a co-chaperone for Hsp70 family chaperones by (i) recognizing non-native proteins through its C-terminal client-binding domains and (ii) stimulating Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis through its N-terminal J-domain, thereby coupling client capture to the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

A frequent point of confusion is that “DNAJB1” also appears in the oncogenic DNAJB1–PRKACA gene fusion that drives fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). The fusion is a distinct entity (a chimeric oncoprotein/oncokinase) and should not be conflated with the wild-type DNAJB1 co-chaperone. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8, song2024modelsoffibrolamellar pages 1-2)

2. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

2.1. J-domain proteins (Hsp40/JDPs) and class B architecture

J-domain proteins (JDPs; historically called Hsp40s) are co-chaperones that specify Hsp70 functions. Their defining element is the ~70 amino-acid J-domain containing a conserved HPD motif, which is required to stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 13-14, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

Class B JDPs (the DNAJB family) have an N-terminal J-domain, an adjacent glycine/phenylalanine-rich (G/F-rich) region, and C-terminal β-sandwich client-binding domains (CTD-I and CTD-II) plus a dimerization domain; class B members notably lack the class A zinc-finger-like region. DNAJB1/HDJ1 is among class B proteins described as retaining CTD-II and a dimerization domain. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 4-6)

A visual summary of class B architecture and a structural view using DNAJB1 as a representative are shown in Zhang et al. 2023 (Figure 3). (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone media 92edd5fb, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone media 87ff823b)

2.2. Mechanistic role of DNAJB1 in the Hsp70 ATPase cycle

In the canonical Hsp70 cycle, the J-domain docks on ATP-bound Hsp70 (at the interdomain linker) and positions the HPD motif to activate Hsp70’s catalytic center. This stimulates ATP hydrolysis, shifting Hsp70 to a high-affinity client-binding state (“ultra-affinity”), facilitating client capture and iterative refolding/unfolding cycles; nucleotide exchange factors then promote ADP release to reset the cycle. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

DNAJB1 also participates in regulatory interactions that tune this cycle. For example, class B JDPs can show G/F-mediated autoinhibition of the J-domain; in DNAJB1/HDJ1, interaction between Hsp70’s C-terminal EEVD motif and a groove in DNAJB1 CTD-I is described as relieving this inhibition and enabling productive Hsp70 engagement (a mechanism discussed in the context of disaggregation activity). (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9)

2.3. Primary functional annotation (what DNAJB1 “does”)

DNAJB1 is not an enzyme that catalyzes a defined chemical reaction; rather, it is an ATPase-cycle regulator and substrate-targeting factor for Hsp70. Its primary biochemical function is to (i) bind non-native protein clients via C-terminal regions and (ii) activate Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis via its J-domain/HPD motif, thereby increasing Hsp70 client-binding and enabling folding/refolding, disaggregation, or triage to degradation pathways depending on context. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

2.4. Subcellular localization (current evidence level)

The JDP family spans many compartments (e.g., ER, mitochondria, cytosol/nucleus), but the evidence assembled here does not provide a DNAJB1-specific steady-state localization statement beyond placing DNAJB1 as a prototypical (non-organelle-targeted) class B JDP used as a representative in cytosolic Hsp70 circuits and aggregate-associated recruitment of Hsp70. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 28-32, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

3. Biological processes and pathways

3.1. Proteostasis networks and stress responses

JDP–Hsp70 systems are central to cellular proteostasis and are transcriptionally tuned by stress responses such as heat shock and unfolded protein response programs, with dysregulation linked to neurodegeneration and cancer. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 4-6)

Within proteostasis, DNAJB1 has been highlighted as capable of remaining associated with aggregates to recruit multiple Hsp70 molecules, consistent with a role in assembling effective disaggregation/processing machinery on aggregated substrates. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

3.2. p53/MDM2 axis and cancer-relevant signaling

A 2021 review summarizes evidence that DNAJB1/HDJ1 can functionally intersect with p53 signaling via complexes with HSC70/HSP70 and ATP. DNAJB1/HDJ1 has been reported to bind and stabilize MDM2 and to modulate p53 regulation, and it has also been reported to destabilize PDCD5, suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis in some contexts; other contexts suggest DNAJB1/HDJ1 can support mutant p53 gain-of-function phenotypes, highlighting strong context dependence (wild-type vs mutant p53; cellular setting). (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 16-17, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 8-9)

4. Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

4.1. 2023: refined mechanistic models for DNAJB1 regulation within Hsp70–JDP circuits

A 2023 Trends in Cell Biology review emphasizes that DNAJB1 is regulated by multiple intrinsic autoinhibitory elements and that a secondary contact between the Hsp70 EEVD motif and a positively charged groove in DNAJB1 CTD-I can relieve autoinhibition, although the precise trigger remains unresolved. The same review discusses how JDP scaffolding/hetero-oligomerization (including DNAJB1 participation) can create potent Hsp70-based disaggregases, underscoring network-level rather than single-protein regulation. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9)

4.2. 2024: DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion as a model of “DNAJB1 sequence repurposed” in cancer

Although distinct from wild-type DNAJB1 function, the DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion dominates DNAJB1-related translational research in 2023–2024.

(i) Multi-omics and tumor classification: A 2024 Nature Communications study analyzed RNA-seq from 1,412 liver tumors and assembled 220 FLC/FLC-like samples (127 newly sequenced plus 91 reprocessed external), deriving an FLC transcriptional signature (693 genes: 287 up, 406 down) from 81 matched tumor-normal pairs. It reported that primary tumors vs normal differed in 6.5% of transcripts (n=3,506), while metastases vs primaries differed in only 0.6% (n=310), and showed strong concordance between proteome and transcriptome (R2=0.8). (requena2024livercancermultiomics pages 1-2, requena2024livercancermultiomics pages 2-3)

(ii) Downstream transcriptional mediators: A 2024 PLOS Genetics study identified the primate-restricted lncRNA LINC00473 as among the most upregulated genes in FLC tumors; its expression was strongly suppressed by RNAi-mediated inhibition of the DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion. Functional loss/gain experiments supported that LINC00473 promotes tumor growth, suppresses apoptosis, and alters metabolism (promoting glycolysis; affecting spare respiratory capacity). (ma2024dnajb1prkacafusionproteinregulated pages 1-4)

(iii) Tumor immunology/neoantigens: A 2024 Cell Reports Medicine study emphasized that DNAJB1–PRKACA is present in >90% of FLC cases and thus represents a shared neoantigen target. The authors reported that endogenous fusion-specific CD8 T cell responses are rare, but identified two functional fusion-specific TCRs, one of which showed strong anti-tumor activity in vivo, supporting TCR-based cellular therapy development. (kirk2024dnajb1prkacafusionneoantigens pages 1-3)

5. Current applications and real-world implementations

5.1. Diagnostics: DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion detection in fibrolamellar carcinoma

A 2024 review of FLC models states that “almost all” FLC tumors have the DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion and that the fusion is accepted as a diagnostic criterion, described as an extremely sensitive and specific molecular marker in the FLC diagnostic setting (noting that other literature has reported rare detection in non-FLC oncocytic neoplasms). (song2024modelsoffibrolamellar pages 1-2, hackenbruch2024fusionvac2201aphase pages 11-11)

5.2. Therapeutics in development: vaccines, TCR-T, and nucleic-acid therapeutics targeting the fusion

Peptide vaccine + checkpoint blockade (clinical trial design, 2024): FusionVAC22_01 is a phase I, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating a DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion transcript-based peptide vaccine (Fusion-VAC-XS15) combined with anti–PD-L1 therapy (atezolizumab). Trial registration: EU CT 2022-502869-17-01; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05937295. The design includes two vaccine doses 4 weeks apart and atezolizumab every 4 weeks through a 54-week treatment phase. (hackenbruch2024fusionvac2201aphase pages 1-2)

The same trial report provides population-scale “implementability” statistics: predicted binding to 1,290 HLA class II alleles and inclusion of sequences from 13 frequent HLA-I alleles, covering ~96.6% of the European population and ~93.8% worldwide. Planned enrollment is n=20. (hackenbruch2024fusionvac2201aphase pages 7-8)

GalNAc-siRNA fusion junction targeting (preclinical, 2024): A 2024 Molecular Therapy study designed chemically stabilized GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs against the DNAJB1::PRKACA fusion junction to enable liver uptake (ASGR-mediated). In Huh7 cells expressing the fusion and in multiple FLC patient-derived xenograft models, these siRNAs preferentially targeted the fusion over native DNAJB1/PRKACA, achieved productive uptake, and produced durable inhibition of PDX growth in vivo with no detectable toxicities reported. (neumayer2024galnacconjugatedsirnatargeting pages 1-2)

TCR-based cell therapy (preclinical, 2024): Fusion-specific TCR discovery and validation provides a path to engineered TCR-T approaches. The 2024 Cell Reports Medicine study identified two functional DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion-specific TCRs; one showed strong in vivo anti-tumor activity. (kirk2024dnajb1prkacafusionneoantigens pages 1-3)

6. Expert opinion and analysis (authoritative synthesis)

A key consensus view from high-level reviews is that JDPs such as DNAJB1 operate as network “catalysts” that confer substrate specificity and functional diversity on Hsp70s, with regulation distributed across domain architecture, autoinhibitory intramolecular contacts, and co-assembly/scaffolding mechanisms; accordingly, DNAJB1 function is best understood as circuit behavior rather than a single binary activity. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 4-6, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 8-9)

In cancer biology, expert synthesis emphasizes context dependence of DNAJB1/HDJ1 interactions with p53 pathway components, with evidence supporting both pro-survival and potentially tumor-suppressive outcomes depending on p53 status and experimental setting, underscoring the need for client- and genotype-specific functional studies when interpreting DNAJB1 as a therapeutic target. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 8-9, kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8)

7. Quantitative statistics and data highlights (recent)

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (fusion-driven disease context)

Incidence: ~0.02 per 100,000 annually in the US. (kirk2024dnajb1prkacafusionneoantigens pages 1-3)

Fusion prevalence: DNAJB1–PRKACA present in >90% of FLC cases (driver/neoantigen rationale). (kirk2024dnajb1prkacafusionneoantigens pages 1-3)

Mortality: estimated 60–80% of patients ultimately succumb (as reported in 2024 Cell Reports Medicine). (kirk2024dnajb1prkacafusionneoantigens pages 1-3)

5-year survival: ~45% (reported in the 2024 FusionVAC22_01 clinical trial article background). (hackenbruch2024fusionvac2201aphase pages 1-2)

Multi-omics cohort sizes and tumor similarity (2024 Nature Communications): 1,412 liver tumor RNA-seq samples analyzed; 220 FLC/FLC-like samples assembled; 693-gene signature; 6.5% transcripts altered in primary vs normal (n=3,506) vs 0.6% altered in metastasis vs primary (n=310); proteome–transcriptome concordance R2=0.8. (requena2024livercancermultiomics pages 1-2, requena2024livercancermultiomics pages 2-3)

8. Practical notes for functional annotation (what to record in a gene card)

Molecular function: “Hsp70 co-chaperone; stimulates Hsp70 ATPase via J-domain HPD motif; binds non-native client proteins via CTD-I/CTD-II; supports disaggregation/folding/triage depending on co-chaperone network context.” (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 2-4, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

Cellular component: broadly consistent with cytosolic/nuclear JDP circuits (no organelle-targeting described in the evidence collected here); may associate with protein aggregates as a platform for Hsp70 recruitment. (zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 3-4)

Biological processes/pathways: proteostasis and stress response; p53/MDM2 axis modulation; broader cancer-relevant signaling is context-dependent. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8, zhang2023jdomainproteinchaperone pages 4-6)

Caution/ambiguity: Separate all annotations for wild-type DNAJB1 from those for the DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion oncoprotein used in FLC diagnostics and translational programs. (kaida2021regulationofp53 pages 6-8, song2024modelsoffibrolamellar pages 1-2)
