description: >
  DRAM1 (DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1) is a lysosomal multi-pass membrane
  protein with six transmembrane segments, primarily localized to LAMP1-positive lysosomes with
  its C-terminus facing the cytosol. It is a canonical p53-induced autophagy modulator that
  plays central roles in: (1) promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion via stabilization of
  lysosomal VAMP8 by blocking CHIP-mediated ubiquitination, thereby enabling STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8
  SNARE complex assembly; (2) regulating ER-lysosome membrane contact sites through interaction
  with STIM1, affecting calcium homeostasis and ER-phagy; (3) enhancing lysosomal acidification
  and protease activation; and (4) promoting xenophagy (antimicrobial autophagy) in host defense
  against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria. DRAM1 is transcriptionally activated by
  p53 and p73, and is down-regulated in tumor cells by methylation-dependent transcriptional
  silencing. While DRAM1 is best characterized as a positive regulator of autophagy and
  p53-mediated apoptosis, its precise enzymatic function remains unclear; it appears to act
  primarily as an adapter/scaffold protein facilitating autophagy machinery assembly and
  organelle contact site formation.

    summary: >
      DRAM1 is a well-established lysosomal membrane protein. The IBA annotation based on
      phylogenetic analysis is strongly supported by multiple experimental studies showing
      DRAM1 localization to LAMP1-positive lysosomes (Wang et al., 2024 PNAS; Crighton et al.,
      2006 Cell PMID:16839881). UniProt also annotates DRAM1 to the lysosomal membrane based
      on experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Lysosomal localization is a core, well-documented feature of DRAM1. The protein contains
      6 transmembrane segments and resides primarily on lysosomes with partial localization to
      late endosomes and autophagosomes. This is supported by the original discovery paper
      (PMID:16839881) and recent mechanistic studies.

  review:
    summary: >
      DRAM1 is a canonical autophagy modulator, as indicated by its full name "DNA
      damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1". Multiple mechanistic studies confirm
      DRAM1 regulates autophagy at multiple levels including autophagosome-lysosome fusion
      (via VAMP8 stabilization) and ER-phagy (via STIM1 interaction).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Regulation of autophagy is the primary, defining function of DRAM1. The IBA annotation
      accurately captures the core function at the appropriate level of specificity. More
      specific terms (e.g., positive regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion) could be
      added as additional annotations but this general term correctly describes the overall
      role.

      This IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping is appropriate. DRAM1's

      (GO:0010506) is more specific, this broader term is also accurate.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      DRAM1 is directly involved in autophagy processes, particularly at the
      autophagosome-lysosome fusion step. While the IBA/IDA annotations for "regulation of
      autophagy" are more informative about DRAM1's regulatory role, this general autophagy
      annotation is not incorrect as DRAM1 is an integral component of the autophagy machinery.

  review:
    summary: >
      DRAM1 plays a critical role in p53-mediated apoptosis. The original discovery paper
      (Crighton et al., 2006) demonstrated that DRAM1 is required for p53-induced apoptosis,
      linking autophagy to programmed cell death. However, DRAM1 is not directly an apoptotic
      effector but rather modulates apoptosis through its autophagy regulatory function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >
      While DRAM1 contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis, this is secondary to its primary
      autophagy function. The original paper states DRAM1 is essential for p53-mediated
      apoptosis but this is through its autophagy-modulating activity. DRAM1 can also
      recruit BAX to lysosomes to trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization in specific
      contexts. This annotation is valid but represents a downstream consequence rather
      than core molecular function.

      This annotation derives from a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid study (Rolland et al.,
      2014, Cell) that identified an interaction between DRAM1 and C1orf21. While technically
      valid, "protein binding" is uninformative about DRAM1's actual molecular function.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >
      The term "protein binding" is too generic to be informative. DRAM1 has specific,
      functionally relevant protein interactions (e.g., VAMP8, STIM1) that should be
      annotated with more specific terms if possible. This high-throughput interaction
      with C1orf21 lacks functional validation and does not illuminate DRAM1's mechanism.
      While not incorrect, such generic annotations provide little biological insight.

      This IEA annotation was transferred from orthologous genes via Ensembl Compara.
      While autophagy is induced by metabolic stress including oxygen-glucose deprivation,

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

      The annotation is plausible given DRAM1's role as a stress-responsive autophagy
      modulator that is induced by p53 activation. However, this represents a specific

  review:
    summary: >
      CRITICAL ISSUE: PMID:19895784 (Park et al., 2009) is primarily about DRAM2/TMEM77, not
      DRAM1. The paper identifies DRAM2 as a DRAM-homologous protein and studies its
      lysosomal localization. While the paper mentions that co-expression of DRAM2 with
      DRAM (DRAM1) induces cell death, the primary focus is on DRAM2. Nevertheless, the
      annotation itself (regulation of autophagy for DRAM1) is correct based on other
      literature; this reference is just poorly chosen.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >

      This annotation citing cytoplasmic localization for DRAM1 based on PMID:19895784 is

      specific organellar localization.
