# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8N682
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 1; AltName: Full=Damage-regulated autophagy modulator;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DRAM1; Synonyms=DRAM;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DRAM/TMEM150 family. .
- **Key Domains:** DRAM/TMEM150_Autophagy_Mod. (IPR050911); Frag1/DRAM/Sfk1. (IPR019402); Frag1 (PF10277)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DRAM1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DRAM1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DRAM1** (gene ID: DRAM1, UniProt: Q8N682) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified that the requested target is the human gene DRAM1 (DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1; UniProt Q8N682). Recent primary literature characterizes DRAM1 as a conserved, multi-pass lysosomal membrane protein and canonical p53 target, consistent with the human UniProt entry and the DRAM/TMEM family description. Human-cell studies (HEK293T, U2OS) and in vivo models (Drosophila) localize the full-length human DRAM1 to LAMP1-positive lysosomes with six hydrophobic transmembrane segments and a cytosol-facing C-terminus, matching the expected topological class for this family (PNAS 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 3-3, wang2024thep53target pages 3-4, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10). No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified in the 2023–2024 literature.

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and topology: DRAM1 is a conserved, multi-pass lysosomal membrane protein (six transmembrane segments) whose C-terminus faces the cytosol. It resides primarily on lysosomes with partial localization to late endosomes and autophagosomes. Proper lysosomal targeting involves adaptor protein complexes, with AP-4 playing a major role (human cells) (PNAS, 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 3-3, wang2024thep53target pages 3-4, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10). 
- Primary role in autophagy/lysosome biology: DRAM1 is a canonical p53-induced factor that promotes autophagy and lysosomal function. Mechanistically, DRAM1 can (i) enhance lysosomal acidification and protease activation, (ii) promote autophagosome–lysosome fusion and autolysosome formation, and (iii) engage selective autophagy programs, including ER-phagy; it can also recruit BAX to lysosomes to trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization in specific contexts (PNAS, 2024; Nat Commun, 2025) (wang2024thep53target pages 9-10, zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 1-2). 
- Cargo/pathway selectivity: DRAM1 modulates selective autophagy programs beyond bulk autophagy. In 2024, DRAM1 was shown to regulate ER–lysosome contact sites through STIM1, coupling lysosomal function to ER stress and ER-phagy. Prior and concurrent data connect DRAM1 to mitophagy-relevant stress responses in Parkinsonian models, and to xenophagy defenses in mycobacterial infection models (PNAS, 2024; Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 3-3, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10).
- Upstream regulation: DRAM1 is transcriptionally induced by p53 (human cancer cell lines; knockdown of p53 lowers DRAM1 mRNA and protein). In innate immunity, Dram1 lies downstream of TLR–MYD88–NF-κB signaling in zebrafish infection models, positioning it within a stress- and pathogen-responsive regulatory network (Sci Rep, 2025; Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- ER–lysosome contact sites and Ca2+ homeostasis: A 2024 PNAS study demonstrated that DRAM1 physically and functionally promotes ER–lysosome contacts via STIM1, disrupting ER structure, triggering ER stress, and inducing ER-phagy; overexpression of STIM1 mitigated these effects. The work links DRAM1 to calcium homeostasis and organelle contact-site biology, establishing roles beyond classical autophagy induction (PNAS, 2024; published Sept 18, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400531121) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10).
- Autolysosome formation via VAMP8 stabilization: A 2025 Nature Communications study (received 2024) revealed that DRAM1 binds and stabilizes lysosomal VAMP8 by blocking CHIP-mediated ubiquitination (Lys68/72/75). DRAM1 thereby promotes assembly of the STX17–SNAP29–VAMP8 SNARE complex, enhancing autophagosome–lysosome fusion (Nat Commun, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60887-y) (zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 1-2, zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 8-9).
- Cancer signaling and metabolism: In gastric cancer models (2024–2025), DRAM1 promoted proliferation, migration/metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling; DRAM1 knockdown decreased p-AKT/p-mTOR and curtailed tumor growth in vivo (Scientific Reports, 2025; accepted Jan 20, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-87389-7) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16, wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 4-5, wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 3-4, wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 5-7).
- Neurodegeneration context: A 2025 review synthesized how DRAM1-mediated ER–lysosome tethering and lysosomal dysfunction intersect with endomembrane network failure in neurodegenerative diseases, integrating the 2024 PNAS findings into disease mechanisms (Exp Mol Med, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01579-x) (kim2025failureoflysosomal pages 10-10).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Cancer models: Genetic suppression of DRAM1 reduced in vivo tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft models of gastric cancer, consistent with attenuated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. The study also explored pharmacologic interactions (e.g., PI3K inhibitor LY294002, rapamycin) that intersect with DRAM1-driven phenotypes, suggesting combinatorial therapeutic avenues (Scientific Reports, 2025) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 3-4, wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 5-7). 
- Infection models (xenophagy): In zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum, dram1 mRNA overexpression reduced bacterial burden and increased LC3 recruitment and acidification of Mm-containing compartments. Dram1 action was independent of optn and p62 (double mutants) but required myd88, providing an in vivo proof-of-principle of host-directed, DRAM1-mediated xenophagy enhancement (Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1331818) (xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 12-12, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10).
- Organellar contacts and stress modulation: The 2024 mechanistic PNAS work suggests that manipulating DRAM1–STIM1 interactions could modulate ER stress and ER-phagy, presenting a potential avenue for therapeutic modulation of stress-responsive autophagy pathways in degenerative diseases and cancer (PNAS, 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative autophagy–cancer review: Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology (2023) frames DRAM1 as a canonical p53 target within autophagy networks that can take tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting roles depending on context, aligning with the dual roles seen in recent gastric and liver cancer models (Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-023-00585-z) ().
- Mechanistic novelty and disease linkage: The 2024 PNAS paper places DRAM1 at ER–lysosome contact sites via STIM1, extending DRAM1’s role to calcium and ER-stress control. A 2025 review integrates these findings into broader neurodegenerative disease models, underscoring lysosomal acidification and contact site physiology as therapeutic targets (PNAS, 2024; Exp Mol Med, 2025) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, kim2025failureoflysosomal pages 10-10).
- Cancer cell-extravasation pathway: The 2025 Nature Communications paper provides a mechanistic model whereby DRAM1 promotes autolysosome formation via VAMP8 stabilization, linking enhanced autophagic flux to metastatic extravasation in HCC—thereby identifying a druggable axis (VAMP8 ubiquitination/CHIP interaction) for anti-metastatic strategies (Nat Commun, 2025) (zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 1-2, zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 8-9).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- DRAM1–p53 regulation (gastric cancer cells): p53 knockdown significantly reduced DRAM1 mRNA in AGS and HGC27 cells (e.g., AGS sip53-1 and sip53-2 vs control, p<0.001; HGC27, p=0.002) and lowered DRAM1 protein (Scientific Reports, 2025) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16).
- In vivo tumor suppression by DRAM1 knockdown: In male nude mouse xenografts, DRAM1 knockdown “significantly reduced the growth rate, size, and weight” of tumors and increased TUNEL-positive apoptosis; DRAM1 knockdown decreased PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway readouts in tumor tissue (Scientific Reports, 2025) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 3-4).
- Zebrafish xenophagy enhancement by dram1 overexpression: One-cell-stage dram1 mRNA overexpression increased LC3 colocalization with Mycobacterium marinum and reduced pathogen burden at 2 dpi; effects remained in optn/p62 double mutants but were absent in myd88 mutants, indicating dependence on innate TLR signaling (Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024) (xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10).

Mechanistic integration and pathway placement
- Upstream: DNA damage and other stresses activate p53, which transactivates DRAM1. In innate immune contexts, TLR–MYD88–NF-κB signaling can upregulate Dram1 (zebrafish) (Sci Rep, 2025; Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10).
- Localization/topology: DRAM1 is a lysosomal multi-pass membrane protein (6 TMs) with a cytosolic C-terminus; it also partially localizes to RAB7-positive late endosomes and LC3-positive autophagosomes. AP-4 contributes to DRAM1 trafficking from the Golgi to lysosomes (PNAS, 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 3-3, wang2024thep53target pages 3-4, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10).
- Autophagosome–lysosome fusion: DRAM1 directly stabilizes VAMP8, enabling STX17–SNAP29–VAMP8 assembly to drive autolysosome formation; this fusion step links DRAM1 to maturation of the autophagic pathway (Nat Commun, 2025) (zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 1-2, zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 8-9).
- Organelle contact sites and Ca2+ signaling: DRAM1 promotes ER–lysosome contacts through STIM1, altering Ca2+ homeostasis, ER stress, and ER-phagy signaling (PNAS, 2024) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 9-10).
- Downstream cellular outcomes: In cancer, DRAM1 intersects with PI3K/AKT/mTOR and EMT programs (GC models), and in HCC models contributes to extravasation via enhanced autolysosome formation; in infection, DRAM1 promotes xenophagy and lysosomal acidification of mycobacteria-containing compartments; in neuronal stress models, DRAM1 modifies mitochondrial/ER stress responses (Sci Rep, 2025; Nat Commun, 2025; Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024; PNAS, 2024) (wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16, zhang2025dram1promotesthe pages 1-2, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 12-12, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10, wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, wang2024thep53target pages 3-3).

Limitations and open questions
- While strong evidence supports p53-mediated regulation and lysosomal/autophagic functions, comprehensive human clinical expression statistics (IHC prevalence, hazard ratios) remain limited in recent mechanistic reports; larger clinical cohorts and multi-omic integration will be valuable. The extent to which DRAM1 modulates additional selective autophagy processes (e.g., mitophagy vs ER-phagy vs xenophagy) in human tissues remains an active area of investigation (PNAS, 2024; Front Cell Infect Microbiol, 2024; Sci Rep, 2025) (wang2024thep53target pages 1-2, xie2024xenophagyreceptorsoptn pages 8-10, wu2025dram1enhancesthe pages 15-16).
