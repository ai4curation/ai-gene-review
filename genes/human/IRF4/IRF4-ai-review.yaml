  IRF4 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 4, also known as MUM1/LSIRF/NF-EM5) is a lymphoid-restricted
  member of the IRF transcription factor family. Unlike most IRFs, IRF4 is not induced by interferons
  but is instead activated by antigen receptor signaling (TCR/BCR), IL-4, CD40, and LPS. IRF4 contains
  an N-terminal tryptophan-rich DNA-binding domain (DBD) recognizing ISRE-like GAAA motifs and a
  C-terminal IRF-associated domain (IAD) mediating homo/heterodimerization with partner transcription
  factors. IRF4 has intrinsically weak solo DNA-binding activity and acquires specificity through
  composite elements with partners such as PU.1/SPI-B at EICE motifs in B cells, and BATF/JUN at
  AICE motifs in T cells. IRF4 is essential for plasma cell differentiation, germinal center B cell
  fate decisions, and the differentiation of multiple T helper lineages (Th2, Th9, Th17) as well as
  effector CD8+ T cells. It also regulates dendritic cell and macrophage programs. IRF4 functions
  predominantly in the nucleus as a transcriptional activator. Dysregulation of IRF4 is implicated in
  multiple myeloma (where it is a lineage-survival oncogene), large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4
  rearrangement, and combined immunodeficiency (IMD131). Genetic variants in IRF4 also influence
  human pigmentation through regulation of the TYR promoter in cooperation with MITF.

      IRF4 is a lymphoid-restricted transcription factor that plays critical roles across multiple
      arms of the immune system, including B cell differentiation to plasma cells, T helper cell

      IMP annotation based on Thouenon et al. (2023) J Exp Med, characterizing the IRF4 F359L

        The mutant IRF4 failed to efficiently regulate the transcriptional activity of
        interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs). Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry
        of endogenous proteins indicated that the mutant and wildtype IRF4 proteins differed with
        regard to their respective sets of binding partners.

      IMP annotation for nuclear localization from the Thouenon et al. (2023) study. The F359L

      localizes to the nucleus.

      IMP annotation from Guerin et al. (2018) eLife, characterizing the IRF4 R98W variant in

      The loss-of-function analysis of the R98W disease variant provides direct evidence that

  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:12374808
  review:
    summary: >-
      NAS annotation for regulation of T-helper cell differentiation based on Hu et al. (2002).
      The paper discusses how IRF4 controls T cell cytokine production, which is closely linked
      to Th cell differentiation programs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      IRF4 is genuinely critical for T-helper cell differentiation, including Th2, Th9, and Th17
      lineages. While the evidence code is NAS (non-traceable author statement), this function
      is extremely well-established in subsequent literature. IRF4 is a master regulator of
      multiple Th cell differentiation programs.

      supporting_text: >-
        These studies thus support the notion that IRF-4 represents one of the lymphoid-specific
        components that control the ability of T lymphocytes to produce a distinctive array of
        cytokines.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation from Hu et al. (2002) showing IRF4 positively regulates DNA-templated
      transcription. Demonstrated by transactivation of IL-2 and IL-4 promoter-reporter constructs
      and enhancement of endogenous cytokine gene expression.
    action: ACCEPT

      Direct experimental evidence supporting IRF4 as a positive regulator of transcription.
      This is a core biological process annotation complementing the MF transcription activator
      annotations.

    label: positive regulation of plasma cell differentiation
  evidence_type: NAS
  original_reference_id: PMID:29537367
  review:
    summary: >-
      IRF4 is essential for plasma cell differentiation. Loss-of-function variants in IRF4 cause
      combined immunodeficiency (IMD131) characterized by low immunoglobulin levels and low plasma
      cell counts (PMID:29537367, PMID:36662884, PMID:36917008). IRF4 cooperates with BLIMP1/XBP1
      to drive the plasma cell differentiation program. In multiple myeloma, IRF4 is a lineage
      addiction factor for malignant plasma cells.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This is a major gap in the current annotation set. Plasma cell differentiation is one of
      the best-established and most important biological functions of IRF4, yet it is not
      annotated. Human genetic evidence from IMD131 patients directly demonstrates IRF4's
      requirement for plasma cell differentiation. The Reactome and UniProt entries both reference
      IRF4's role in B cell/plasma cell biology.

      Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4 is a lymphoid-restricted member of the interferon

      IRF4T95R behaved as a gain-of-function hypermorph by binding to DNA with higher affinity

  - statement: Decreased activation from canonical ISRE reporter
    supporting_text: >-
      Simultaneously, IRF4T95R functions as a neomorph by binding to noncanonical DNA sites to

    label: DNA-binding transcription activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific
  description: >-
    IRF4 functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcriptional activator. It binds ISRE
    (interferon-stimulated response element) motifs and composite elements (EICE with PU.1/SPI-B,
    AICE with BATF/JUN) to activate transcription of target genes. The N-terminal tryptophan
    pentad repeat domain (aa 21-129) mediates DNA binding, while the C-terminal IRF-associated
    domain (IAD) mediates heterodimerization with partner TFs. IRF4 has intrinsically weak solo
    DNA-binding activity and acquires target gene specificity through its partner TFs.
