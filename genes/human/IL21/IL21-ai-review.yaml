description: >-
  Interleukin-21 (IL21) is a secreted cytokine with immunoregulatory activity that
  belongs
  to the IL-15/IL-21 family. IL21 promotes the transition between innate and adaptive
  immunity
  and is critical for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell generation and maintenance, germinal
  center
  formation, and B cell differentiation. It induces immunoglobulin production (IgG1,
  IgG3) in
  B cells, regulates proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cells in
  synergy with
  IL15, and stimulates interferon-gamma production in T cells and NK cells. IL21 signals
  through
  a receptor complex containing IL21R and the common gamma chain (IL2RG), activating
  the JAK-STAT
  pathway (primarily JAK1/JAK3 and STAT1/STAT3/STAT5). Expressed primarily by activated
  CD4+
  T cells. Mutations cause common variable immunodeficiency 11 (CVID11).

        IL21 binds the common gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared with IL-2 receptor.
        PMID:12504082 shows IL21 and IL4 bind overlapping epitopes on gamma chain.
        This is mechanistically correct but could be misleading - IL21 does not bind
        the complete IL-2 receptor, only the shared gamma chain component.
