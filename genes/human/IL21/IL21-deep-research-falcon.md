## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9HBE4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-21 {ECO:0000305}; Short=IL-21; AltName: Full=Za11; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL21 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:6005};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IL-15/IL-21 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 4_helix_cytokine-like_core. (IPR009079); IL-15/IL-21_fam. (IPR003443); IL15 (PF02372)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL21" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL21' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL21** (gene ID: IL21, UniProt: Q9HBE4) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target verification: The UniProt entry Q9HBE4 corresponds to human interleukin-21 (IL-21), encoded by the human IL21 gene, a secreted type I cytokine in the common gamma chain (γc) cytokine family with a four-helix bundle fold; it signals through IL-21R paired with the common γ chain (IL2RG). This matches the provided identity, organism (Homo sapiens), and family/domain context. (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, koh2024il17andil21 pages 2-4, zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and family: IL-21 is a pleiotropic type I cytokine of the common γc cytokine family (with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, IL-21) characterized structurally by a four-helix bundle fold. It is produced predominantly by CD4+ T-cell subsets, notably follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and Th17 cells, and also by NKT cells; CD8+ T cells can produce IL-21 in some contexts. (Spolski & Leonard 2014, Nat Rev Drug Discov; Koh et al. 2024, Immune Network; Isvoranu & Chiritoiu-Butnaru 2024, Front Immunol). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296 (2014-04); https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, koh2024il17andil21 pages 2-4, isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)
- Receptor and signaling: IL-21 signals via a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-21R and the common γ chain (CD132), activating JAK1/JAK3 to predominantly induce STAT3 and STAT1 phosphorylation (with weaker STAT5), and also engages MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Negative feedback via SOCS1/3 and transcriptional programs requiring IRF4, BATF–JUN, and STAT3 are prominent. (Koh 2024; Spolski & Leonard 2014; Zeng et al. 2007, Blood). URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01); https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296 (2014-04); https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-10-054973 (2007-05). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 6-7, spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)
- Cellular localization: IL-21 is secreted and acts in a paracrine/autocrine manner on lymphoid and myeloid cells expressing IL-21R. (Spolski & Leonard 2014; Koh 2024). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2. (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, koh2024il17andil21 pages 2-4)

2) Mechanistic functions and pathways (cell-type specific)
- B cells: IL-21 is pivotal for germinal center (GC) responses. It promotes isotype class switching (notably IgG subclasses), plasma cell differentiation, and long-lived antibody responses via STAT3- and IRF4-dependent induction of BLIMP-1/PRDM1; IL-21R deficiency impairs expansion of antigen-specific memory B cells and plasma cells and skews Ig isotypes (e.g., reduced IgG with elevated IgE in IL-4–rich contexts). IL-21 can also induce B-cell apoptosis depending on context. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 7-9, spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2)
- CD4+ T cells and T helper programming: IL-21 serves as an autocrine factor for Th17 differentiation (with TGF-β), supports Tfh lineage programs, and can promote Th1 features in human cells under some conditions (e.g., increased STAT4/T-bet and IFN-γ in Crohn’s lamina propria). It modulates Treg/tr1 biology: Il21 deficiency can increase Treg numbers, whereas IL-21 can also promote IL-10–producing Tr1 cells depending on milieu. URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 6-7, koh2024il17andil21 pages 7-9)
- CD8+ T cells: IL-21 synergizes with IL-7/IL-15 (and IL-2) to drive CD8+ proliferation, cytotoxic differentiation, IFN-γ production, and memory-like persistence, enhancing antitumor responses. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-10-054973. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 7-9, zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)
- NK cells: IL-21 activates human NK cells, boosting cytotoxicity (including synergy with IL-15/IL-18) and reinvigorating exhausted NK cells in tumors, although context-dependent inhibitory effects are reported. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 7-9, koh2024il17andil21 pages 19-20)
- Dendritic cells and myeloid cells: IL-21 can negatively regulate conventional dendritic cell (cDC) maturation and induce apoptosis via STAT3/BIM; it modulates monocyte/macrophage functions. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 7-9, spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2)
- Intracellular signaling detail: Mutation analyses of IL-21R cytoplasmic tyrosines show Y510 is sufficient for STAT1/3 activation and full proliferative signaling; MAPK and PI3K contribute to IL-21–mediated proliferation and are pharmacologically inhibitable. URL: https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-10-054973. (zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)

3) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Updated immunobiology reviews: 2024 reviews synthesize IL-21’s dual (“double-edged”) roles, integrating STAT3 vs STAT1 balance, IRF4/BATF cooperation, and cell-type–specific outcomes across B cells, Tfh/Th17, CD8, NK, and DCs, with translational implications. URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 19-20, koh2024il17andil21 pages 6-7)
- Cancer immunotherapy positioning: 2024 review highlights IL-21 as an immunostimulatory cytokine with promising antitumor activity alone or in rational combinations (mAbs, checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic virotherapy, adoptive cell therapies), with generally manageable toxicity in early trials. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)
- Mechanistic oncology updates: IL-21 can reshape tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (e.g., expansion of favorable CD8+ subsets) and act via NK-mediated mechanisms, underscoring context-dependent pro- versus antitumor effects. URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 22-23)

4) Disease associations and mechanisms (selected, with recent sources)
- Autoimmunity and inflammation: Elevated IL-21 or IL-21R signaling is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s), SLE (autoreactive CD11chi T-bet+ B cells), and psoriasis; neutralization or pathway modulation affects Th1/Th17 polarization and inflammatory mediators in human tissues and models. URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 22-23)
- Infection and mucosal immunity: IL-21 participates in mucosal Th1 responses (e.g., coeliac disease, IBD) and antiviral antibody responses in infection and vaccination contexts, supporting Tfh and GC reactions. URL: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 19-20, koh2024il17andil21 pages 22-23)
- Oncology: IL-21 supports antitumor CD8 and NK activity, can induce apoptosis and enhance ADCC in B-cell malignancies (e.g., CLL), but may have protumor roles depending on microenvironmental STAT utilization and cellular targets. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2 (2024-01); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (koh2024il17andil21 pages 22-23, isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)

5) Current applications and implementations
- Recombinant IL-21 in oncology: Early clinical studies have evaluated recombinant IL-21 as monotherapy or in combination with antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors, with reported antitumor activity and generally tolerable safety in phase I/II settings, per 2024 review synthesis. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)
- Pathway antagonism in autoimmunity: Development of therapeutic antagonists targeting IL-21 or IL-21R has been pursued for RA, SLE, and Crohn’s disease; earlier clinical evaluations are summarized in foundational reviews. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296 (2014-04). (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2)
- JAK pathway inhibition: Because IL-21 signals through JAK1/JAK3→STAT3/STAT1, approved JAK inhibitors can modulate IL-21–driven biology indirectly; this is mechanistically grounded in the canonical pathway description. URLs: https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-10-054973. (koh2024il17andil21 pages 6-7, zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)
- Cellular therapies and combinations: Reviews highlight IL-21’s integration into adoptive cell strategies (e.g., for supporting CD8/NK function) and in combination regimens including oncolytic virotherapy; these are active translational areas with ongoing early-phase testing. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)

6) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Consensus across high-quality reviews emphasizes IL-21 as a central Tfh- and Th17-derived cytokine orchestrating humoral immunity and cytotoxic effector programming, with outcomes determined by cellular context and STAT3/STAT1 balance. Therapeutically, IL-21 can be leveraged to boost antitumor immunity, while antagonism may be beneficial in autoimmunity. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743. (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, koh2024il17andil21 pages 19-20, isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)

7) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Specific recent (2023–2024) trial effect sizes and patient-level statistics could not be extracted from the accessible source excerpts. However, early oncology trials summarized in 2024 review literature report antitumor activity with generally minimal or manageable adverse events for recombinant IL-21 alone or in combinations. Additional quantitative details would require direct access to individual trial reports. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743 (2024-04). (isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2)

8) Summary functional annotation (precise role and localization)
- Molecule type: Secreted cytokine (four-helix bundle) of the γc family. Receptor: IL-21R/γc heterodimer. Primary signaling: JAK1/JAK3→STAT3>STAT1 (±STAT5), with MAPK and PI3K/AKT contributions; SOCS1/3 negative feedback; IRF4, BATF–JUN, and STAT3 transcriptional modules. Producers: Tfh, Th17, NKT (and contextually CD8+ T cells). Targets: B, T, NK, DCs, and other hematopoietic cells expressing IL-21R. Cellular location of action: Extracellular (secreted), acting on immune cell surfaces bearing IL-21R. Primary functions: Orchestrates GC B-cell help (class switching, plasma-cell differentiation), sustains and programs CD8 and NK cytotoxicity, shapes Th subset balance, and modulates DC maturation. Pathway role: Central node in adaptive immunity with context-dependent roles in infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd4296; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2024.24.e2; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1369743; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2006-10-054973. (spolski2014interleukin21adoubleedged pages 1-2, koh2024il17andil21 pages 6-7, isvoranu2024therapeuticpotentialof pages 1-2, zeng2007themolecularbasis pages 1-3)

Notes on evidence scope and limitations
- Where 2023–2024 primary studies (e.g., checkpoint inhibitor thyroiditis, single-cell plasma-cell dynamics, engineered IL-21 therapeutics) are highly relevant, detailed quantitative outcomes were not retrievable from the excerpts available to this analysis. The mechanistic and translational summaries here are therefore grounded primarily in a 2024 immunobiology review and a 2024 oncology-focused review, complemented by a seminal mechanistic study and a comprehensive 2014 review. Further specificity (trial IDs, dosing, response rates) would require direct citation of the individual primary trials or more detailed review sections.
