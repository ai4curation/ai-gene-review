## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene SCGB1C2 (P0DMR2) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

**Gene and Family Overview:** SCGB1C2 (also known as secretoglobin family 1C member 1-like) is a human gene encoding a small secreted protein in the secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=,3)). This gene is located on chromosome 17 and is a paralog of SCGB1C1 ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=SCGB1C2%20,of%20this%20gene%20is%20SCGB1C1)). Secretoglobins are a family of mammalian secretory proteins (~10 kDa) that typically form dimers and were historically called the uteroglobin family ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20secretoglobins%20,discovered%20suggests%20that%20this%20family)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGBs%20are%20small%20%28,covalent%20interactions%20%5B%2018)). SCGB1C2 is a protein-coding gene (UniProt P0DMR2) and current genomic resources (updated 2025) predict its product is localized to the extracellular region ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=SCGB1C2%20Gene%20,1C%20Member%202)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=NCBI%20Gene%20Summary%20for%20SCGB1C2,Gene)). Like other secretoglobins, SCGB1C2 contains a signal peptide for secretion and is expected to function outside the cell. Importantly, secretoglobins share a characteristic **four-α-helix bundle** structure in each monomer, assembling into homo- or heterodimers via conserved disulfide bonds ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGBs%20are%20small%20%28,covalent%20interactions%20%5B%2018)). This dimerization creates an internal hydrophobic cavity analogous to a globin fold, which can bind small lipophilic ligands ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=second%20reason%20was%20proposed%20for,3)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)). 

**Structural Features and Ligand Binding:** By homology, the SCGB1C2 protein is comprised of about 90–100 amino acids including the signal sequence (the mature secreted form is roughly 10 kDa) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2/structure%2Binteraction#:~:text=,PUBLICATIONS)). Secretoglobin family members are known to be exceptionally stable dimers, resistant to proteases and extremes of pH ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGBs%20are%20small%20%28,covalent%20interactions%20%5B%2018)). Crystallographic studies on related secretoglobins (e.g. uteroglobin SCGB1A1) show two monomers arranged anti-parallel, enclosing a hydrophobic pocket ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=structures%20of%20several%20SCGBs%20have,covalent%20interactions%20%5B%2018)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)). This pocket is the key to function: for example, **SCGB1A1 (Clara cell 10 kDa protein)** binds a variety of hydrophobic molecules including steroid hormones, retinoids, certain polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites, and eicosanoid inflammatory mediators ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)). Such binding capacity underlies the modulation of local ligand availability. Another family member, **SCGB1C1**, is highly similar to SCGB1C2 and has been identified in olfactory mucosa, where it localizes to Bowman’s glands and is thought to act as an odorant-binding protein ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). SCGB1C1 (originally termed “ligand-binding protein RYD5”) binds small hydrophobic odorant molecules in the nasal mucus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). By analogy, **SCGB1C2 likely shares this ligand-binding function**, though its specific binding partners are not yet confirmed. The InterPro database classifies SCGB1C2 in the secretoglobin_1C-like family, reflecting a conserved fold and ligand-binding domain ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=Domains%20%26%20Families%20for%20SCGB1C2,like%20%2A%20Secretoglobin_sf%20%23%23%23%20Graphical)). In summary, the primary molecular function of SCGB1C2 is inferred to be **binding and transport of small hydrophobic compounds** in the extracellular milieu, similar to other secretoglobins ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)). This could include lipophilic signaling molecules or chemical messengers, consistent with the family’s role as “secreted ligand carriers.” Notably, secretoglobins have been described as **multi-functional, cytokine-like modulators**; for instance, SCGB1A1 has a peptide segment (“antiflammin”) that can inhibit phospholipase A2 and reduce inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9271138/#:~:text=Leucine,that%20SCGB3A2%20belongs%20to%20the)). While SCGB1C2 has not been fully biochemically characterized, its high sequence homology to SCGB1C1 suggests a comparable folded structure and capacity to bind ligands, potentially contributing to local chemical signaling or immune modulation.

**Expression Profile and Localization:** Experimental expression data indicate that SCGB1C2 is produced in specific tissues, aligning with a localized function. According to the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, v23, 2023), **SCGB1C2 mRNA is most enriched in the pancreas, retina, and testis** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Muller%20glia%20cells%2C%20Late)). In normal tissue panels, SCGB1C2 shows **“tissue-enhanced”** expression in the exocrine pancreas ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Cilium%20%28mainly)). Notably, single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal **group-enriched expression** in certain retinal cell types (Müller glial cells and photoreceptor cells) and in male germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Muller%20glia%20cells%2C%20Late)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20specificity,Hemostasis%20%28mainly)). This suggests SCGB1C2 may have specialized roles in ocular and reproductive physiology. By contrast, SCGB1C2 transcripts are **undetectable in adult brain tissue** and most other organs, indicating a rather restricted expression pattern ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Tissue%20specificity,no%20cluster%20assigned)). Such specificity is common for secretoglobins, which are often prominent in glandular or mucosal tissues. For example, many SCGB genes are highly expressed in secretory epithelia of the lung, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, uterus, and prostate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=bloom%27%20and%20make%20up%20a,SCGBs%20in%20recent%20years%2C%20clearly)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=Secretoglobins%20are%20found%20at%20high,Some%20SCGB%20family%20members)). Consistent with its classification, SCGB1C2 is a **secreted protein**: it contains a signal peptide and is exported out of the cell. It has been **experimentally detected at the protein level** (e.g. by mass-spectrometry or antibody-based assays), confirming that the predicted polypeptide is indeed expressed in human tissues ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Gene%20name,i%7D%20Secreted)). Once synthesized and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum, SCGB1C2 is secreted into the extracellular space – likely into local glandular fluids or tissue interstitium – rather than being a membrane-bound or intracellular protein ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,no%20cluster%20assigned)). The Alliance of Genome Resources (2025) likewise annotates SCGB1C2 as an extracellular protein, indicating consensus that it functions outside the cell ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=NCBI%20Gene%20Summary%20for%20SCGB1C2,Gene)). Importantly, **SCGB1C2 appears to act locally (“locally secreted”)** rather than as a widely circulating hormone ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Locally%20secreted%20TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION)). This means its effect is probably confined to the vicinity of the cells that produce it, such as the lumen of exocrine glands or the extracellular environment of retina and seminiferous tubules. In the **retina**, Müller glia and photoreceptors secreting SCGB1C2 could influence the retinal extracellular milieu – perhaps by binding retinoids or mitigating oxidative lipids – although direct evidence is lacking. In the **testis**, late spermatogenic cells expressing SCGB1C2 might release it into seminiferous tubule fluid, suggesting a role in the reproductive microenvironment (for example, binding and sequestering lipophilic factors or pheromone-like compounds). In the **pancreas**, SCGB1C2 is likely produced by acinar cells (which share features with other secretory epithelia) and secreted into pancreatic fluids or the extracellular space of the gland. While the precise sites of action remain to be pinpointed, the consistent theme is that SCGB1C2 operates in secretory fluids at tissue interfaces, aligning with a role in local chemical transport or defense.

**Biological Function and Pathways:** The exact **biological role of SCGB1C2** is still under investigation, as there have been no dedicated functional studies on this protein to date. However, **inference from closely related proteins and general secretoglobin biology provides valuable clues**. Secretoglobins are often involved in **modulating inflammation, immune responses, and tissue homeostasis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=including%20fluids%20of%20the%20lung%2C,Such%20information%20is%20predicted%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=The%20pathophysiological%20functions%20of%20SCGBs,However%2C%20as%20to%20other)). A comprehensive review of the human SCGB gene superfamily (Jackson et al., 2011) emphasized that most secretoglobins have **poorly defined functions** but collectively appear to play important roles in **inflammation control, tissue repair, and tumorigenesis** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=including%20fluids%20of%20the%20lung%2C,Such%20information%20is%20predicted%20to)). In particular, several secretoglobins act as **immunomodulators** or **anti-inflammatory agents** in their tissue contexts. For example, **SCGB1A1 (uteroglobin/CC10)** is a well-studied secretoglobin from airway Club cells that has *anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects* in the lung. It can bind pro-inflammatory mediators (like leukotrienes and phospholipids) and thereby reduce inflammatory signaling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9271138/#:~:text=cells%20that%20was%20the%20first,of%20actions%20and%20signaling%20pathway)). Mice lacking SCGB1A1 show heightened lung inflammation, underscoring its protective role. Likewise, **SCGB3A2 (UGRP1)** in the lung has been shown to **suppress allergic inflammation** and promote tissue repair; it acts as both an anti-inflammatory cytokine and a growth factor in pulmonary disease models ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9271138/#:~:text=cells%20that%20was%20the%20first,of%20actions%20and%20signaling%20pathway)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=The%20expression%20of%20SCGBs%20except,postoperative%20endoscopy%20and%20symptom%20scores)). These examples illustrate how secretoglobins can influence signaling pathways: not by classical enzyme catalysis or receptor activity, but by **binding ligands or interacting with cells in a cytokine-like manner**. 

Given this context, it is plausible that **SCGB1C2’s primary function is to bind and sequester specific small molecules**, thus regulating their availability and activity. The nature of such ligands for SCGB1C2 is not yet known. However, considering its expression sites, candidates could include *retinoids or other lipid mediators in the retina*, *endogenous steroids or vitamins in the testis*, or *local inflammatory lipid mediators in glandular secretions*. For instance, retinal Müller glia support neurons partly by controlling the extracellular chemical environment; SCGB1C2 could contribute by binding excess hydrophobic molecules or oxidative byproducts. In the olfactory system, the paralog SCGB1C1 is thought to ferry odorant molecules through mucus to odorant receptors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). By analogy, SCGB1C2 might ferry or neutralize bioactive compounds in the eye or reproductive tract, although **direct experimental evidence is lacking**. It is important to note that secretoglobins can also act as **carrier proteins for pheromones or signaling lipids**: in rodents, a large expansion of secretoglobin-like genes encodes **androgen-binding proteins (ABPs)** that carry pheromonal cues in saliva ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=fully%20characterised%2C%20what%20already%20has,identify%20tissue%20damage%20or%20cancer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=tumorigenesis,Such%20information%20is%20predicted%20to)). Humans have only a few counterparts of these ABPs. While SCGB1C2 is not formally classified as an ABP, its presence in testis could hint at a role in reproductive signaling or immune privilege. The testis is an immune-privileged site where controlling inflammation is crucial for sperm development; a secreted protein that binds inflammatory lipids or cytokines could be beneficial. Thus, **one hypothesis** is that SCGB1C2 contributes to maintaining an optimal extracellular environment in the testis and retina by binding potentially harmful or signaling molecules – a role analogous to known secretoglobins in other tissues.

In terms of **pathway integration**, SCGB1C2 is not known to be part of any canonical signaling pathway or metabolic chain (for example, it is **not an enzyme in metabolism** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2/structure%2Binteraction#:~:text=,PUBLICATIONS))). Instead, its action is likely **indirect**: by binding ligands, it can modulate pathways such as **olfactory signal transduction, retinoid recycling, or inflammatory signaling** *without being an enzyme or receptor itself*. For instance, if SCGB1C2 binds a pro-inflammatory eicosanoid, it could dampen the activation of that eicosanoid’s receptor, effectively tweaking the **immune signaling pathway** in that locale. This mode of action is comparable to SCGB1A1, which by binding *leukotriene D4* can inhibit leukotriene signaling and downstream inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20uteroglobin%20,in%20each)). Similarly, SCGB1C1 in olfactory mucus may present odorants to olfactory receptors, influencing the **sensory transduction pathway** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). For SCGB1C2, one might speculate involvement in the **visual cycle** or **reproductive signaling**, but no studies have confirmed such roles. It has not been shown to have receptor agonist or antagonist activity on its own; rather, any signaling impact would come from altering ligand distribution. There is also no evidence so far that SCGB1C2 forms heterodimers with other secretoglobins (as some family members do, e.g. mammaglobin A/SCGB2A2 dimerizes with lipophilin B/SCGB1D2 in breast tissue ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=1,doi)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=,doi))). SCGB1C2 likely homodimerizes with itself given its unique expression profile separate from SCGB1C1. 

**Current Research and Clinical Insights:** As of now, **SCGB1C2 remains one of the less-characterized secretoglobins**. A decade ago, only nine human SCGB genes had been functionally described ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=%5B1%20,as%20in%20the%20mammary%20gland)), but genomic analyses later brought that number to eleven, including SCGB1C2 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20secretoglobins%20,discovered%20suggests%20that%20this%20family)). The discovery of SCGB1C2 as a distinct gene (originally annotated as “SCGB1C1-like”) came through genome sequencing efforts rather than through targeted biochemical studies. The absence of a **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot functional summary** for SCGB1C2 (as of 2025) underscores the gap in experimental data ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=No%20data%20available%20for%20CIViC,piRNA%20Summary%20for%20SCGB1C2%20Gene)). However, large-scale omics projects have started to shed light on its expression. The Human Protein Atlas (updated 2022–2023) identified SCGB1C2 RNA in specific cell types, which is a crucial first step in pinpointing where the protein might act ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Extracellular%20location,Muller%20glia%20cells%2C%20Late)). To date, **no disease-causing mutations or major polymorphisms** in SCGB1C2 have been reported in the literature. SCGB1C2 is not a prominent hit in genome-wide association studies, though one database (MalaCards) notes a tentative link to “inflammatory spondylopathy” ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=SCGB1C2%20,of%20this%20gene%20is%20SCGB1C1)). This association likely comes from high-throughput data and is not yet backed by mechanistic studies. In contrast, other secretoglobins have clearer clinical connections: for example, **SCGB2A2 (Mammaglobin-A)** is overexpressed in breast cancer and used as a tumor marker ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=1,doi)), and **SCGB1A1** levels in serum or sputum can serve as a biomarker for lung injury and inflammation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=and%20SCGB3A2%20%28UGRP1%29%20%5B3%20,diseases%20has%20been%20rarely%20studied)). No such clinical biomarker role has been established for SCGB1C2. Its restricted expression in pancreas, retina, and testis means any systemic effects would be limited. It’s worth noting that secretoglobins can sometimes be ectopically expressed in cancers – for instance, mammaglobins in gynecologic tumors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=1,doi)) – so researchers have examined SCGB gene expression across cancers. A broad tumor profiling study (Zafrakas et al. 2006) looked at mammaglobin and lipophilin family members in many tumors ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=1,doi)), but SCGB1C2 was not highlighted, implying it was either not expressed or not tested in those contexts. In the **pancreas**, SCGB1C2’s presence raises the question of whether it plays a role in pancreatic diseases; however, common pancreatic conditions (like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer) have not yet been linked to this gene in literature. 

**Expert Perspectives:** Experts in the field have pointed out that **further research is needed to elucidate SCGB1C2’s function**. The secretoglobin family as a whole has drawn interest for its **evolutionary diversification and unique roles in chemical communication and immunity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=fully%20characterised%2C%20what%20already%20has,identify%20tissue%20damage%20or%20cancer)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=Secretoglobins%20are%20found%20at%20high,Some%20SCGB%20family%20members)). In a 2011 family-wide analysis, Jackson *et al.* noted that mouse secretoglobins underwent an “evolutionary bloom” (with >60 related genes, many for pheromone binding), whereas humans have a much smaller repertoire ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20secretoglobins%20,discovered%20suggests%20that%20this%20family)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=tumorigenesis,identify%20tissue%20damage%20or%20cancer)). The human SCGB1C subfamily (to which SCGB1C2 belongs) is thought to correspond to some of these chemical communication functions. Shioko Kimura, a leading researcher on secretoglobins, has described SCGB proteins like SCGB1A1 as **“multi-functional cytokine-like molecules”** that partake in intercellular signaling despite not being classical cytokines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9271138/#:~:text=Secretoglobin%20,This%20review%20summarizes)). This view encourages investigating SCGB1C2 for any paracrine effects it might have on neighboring cells (for example, modulating immune cells in tissues). So far, **no direct protein–protein interactions involving SCGB1C2** have been reported (as per databases, it has zero known protein interaction partners ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Protein%20evidence%20Evidence%20at%20protein,i%7D%20Locally%20secreted)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2#:~:text=Protein%20interactions%20No%20protein%20interactions,i%7D%20Secreted))). This is expected for a secreted carrier protein, which would primarily interact with small molecules rather than large protein complexes. The lack of known interactions also suggests SCGB1C2 might exert its influence by **chemical sequestration** rather than by binding to a receptor or signaling complex. In line with this, **no specific signaling pathway “node” is attributed to SCGB1C2** in Reactome or KEGG pathway databases (it is absent from metabolic pathway charts, consistent with a binding protein role ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000268320-SCGB1C2/structure%2Binteraction#:~:text=,PUBLICATIONS))). 

In summary, **SCGB1C2 is presumed to function as a secreted ligand-binding protein that contributes to local tissue homeostasis**. Its protein product is **secreted to the extracellular space**, where it likely binds small hydrophobic substrates – by analogy, possibly odorants, lipids, or steroids – although the exact substrate specificity remains unknown. Through this ligand-binding activity, SCGB1C2 may **regulate biochemical pathways indirectly**: for example, buffering inflammatory mediators or facilitating the transport of chemical signals to receptors. It carries out its function in **specific sites** such as pancreatic secretions, the retinal interphotoreceptor matrix, or the seminiferous tubule fluid of the testes. These locations suggest roles in the **ciliary/ocular environment and reproductive system**, potentially guarding tissue integrity or influencing cell-cell signaling in those contexts. While broad pleiotropic effects have not been documented for SCGB1C2, understanding its precise role will likely require targeted studies (e.g. ligand binding assays or knockout models). The **current understanding (as of 2023)** is thus largely inferential: SCGB1C2 is part of a family known for **dimeric secreted proteins that modulate inflammation and bind hydrophobic ligands**, so it is expected to perform a similar biochemical role within the particular tissues where it is expressed ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=including%20fluids%20of%20the%20lung%2C,Such%20information%20is%20predicted%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=SCGB1C1%20has%20been%20shown%20to,25)). As one review succinctly stated, *“the biological activities of most individual SCGBs have not been fully characterized”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3251818/#:~:text=The%20secretoglobins%20,discovered%20suggests%20that%20this%20family)) – a statement that certainly applies to SCGB1C2. Going forward, **primary research – such as biochemical ligand screens or tissue-specific knockout studies – will be needed** to definitively identify SCGB1C2’s substrates and physiological function. Such studies could elucidate whether SCGB1C2 has a niche role (for example, an odorant or retinoid-binding protein in a specialized compartment) or a broader immunomodulatory function akin to its secretoglobin relatives. Until then, SCGB1C2 remains an intriguing but **under-characterized member of the secretoglobin family**, known to be **secreted and likely ligand-binding**, with a presumed role in maintaining chemical balance in select human tissues ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=SCGB1C2#:~:text=NCBI%20Gene%20Summary%20for%20SCGB1C2,Gene)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3063214/#:~:text=The%20pathophysiological%20functions%20of%20SCGBs,However%2C%20as%20to%20other)).
