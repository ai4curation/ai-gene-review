description: Secretoglobin family 1C member 2, a small secreted protein (~10 kDa,
  95 AA) that forms homodimers with a four-helix bundle structure creating a hydrophobic
  pocket for binding small lipophilic ligands. Member of the secretoglobin (uteroglobin)
  superfamily of secretory proteins involved in immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory
  responses, and ligand transport. Expression is tissue-enhanced in pancreas, retina
  (Müller glia and photoreceptors), and testis (spermatocytes/spermatids), suggesting
  specialized roles in these organs. Like other secretoglobins, SCGB1C2 likely binds
  and sequesters hydrophobic molecules (steroids, retinoids, lipid mediators) to regulate
  their local availability and modulate inflammation or signaling. The protein is
  secreted into extracellular fluids where it functions as a ligand carrier/buffer.
  Specific binding partners and detailed biochemical function remain to be determined
  experimentally.

  review:
    summary: High-throughput interactome study. Generic protein binding.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Non-informative generic term. SCGB1C2 primarily binds small molecules,
      not proteins.
