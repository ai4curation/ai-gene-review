  review:
    summary: |
      The 1993 Postel et al. paper (PMID:8392752) identified NME2 as the c-myc purine-binding transcription factor PuF. However, subsequent studies, particularly the definitive 2009 Dexheimer et al. study (PMID:19435876), clarified that NME2 does NOT function as a classical DNA-binding transcription factor. GO:0001216 requires "selective and non-covalent binding to a specific double-stranded genomic DNA sequence." NME2 binds to single-stranded DNA and G-quadruplex structures, not double-stranded DNA motifs. PMID:19435876 explicitly states NME2 "does not bind to or cleave the NHE III(1) in duplex form" and concludes that "NM23-H2 may play an indirect role in transcriptional activation." NME2 lacks any known DNA-binding domains characteristic of transcription factors (HOX, GATA, zinc-finger, etc.). Its transcriptional effects appear mediated through binding to non-canonical G-quadruplex DNA structures that then allow other single-stranded transcription factors to bind.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: |
      NME2 does not meet the criteria for GO:0001216 (DNA-binding transcription activator activity), which requires binding to double-stranded genomic DNA sequence motifs. NME2 is an enzyme (nucleoside diphosphate kinase) that has a moonlighting function in binding G-quadruplex and single-stranded DNA, but this does not constitute classical transcription factor activity. The GO usage guidelines for GO:0003700 explicitly state that proteins with enzymatic activity and no known DNA-binding domain should be annotated to transcription coregulator activity if appropriate. The mechanism described in the literature involves NME2 binding to G-quadruplex structures to destabilize them and allow other transcription factors to bind, which is an indirect role.

  review:
    summary: |
      Well-supported annotation. PMID:19033359 demonstrates that NME2 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures within the nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) III(1) region of the c-MYC promoter. This was shown by gel shift assays, surface plasmon resonance, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The G4 binding is independent of the kinase activity and represents a key moonlighting function of NME2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      Direct experimental evidence from multiple assays demonstrates NME2 binds G-quadruplex DNA structures. This is a well-characterized moonlighting function separate from its primary kinase activity.

The study includes crystal structures of NME2 bound to DNA, demonstrating the molecular basis for G4 DNA binding. Importantly, this study clarifies that NME2 does NOT bind duplex DNA, only single-stranded and G-quadruplex forms.

  review:
    summary: |
      Supported annotation for the biological process, though the mechanism is indirect. PMID:19033359 demonstrates that NME2 binding to the G-quadruplex in the c-MYC promoter leads to c-MYC transcriptional activation. This was shown using luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming in vivo association with the c-MYC NHE region.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      The biological process annotation (positive regulation of transcription) is appropriate as NME2 does promote c-MYC transcription. The mechanism involves G-quadruplex binding and resolution, which allows other transcription factors to access the promoter. This is a valid involvement_in relationship for a BP term.

      Supported annotation for the biological process. PMID:19435876 confirms NME2's role in c-MYC transcriptional activation through RNA interference experiments. Knockdown of NME2 reduced c-MYC expression, confirming its regulatory role. The mechanism involves indirect effects through G-quadruplex binding rather than direct transcription factor activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      The biological process annotation is appropriate. RNAi experiments confirmed NME2 is required for normal c-MYC transcription levels. While the molecular mechanism is indirect (via G-quadruplex binding), the involvement in the biological process of transcription regulation is well-supported.

    summary: |
      Important negative annotation. Earlier studies (PMID:11121025) claimed NME2 had nuclease activity that cleaved DNA within the c-MYC NHE region. However, PMID:19435876 definitively refuted this, showing that further purification of NME2 eliminated the nuclease activity while retaining DNA binding. This indicates the nuclease activity was due to contaminating proteins, not intrinsic to NME2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      Critical negative result that corrects the literature. The NOT annotation prevents over-annotation of NME2 with enzymatic activities it does not possess. The authors showed the nuclease activity was artifactual.

    summary: |
      The biological process annotation is acceptable, though the original 1993 paper overinterpreted the mechanism. PMID:8392752 showed that NME2 (identified as PuF) could activate c-myc transcription in vitro. Later studies (PMID:19435876, PMID:19033359) clarified that this activation is indirect, occurring through G-quadruplex binding rather than classical transcription factor activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      The BP annotation for positive regulation of transcription is valid - NME2 does promote c-MYC transcription. However, the molecular mechanism is indirect (via G-quadruplex destabilization) rather than through direct DNA-binding transcription factor activity. The BP annotation correctly captures the involvement in the process without claiming a specific molecular mechanism.
