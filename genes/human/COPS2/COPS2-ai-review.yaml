description: >-
  COPS2 (COP9 signalosome complex subunit 2, also known as TRIP15/Alien) is a core
  PCI-domain scaffold subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), an eight-subunit protein
  complex essential for regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. COPS2 is a
  non-catalytic structural component that organizes the CSN complex and engages
  cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) to enable CSN5-mediated deneddylation of cullins,
  thereby controlling CRL ubiquitin ligase activity and downstream proteostasis.
  COPS2 also functions independently as a nuclear receptor corepressor (Alien/TRIP15),
  interacting with thyroid hormone receptor, DAX-1, and other nuclear receptors to
  repress transcription. The protein localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus,
  consistent with its roles in both CRL regulation and transcriptional regulation.

        Core annotation. COPS2/CSN2 is an integral subunit of the COP9 signalosome
        as demonstrated by multiple structural and biochemical studies. The CSN
        complex consists of COPS1-8/9 subunits, and COPS2 is part of the
        Csn1/2/3/8 module [PMID:19141280]. Crystal structure confirms COPS2 as a
        core subunit [PMID:25043011].
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        COPS2 is a well-established core subunit of the COP9 signalosome. IBA
        annotation based on phylogenetic inference is fully supported by
        extensive experimental evidence in mammals and other eukaryotes.

            Our results indicate that the catalytically active human complex,
            reconstituted in vitro, is composed of a single copy of each of the
            eight subunits. By forming a total of 35 subcomplexes, we are able to
            build a comprehensive interaction map that shows two symmetrical
            modules, Csn1/2/3/8 and Csn4/5/6/7, connected by interactions between
            Csn1-Csn6.

        Core annotation. COPS2 is essential for CSN complex integrity and
        deneddylase function. Mouse knockout studies show that Csn2 disruption
        leads to loss of CSN function and accumulation of neddylated cullins
        [PMID:12628923]. The deneddylation is catalyzed by CSN5, but requires
        the intact complex including COPS2 for activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        COPS2 is required for CSN-mediated deneddylation. While COPS2 itself
        lacks catalytic activity (CSN5 is the isopeptidase), COPS2 is essential
        for CSN complex assembly and function. The IBA annotation appropriately
        captures the role of CSN2 in the deneddylation process.

        OVER-ANNOTATION: COPS2 is a PCI-domain scaffold subunit of the COP9
        signalosome (CSN). PMID:9535219 shows the CSN complex has kinase
        activity, but UniProt notes this is "possibly via its association
        with CK2 and PKD kinases". COPS2 itself lacks kinase catalytic
        activity - it is a structural scaffold. The kinase activity comes
        from associated kinases, not COPS2.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        COPS2 does not have intrinsic kinase activity. The phosphorylation
        activity is due to associated kinases (CK2, PKD) that interact with
        the CSN complex. The annotation should reflect the regulatory role
        rather than direct catalytic phosphorylation.

          Our results indicate that the catalytically active human complex,
          reconstituted in vitro, is composed of a single copy of each of the
          eight subunits.
