### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "COPS2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'COPS2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **COPS2** (gene ID: COPS2, UniProt: P61201) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human COPS2 (COP9 signalosome subunit 2; TRIP15/Alien)

Verification of target identity and domain context
- The target is COPS2 (UniProt P61201), a core non-catalytic subunit of the mammalian COP9 signalosome (CSN), also known historically as TRIP15/Alien. Genetic and biochemical studies establish CSN2/COPS2 as an integral PCI-scaffold subunit within the eight-subunit CSN complex, consistent with PCI family/domain annotations provided (CSN/26S components, PCI/Tetratricopeptide-like folds). These features position CSN2 at the CSN–CRL interface, coordinating with other PCI subunits to arrange the catalytic MPN+/JAMM deneddylase (CSN5) for activity (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4). Foundational genetics in mouse (Csn2/Trip15) confirm conserved subunit function and nomenclature alignment (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 7-8).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary molecular role: CSN2 is a non-enzymatic PCI-scaffold subunit of CSN that helps organize the complex and engages cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) to regulate CSN5-catalyzed deneddylation (removal of NEDD8) from cullin scaffolds. This deneddylation downmodulates CRL ubiquitylation, resets the CRL neddylation cycle, and thereby controls proteostasis and numerous signaling pathways (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4). Genetic disruption of Csn2 in mouse impairs CSN integrity and deneddylation of Cul1/Cul2, with accumulation of cyclin E and p53, and early embryonic lethality, underscoring its essential scaffolding and regulatory function (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4).
- Interface with CRLs: Structural analyses and reviews place CSN2 in direct contact with cullin C-termini and RBX RING components (e.g., CSN2 with CUL4A CTD; CSN2 and CSN4 can “sandwich” RBX1), transmitting conformational changes toward the CSN5–CSN6 catalytic dimer to control deneddylation (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).
- TRIP15/Alien nuclear receptor corepression: Historical literature recognizes TRIP15/Alien (COPS2) as a nuclear receptor corepressor (e.g., interactions with DAX-1 and thyroid hormone receptor), indicating additional gene-regulatory functions beyond its structural CSN role (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 7-8).
- Cellular localization: CSN (including CSN2) is present in cytoplasm and nucleus, coinciding with sites of CRL action (e.g., CRL4CSA in transcription-coupled repair; NF-κB signaling in immune/endothelial cells; neuronal stress responses), with functional evidence for nuclear and cytoplasmic roles (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25), (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- CSN vs proteasome LID comparison and CSN–CRL architecture: A 2024 review synthesizes structural/functional parallels between the proteasome LID and CSN, and details CSN–CRL interfaces where CSN2 engages CUL-CTDs and RBX to position CSN5 for deneddylation; it also discusses conformational propagation from PCI subunits (CSN2/4/7) to the CSN5 active site (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).
- Inflammation and neurovascular applications: Ex vivo and cellular work in 2023 shows CSN activity (modulated with NEDD8 pathway inhibitor MLN4924 and CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3) reduces microglial/endothelial inflammation and protects against ischemic neuronal stress in organotypic brain slices, linking CSN function to neuroinflammation and barrier integrity (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25).
- Orthosteric CSN5 inhibition and mechanism (new mechanistic clarity): Although published as a 2025 preprint, recent cryo-EM and biochemical analyses clarify how orthosteric inhibitor CSN5i-3 achieves substrate-dependent, nanomolar potency by acting as an “orthosteric molecular glue” that stabilizes a tri-molecular CSN5–NEDD8–inhibitor assembly, occluding the iso-peptide linkage and reshaping CSN5 loops that gate the active site (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.26.690573; Nov 2025) (shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 1-5, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 5-9, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 23-25, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 9-13). While beyond 2024, these structural insights align with and extend 2023–2024 mechanistic models of CSN–CRL deneddylation.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Pharmacologic modulation of the CRL–CSN axis: The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 (pevonedistat) and CSN5i-3 (active-site CSN inhibitor) are used as tool compounds to modulate CRL activity/CSN deneddylation in preclinical models. In brain slice and cell paradigms, MLN4924 dampened NF-κB signaling and protected endothelial barrier and neurons in ischemia models; conversely, CSN5 inhibition exacerbated permeability and injury, indicating pathway tunability with translational potential in inflammatory/ischemic contexts (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25). The orthosteric CSN5i-3 mechanism supports strategies for selective substrate/CRL-dependent CSN inhibition (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.26.690573; Nov 2025) (shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 1-5, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 13-17).
- Pathway-level implementations: The CSN–CRL neddylation/deneddylation cycle is central to regulating cell-cycle proteins (e.g., p27, cyclin E), DNA-damage responses, immune signaling (NF-κB), and transcription-coupled repair (e.g., CRL4CSA). Genetic or chemical modulation of this axis serves as a lever in oncology and inflammation biology (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4), (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4), (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Structural/mechanistic perspective: The 2024 synthesis highlights CSN2’s PCI-scaffold role and its direct contacts with CRL components (CUL CTDs, RBX), explaining how PCI subunit movements regulate CSN5 catalysis. It frames CSN as a dynamic regulator opposing CRL activation by NEDD8, with potential to influence the substrate receptor landscape and downstream proteostasis (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).
- Translational view in neuroinflammation: 2023 experimental work concludes that mimicking CSN deneddylase activity (via NEDD8-pathway modulation) dampens inflammatory signaling and preserves neural/endothelial function ex vivo, positioning the CSN–CRL axis as a candidate therapeutic target in ischemic and inflammatory CNS settings (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25).
- Orthosteric inhibition implications: Recent structural data support a nuanced inhibition paradigm in which active-site CSN5 inhibitors can exhibit uncompetitive, substrate-dependent potency by stabilizing the enzyme–substrate complex. This has implications for designing substrate- or CRL-selective CSN modulators, a concept with relevance for oncology and inflammatory diseases (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.26.690573; Nov 2025) (shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 1-5, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 23-25).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Genetic loss-of-function: Csn2-null mice arrest shortly after implantation, with ICM outgrowth failure, cyclin E accumulation, and elevated p53/p21—quantitatively indicating profound proliferation deficits and embryonic lethality (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4).
- Neuroinflammation/ischemia models: In microglia and cerebral endothelial cells, pharmacologic modulation of the NEDD8/CSN axis altered NF-κB signaling, phagocytosis, motility, and monolayer permeability; in organotypic slices, MLN4924 reduced ischemic neuronal death, whereas CSN5 inhibition impaired survival (qualitative summary of reported findings) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25).
- CSN5 orthosteric inhibition: Biophysical and kinetic analyses of CSN5i-3 demonstrate micromolar affinity for free CSN5 contrasted with potent, low-nanomolar inhibition of deneddylation through a cooperative, uncompetitive mechanism involving NEDD8 engagement—quantitative framework supporting the “orthosteric molecular glue” model (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.26.690573; Nov 2025) (shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 23-25, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 13-17, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 9-13).

Functional annotation summary for COPS2
- Molecular function: COPS2 is a PCI-scaffold subunit within CSN that organizes CSN–CRL assemblies and helps enable CSN5-mediated deneddylation of cullins, thereby controlling CRL E3 ligase activity and downstream proteostasis; independently, TRIP15/Alien acts as a nuclear receptor corepressor, indicating transcriptional regulatory capacity (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4), (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 7-8).
- Pathways: CSN–CRL neddylation/deneddylation cycle; cell-cycle control (e.g., p27, cyclin E), DNA damage and transcription-coupled repair contexts (e.g., CRL4CSA), immune signaling (NF-κB), and neuronal stress/inflammation (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4), (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25), (URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.19.6790-6797.2003; Oct 2003) (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4).
- Localization: Nuclear and cytoplasmic, co-localizing with CRLs and engaging immune, endothelial, and neuronal contexts consistent with CSN’s broad regulatory reach (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-023-04911-8; Aug 2023) (tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25), (URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1496862; Nov 2024) (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity and organism
- All cited mechanistic/structural references concern mammalian/human CSN, with direct genetic evidence from mouse Csn2 knockout that translates to human COPS2/CSN2 role within the conserved CSN. The TRIP15/Alien synonym is consistently used in mammalian literature and linked to nuclear receptor corepression. No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered that would redirect away from human COPS2 (lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 1-2, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 3-4, lykkeandersen2003disruptionofthe pages 7-8, dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4).

Overall interpretation
- COPS2 (CSN2/TRIP15) is essential as a PCI-scaffold that situates the CSN for efficient, regulated deneddylation of CRLs, thereby integrating protein quality control with cell-cycle, DNA repair, immune, and neuronal processes. Recent (2023–2024) syntheses and disease-model studies reinforce this central role and demonstrate that pharmacologic intervention in the neddylation/deneddylation cycle can modulate inflammation and tissue stress responses. Emerging structural work on orthosteric CSN5 inhibition provides a framework for next-generation, potentially substrate/CRL-selective CSN modulators that could be developed for oncology, inflammation, and neurovascular indications (dubiel2024comparisonoftwo pages 2-4, tian2023thecop9signalosome pages 24-25, shi2025orthostericmolecularglue pages 1-5).
