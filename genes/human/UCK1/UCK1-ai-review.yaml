description: UCK1 (Uridine-cytidine kinase 1) is a nucleoside kinase that catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their respective monophosphates
  (UMP and CMP), functioning in the pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway. The enzyme
  can use ATP or GTP as phosphate donors and shows specificity for pyrimidine ribonucleosides,
  not phosphorylating deoxyribonucleosides or purine ribonucleosides. UCK1 is also
  capable of phosphorylating various nucleoside analogs used in cancer chemotherapy
  and antiviral therapy.

  review:
    summary: Cytoplasmic localization is supported by phylogenetic inference (IBA)
      and consistent with the Reactome annotation indicating cytosolic localization.
      The enzyme functions in the cytoplasm/cytosol to phosphorylate nucleosides.
      While accurate, this is a broader parent term of the more specific GO:0005829
      (cytosol).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The cytoplasmic localization is well-supported by phylogenetic evidence
      and consistent with the enzyme's role in nucleotide salvage. Reactome specifically
      notes cytosolic UCK1 activity. While the more specific term GO:0005829 (cytosol)
      is also annotated with experimental evidence (TAS), having both parent and
      child terms is acceptable in GO annotation practices. This provides broader
      coverage and is phylogenetically supported.

  review:
    summary: Uridine kinase activity is a core function of UCK1, directly demonstrated
      by experimental evidence showing phosphorylation of uridine to UMP. This IBA
      annotation is consistent with direct experimental evidence (IDA) from PMID:11306702.
      The enzyme is highly specific for pyrimidine ribonucleosides.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents one of the two core molecular functions of UCK1. The
      enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine to UMP using ATP or GTP as
      phosphate donor, as demonstrated experimentally in the original characterization
      study and confirmed through phylogenetic inference. The substrate specificity
      is well-established - UCK1 does not phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides or purine
      ribonucleosides.

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation was inferred from the cytidine kinase molecular
      function. While technically correct that UCK1 phosphorylates cytidine to CMP,
      this broad biosynthetic process term doesn't specify that UCK1 functions in
      the salvage pathway (not de novo biosynthesis). The more specific term GO:0044211
      (CTP salvage) is already annotated with experimental evidence (IDA).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Upon further consideration, this annotation is acceptable. While GO:0044211
      (CTP salvage) is more specific and preferred, GO:0009224 (CMP biosynthetic
      process) is not incorrect - CMP is indeed biosynthesized by UCK1 activity,
      whether via salvage or de novo pathways. The IEA annotation provides broader
      pathway coverage and was correctly inferred from the cytidine kinase activity.
      Both terms can coexist, with the salvage term being more informative about
      the specific pathway.

  review:
    summary: This is an overly general parent term that doesn't provide meaningful
      information about UCK1's specific function. While technically correct that
      UCK1 binds nucleotides (ATP/GTP as phosphate donors, and uridine/cytidine as
      substrates), this broad term lacks functional specificity. The more specific
      child term GO:0005524 (ATP binding) is already annotated.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This term is too vague and uninformative for curation purposes. It was
      automatically assigned based on UniProtKB keywords. UCK1 specifically binds
      ATP (and can also use GTP) as phosphate donors for its kinase activity. The
      more specific GO:0005524 (ATP binding) provides much more useful functional
      information and is already annotated. This overly broad parent term adds little

    summary: UCK1 binds ATP as a phosphate donor for its kinase activity. The enzyme

      uses ATP (or GTP) as a phosphate donor in the reaction uridine/cytidine + ATP
      → UMP/CMP + ADP + H+. Crystallographic structures (PDB 2JEO, 2UVQ) directly

  review:
    summary: This is a high-level parent term in the molecular function hierarchy.
      While UCK1 is indeed a kinase (specifically a nucleoside kinase), this term
      is overly general. The more specific and informative terms GO:0004849 (uridine

      with both IBA and IDA evidence.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      and UniProtKB keywords. While technically accurate, it provides minimal functional
      information compared to the specific child terms (uridine kinase activity,

      In curation, such overly general parent terms are typically considered over-annotations
      when more specific child terms adequately describe the function.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is an extremely high-level parent term in the molecular function
      ontology. UCK1 is indeed a transferase (kinases transfer phosphate groups from
      ATP to substrates), but this root-level term provides virtually no functional
      specificity. Multiple more informative descendant terms are already annotated
      (kinase activity, uridine kinase activity, cytidine kinase activity).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This is a classic example of over-annotation with an overly broad parent
      term. It was automatically assigned based on UniProtKB keywords. While technically
      correct, GO:0016740 is so general that it encompasses a vast array of different
      enzyme activities. The more specific child terms (GO:0016301 kinase activity,
      GO:0004849 uridine kinase activity, GO:0043771 cytidine kinase activity) provide
      far more useful functional information. Annotating to such high-level parent
      terms when specific child terms exist is generally discouraged in manual curation.

      process function. The UniProt entry explicitly states this is "step 1/1" in

    supporting_text: The approximately 30-kDa proteins, named UCK1 and UCK2, were
      expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of
      Urd and Cyd. The enzymes did not phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides or purine
      ribonucleosides.
