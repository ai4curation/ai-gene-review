  SCAMP4 (Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 4) is a member of the SCAMP family of
  integral membrane proteins involved in vesicle trafficking. SCAMP4 is a shorter (~25 kDa)
  SCAMP family member that lacks most of the large N-terminal cytosolic domain found in
  SCAMP1-3, but retains the conserved four-transmembrane domain core with cytosolic N- and
  C-termini. Like other SCAMPs, SCAMP4 localizes primarily to the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
  and recycling endosome membranes, with some presence at the plasma membrane. The SCAMP
  family functions as membrane-trafficking machinery at cytosolic interfaces, participating
  in vesicle formation, fusion, and recycling between the plasma membrane and internal
  compartments. Recent studies have identified SCAMP4 as a senescent cell surface protein
  potentially involved in promoting SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) secretion,
  though direct mechanistic evidence for SCAMP4-specific functions remains limited.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from the SCAMP family
      (PANTHER). SCAMP family proteins function as membrane-trafficking machinery
      involved in vesicle formation and fusion. The family is implicated in exocytic
      processes. While SCAMP4-specific exocytosis data is limited, the phylogenetic
      inference is supported by family-level functional evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Exocytosis is a well-established function for the SCAMP family based on
      family-level studies. The IBA annotation appropriately captures this conserved
      family function at a reasonable level of specificity. SCAMP4 retention of the
      conserved membrane core supports functional conservation.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This IBA annotation for TGN membrane localization is strongly supported by
      SCAMP family localization studies that demonstrated SCAMPs 1-4 concentrate
      in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal recycling compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TGN localization is a core characteristic of the SCAMP family. Family-level
      localization studies explicitly included SCAMP4 and demonstrated concentration
      at the TGN membrane. This represents a fundamental aspect of SCAMP4 cellular
      localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IBA annotation for recycling endosome membrane localization is well-supported
      by family-level studies showing SCAMPs 1-4 localize to endosomal recycling
      compartments alongside TGN.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Recycling endosome localization is a well-documented characteristic of SCAMP
      family proteins. The phylogenetic inference appropriately extends this localization
      to SCAMP4 based on conserved family properties.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping (IPR007273 SCAMP domain)
      and UniProtKB keywords. While accurate, this is a broad term. The SCAMP family is
      involved in protein transport, functioning as trafficking machinery for
      vesicle-mediated transport between compartments.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The term is appropriately broad for an automated annotation. SCAMP family function
      in membrane protein trafficking supports this annotation. More specific terms
      (exocytosis) are already captured by the IBA annotations, so this broader IEA
      annotation provides acceptable coverage without being misleading.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation identifies SCAMP4 as a membrane protein. This is accurate but
      very general. SCAMP4 is a multi-pass integral membrane protein with four
      transmembrane domains. More specific localization terms (TGN membrane, recycling
      endosome membrane) are already captured by IBA annotations.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a generic term, it is accurate and not misleading. SCAMP4 is
      unambiguously a membrane protein with four transmembrane helices. The more specific
      IBA annotations provide the detailed localization information.

      This annotation comes from the HuRI (Human Reference Interactome) project, a
      systematic yeast two-hybrid screen that identified approximately 53,000 protein-protein

      Per curation guidelines, 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) is an uninformative

      about SCAMP4's role. The HuRI study is a high-throughput interactome mapping
      study that detected binary PPIs but does not provide mechanistic insight into
      SCAMP4's molecular function.

      SCAMP4 is a member of the SCAMP family of trafficking proteins that function as
      membrane-trafficking machinery. The specific molecular function of SCAMP4 is not
      well characterized - it is a non-enzymatic integral membrane protein. SCAMP4
      localizes to the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosome membranes where it
      participates in vesicle-mediated transport processes including exocytosis.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What are the specific protein interactions and mechanistic roles of SCAMP4
      compared to other SCAMP family members (SCAMP1-3, SCAMP5)? SCAMP4 lacks the
      E-peptide region that mediates SCAMP2-NHE7 interactions, suggesting functional
      divergence. The specific binding partners and mechanisms of SCAMP4 remain understudied.
  - question: >-
      What is the role of SCAMP4 in senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
      and senescent cell biology? Recent reviews identify SCAMP4 as a senescent cell
      surface protein potentially promoting SASP secretion, but direct functional
      evidence is lacking.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      CRISPR knockout or siRNA knockdown of SCAMP4 in senescent cell models
      followed by quantitative secretomics to assess effects on SASP factor secretion.
      This would directly test the proposed role of SCAMP4 in promoting SASP secretion
      suggested by surfaceome studies.
  - description: >-
      Proximity labeling (BioID/APEX2) of SCAMP4 to identify the specific
      interactome in different cellular compartments. This would provide context-specific
      interaction data beyond high-throughput Y2H and identify functional partners
      in native cellular environments.
