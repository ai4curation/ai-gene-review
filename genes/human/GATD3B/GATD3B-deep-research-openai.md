## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene GATD3B (A0A0B4J2D5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function. 

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Overview of the GATD3B Gene and Protein

**GATD3B** (Glutamine Amidotransferase-like Class 1 Domain Containing 3B) is a human protein-coding gene encoding a small mitochondrial protein of the DJ-1/PfpI superfamily ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20potential,See%20more)). This gene is a paralog of **GATD3A** (also known as C21orf33 or *ES1*, for “E. coli** S**imilarity 1”) – both genes belong to the GATD3 family and likely arose from a duplication event ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000280071#:~:text=Orthologs)). GATD3B was identified through genomic sequencing as a homolog of bacterial and zebrafish **ES1** proteins, mapping to human chromosome 21 ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=Isolation%20of%20a%20human%20gene,5)). It contains a **type I glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1)** domain, a fold shared with the DJ-1 superfamily (which includes the Parkinson’s disease protein DJ-1/PARK7) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=We%20focused%20on%20the%20mitochondrial,acid%20species%20in%20a%20one)). Despite its name, current evidence indicates that GATD3B is **not** involved in classical glutamine metabolism; instead, it plays a role in cellular defense against reactive carbonyl compounds. 

**Expression:** GATD3B transcripts are widely expressed across tissues. For example, RNA profiling shows expression in the heart and at least 97 other human tissues ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000280071#:~:text=Expressed%20in%20apex%20of%20heart,other%20cell%20types%20or%20tissues)), suggesting a ubiquitous housekeeping role. Notably, GATD3B (or its close family member GATD3A) is encoded on chromosome 21 and is **overexpressed in Down syndrome** (trisomy 21) tissues due to gene dosage. One study reported ~1.9-fold higher levels of the GATD3A/ES1 protein in fetal Down syndrome brain compared to controls ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=For%20neuron%20damage%2C%20GATD3A%2FES1%20encodes,This%20result%20suggests%20that)). This overexpression has been hypothesized to relate to the heightened oxidative and carbonyl stress seen in Down syndrome; investigators have speculated that elevated ES1 might reflect a compensatory response or a contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-linked neurodegeneration in Down syndrome brains ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20overexpression%20of,hydrogen%20peroxide%20and%20protects%20the)). Beyond this context, GATD3 proteins have not been strongly linked to specific diseases, but their activity suggests relevance to conditions involving metabolic stress (e.g. diabetes and neurodegeneration, where carbonyl stress and glycation damage are prevalent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=Glycation%2C%20the%20nonenzymatic%20glycosylation%20of,transthyretin%20amyloidosis%2C%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%2C%20and))).

**Localization:** The GATD3B protein is targeted to the **mitochondria**, the cellular organelles responsible for energy metabolism. It contains an N-terminal leader sequence rich in hydrophobic and positively charged residues, characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting peptide. Consistently, proteomic surveys and cell imaging have confirmed GATD3 (ES1) as a resident mitochondrial protein ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20potential,See%20more)) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=Proteomics%20of%20bovine%20mitochondrial%20RNA,6)). The mature protein (~18–20 kDa) is presumably localized to the **mitochondrial matrix**, since its function is to metabolize small toxins generated in mitochondrial metabolism (see below). Early studies in model systems supported a mitochondrial role: for instance, the zebrafish ES1 homolog localizes to mitochondria in retinal cone cells and was even implicated in regulating mitochondrial morphology (excess ES1 led to unusually large “mega-mitochondria” in photoreceptors) ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=match%20at%20L1210%20ES1%20is,22)). In mammals, however, GATD3/ES1 loss did not visibly alter mitochondrial ultrastructure, suggesting its primary role is biochemical rather than structural ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=histological%20analyses,the%20mitochondria%20did%20not%20change)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,activity%20caused%20by%20ES1%20deficiency)).

# Biochemical Function and Enzymatic Activity

**Primary Function:** GATD3B is now recognized as an enzyme that protects cells from toxic metabolites. Specifically, it functions as a **glutathione-independent glyoxalase** (also termed **glyoxalase III**). Glyoxalases are enzymes that detoxify reactive dicarbonyl compounds like glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which are byproducts of metabolism that can glycate proteins and DNA (forming advanced glycation end-products, AGEs) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=Glycation%2C%20the%20nonenzymatic%20glycosylation%20of,transthyretin%20amyloidosis%2C%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%2C%20and)). Unlike the classical glyoxalase system (GLO1/GLO2) which operates in the cytosol and requires glutathione, GATD3B provides a glutathione-*independent* mechanism to neutralize glyoxal inside mitochondria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=We%20focused%20on%20the%20mitochondrial,acid%20species%20in%20a%20one)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). 

**Catalytic Reaction:** The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of **glyoxal (CHO-CHO)** to **glycolate (HOCH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>)** in a single-step hydrolytic reaction ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=are%20members%20of%20the%20DJ,acid%20species%20in%20a%20one)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). In essence, GATD3B adds water to the dialdehyde glyoxal, yielding a carboxylic acid and preventing the formation of harmful AGEs. This reaction is analogous to the known activity of bacterial and yeast DJ-1 superfamily members. Indeed, human GATD3B is ~43% identical in sequence to *E. coli* “elbB”, a stress-response protein with glyoxalase III activity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=We%20focused%20on%20the%20mitochondrial,acid%20species%20in%20a%20one)). Like other DJ-1 family enzymes (e.g. *E. coli* Hsp31 and human DJ-1), GATD3B is thought to use a **cysteine-based catalytic mechanism**: a nucleophilic cysteine and a general acid/base (often Glu or His) in the active site facilitate the hydration of the carbonyl substrate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=elbB%20exhibits%20GLO3%20activity%2C%20converting,When)). The GATD3B protein sequence contains conserved **Cys** and **Glu** residues required for this catalytic activity, analogous to those in Hsp31 and DJ-1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=elbB%20exhibits%20GLO3%20activity%2C%20converting,When)). No evidence indicates that GATD3B catalyzes glutamine amidotransfer reactions; the “amidotransferase” designation derives from its structural fold rather than its actual substrate specificity.

**Substrate Specificity:** GATD3B appears to be finely tuned to detoxify **glyoxal** in particular. Recent experimental assays showed that the mammalian enzyme efficiently metabolizes glyoxal but displays little or no activity toward **methylglyoxal** (a related dicarbonyl) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=significantly%20lower%2C%20but%20the%20metabolic,possesses%20properties%20similar%20to%20those)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=mES1%29,defined%20as%20the%20amount%20of)). In a 2023 study, recombinant mouse GATD3 (ES1) actively converted glyoxal into glycolic acid in vitro, whereas no significant turnover of methylglyoxal was detected ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=mES1%29,defined%20as%20the%20amount%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=significantly%20lower%2C%20but%20the%20metabolic,possesses%20properties%20similar%20to%20those)). This mirrors the behavior of *E. coli* elbB, which can neutralize glyoxal but not the bulkier methylglyoxal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=significantly%20lower%2C%20but%20the%20metabolic,possesses%20properties%20similar%20to%20those)). Thus, GATD3B serves a specialized role in eliminating *glyoxal* generated within mitochondria. Glyoxal can arise from oxidative sugar fragmentation or lipid peroxidation, and if left unchecked it readily reacts with biomolecules. By clearing glyoxal, GATD3B helps **prevent mitochondrial protein glycation** and maintains enzyme integrity.

# Biological Pathways and Processes

**Mitochondrial Dicarbonyl Detoxification:** The foremost biological process involving GATD3B is the **detoxification of reactive carbonyls in the mitochondrion**. Mitochondria lack the classical glutathione-dependent glyoxalase enzymes, so the mechanism for handling dicarbonyl stress in mitochondria was unclear until recently ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=are%20members%20of%20the%20DJ,acid%20species%20in%20a%20one)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). GATD3 (ES1) fills this gap. It constitutes a novel mitochondrial glyoxalase pathway that protects mitochondrial proteins, DNA, and membranes from glyoxal-induced damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). Deletion of the GATD3A gene in mice demonstrates the enzyme’s importance: **ES1-knockout mice** showed a significant accumulation of glyoxal’s toxic effects in the brain mitochondria ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=histological%20analyses,the%20mitochondria%20did%20not%20change)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=pathway%20and%20oxidative%20phosphorylation,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). Specifically, mitochondrial fractions from ES1-deficient mice had substantially lower glyoxal-metabolizing activity than wild-type, indicating that ES1 is a major (if not the only) mitochondrial glyoxalase ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,activity%20caused%20by%20ES1%20deficiency)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). In these knockouts, the impairment in glyoxal clearance was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial **cytochrome c oxidase** activity, suggesting that excess glyoxal may damage crucial respiratory enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=pathway%20and%20oxidative%20phosphorylation,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). The cells responded by upregulating alternative detoxification pathways: researchers observed a compensatory increase in enzymes of the **methylglyoxal degradation pathway** (e.g. aldo-keto reductase AKR7A2 and CYP2E1) in the knockout, presumably to mitigate the elevated carbonyl stress ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=that%20ES1,mitigate%20the%20effects%20of%20ES1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,activity%20caused%20by%20ES1%20deficiency)). This underscores that GATD3B/ES1 normally helps keep mitochondrial reactive carbonyl levels low, safeguarding mitochondrial function.

**General Metabolic and Stress Response:** By preventing glycation damage, GATD3B contributes broadly to **mitochondrial quality control** and **oxidative stress resistance**. Glyoxal and related dicarbonyls are known to increase under oxidative stress and high metabolism; without detoxification they form adducts that exacerbate oxidative damage and interfere with enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=Glycation%2C%20the%20nonenzymatic%20glycosylation%20of,transthyretin%20amyloidosis%2C%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%2C%20and)). Therefore, GATD3B can be viewed as part of the cell’s antioxidant defense network. Its activity complements other mitochondrial protective systems (such as superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxins) but targeting a different class of damaging byproducts (carbonyl compounds). This role may tie GATD3B to aging and metabolic diseases: excessive dicarbonyl accumulation is implicated in **diabetic complications, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s), and aging-related tissue dysfunction** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=Glycation%2C%20the%20nonenzymatic%20glycosylation%20of,transthyretin%20amyloidosis%2C%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%2C%20and)). While direct data in humans are limited, the presence of GATD3B in virtually all tissues ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000280071#:~:text=Expressed%20in%20apex%20of%20heart,other%20cell%20types%20or%20tissues)) and its induction in Down syndrome brains ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=For%20neuron%20damage%2C%20GATD3A%2FES1%20encodes,This%20result%20suggests%20that)) suggest the protein is routinely called upon to manage metabolic stress. In Down syndrome, for instance, the chronic overexpression of chromosome 21 genes (including GATD3A) is thought to disturb redox balance; increased ES1 might be a response aiming to counteract heightened carbonyl and ROS levels ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20overexpression%20of,hydrogen%20peroxide%20and%20protects%20the)). Researchers have included GATD3A among genes that could contribute to the early neurodegeneration observed in Down syndrome, possibly through its interactions with mitochondrial stress pathways ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=For%20neuron%20damage%2C%20GATD3A%2FES1%20encodes,This%20result%20suggests%20that)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9168127/#:~:text=match%20at%20L839%20overexpression%20of,hydrogen%20peroxide%20and%20protects%20the)). However, whether GATD3B itself has regulatory roles beyond its enzymatic detox function remains to be elucidated.

# Recent Research and Developments (2023–2024)

Until recently, the function of GATD3B (and GATD3A) was **largely uncharacterized**. Early clues from sequence homology and microbial models suggested a metabolic role, but direct evidence in mammals was lacking. **Key progress was made in 2023**, when Ito *et al.* published a detailed functional study of the mouse GATD3A protein (ES1) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). This work provided the first clear demonstration of GATD3’s enzymatic activity and physiological importance:

- **Glyoxalase III Activity Confirmed:** Ito and colleagues showed that purified **mouse ES1 catalyzes the conversion of glyoxal to glycolic acid** in vitro ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). No co-factors (such as glutathione) were required, confirming ES1 acts as a one-step glyoxalase (glyoxalase III). Notably, adding recombinant ES1 significantly reduced glyoxal levels, whereas **no activity was observed with methylglyoxal** as substrate ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=mES1%29,defined%20as%20the%20amount%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=significantly%20lower%2C%20but%20the%20metabolic,possesses%20properties%20similar%20to%20those)). This established the substrate specificity of the enzyme and aligned with predictions from bacterial homologs.

- **Knockout Mouse Phenotype:** The researchers created an **ES1-knockout (Gatd3a<sup>−/−</sup>) mouse** to assess the in vivo role ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=We%20focused%20on%20the%20mitochondrial,humans%20and%20mice%3B%20however%2C%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=step%2C%20glutathione,When)). In brains of ES1-KO mice, glyoxal-metabolizing activity was significantly decreased relative to wild-type, demonstrating that ES1 is the principal agent clearing mitochondrial glyoxal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=significantly%20lower%2C%20but%20the%20metabolic,possesses%20properties%20similar%20to%20those)). Although the knockout mice did not display obvious developmental abnormalities, biochemical analysis revealed that **mitochondrial respiration was subtly impaired**. In particular, the activity of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) was reduced in ES1-deficient mitochondria, consistent with glyoxal-induced damage to respiratory chain components ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=pathway%20and%20oxidative%20phosphorylation,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). Proteomic profiling further showed an upregulation of alternate detox enzymes and oxidative phosphorylation proteins in KO mice, indicating a compensatory response to **dicarbonyl stress** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=that%20ES1,mitigate%20the%20effects%20of%20ES1)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,activity%20caused%20by%20ES1%20deficiency)). Together, these findings confirmed that GATD3/ES1 is an important mitochondrial **metabolic safeguard**, and loss of this protein triggers molecular changes to cope with accumulating glyoxal.

- **Mechanistic Insights:** Through alignment and mutational analysis, Ito *et al.* noted that ES1 shares the conserved **Cys-Glu** catalytic motif of known DJ-1 superfamily glyoxalases ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=elbB%20exhibits%20GLO3%20activity%2C%20converting,When)). This supported a catalytic mechanism in which the enzyme’s cysteine likely forms a thiohemiacetal intermediate with glyoxal, which then hydrolyzes to release glycolate. The study by Ito *et al.* was the first to delineate this **novel mitochondrial dicarbonyl detox pathway**, filling a gap in our understanding of mitochondrial metabolism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=should%20be%20the%20response%20to,for%20reactive%20dicarbonyls%20in%20mitochondria)). It highlighted that cells possess a dedicated system to handle glyoxal in the mitochondrial matrix, with GATD3/ES1 as the central enzyme. This discovery has spurred interest in whether modulating GATD3B activity could influence cellular resistance to metabolic stress.

**Ongoing and Future Directions:** Following the 2023 breakthrough, current research is exploring **real-world implications** of GATD3B’s function. For example, scientists are examining if GATD3B expression or activity changes under conditions like high-fat diet, diabetes, or oxidative injury, where dicarbonyl production is elevated. Given that glyoxal and methylglyoxal are key drivers of protein glycation in diabetic complications and age-related tissue damage ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10209487/#:~:text=Glycation%2C%20the%20nonenzymatic%20glycosylation%20of,transthyretin%20amyloidosis%2C%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%2C%20and)), **GATD3B is being discussed as a potential therapeutic target or biomarker** for metabolic health. While no therapies directly targeting GATD3B exist yet, one could envision strategies to boost its activity (or that of GATD3A) to reduce mitochondrial AGE formation. In line with this, some researchers have noted the co-localization of GATD3A with mitochondrial RNA and hypothesized additional roles in mitochondrial homeostasis ([www.genecards.org](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATD3#:~:text=Proteomics%20of%20bovine%20mitochondrial%20RNA,6)), though such functions remain to be proven. 

Finally, it is worth noting that **gene duplication in humans** resulting in GATD3A and GATD3B provides redundancy that could be protective. Both GATD3A and GATD3B encode very similar proteins (mitochondrial enzymes of 190 amino acids) and presumably share function ([tissues.jensenlab.org](https://tissues.jensenlab.org/protein/ENSP00000480313#:~:text=TISSUES%20Tissue%20expression%20database%20JensenLab,The)) ([www.bgee.org](https://www.bgee.org/gene/ENSG00000160221#:~:text=GATD3A%20ENSG00000160221%20expression%20in%20Homo,Compare%20expression%3A%20table)). However, detailed comparisons of GATD3A vs. GATD3B expression and activity have not yet been published. It will be an important area of study to determine if GATD3B has any unique regulation or tissue specificity relative to GATD3A, or if it simply augments the total ES1 enzyme pool in cells. Addressing these questions will deepen our understanding of how human cells guard their mitochondria against the ever-present threat of metabolic toxins like glyoxal.
