description: >-
  PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain-containing protein 1) is a secreted metalloenzyme that
  functions as a bidirectional N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase. Despite its
  classification in the M20 peptidase family, PM20D1 has completely abandoned peptidase
  activity through neofunctionalization, representing a textbook case of enzyme functional
  divergence. It catalyzes both the condensation of free fatty acids (preferentially oleate)
  with free amino acids (preferentially phenylalanine) to generate N-acyl amino acids, and
  the reverse hydrolytic reaction. The N-acyl amino acid products (e.g., N-oleoyl-phenylalanine,
  N-oleoyl-glutamine) directly bind mitochondrial inner membrane carriers (SLC25 family)
  and function as endogenous UCP1-independent mitochondrial uncouplers, stimulating oxidative
  metabolism and energy expenditure. PM20D1 circulates in association with LDL and HDL
  lipoprotein particles, which co-activate its enzymatic activity, while serum albumin
  serves as a physiologic carrier for its N-acyl amino acid products. The enzyme is highly
  expressed in brown adipose tissue and is cold-inducible, playing a role in adaptive
  thermogenesis and energy homeostasis. PM20D1 also produces N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA)
  from dopamine, which inhibits alpha-synuclein aggregation. The gene lies within the PARK16
  locus linked to Parkinson's disease risk. PM20D1 has been implicated in metabolic regulation,
  obesity, nociception (via TRPV1/TRPA1 antagonism), and neuroprotection in both Alzheimer's
  and Parkinson's diseases. Intracellularly, FAAH serves as a complementary N-acyl amino acid
  synthase/hydrolase, creating division of labor between extracellular (PM20D1) and
  intracellular (FAAH) pathways.

      REMOVE. This is a misleading annotation. Although PM20D1 belongs to the M20 peptidase

      PM20D1 does not cleave peptide bonds. It hydrolyzes N-acyl amino acids where a fatty

  review:
    summary: >-
      KEEP_AS_NON_CORE. PM20D1 was detected in urinary exosomes by high-throughput
      proteomics. This represents a location where PM20D1 can be found, but its primary
      functional location is the extracellular space/blood associated with lipoproteins.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: High-throughput detection; primary location is extracellular space with lipoproteins

core_functions:
- description: >-
    PM20D1 catalyzes the bidirectional synthesis and hydrolysis of N-acyl amino acids
    in the extracellular space. The synthase reaction condenses free fatty acids
    (preferentially oleate) with free amino acids (preferentially phenylalanine) to
    produce N-acyl amino acids. The products function as endogenous UCP1-independent
    mitochondrial uncouplers that stimulate energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis.

      We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the
      condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also
      the reverse hydrolytic reaction.

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the structural basis for PM20D1's substrate specificity for phenylalanine
    and oleate in the synthase reaction?
  experts:
  - Long JZ
  - Spiegelman BM
- question: >-
    Does PM20D1 have additional physiological substrates beyond the characterized
    N-acyl amino acids, and do all products function as mitochondrial uncouplers?
  experts:
  - Long JZ
  - Nomura DK

suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: >-
    PM20D1 crystal structure could reveal the molecular basis for its substrate
    preferences and distinguish it from true peptidases.
  description: >-
    Crystallography of PM20D1 with bound substrates or substrate analogs to determine
    the structural basis for fatty acid and amino acid recognition.
