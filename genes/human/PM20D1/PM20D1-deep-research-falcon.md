### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q6GTS8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=N-fatty-acyl-amino acid synthase/hydrolase PM20D1 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:27374330}; EC=3.5.1.114 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27374330}; EC=3.5.1.14 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27374330}; AltName: Full=Peptidase M20 domain-containing protein 1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:26518}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=PM20D1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:26518};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase M20A family. .
- **Key Domains:** Bact_exopeptidase_dim_dom. (IPR036264); Pept_M20A. (IPR047177); Peptidase_M20. (IPR002933); Peptidase_M20_dimer. (IPR011650); M20_dimer (PF07687)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "PM20D1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'PM20D1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **PM20D1** (gene ID: PM20D1, UniProt: Q6GTS8) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified the target as human PM20D1 (Peptidase M20 domain–containing protein 1), a member of the M20 peptidase family. Primary functional and localization data were drawn from seminal experimental work and later follow‑ups (Cell 2016; Cell Chem Biol 2020; Nat Med 2018), with 2024 updates on epigenetic associations in chronic pain. These sources directly examine human PM20D1 or demonstrate conservation between mouse and human orthologs (including catalytic residues), aligning with the UniProt description and domain family assignment (M20) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 7-8, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6, kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 1-3, sanchezmut2018pm20d1isa pages 7-9, ao2024wholegenomemethylationprofiling pages 11-13).

Comprehensive research report: PM20D1 (human; UniProt Q6GTS8)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and family: PM20D1 is a secreted enzyme of the mammalian M20 peptidase family. It functions as a bidirectional N‑acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase that interconverts free fatty acids plus amino acids with N‑acyl amino acids (NAAs) (bidirectional catalysis shown in vitro for human PM20D1). Catalytic histidines (e.g., H125, H465) are conserved and required for activity (mutations ablate catalysis) (Long 2016, Cell; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071; published Jul 2016) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 7-8, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6).
- Core biochemical role: PM20D1 regulates a circulating, cold‑inducible class of NAAs that act as mitochondrial uncouplers independent of UCP1, thereby modulating energy expenditure and systemic metabolism (Long 2016, Cell; Kim 2020, Cell Chem Biol; URLs: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.071; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.04.009; published Jul 2016; Sep 2020) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-7, kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 1-3).

2) Enzymology, substrate specificity, and reaction directionality
- Bidirectional enzyme: Purified human and mouse PM20D1 catalyze both N‑acyl amino acid synthesis from free fatty acids and amino acids, and hydrolysis of preformed NAAs back to their precursors. Under the reported assay conditions, net conversion favored hydrolysis (~94% hydrolase versus ~1–2% synthase), indicating robust hydrolase activity and more selective synthase activity dependent on substrates (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 5-6, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 7-8).
- Substrate scope: Demonstrated synthase substrates include oleate (C18:1) and arachidonate (C20:4) as acyl donors and multiple amino acids as headgroups (e.g., phenylalanine, leucine, glycine, serine, alanine, isoleucine, glutamate, tryptophan, lysine, tyrosine). PM20D1 showed preference for free fatty acids over acyl‑CoA for NAA synthesis in vitro (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 7-8, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 5-6).
- Catalytic residues and conservation: Human PM20D1 is highly similar to mouse (71% identity; 86% similarity) and requires H125/D127/H465; mutation of these residues abolishes both synthase and hydrolase activities, supporting a shared catalytic machinery for bidirectionality (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 7-8).

3) Cellular/tissue localization and evidence for secretion/extracellular activity
- Secreted enzyme associated with lipoproteins: PM20D1 is secreted in vivo and found in plasma, where it associates with LDL/HDL. Fractionation and immunoaffinity proteomics show PM20D1 in lipoprotein fractions, with lipoproteins acting as co‑activators of PM20D1 and promoting NAA biosynthesis. Serum albumin serves as a physiologic NAA carrier that partitions NAAs between active “free” and inactive “bound” pools (Kim 2020, Cell Chem Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2020.04.009; published Sep 2020) (kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 3-5, kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 1-3).
- Tissue sources: Endogenous secretion from brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, kidney, and intestine has been detected; adipocytes secrete PM20D1 into circulation (Kim 2020, Cell Chem Biol; URL above). In vivo secretome mapping further validates classically secreted PM20D1 using a signal peptide–dependent tagging system (Wei 2021, Nat Chem Biol; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-020-00698-y; published Sep 2021) (kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 1-3, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5).

4) Roles in thermogenesis and UCP1‑independent mechanisms
- N‑acyl amino acids as endogenous uncouplers: Specific NAAs (e.g., N‑oleoyl‑Phe, N‑arachidonoyl‑Gly, N‑arachidonoyl‑Phe) increase oxygen consumption rate in adipocytes even in the presence of oligomycin, indicating mitochondrial uncoupling independent of ATP synthase and UCP1. In vivo elevation of circulating PM20D1 increases whole‑body VO2/VCO2, reduces fat mass (~30% reduction) without increased activity/food intake, and raises plasma NAA levels, supporting a role in UCP1‑independent thermogenesis (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-7, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5).

5) Regulation of PM20D1 expression and disease associations
- Genetic/epigenetic regulation in brain and AD: PM20D1 harbors a promoter methylation DMR in human cortex that inversely correlates with expression. Two mQTL/eQTL SNPs (rs708727, rs960603) associate with higher promoter methylation, lower expression, and increased AD risk. A haplotype‑dependent enhancer–promoter loop mediated by CTCF/MeCP2 modulates PM20D1; risk haplotypes reduce CTCF binding, increase MeCP2 binding, and suppress transcription. Functional modulation of PM20D1 expression alters AD‑like pathology in models (Sanchez‑Mut 2018, Nat Med; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0013-y; published May 2018) (sanchezmut2018pm20d1isa pages 7-9, sanchezmut2018pm20d1isa pages 1-4).
- Chronic pain (2024 update): Whole‑genome methylation profiling in temporomandibular disorders (TMD) identified a PM20D1 promoter DMR with biphasic methylation dynamics across disease course (hypermethylation in chronic cases and specific early persistent‑pain trajectories, with hypomethylation at follow‑up in persistent cases). Several mQTLs influenced DMR methylation, indicating genetic modulation of PM20D1 epigenetics in pain states (Ao 2024, Pain; URL: https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003104; published Nov 2024) (ao2024wholegenomemethylationprofiling pages 11-13).
- Metabolic links: Genetic elevation of PM20D1 increases circulating NAAs and induces a hypermetabolic phenotype, whereas loss of PM20D1 impairs glucose homeostasis in mice, consistent with metabolic roles for the PM20D1–NAA axis (Kim 2020, Cell Chem Biol; URL above) (kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 1-3).

6) Quantitative data and statistics
- Plasma NAA concentrations and in vivo changes: Targeted LC–MS quantitation showed basal plasma NAA levels in the ~1–100 nM range in mice; AAV‑PM20D1 increased multiple NAAs in plasma (e.g., N‑oleoyl‑Phe from ~4 nM to ~10 nM; N‑oleoyl‑Leu from ~6 nM to ~29 nM; representative values reported in the study). Elevation of circulating PM20D1 increased whole‑body oxygen consumption and decreased body fat (~30% reduction) without changes in activity or food intake (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5).
- Enzymatic conversion balance: Under assay conditions, PM20D1 exhibited markedly higher hydrolase conversion (~94% ± 0.8%) than synthase conversion (~1.2% ± 0.1%), highlighting strong hydrolase activity and more selective synthetic activity (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 5-6).
- Secretome/complex formation: Proteomic co‑purification identified apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOB) as PM20D1‑associated proteins; fractionation localized PM20D1 activity to HDL/LDL fractions, indicating an extracellular, lipoprotein‑coupled enzymatic context (Kim 2020, Cell Chem Biol; URL above) (kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 3-5).

7) Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Pain epigenetics (2024): PM20D1 promoter methylation dynamics serve as a potential longitudinal marker in chronic painful TMD, showing genetically modulated, biphasic methylation trajectories between onset and 6‑month follow‑up. This underscores PM20D1 as an epigenetically regulated locus beyond neurodegeneration, with potential utility as a biomarker of pain trajectory (Ao 2024, Pain; URL: https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003104; published Nov 2024) (ao2024wholegenomemethylationprofiling pages 11-13).
- Continued validation of secretion/extracellular activity: Secretome profiling and plasma proteomics confirm PM20D1 as a classically secreted protein and delineate its extracellular association with lipoproteins, which modulate its activity and NAA bioavailability (Kim 2020; Wei 2021; URLs above; though pre‑2023, these remain the most authoritative mechanistic studies to date) (kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 3-5, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5).

Applications and real‑world implementations
- Metabolic modulation: The PM20D1–NAA axis represents a targetable node for increasing energy expenditure via UCP1‑independent uncoupling. Exogenous NAAs improved glucose homeostasis and increased energy expenditure in mice, while genetic elevation of PM20D1 raised circulating NAAs and induced a hypermetabolic state, suggesting therapeutic potential for obesity and related metabolic disorders (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5, long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-7).
- Biomarkers: PM20D1 promoter methylation and haplotype (rs708727/rs960603) constitute a combined genetic–epigenetic biomarker framework in Alzheimer’s disease; the 2024 TMD study suggests analogous potential for pain stratification and prognosis (Sanchez‑Mut 2018, Nat Med; Ao 2024, Pain; URLs above) (sanchezmut2018pm20d1isa pages 1-4, ao2024wholegenomemethylationprofiling pages 11-13).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Mechanistic consensus: High‑quality experimental evidence supports PM20D1 as a secreted, extracellular M20 peptidase that regulates a family of bioactive NAAs with direct mitochondrial effects, providing a UCP1‑independent thermogenic mechanism. The lipoprotein association data add a physiologic layer that explains NAA partitioning and enzyme co‑factorization in plasma. Together, these findings argue for PM20D1 as a bona fide extracellular metabolic regulator rather than a purely intracellular peptidase (Long 2016; Kim 2020; Wei 2021; URLs above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 4-5, kim2020aplasmaprotein pages 3-5).
- Epigenetic regulation and disease: The Nature Medicine study provides causal‑leaning evidence that PM20D1 expression modulation affects AD‑related pathology, situating PM20D1 as both a risk‑linked locus (mQTL/eQTL) and a stress‑inducible protective gene. The 2024 pain data broaden the epigenetic disease relevance of PM20D1 and suggest that context‑dependent methylation dynamics may reflect disease state and trajectory (Sanchez‑Mut 2018; Ao 2024; URLs above) (sanchezmut2018pm20d1isa pages 7-9, ao2024wholegenomemethylationprofiling pages 11-13).

Limitations and open questions
- Enzyme kinetics: Precise steady‑state kinetic constants (Km, kcat) for human PM20D1 across physiologic substrates remain incompletely defined in the cited literature; reported conversion data highlight directionality but not detailed kinetics (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 5-6).
- Translational status: While animal studies support metabolic benefits of manipulating the PM20D1–NAA axis, clinical studies in humans and standardized biomarker assays (e.g., plasma PM20D1 protein or NAA panels) require further development.

Summary of verified identity alignment
- Gene symbol and organism: PM20D1 studied in human and mouse; human PM20D1 shows conserved activity and catalytic residues, matching the human (Homo sapiens) target (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6).
- Family/domains: Experimental papers classify PM20D1 within the M20 peptidase family, consistent with peptidase M20A features noted in database annotations (Long 2016, Cell; URL above) (long2016thesecretedenzyme pages 6-6).
