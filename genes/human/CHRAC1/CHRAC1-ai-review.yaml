  CHRAC1 (Chromatin Accessibility Complex protein 1, also known as CHRAC-15 or CHRAC15)
  is a small (~15 kDa, 131 amino acids) histone-fold protein that functions as a
  structural/accessory subunit in the CHRAC (Chromatin Accessibility Complex)
  ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex. CHRAC1 forms a stable heterodimer with
  POLE3 (also known as CHRAC-17/p17) via their histone-fold domains, structurally
  analogous to the histone H2A-H2B dimer. This CHRAC1-POLE3 heterodimer binds naked
  double-stranded DNA and associates with the ACF chromatin remodeling complex
  (consisting of SMARCA5/SNF2H and BAZ1A/ACF1) to form the complete four-subunit
  CHRAC complex. The CHRAC1-POLE3 module enhances the ATP-dependent nucleosome
  sliding and chromatin assembly activities of ACF. CHRAC1 itself has no enzymatic
  activity but serves as an essential adapter that tethers the remodeling machinery
  to chromatin substrates. The complex functions in chromatin remodeling during DNA
  replication (particularly through heterochromatin), transcriptional regulation,
  and maintenance of chromatin organization.

        CHRAC1 is a nuclear protein that functions in chromatin remodeling. The Human
        Protein Atlas confirms nuclear/nucleoplasm localization. UniProt states

        While CHRAC1's complex facilitates DNA replication through chromatin, the

        "DNA-templated DNA replication" implies direct involvement in DNA synthesis.
        CHRAC1 functions in chromatin remodeling to support replication, not in
        replication itself. A more accurate term would be "regulation of DNA replication"
        or chromatin remodeling during replication.

      reason: >-
        This annotation is erroneous. CHRAC1 has no DNA polymerase activity. The
        original publication (PMID:10880450) describes CHRAC1 as a structural
        histone-fold protein, not an enzyme. The confusion may arise from POLE3's
        dual role in Pol epsilon, but CHRAC1 is not part of the polymerase complex.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is INCORRECT. CHRAC1 is NOT a component of DNA polymerase
        epsilon. POLE3 (CHRAC1's binding partner) is shared between CHRAC and Pol
        epsilon, but CHRAC1 itself is specific to the CHRAC complex [PMID:14759371].
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        CHRAC1 is not a subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon. While POLE3 (p17) is
        shared between CHRAC and Pol epsilon, CHRAC1 (p15) is unique to CHRAC.
        The original literature clearly distinguishes CHRAC1 from Pol epsilon
        components.

        DNA binding is demonstrated for the CHRAC1-POLE3 heterodimer in the original

        DNA binding is experimentally demonstrated for the CHRAC1-containing
