description: Nidogen-1 (also called entactin) is a critical basement membrane glycoprotein
  that functions as an architectural linker protein bridging the laminin and collagen
  IV networks. The 1247 amino acid protein contains three globular domains (G1, G2,
  G3) connected by rod-like segments with EGF-like repeats. The G2 domain binds with
  high affinity to the laminin gamma-1 chain, while the G3 domain binds collagen IV.
  Nidogen-1 also binds perlecan and fibulins, serving as a central organizing element
  in basement membrane assembly. This bridging function is essential for basement membrane
  structural integrity across diverse tissues including skin, muscle, and nervous system.
  The protein is ubiquitously expressed in basement membranes throughout the body and
  represents one of the core structural constituents of the basement membrane extracellular
  matrix.

    summary: Nidogen-1 contains multiple calcium-binding EGF-like domains in its central
      rod region, as indicated by InterPro domain annotations. UniProt features annotate
      calcium-binding EGF-like domains at positions 710-751 and 802-840.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a legitimate molecular function supported by domain architecture.
      Nidogen-1 contains calcium-binding EGF-like repeats in the rod domain connecting
      G2 and G3 globules, as confirmed by InterPro annotations and UniProt features.
      PMID:2119632 notes "The molecule binds calcium ions" as one of nidogen's properties.
      While not the core bridging function, calcium binding may play a role in maintaining
      structural integrity.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is misleading. GO:0071944 (cell periphery) includes both
      plasma membrane and cell wall, which are not appropriate for nidogen-1. Nidogen-1
      is a secreted protein that localizes to the extracellular basement membrane,
      not to cellular membranes or cell periphery structures. While the basement membrane
      is adjacent to cells, "cell periphery" suggests association with the cell surface
      itself rather than the extracellular space. The more specific terms basement
      membrane (GO:0005604) and extracellular matrix (GO:0031012) are far more appropriate.
