description: >-
  RAB9B (Ras-related protein Rab-9B) is a small GTPase of the Rab family that regulates
  vesicular trafficking between late endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Like
  its paralog RAB9A, RAB9B cycles between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active)
  states to control membrane trafficking. In its GTP-bound form, RAB9B recruits effector
  proteins including TIP47 (cargo adaptor for mannose-6-phosphate receptor recycling),
  GCC185 (TGN tether), BLOC-3 complex (HPS1-HPS4 heterodimer involved in lysosome-related
  organelle biogenesis), RhoBTB3 (ATPase for endosome-to-Golgi transport), and NDE1
  (dynein motor adaptor for retrograde trafficking). RAB9B localizes to late endosomes,
  lysosomes, and phagosomes, where it participates in retrograde transport of
  cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) to the TGN, thereby
  supporting lysosomal enzyme delivery. RAB9B is recruited to phagosomes containing
  bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, suggesting a role in
  phagosome maturation. The protein is ubiquitously expressed with enhanced expression
  in heart tissue.

      RAB9B localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes as part of its role in

      Rab9 family proteins are established regulators of late endosome-TGN trafficking
      and localize to late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. This is consistent with

      to late endosomes and lysosomes (PMID:21255211, PMID:20937701).

    RAB9B binds GTP in its active state, enabling recruitment of effector proteins
    including BLOC-3, RhoBTB3, TIP47, and NDE1. Crystal structure demonstrates
    GTP analog binding (PDB:2OCB). GTP-dependent effector binding is demonstrated
    in PMID:20048159 and PMID:19490898.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What are the specific functional differences between RAB9A and RAB9B,
      and are there tissue-specific roles? Most mechanistic studies have focused
      on RAB9A, with RAB9B function largely inferred from paralogy. Expression
      differences (e.g., low RAB9B in macrophages) suggest tissue-specific roles
      that remain unexplored.
  - question: >-
      Does RAB9B have specific effectors distinct from RAB9A? While BLOC-3,
      RhoBTB3, and NDE1 are established Rab9 effectors, it is unclear whether
      RAB9B has unique effector preferences compared to RAB9A.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Side-by-side comparison of RAB9A and RAB9B knockout/knockdown effects
      on M6PR trafficking and lysosomal enzyme delivery in different cell types.
      This would clarify whether RAB9A and RAB9B have redundant or specialized
      functions in the endosome-to-TGN retrograde pathway.
  - description: >-
      Quantitative proteomics (BioID or IP-MS) comparing RAB9A and RAB9B
      interactomes in the same cellular context. This would identify effector
      specificities and potential unique functions for each paralog.
