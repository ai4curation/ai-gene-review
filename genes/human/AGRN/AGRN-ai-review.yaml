description: Agrin is a large heparan sulfate proteoglycan that functions as the critical organizer of the neuromuscular junction postsynaptic apparatus. Neural agrin isoforms containing the z8 insert bind to the LRP4-MuSK receptor complex on muscle cells, triggering phosphorylation cascades that induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors and assembly of the postsynaptic density. Beyond the NMJ, agrin is a major basement membrane component in kidney glomerulus, blood-brain barrier, and other tissues, where it contributes to ECM architecture through laminin binding. Alternative splicing generates functionally distinct isoforms - neural z+ forms are active at NMJ while muscle z0 forms serve structural roles in basement membranes.

  review:
    summary: Both transmembrane (SN-agrin, isoform 2) and secreted (LN-agrin, isoform 1) forms of agrin associate with plasma membrane. Transmembrane isoforms are present in CNS neurons. Secreted forms interact with muscle cell surface receptors (LRP4/MuSK complex) at NMJ. UniProt confirms isoform 2 is single-pass type II membrane protein in synapses.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Agrin has documented membrane association through both transmembrane isoforms and receptor binding of secreted isoforms. This is a core localization for agrin function at NMJ where it binds to muscle surface receptors, and for CNS where transmembrane forms are expressed.

  review:
    summary: Agrin initiates signal transduction at NMJ through AGRN-LRP4-MuSK complex formation, activating MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream phosphorylation cascades. This signaling induces AChR clustering and postsynaptic differentiation. Term is accurate but very general.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While agrin clearly mediates signal transduction, this term is too broad. More specific terms exist that better capture agrin's mechanism as a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activator (GO:0030297) and its role in specific processes like neuromuscular junction development.

  review:
    summary: Agrin is essential for establishing the structural and molecular organization required for chemical synaptic transmission at NMJ by inducing AChR clustering. However, agrin itself does not directly participate in synaptic transmission - it organizes the postsynaptic apparatus that enables transmission.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While agrin is critical for NMJ function, it acts developmentally to organize the synapse rather than participating directly in transmission. More specific terms like 'neuromuscular junction development' (GO:0007528) or 'synapse organization' (GO:0050808) better capture agrin's actual role as an organizer rather than a participant in transmission per se.

  review:
    summary: Agrin directly activates MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase through formation of the AGRN-LRP4-MuSK ternary complex. This activation is essential for NMJ formation and is mediated by the z8 insert in neural agrin isoforms. Structural studies revealed a 2:2 tetrameric complex where agrin binding to LRP4 brings two MuSK receptors into close proximity for trans-autophosphorylation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the core molecular function of neural agrin at NMJ. Agrin binding to LRP4 promotes MuSK activation and autophosphorylation, initiating the signaling cascade for AChR clustering. This is precisely accurate and well-supported by structural and functional studies.

    reason: Extracellular region is the core localization for secreted agrin. This annotation is correct regardless of the specific pathway context (even if integrin binding is less established than LRP4/MuSK interactions).

  review:
    summary: Multiple Reactome annotations place agrin in Golgi lumen as part of GAG biosynthesis pathways (heparanase cleavage, HS chain assembly, etc). Agrin passes through Golgi during synthesis and GAG modification.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Agrin transiently passes through the Golgi during synthesis where GAG side chains are assembled. However, this is a transient biosynthetic localization, not where agrin functions. The functional localizations are ECM, basement membrane, and synapse. Mark all Golgi annotations as non-core biosynthetic localizations.

  review:
    summary: Transmembrane agrin (isoform 2) in CNS induces dendritic filopodia formation, which serve as sites for synapse formation. The 7th follistatin-like domain (specifically D538) is essential for this activity. Activity-dependent filopodia formation requires neurotrypsin-dependent agrin cleavage and the 22 kDa C-terminal fragment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a documented function of CNS transmembrane agrin. While not the primary NMJ function, it represents an important role in CNS synapse formation. Filopodia act as precursors to mature synapses. This is a legitimate biological process for agrin in the brain, linked to cognitive function through neurotrypsin cleavage.

While agrin is best known for its signaling role at NMJ, it also serves as a structural ECM component, particularly in kidney GBM, blood-brain barrier, and other BMs. The RCA (inferred from reviewed computational analysis) evidence is appropriate for this well-established role.

    reason: While agrin is detected in exosomes, this likely represents shedding or secretion artifacts rather than a functional localization. Exosome presence doesn't indicate a specific biological role. This is a peripheral detection, not core function.

  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: The LG2 and LG3 domains of agrin bind alpha-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. This interaction anchors agrin to the muscle cell surface and links the ECM to the cytoskeleton. The interaction depends on LARGE-synthesized matriglycan polysaccharides on dystroglycan and has been shown to regulate cardiac regeneration through YAP pathway modulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Dystroglycan binding is a well-characterized and functionally important molecular activity of agrin. This interaction is critical for agrin's structural role in linking basement membrane to muscle cytoskeleton at NMJ. Mutations disrupting this binding cause CMS. Additionally, agrin-dystroglycan interaction regulates YAP signaling in cardiomyocytes, with implications for cardiac regeneration.
