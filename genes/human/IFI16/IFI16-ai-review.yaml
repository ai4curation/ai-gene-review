description: IFI16 (Gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16) is a PYHIN family 
  nuclear DNA sensor that plays a central role in innate immunity. It contains 
  an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and two C-terminal HIN-200 domains that bind 
  double-stranded DNA via OB-fold structures. The primary functions of IFI16 
  include sensing cytosolic and nuclear viral DNA during herpesvirus infection, 
  activating STING-dependent type I interferon responses, and forming 
  ASC-dependent inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and IL-1beta maturation. 
  IFI16 also functions as a transcriptional regulator, interacting with p53 and 
  Sp1 family transcription factors to modulate gene expression. It acts as a 
  restriction factor against herpesviruses (HSV-1, HCMV, KSHV) by binding viral 
  DNA and inhibiting viral gene expression. The protein is predominantly nuclear
  but can translocate to the cytoplasm depending on acetylation status and upon 
  viral infection.

    review:
      summary: IFI16 contains two HIN-200 domains that bind double-stranded DNA 
        via electrostatic interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone. This is 
        a well-established core function supported by structural studies 
        (PMID:22483801) and functional assays (PMID:7536752, PMID:20890285).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: dsDNA binding is a fundamental molecular function of IFI16 that 
        underlies its role as a DNA sensor. The HIN domains contain OB-folds 
        that mediate sequence-independent dsDNA binding. This is supported by 
        IBA phylogenetic inference and extensive experimental evidence.

      summary: IFI16 is an interferon-inducible gene whose expression is

    description: >-
      IFI16 is a cytosolic and nuclear DNA sensor that binds double-stranded DNA through
      its two HIN-200 domains (HIN-A and HIN-B). The HIN domains contain OB-fold motifs
      that recognize DNA through electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone.
      Upon DNA binding, IFI16 recruits STING to activate type I interferon signaling
      and/or assembles with ASC to form an inflammasome complex for IL-1beta maturation.
