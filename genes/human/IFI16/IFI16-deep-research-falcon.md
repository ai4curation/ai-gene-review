## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q16666
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1526658}; Short=Ifi-16 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1526658}; AltName: Full=Interferon-inducible myeloid differentiation transcriptional activator;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IFI16 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:1526658, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:5395}; Synonyms=IFNGIP1;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HIN-200 family. .
- **Key Domains:** DAPIN. (IPR004020); DEATH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011029); HIN-200. (IPR040205); HIN200/IF120x. (IPR004021); NA-bd_OB-fold. (IPR012340)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IFI16" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IFI16' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IFI16** (gene ID: IFI16, UniProt: Q16666) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: IFI16 (Human; UniProt Q16666)

Verification of target identity and domain architecture
- Gene/protein match: The target is IFI16 (Interferon gamma inducible protein 16; UniProt Q16666), a human PYHIN (pyrin and HIN-200) family member comprising an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and two C-terminal HIN domains, typically HIN-A and HIN-B. The HIN domains are built from tandem OB-fold beta-barrels that bind nucleic acids; IFI16 also contains nuclear localization signals and an intrinsically disordered linker between PYD and HINs. These defining features align with the PYHIN family and the description provided, confirming correct gene/protein identity and organism (Homo sapiens). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025); https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 2-3, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2, xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6)

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Family and domains: IFI16 is a nuclear-dominant PYHIN sensor. The PYD mediates protein–protein interactions (e.g., ASC recruitment), while the HIN domains recognize nucleic acids through phosphate backbone electrostatics; OB-folds in HINs underlie this recognition. HIN subtype behavior differs: HIN-B shows strong dsDNA binding; HIN-A can contribute and may also bind ssDNA in some contexts. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 2-3, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2)
- Nucleic acid recognition: IFI16 senses double-stranded DNA with a length/structure threshold for signaling. Binding to short DNA (~10–20 bp) is possible, but robust IFN-I or inflammasome activation usually requires ≥70 bp, with optimal responses >200 bp. DNA sensing triggers IFI16 oligomerization/filament formation along nucleosome-free DNA and relief of PYD–HIN autoinhibition. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024). (xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6)
- Subcellular localization and dynamics: IFI16 is predominantly nuclear (including nucleolus) under basal conditions; during infection or DNA damage, it can translocate to the cytoplasm, form signaling filaments on viral genomes in the nucleus, or undergo pathogen-driven degradation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6, bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2)

Mechanisms and pathways
- ASC-dependent inflammasome: Upon DNA engagement, IFI16’s PYD recruits ASC, forming an IFI16 inflammasome that activates caspase-1 and IL-1β maturation; this can occur in the nucleus (noncanonical, “nuclear” inflammasome) or cytosol. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4)
- cGAS–STING/type I IFN signaling: IFI16 also induces type I interferons via STING–TBK1–IRF3. Evidence supports both cGAS-cooperative roles and cGAS-independent IFI16→STING activation, including reports of direct IFI16–STING interaction and IFI16-facilitated STING dimerization/TBK1 recruitment, albeit with context-dependent positive/negative regulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4, xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6)
- RIG-I axis crosstalk: IFI16 can promote RIG-I expression and facilitate RIG-I ubiquitination and activation upon viral nucleic acid sensing, connecting to MAVS–TBK1–IRF3/NF-κB signaling. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4)
- Regulatory complexity: Reviews highlight that IFI16 may inhibit or promote inflammasome vs IFN outputs depending on cellular context, DNA location, and pathogen, and may suppress other inflammasomes (AIM2/NLRP3) under certain conditions. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 2-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19)

Antiviral responses and pathogen interactions
- DNA viruses: IFI16 binds nuclear viral genomes and restricts transcription/replication in herpesviruses (e.g., HSV-1, KSHV, HCMV); some viruses drive IFI16 degradation during lytic reactivation. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19)
- Pathway coordination: IFI16 supports type I IFN responses through STING and can interface with RIG-I signaling, contributing to broad antiviral states. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024). (bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4)
- Generalized antiviral mechanism: Structural/biophysical models emphasize DNA length dependence, filament formation on nucleosome-free DNA, and nuclear sensing, consistent with restriction of diverse DNA viruses and modulation of innate signaling. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024). (xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6)

Cancer biology and immune-oncology
- Dual roles: Recent reviews synthesize that IFI16 shows context-dependent tumor suppression (e.g., via IRF3-driven IFN programs, inhibition of DNA repair, and anti-proliferative signaling) and tumor promotion (e.g., chronic inflammation and microenvironmental effects). Mechanisms may be inflammasome-dependent or independent. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 2-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2)
- Open clinical questions: Reviews stress unresolved aspects: subcellular dynamics in tumors, interplay with cGAS–STING, and pathogen-driven modulation of IFI16 levels (e.g., degradation during herpesvirus reactivation) and their implications for therapy. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19)

Autoimmunity and inflammatory disease
- Type I IFN and inflammasome axes: IFI16 has been associated with mucosal inflammation (e.g., IBD) and proposed involvement in systemic autoimmunity (SLE) via pathological IFN and inflammasome activation, although disease- and tissue-specific mechanisms remain to be fully delineated. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19)

Cell death programs and PANoptosis
- PANoptosis context: IFI16 is implicated in apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis cross-talk and has been proposed as a regulator of PANoptosis in cardiac pathology, potentially intersecting with cGAS–STING-driven inflammatory signaling. Clinical correlations include elevated IFI16 with heightened inflammatory cytokines in myocardial infarction models, suggesting translational potential as a biomarker or target, though mechanistic resolution is ongoing. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-01978-5 (May 2024). (chang2024theroleof pages 10-11, chang2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Post-translational regulation and isoforms
- PTMs and isoforms: Reviews surveyed here note IFI16 regulation by conformational autoinhibition (PYD–HIN) relieved by DNA binding, and mention an IFI16-β transcript variant that can inhibit AIM2 inflammasome activity, illustrating isoform-level functional diversity. Comprehensive, recent quantitative maps of acetylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation were not detailed in the 2023–2025 sources sampled and remain active research areas. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-01978-5 (May 2024). (chang2024theroleof pages 1-2)

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2025)
- Structural and mechanistic updates: 2024–2025 reviews consolidate OB-fold-mediated DNA binding, length-dependent sensing thresholds, and nuclear filament formation as central to IFI16 activation logic. They also synthesize evidence for direct or cooperative IFI16 engagement of STING, with context-dependent bidirectional regulation. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024). (xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6, bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4)
- Disease-focused insights: 2024 work highlights IFI16’s proposed role in PANoptosis and heart disease, suggesting translational paths (biomarkers/targets) that warrant validation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-01978-5 (May 2024). (chang2024theroleof pages 10-11, chang2024theroleof pages 1-2)
- Cancer-focused synthesis: 2025 review articulates dual roles of PYHIN proteins, including IFI16, in tumor contexts, emphasizing unsettled mechanisms of inflammasome versus interferon dominance and crosstalk with cGAS–STING. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 2-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker prospects: IFI16’s induction by type I IFN, nuclear localization dynamics, and reported elevation in cardiac injury contexts point to biomarker potential in inflammatory and cardiovascular disease; however, standardized assays and prospective clinical validation are needed. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-024-01978-5 (May 2024). (chang2024theroleof pages 10-11)
- Therapeutic angles: Conceptual strategies include modulating IFI16–STING engagement to tune IFN responses or targeting IFI16 inflammasome activity in inflammation or cancer; reviews emphasize the need for mechanistic and preclinical development before clinical translation. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 2-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 18-19)

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Cross-field consensus: Multiple 2023–2025 reviews converge on IFI16 as a nuclear DNA sensor with dual outputs (inflammasome vs interferon) governed by DNA context and cellular state, and as a context-specific modulator in cancer and inflammatory disease. URLs: https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1576674 (May 2025); https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1395035 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-024-00046-w (Mar 2024). (zeng2025thedualroles pages 2-4, zeng2025thedualroles pages 1-2, bottardi2024mndaapyhin pages 3-4, xie2024cytosolicdnasensors pages 5-6)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Quantitative trends: The surveyed 2023–2025 sources emphasize mechanistic synthesis rather than large-scale quantitative clinical data for IFI16. Reported observations include increased IFI16 expression associated with inflammatory cytokine elevation in myocardial infarction models, but broader statistics on effect sizes and clinical outcomes specific to IFI16 modulation remain limited in these reviews and represent an evidence gap.
