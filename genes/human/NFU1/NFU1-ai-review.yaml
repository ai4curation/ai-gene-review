description: NFU1 encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein of the NifU/NFU family that
  functions as a late-acting [4Fe-4S] cluster carrier in mitochondrial iron-sulfur
  cluster biogenesis. The protein dimerizes and ligates a bridging [4Fe-4S] cluster
  that is transferred to specific client proteins. NFU1 receives two [2Fe-2S] units
  from upstream donors ISCU2 and ISCA1, which are reductively coupled (with electrons
  from FDX2) to form the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The primary client is lipoyl synthase (LIAS),
  which requires the auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster for its catalytic activity. NFU1 dysfunction
  therefore impairs lipoylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
  (OGDH), and the glycine cleavage system, explaining the metabolic features of NFU1
  deficiency. Biallelic mutations in NFU1 cause Multiple Mitochondrial Dysfunctions
  Syndrome type 1 (MMDS1), characterized by early-onset leukoencephalopathy, lactic
  acidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, and pulmonary hypertension. Alternative splicing
  produces isoforms with distinct subcellular localizations, with isoform I targeted
  to mitochondria and isoform II present in cytosol and nucleus.

  review:
    summary: NFU1 is established as a mitochondrial protein through multiple lines
      of evidence. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic analysis is well-supported
      by direct experimental evidence showing mitochondrial localization of isoform
      I (PMID:12886008), mitochondrial matrix localization from Reactome pathway analysis,
      and high-confidence mitochondrial proteomics (PMID:34800366).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Mitochondrial localization is a core feature of NFU1 function. The protein
      functions specifically in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis and is targeted
      to the mitochondrial matrix (PMID:12886008, Reactome:R-HSA-6793591). This is

      species.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While NFU1 does participate in protein maturation, the term "protein maturation"
      (GO:0051604) is too general. The specific role of NFU1 is in iron-sulfur cluster

    summary: The IEA annotation for iron ion binding is derived from InterPro domain

      The [4Fe-4S] cluster contains four iron atoms that are coordinated by the protein.

    action: NEW
    reason: This term specifically captures NFU1's role as a late-acting Fe-S cluster
      chaperone that assembles clusters from [2Fe-2S] intermediates and delivers them
      to client proteins including LIAS. This is the defining molecular function of
      NFU1.

        for assembly of clusters that are subsequently used for maturation of targeted
        Fe-S proteins.

    label: iron-sulfur cluster chaperone activity
  description: NFU1 is a late-acting [4Fe-4S] cluster chaperone that receives [2Fe-2S]
    clusters from upstream donors ISCU2 and ISCA1, assembles them into [4Fe-4S] clusters,
    and delivers these to target proteins. This chaperone function is demonstrated
    by biochemical reconstitution, spectroscopic analysis, and functional complementation
    studies (PMID:12886008, PMID:27538573, PMID:28906594).

  description: NFU1 dimerizes and ligates a bridging [4Fe-4S] cluster. Mossbauer spectroscopy
    and UV-visible absorption studies demonstrate approximately one [4Fe-4S] cluster
    per two NFU1 monomers (PMID:12886008). The cluster-binding cysteines (C210 and
    C213) are essential for function and are disrupted by pathogenic mutations (PMID:28906594).
