## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9NYP7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Very long chain fatty acid elongase 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; EC=2.3.1.199 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10970790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19575253, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20937905}; AltName: Full=3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; AltName: Full=ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; Short=ELOVL FA elongase 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; AltName: Full=Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; AltName: Full=Fatty acid elongase 1; Short=hELO1; AltName: Full=Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; AltName: Full=Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ELOVL5 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03205}; Synonyms=ELOVL2; ORFNames=PRO0530;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ELO family. ELOVL5 subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** ELO_fam. (IPR002076); ELOVL5. (IPR033677); ELO (PF01151)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ELOVL5" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ELOVL5' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ELOVL5** (gene ID: ELOVL5, UniProt: Q9NYP7) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human ELOVL5 (UniProt: Q9NYP7) — functional annotation, pathways, regulation, and recent advances (2023–2025)

Verification of target identity and family/domain alignment
- Symbol match and organism: ELOVL5 is a human member of the ELOVL (elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids) family of integral ER membrane enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting condensation step in fatty acid chain elongation, consistent with the UniProt description of ELOVL5 as a 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA synthase for VLCFA elongation (EC 2.3.1.199) (wang2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 1-2). 
- Family/domains and localization: ELOVL enzymes are multi-pass ER membrane proteins with conserved elongase motifs; ELOVL5 is grouped with ELOVL2 as the principal PUFA-elongating isoforms localized to endoplasmic reticulum, in agreement with the ELO family/domain annotations (wang2023; Vaz et al., 2025) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).

Key concepts and definitions
- Enzyme class and reaction: ELOVL5 is the condensing enzyme of the microsomal fatty acid elongation (FACES) cycle. It catalyzes the Claisen-type condensation of an acyl‑CoA (chain length n) with malonyl‑CoA to form 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA (n+2). This is the first and rate-determining step of the four‑reaction ER elongation cycle (condensation by ELOVLs; then 3‑ketoacyl‑CoA reductase/KAR; hydroxyacyl‑CoA dehydratase/HACD1–4; trans‑2‑enoyl‑CoA reductase/TECR), integrated with high cytosolic NADPH/NADP+ to drive reductions (Kato et al., 2024 JBC; Vaz et al., 2025) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105656 (Feb 2024); https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12734 (May 2025).
- Substrate specificity: Among human ELOVLs, ELOVL5 preferentially elongates C18–C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), working in tandem with ELOVL2 (which extends C20–C22/C24). This positions ELOVL5 as the principal elongase for 18:3n‑3/18:2n‑6–derived intermediates to C20 products (e.g., 20:5n‑3/EPA precursors, 20:4n‑6 AA precursors), and onward toward docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n‑3) via sequential desaturation/elongation (Vaz et al., 2025; Loukil et al., 2024) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11, loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4 (Jun 2024).
- Pathway context with desaturases: Long‑chain PUFA biosynthesis from essential precursors (ALA 18:3n‑3; LA 18:2n‑6) proceeds via alternating desaturation (FADS2 Δ6, FADS1 Δ5) and elongation (ELOVL5, then ELOVL2). Human conversion of dietary ALA to EPA/DHA is limited (~5% to EPA; ~0.5% to DHA, influenced by diet and FADS variation), underscoring the pathway’s tight regulation and substrate competition (Loukil et al., 2024) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3).
- Cellular localization: ELOVL5 functions on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with the ER-resident ELOVL family and the arrangement of the four‑enzyme elongation cycle in ER membranes (wang2023; Vaz et al., 2025) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Mechanistic and structural context for the elongation cycle: 2024 biochemical work refined the catalytic understanding of the terminal reductase step (TECR) and its coordination with ELOVL condensing enzymes during ER VLCFA elongation, supporting the canonical four‑step cycle and the rate‑limiting role of ELOVL enzymes (Kato et al., 2024 JBC) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11). URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105656 (Feb 2024).
- Family‑level updates: A 2023 comprehensive review synthesized isoform‑specific roles: ELOVL5 as a core PUFA‑elongating enzyme with broad human tissue expression (highest in testis/epididymis), regulation intersecting with PPARα, and disease relevance across metabolic, neurologic, and cancer contexts (Wang et al., 2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 4-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-023-01523-7 (Nov 2023).
- Human genetic and nutrigenomic insights: A 2024 scoping review concluded that FADS genetic variants strongly influence circulating EPA/DHA, while evidence for ELOVL polymorphisms remains limited; nevertheless, ELOVL5 is positioned upstream of EPA/DHA synthesis as the principal C18→C20 elongase interacting with FADS1/2 (Loukil et al., 2024) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12263-024-00747-4 (Jun 2024).
- Cancer biology: 2023–2024 literature highlighted elevated ELOVL5 expression and functional roles across cancers. In colorectal cancer, analyses show higher ELOVL5 with co‑upregulation of desaturation/elongation partners (FADS2, TECR), and SNPs near ELOVL5 associated with poor survival in mCRC cohorts (Moon, 2023) (moon2023emergingrolesof pages 5-7). In breast cancer cells, ELOVL5 knockdown modulated PUFA composition and increased sensitivity to ferroptosis, suggesting a role in redox‑lipid homeostasis and therapeutic vulnerability (Nikulin et al., 2023) (nikulin2023elovl5andigfbp6 pages 1-2). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1080/19768354.2023.2189933 (Mar 2023); https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2023.1075704 (Jan 2023).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Nutritional genomics and risk stratification: Given ELOVL5’s place in endogenous EPA/DHA synthesis, population data emphasize that genetic variation in upstream FADS and dietary n‑6/n‑3 ratios constrain conversion, informing dietary recommendations that prioritize direct LC‑PUFA intake (e.g., EPA/DHA) over relying on ALA conversion. The scoping review reports typical conversion estimates (~5% EPA; ~0.5% DHA) and notes substrate competition (high LA) reduces n‑3 LC‑PUFA synthesis—parameters used in nutritional counseling and trial design (Loukil et al., 2024) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3).
- Oncology: PUFA remodeling and ferroptosis. Experimental evidence that lowering ELOVL5 can sensitize breast cancer cells to ferroptosis suggests potential combination strategies with exogenous PUFAs or ferroptosis inducers; although still preclinical, such approaches guide biomarker‑driven trials and combination regimens being explored across tumor types (Nikulin et al., 2023; Moon, 2023) (nikulin2023elovl5andigfbp6 pages 1-2, moon2023emergingrolesof pages 5-7).

Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- The 2023 European Journal of Medical Research review emphasizes ELOVL5’s central role in PUFA elongation, ER localization, and its regulation and disease associations, framing ELOVL5 as a plausible therapeutic target where lipid composition contributes to pathophysiology (Wang et al., 2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 1-2, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 4-5). URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-023-01523-7 (Nov 2023).
- The 2025 JIMD review situates ELOVL5 within inherited disorders of FA homeostasis and clarifies biochemical drivers (malonyl‑CoA, NADPH dependence; ER cycle) and isoform preferences (C18–C20 PUFA for ELOVL5), supporting mechanistic annotations used in clinical genetics and metabolic medicine (Vaz et al., 2025) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11). URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/jimd.12734 (May 2025).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Endogenous n‑3 LC‑PUFA synthesis efficiency: Estimated conversion of ALA to EPA/DHA in humans is low—approximately 5% to EPA and 0.5% to DHA—with variation due to FADS genotypes, sex, age, and dietary LA competition; this contextualizes the metabolic leverage and limitations of ELOVL5 in systemic EPA/DHA status (Loukil et al., 2024) (loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3). 
- Expression landscape: Family‑level surveys report ELOVL5 detected in multiple human tissues, with highest mRNA in testis/epididymis, aligning with tissues enriched in docosapentaenoic acids and reflecting the physiological demand for PUFA elongation during spermatogenesis (Wang et al., 2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 4-5).

Function, substrates, products, and cofactors (concise synthesis)
- Function: ER condensing enzyme initiating two‑carbon elongation of long‑chain PUFAs (EC 2.3.1.199) (Vaz et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2023) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4).
- Substrate specificity: Prefers 18–20 carbon n‑3/n‑6 PUFAs (e.g., 18:3n‑3, 18:2n‑6, 20:4n‑6, 20:5n‑3), producing longer 3‑ketoacyl‑CoAs that are processed to C20/C22 PUFAs (e.g., precursors of AA, EPA; pathway to 22:5n‑3) (Vaz et al., 2025; Loukil et al., 2024) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11, loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3).
- Pathway partners: FADS2 (Δ6), FADS1 (Δ5), ELOVL2 (C20→C24), plus KAR, HACD1–4, TECR (ER elongation steps) (Kato et al., 2024; Vaz et al., 2025) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).
- Cofactors and substrates: Malonyl‑CoA (from ACC1/ACACA) as the C2 donor; reducing equivalents (NADPH) required downstream for KAR/TECR steps; acyl‑CoA substrates provided by FASN and dietary uptake (Vaz et al., 2025) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).
- Localization: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Wang et al., 2023; Vaz et al., 2025) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).

Disease associations and physiology
- Inherited disease: The 2025 JIMD review catalogs ELOVL family gene disorders and notes the specific substrate preference of ELOVL5 but does not detail ELOVL5‑specific Mendelian disease in its excerpt; nonetheless, ELOVL family pathogenic variants establish the clinical relevance of this pathway (Vaz et al., 2025) (vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).
- Cancer: Multiple lines of evidence link ELOVL5 to tumor lipid remodeling and phenotypes—elevated expression in colorectal cancer and other tumors; genetic associations with survival in mCRC cohorts; and functional data in breast cancer indicating roles in ferroptosis susceptibility (Moon, 2023; Nikulin et al., 2023) (moon2023emergingrolesof pages 5-7, nikulin2023elovl5andigfbp6 pages 1-2).
- Immunology and metabolism: Family‑level syntheses highlight ELOVL roles in membrane lipid composition, signaling lipids (eicosanoids/docosanoids), and PPARα‑linked regulation, implying ELOVL5 activity can influence inflammatory and metabolic signaling outputs (Wang et al., 2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 1-2, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 4-5).

Regulation
- Transcriptional/metabolic regulation: Reviews report that ELOVL family members intersect with lipid‑sensing transcription factors, including PPARα and SREBP1c (family‑level), and that PUFA elongation impacts PPARα activity. While isoform‑specific regulatory maps remain incomplete, ELOVL5 has been noted among ELOVLs stimulated by PPARα in some tissues, consistent with its role in fatty acid remodeling (Wang et al., 2023) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 1-2).

Notes on symbol ambiguity and scope
- The collected evidence specifically addresses human ELOVL5 as an ER VLC‑PUFA elongase. No conflicting gene with identical symbol in a different organism was used as the primary basis for claims. Family and domain features, catalytic role, and localization consistently match the UniProt description (Wang et al., 2023; Vaz et al., 2025) (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).

Summary
Human ELOVL5 (Q9NYP7) is an ER-resident condensing enzyme (EC 2.3.1.199) that preferentially elongates 18–20 carbon n‑3/n‑6 PUFAs, operating with FADS1/2 and ELOVL2 to generate LC‑PUFAs including AA/EPA/DPA/DHA precursors. Its activity depends on malonyl‑CoA and NADPH‑driven downstream reductions within the ER elongation cycle. Recent reviews and mechanistic work (2023–2024) consolidate its biochemical role, regulation, and disease relevance. In cancer, ELOVL5 aligns with altered PUFA metabolism and ferroptosis sensitivity, while nutrigenomic evidence underscores constraints on endogenous EPA/DHA production that implicate ELOVL5 within broader genetic and dietary determinants of PUFA status (wang2023acomprehensivereview pages 2-4, loukil2024geneticassociationbetween pages 1-3, moon2023emergingrolesof pages 5-7, nikulin2023elovl5andigfbp6 pages 1-2, vaz2025disordersoffatty pages 9-11).
