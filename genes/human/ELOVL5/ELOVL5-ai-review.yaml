description: ELOVL5 (Very long chain fatty acid elongase 5) is an endoplasmic 
  reticulum membrane-resident enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting 
  condensation step in the elongation of C18-C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
  (PUFAs). It preferentially acts on n-3 and n-6 PUFAs including gamma-linolenic
  acid (18:3n-6), alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3), and arachidonic acid 
  (20:4n-6), adding two carbons per elongation cycle by condensing acyl-CoA 
  substrates with malonyl-CoA. ELOVL5 works in concert with FADS1/FADS2 
  desaturases and ELOVL2 to generate long-chain PUFAs that serve as precursors 
  for membrane phospholipids and eicosanoid/docosanoid lipid mediators. 
  Mutations in ELOVL5 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 38 (SCA38). Recent 
  studies link ELOVL5 to ferroptosis sensitivity through its role in determining
  membrane PUFA composition.

      summary: ELOVL5 is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic 
        reticulum. Multiple studies confirm ER localization including 
        PMID:20937905 showing ER localization in mammalian cells and 
        PMID:25065913 showing wild-type ELOVL5 localizes to the ER in 
        transfection experiments. UniProt describes it as a multi-pass ER 
        membrane protein with seven transmembrane helices.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Well-supported by phylogenetic inference (IBA), consistent with 
        direct experimental evidence from multiple publications and the known 
        biology of the ELOVL enzyme family which functions exclusively in the ER
        elongation cycle.

    review:
      summary: ELOVL5 is a bona fide fatty acid elongase that catalyzes the 
        condensation of acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA (EC 2.3.1.199). This is the 
        first and rate-limiting step of the four-reaction VLCFA elongation

    review:
      summary: While ELOVL1 is specifically linked to C24 sphingolipid synthesis
        (PMID:20937905), ELOVL5 preferentially elongates PUFAs rather than the 
        saturated/monounsaturated fatty acids that are primary sphingolipid 
        precursors. The IBA annotation may reflect broader family-level 
        inference from yeast ELO genes. ELOVL5 contribution to sphingolipid 
        metabolism is indirect at best.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: ELOVL5 substrate specificity is primarily toward PUFAs (C18-C20 
        polyunsaturated), not the saturated/monounsaturated VLCFAs that are 
        incorporated into sphingolipids. PMID:20937905 specifically attributes 
        C24 sphingolipid synthesis to ELOVL1, not ELOVL5. While phylogenetically
        related, functional differentiation of ELOVL family members means this 
        annotation overstates ELOVL5's role.

      summary: While ELOVL5 can elongate some saturated fatty acids, its 
        substrate preference is strongly toward PUFAs. The deep research and 
        UniProt both emphasize PUFA specificity. Saturated FA elongation is 
        primarily performed by ELOVL1, ELOVL3, and ELOVL6.

      reason: ELOVL5 has detectable activity toward some saturated substrates, 
        so the annotation is not incorrect, but this is not the primary

    review:
      summary: This paper studied miR-30c effects on lipid metabolism. siRNA 
        knockdown of ELOVL5 reduced de novo lipogenesis. The IMP annotation 
        suggests ELOVL5 positively regulates fatty acid biosynthesis based on 
        mutant phenotype.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The study shows siELOVL5 reduces lipogenesis (Fig 4g), supporting 
        a positive role in fatty acid biosynthesis. This is consistent with its 
        enzymatic function.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the specific role of ELOVL5-derived PUFAs in membrane 
      lipid composition and ferroptosis sensitivity? Recent studies suggest 
      ELOVL5 knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis. The deep research
      mentions ELOVL5 modulates ferroptosis sensitivity in breast cancer cells 
      (Nikulin et al. 2023).
    experts: []
  - question: What accounts for the selective vulnerability of cerebellar 
      Purkinje cells in SCA38 caused by ELOVL5 mutations? ELOVL5 is ubiquitously
      expressed but mutations specifically cause cerebellar ataxia.
    experts:
      - Brusco A
      - Di Gregorio E
suggested_experiments:
  - hypothesis: ELOVL5 deficiency will reduce incorporation of C20-C22 PUFAs 
      into membrane phospholipids, potentially altering membrane fluidity and 
      susceptibility to oxidative damage.
    description: Lipidomic profiling of membrane phospholipids in ELOVL5 
      knockout/knockdown cells compared to wild-type, with particular attention 
      to PUFA-containing species that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation.
  - hypothesis: Exogenous DHA should bypass the need for ELOVL5-dependent 
      elongation and restore normal membrane lipid composition and cellular 
      function.
    description: Test whether DHA supplementation can rescue ELOVL5 deficiency 
      phenotypes, since ELOVL5 is upstream of DHA synthesis.
