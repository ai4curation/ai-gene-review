## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q92563
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Testican-2; AltName: Full=SPARC/osteonectin, CWCV, and Kazal-like domains proteoglycan 2; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SPOCK2; Synonyms=KIAA0275, TICN2; ORFNames=UNQ269/PRO306;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** EF-hand-dom_pair. (IPR011992); Kazal_dom. (IPR002350); Kazal_dom_sf. (IPR036058); SPARC/Testican_Ca-bd-dom. (IPR019577); Thyroglobulin_1. (IPR000716)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SPOCK2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SPOCK2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SPOCK2** (gene ID: SPOCK2, UniProt: Q92563) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and target verification
- Identity: The target is human SPOCK2 (UniProt Q92563), also known as Testican‑2, a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan precursor of 424 amino acids. Literature and reviews confirm SPOCK2/Testican‑2 nomenclature and human origin (Homo sapiens) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6). Domain architecture matches UniProt/IPR annotations: an N‑terminal signal peptide; a follistatin‑like (FS) domain; a Ca2+‑binding EC domain containing two EF‑hand motifs; a thyroglobulin type‑1 (TY) domain; and a C‑terminal acidic tail with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment/binding sites (heparan/chondroitin sulfate) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms for the sources cited here.

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains: SPOCK2/Testican‑2 is a secreted ECM‑associated proteoglycan with multidomain architecture (FS, EF‑hand pair, TY) and C‑terminal GAG attachment sites. These features place it within the BM‑40/SPARC family of matricellular proteins that bind GAGs and modulate extracellular protease activity and cell–matrix signaling (Review: Molecular Medicine Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4). Ren et al. describe the same domain set and GAG‑attachment in the acidic C‑terminus (Reproductive Sciences, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00197-4) (ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2).
- Primary biochemical class: SPOCK2 is not an enzyme or transporter; it is a secreted proteoglycan that functions as an ECM structural/regulatory component and signaling modulator, notably influencing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) pathways (ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).

2) Function and interaction partners (current understanding)
- MMP axis regulation: Multiple studies indicate SPOCK2 modulates the MT1‑MMP (MMP14)/MMP‑2 axis and downstream MMP‑2 activity.
  • In human endometrial cancer cells, SPOCK2 upregulation inhibited MT1‑MMP and MMP‑2 expression and reduced pro‑MMP‑2 activation, concomitant with reduced invasion/migration (Reproductive Sciences, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00197-4) (ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2, ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 9-9).
  • In a rat neuropathic pain model, SPOCK2 was increased in spinal astrocytes; SPOCK2 interacted with MT1‑MMP and regulated MMP‑2 activation via the SPARC extracellular domain, promoting ERK1/2 activation and IL‑1β production; SPOCK2 knockdown partially relieved pain behaviors (Journal of Neuroinflammation, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-024-03051-5) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2).
  • In human kidney contexts, testican‑2 increased MMP‑2/MMP‑9 activity in glomerular endothelial cell supernatants and enhanced endothelial tube formation/migration in vitro, consistent with ECM protease modulation (PNAS, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 6-7).
- Position in signaling: Through modulation of MT1‑MMP/MMP‑2 and related proteolysis, SPOCK2 influences ECM remodeling, cell invasion/migration, and inflammatory signaling (ERK1/2, IL‑1β in astrocytes), i.e., a matricellular signaling modulator rather than a catalytic enzyme (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2, ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).

3) Localization and post‑translational modifications
- Localization: SPOCK2 is secreted to the extracellular space and integrates with basement membranes and interstitial ECM. In human kidney, immunogold EM localized testican‑2 to podocyte foot processes, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and the GBM–endothelial interface; single‑nucleus RNA‑seq showed SPOCK2 expression confined to podocytes (PNAS, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).
- Proteoglycan features: SPOCK2 carries GAG chains; the protein has C‑terminal GAG attachment/binding sites, consistent with heparan/chondroitin sulfate decoration typical of SPOCK/testican family members (Review, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355; Ren 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00197-4) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4, ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2).

4) Pathways and processes with quantitative evidence
- Kidney podocyte biology and vascular crosstalk:
  • Physiology: In renal arteriovenous sampling of 22 individuals, arterial‑to‑renal‑venous gradients showed testican‑2 increases across the kidney, indicating renal release; circulating testican‑2 was positively associated with eGFR in two cohorts (JHS n=1,928; FHS n=1,621) and with slower eGFR decline (JHS slope β=0.38, P=4.8×10⁻⁶; FHS β=0.45, P=1.1×10⁻¹⁵). In participants with baseline eGFR ≥60, higher testican‑2 associated with lower incident CKD risk (JHS OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.90, P=0.005; FHS HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–1.00, P=0.046). Functionally, testican‑2 increased HGE cell tube formation and migration in vitro, additively with VEGF (PNAS, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 6-7).
- Cancer biology (ECM remodeling):
  • Endometrial cancer: SPOCK2 overexpression reduced invasion/migration and MT1‑MMP/MMP‑2 expression/activation (Reproductive Sciences, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00197-4) (ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2, ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 9-9).
  • High‑grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC): SPOCK2 upregulated vs. normal; diagnostic AUC 0.894 (CI 0.865–0.923); high SPOCK2 associated with shorter OS (HR 1.45, P=0.005); correlated with ECM/focal adhesion pathways and distinct immune infiltration patterns (Frontiers in Genetics, 2022; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.878123) (jiao2022clinicalsignificanceof pages 9-12).
  • Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD): EZH2 epigenetically represses SPOCK2; EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (1–2 μM) restored SPOCK2 mRNA/protein; SPOCK2 overexpression suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion in A549/HCC827, and slowed tumor growth in vivo (Human Cell, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13577-023-00855-0) (liu2023spock2andspred1 pages 4-7).
- Neuroinflammation/neuropathic pain:
  • In rat CCI, SPOCK2 was upregulated in spinal astrocytes, interacted with MT1‑MMP to regulate MMP‑2 activation, and promoted ERK1/2 and IL‑1β; siRNA against SPOCK2 alleviated pain hypersensitivity (Journal of Neuroinflammation, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-024-03051-5) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2).

5) Recent developments and applications (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Epigenetic targeting in LUAD: SPOCK2 and SPRED1 are repressed by EZH2; pharmacologic EZH2 inhibition (tazemetostat) restored SPOCK2 expression and anticancer phenotypes in vitro/in vivo, suggesting a therapeutic avenue to re‑engage SPOCK2’s tumor‑suppressive ECM signaling (Human Cell, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13577-023-00855-0) (liu2023spock2andspred1 pages 4-7).
- Neuropathic pain mechanism: Astrocytic SPOCK2‑MT1‑MMP interaction upstream of MMP‑2/ERK1/2/IL‑1β points to a glial ECM‑signaling axis as a potential modulator of pain; SPOCK2 knockdown reduced pain in vivo (Journal of Neuroinflammation, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-024-03051-5) (wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2).
- Kidney biomarker and podocyte biology: Circulating testican‑2 serves as a podocyte‑derived marker of kidney health with strong, reproducible associations with eGFR slope and incident CKD across cohorts, motivating its use in renal risk stratification (PNAS, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5).

6) Expert opinions and reviews
- A 2024 narrative review synthesizes SPOCK family structure and function, emphasizing SPOCK2’s secreted proteoglycan identity, domain architecture (FS, EF‑hand, TY) and participation in ECM and neurodevelopmental contexts; it notes tissue enrichment in lung, brain, kidney, and potential cathepsin interactions via TY domain by analogy within the family (Molecular Medicine Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4).

7) Tissue and cell‑type expression maps
- Kidney: snRNA‑seq shows SPOCK2 expression restricted to podocytes in healthy human kidney; protein localizes to podocyte foot processes and GBM by EM/IHC (PNAS, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).
- Broader tissues: Review notes relatively high expression in lung and detectable levels in brain, adrenal gland, kidney, lymphoid tissues, testes, consistent with a widely expressed ECM proteoglycan with tissue‑specific roles (Molecular Medicine Reports, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2024.13355) (xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4).

Conclusions and knowledge gaps
- Primary role: SPOCK2/Testican‑2 is a secreted proteoglycan that modulates ECM protease activity (MT1‑MMP/MMP‑2) and cell–matrix signaling. It is not an enzyme or transporter; rather, it acts as a matricellular regulator at the extracellular face of cells where it is deposited (ren2020spock2affectsthe pages 1-2, wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).
- Location: Extracellular/ECM and basement membranes, exemplified in human glomerulus (podocyte foot processes and GBM) (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5, ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 5-6).
- Pathways: ECM remodeling and endothelial–podocyte crosstalk in kidney; ECM‑dependent invasion and immune interactions in cancers; glial ECM‑signaling in neuropathic pain (ngo2020circulatingtestican2is pages 3-5, jiao2022clinicalsignificanceof pages 9-12, liu2023spock2andspred1 pages 4-7, wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2).
- 2023–2024 highlights: EZH2–SPOCK2 axis in LUAD provides a mechanistic and therapeutic entry point; astrocytic SPOCK2–MT1‑MMP–MMP‑2–ERK–IL‑1β axis in neuropathic pain suggests new targets; review consolidates SPOCK2 structure and tissue distribution (liu2023spock2andspred1 pages 4-7, wang2024spock2modulatesneuropathic pages 1-2, xiao2024spockmasterregulator pages 2-4).
- Open questions: Precise in vivo substrates/partners across tissues; structural basis of MT1‑MMP binding; GAG chain composition and its regulation; whether modulating SPOCK2 therapeutically is safe/effective in humans.
