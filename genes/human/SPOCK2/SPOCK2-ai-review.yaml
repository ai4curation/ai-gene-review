description: 'SPOCK2 (testican-2) is a secreted calcium-binding proteoglycan highly expressed
  in brain that contains chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan
  chains. It has a modular domain structure comprising a follistatin-like domain,
  EC calcium-binding domain, Kazal-like domain, and thyroglobulin type-1 domain. Unlike
  other testican family members (testican-1/SPOCK1 and testican-3/SPOCK3) which inhibit
  membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), testican-2 uniquely abrogates
  this inhibition by binding to and inactivating other testican proteins, thereby
  promoting cell motility and ECM remodeling. Calcium binding was experimentally demonstrated
  through reversible calcium-dependent conformational changes. SPOCK2 participates
  in neurogenesis and is widely expressed in multiple neuronal cell types throughout
  the CNS, with additional expression in lung and testis. Core functions include
  ECM organization, calcium ion binding, modulation of cell-substrate adhesion, and
  regulation of metalloendopeptidase activity through a unique mechanism of counter-inhibition.'

    summary: SPOCK2 is a secreted proteoglycan that localizes to the extracellular
      matrix. UniProt annotation confirms "Secreted, extracellular space, extracellular
      matrix" and PMID:10386950 describes it as an ECM proteoglycan. This is a core
      cellular component annotation for SPOCK2.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported ECM localization by both phylogenetic inference (IBA) and
      experimental evidence. This represents the primary subcellular localization
      of this secreted proteoglycan and is essential for its biological function.

  review:
    summary: This annotation requires careful consideration. While SPOCK2 contains
      a Kazal-like domain (known for protease inhibition), PMID:12810672 shows that
      testican-2 uniquely LACKS the MT-MMP inhibitory activity of other testican
      family members. Instead, it acts as a counter-inhibitor by binding to and inactivating
      other testicans that DO inhibit metalloendopeptidases. The Kazal domain may
      retain some direct inhibitory activity, but the dominant biological function
      is abrogating inhibition by other testicans.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term is misleading because it suggests direct metalloendopeptidase
      inhibition as the primary function. However, PMID:12810672 demonstrates that
      SPOCK2's unique role is to ABOLISH inhibition of MT-MMPs by binding to other
      testican family members. A more accurate annotation would be "negative regulation
      of endopeptidase activity" or "regulation of metalloendopeptidase activity"
      to capture this counter-regulatory function.

    summary: SPOCK2 modulates cell-substrate adhesion through its effects on the ECM

      promotes cell motility on collagen by abrogating the inhibitory effects of

  review:
    summary: SPOCK2 is a secreted protein that localizes to the extracellular space,

      localization. This is accurate but somewhat redundant with the more specific
      GO:0031012 (extracellular matrix) annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct localization annotation supported by phylogenetic inference and

  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning is based on the Kazal-like

      studies show that testican-2 LACKS the MT-MMP inhibitory activity characteristic
      of other testican family members and instead acts as a counter-inhibitor.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Same issue as the IBA annotation for GO:0008191. The computational prediction
      is reasonable based on domain content but contradicts experimental evidence
      showing SPOCK2's unique counter-inhibitory function. Should be replaced with
      regulatory terms.

  review:
    summary: SPOCK2 IS a proteoglycan with chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate
      GAG chains attached. However, "glycosaminoglycan binding" suggests binding
      to GAGs as ligands rather than CARRYING GAGs as post-translational modifications.
      UniProt states SPOCK2 "Contains chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate O-linked
      oligosaccharides" indicating it IS a GAG-modified proteoglycan.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term is misleading. SPOCK2 is not primarily a GAG-binding protein
      but rather a GAG-carrying proteoglycan. The more appropriate annotation would
      be related to proteoglycan core protein function or ECM structural molecule
      activity. While SPOCK2 may have some GAG-binding activity, the dominant characteristic
      is being a proteoglycan itself.

    action: REMOVE

      function common to other testican family members and instead ABOLISHES inhibition
      of MT-MMPs. This appears to be a mis-curation.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The cited paper PMID:12810672 demonstrates the opposite - that testican-2
      uniquely lacks MT-MMP inhibitory activity and instead acts as a counter-inhibitor.
      This is a clear example of mis-annotation where the evidence actually contradicts

    reason: While SPOCK2 is highly expressed in brain and may contribute to neurogenesis,
      there is no direct experimental evidence for synapse assembly specifically.
      The NAS evidence code indicates this is inferred from expression pattern and

      there is no direct experimental evidence for regulation of cell differentiation.

    supporting_text: 'The inhibitory function is common among testican family members
      except for testican 2, which was shown to uniquely abolish inhibition of MT1-MMP-
      or MT3-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation by other testican family members.'

    supporting_text: 'Migration of U251 cells on collagen, which was dependent on
      MT1-MMP activity under serum-free condition, was inhibited by N-Tes or N-Tes-Delta
      122 deposited on collagen. Binding of testican 2 to N-Tes deposited on collagen
      allowed migration of cells expressing MT1-MMP.'
