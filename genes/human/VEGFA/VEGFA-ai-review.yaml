description: 'VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A) is the master regulator
  of angiogenesis. CRITICAL ISOFORM BIOLOGY: Alternative splicing produces 17 isoforms
  with diverse functions: (1) Most isoforms (VEGF121/165/189/206) are PRO-ANGIOGENIC,
  differing in heparin binding and matrix association - VEGF121 is freely diffusible
  while VEGF189/206 are matrix-bound; (2) VEGF165B (P15692-8) is ANTI-ANGIOGENIC -
  it binds VEGFR2 but does NOT activate downstream signaling and INHIBITS tumor growth
  [PMID:15520188]. All current GOA annotations are for positive angiogenesis regulation
  - MISSING the anti-angiogenic VEGF165B function. This is a case where isoforms have
  qualitatively different (even opposite) biological effects.'

    review:
      summary: VEGFA binds to both VEGFR1 (FLT1) and VEGFR2 (KDR) receptors. 
        This is a core molecular function shared by all VEGFA isoforms including
        VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, VEGF206, and VEGF165B. The UniProt entry 
        explicitly states binding to FLT1/VEGFR1 and KDR/VEGFR2 receptors. 
        Importantly, even the anti-angiogenic VEGF165B isoform binds to 
        KDR/VEGFR2, though it does not activate downstream signaling. The deep 
        research confirms VEGFA binds to VEGFR1 with approximately 50-fold 
        higher affinity than VEGFR2 [VEGFA-deep-research-perplexity.md].
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Core molecular function of VEGFA. All isoforms bind VEGF 
        receptors, making this annotation universally applicable to the gene

  - name: L-VEGF189
    id: P15692-13
    description: >-
      Long form with extended N-terminus. Has intracellular functions in addition
      to secreted
      VEGF activities. The L-VEGF forms may have distinct nuclear/intracellular signaling
      roles.
  - name: VEGF206
    id: P15692-1
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061898
    description: >-
      The longest secreted isoform (206 AA). Strongly heparin-binding and matrix-bound.
      Produces dense, localized vascular sprouting patterns. Less diffusible than
      shorter isoforms.
  - name: VEGF189
    id: P15692-2
    sequence_note: VSP_061891
    description: >-
      A strongly heparin-binding, matrix-bound isoform (189 AA). Sequestered in extracellular
      matrix and released by proteases. Produces localized angiogenic effects. Important
      for
      establishing vascular patterning gradients.
  - name: VEGF183
    id: P15692-3
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061897
    description: >-
      An intermediate heparin-binding isoform. Properties intermediate between VEGF165
      and
      VEGF189.
  - name: VEGF165 (VEGF)
    id: P15692-4
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061894
    description: >-
      The predominant and best-characterized isoform (165 AA). Intermediate heparin
      binding
      and diffusibility. Binds both VEGFR1/VEGFR2 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1) coreceptor.
      This is
      the canonical pro-angiogenic isoform that most GO annotations refer to. Target
      of
      anti-VEGF therapies (bevacizumab).
  - name: VEGF148
    id: P15692-5
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061894, VSP_061901,
    description: >-
      A less common isoform with intermediate properties. Functional role less well
      characterized
      than VEGF165.
  - name: VEGF145
    id: P15692-6
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061899, VSP_061900
    description: >-
      An isoform with heparin-binding properties. Binds VEGFR2 but not neuropilins.
      Found in
      reproductive tissues and some tumors.
  - name: VEGF165B
    id: P15692-8
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061894, VSP_061903
    description: >-
      CRITICAL: An ANTI-angiogenic isoform! Uses distal splice site in exon 8 (exon
      8b) producing
      an alternative C-terminus. Binds VEGFR2 but does NOT activate downstream signaling
      for
      angiogenesis. Acts as endogenous inhibitor of pro-angiogenic VEGF isoforms.
      Downregulated
      in cancer, upregulated in quiescent vasculature. GO annotations for "positive
      regulation
      of angiogenesis" do NOT apply to this isoform - it has the OPPOSITE function.
  - name: VEGF121
    id: P15692-9
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061895, VSP_061896
    description: >-
      The shortest secreted isoform (121 AA). Freely diffusible, lacks heparin-binding
      domain.
      Does not bind neuropilins. Produces diffuse vascular networks. Important for
      long-range
      angiogenic signaling.
  - name: VEGF111
    id: P15692-10
    sequence_note: VSP_061891, VSP_061892, VSP_061893
