# Comprehensive Functional Annotation of VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)

VEGFA, located on human chromosome 6p21.1, encodes vascular endothelial growth factor A, a critical secreted signaling protein that serves as the master regulator of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis across virtually all physiological and pathological contexts.[1][3] This dimeric growth factor exists as multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing, ranging from 121 to 206 amino acids in length, each conferring distinct bioavailability and biological potency through differential interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the extracellular matrix.[2][7][32] VEGFA functions primarily as a ligand for two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, though it also engages the non-kinase co-receptor neuropilin-1, thereby orchestrating complex intracellular signaling cascades that promote endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration, and increased vascular permeability.[3][4][13] The protein contains a characteristic cystine-knot motif stabilized by multiple interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds, conferring remarkable structural stability even under hypoxic conditions where oxygen availability is severely compromised.[11][19] Beyond its well-established role as a paracrine angiogenic factor, VEGFA is increasingly recognized as functioning in intracrine signaling pathways within multiple cell types including cancer cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and various macrophage populations, where nuclear-localized VEGFA and its receptors directly regulate gene expression, cell survival, and metabolic homeostasis.[48] This multifaceted protein exemplifies how alternative splicing and spatial compartmentalization of signaling create a single gene product capable of executing distinct biological functions appropriate to specific developmental, regenerative, and pathological contexts.

## Gene Structure and Chromosomal Organization

The VEGFA gene spans a 16.3 kilobase coding region located at chromosome 6p21.1 on the short arm of the human genome, organized into eight exons separated by seven introns.[43] This compact genomic organization belies the remarkable diversity of VEGFA protein isoforms that can be generated from the single gene through multiple mechanisms of alternative splicing. The gene structure reflects evolutionary conservation of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family, with sequence homology particularly evident in the regions encoding the critical cystine-knot motif and receptor-binding domains.[1] The location on chromosome 6 places VEGFA within a gene-rich region, and the genomic sequence has been characterized at high resolution through multiple reference genome assemblies including GRCh38.p14 and alternate T2T-CHM13v2.0 assemblies.[1] Beyond the constitutive elements of the gene, the regulatory landscape encompasses promoter regions responsive to multiple environmental signals including hypoxia, inflammatory cytokines, and growth factors, ensuring that VEGFA expression can be rapidly induced or suppressed in response to tissue-specific demands. The identification of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the VEGFA locus has revealed significant associations with circulating VEGF-A levels and cardiovascular disease risk, indicating that genetic variation at this locus modulates both baseline VEGF expression and individual susceptibility to vascular disorders.[43]

## Protein Structure and Cystine-Knot Motif

The VEGFA monomer adopts a distinctive three-dimensional structure anchored by a cystine-knot motif, a structural feature shared with other members of the PDGF/VEGF cytokine superfamily including platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor beta.[22][31] The cystine knot consists of three disulfide bonds arranged in a topologically unique manner: the first two disulfide bridges form an eight-residue ring, through which a third disulfide bond passes, creating the characteristic knot-like topology.[22][31] Specifically, in VEGF these disulfide bonds occur between cysteines at positions 57-102, 61-104, and 26-68, with the latter passing through the ring formed by the first two.[22] This structural motif provides exceptional stability to the VEGF monomer and is essential for subsequent dimerization and receptor engagement. The VEGFA protein forms antiparallel homodimers covalently linked by two additional interchain disulfide bridges between cysteine residues 51 and 60 of each monomer, creating a molecule with approximate molecular weight of 46 kilodaltons.[22][31] Around this cystine-knot core, the VEGFA monomer contains a central four-stranded beta sheet extending from residues that form part of the receptor-binding interface.[22] The monomer structure includes an N-terminal alpha helix, which distinguishes VEGFA from PDGF and contributes to the larger buried surface area at the dimer interface compared to other cystine-knot family members.[22] This structural organization creates two symmetrical receptor-binding sites located at opposite poles of the homodimer, allowing simultaneous engagement of two VEGFR dimers and enabling the formation of higher-order signaling complexes.[22][31]

The structural stability conferred by the cystine-knot motif proves particularly important for VEGFA function under hypoxic conditions. Recent evidence demonstrates that VEGFA can efficiently complete disulfide bond formation and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum even in the absence of sufficient oxygen, unlike many other growth factors and structural proteins that become misfolded under hypoxia.[19] This oxygen-independent disulfide bond formation capability reflects selective evolutionary pressure on hypoxia-induced proteins to maintain functionality when oxygen is severely limited, suggesting that the compact disulfide architecture of VEGFA represents an adaptation for expression during the hypoxic conditions that characterize developing tissues and ischemic regions.[19] The protein contains an N-linked glycan as part of its core structure, and additional post-translational modifications including glycosylation at multiple sites throughout the molecule are essential for proper folding, secretion, and biological activity.[20] These structural features create a remarkably stable growth factor capable of maintaining signaling function across diverse physiological contexts.

## Alternative Splicing and Isoform Diversity

The VEGFA gene encodes a remarkable diversity of protein isoforms through alternative splicing of exons 5, 6, 7, and 8, creating two major families of proteins with profoundly different biological properties.[2][7][57] Differential splicing of exons 6 and 7 generates the main VEGF family of proangiogenic isoforms, which exist as VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, corresponding to their amino acid lengths.[2][7][57] VEGF121 arises from skipping both exons 6 and 7 and represents the shortest proangiogenic form, existing as a weakly acidic polypeptide that lacks fifteen basic amino acids within the forty-four residues encoded by exon 7.[7][57] This shorter form is freely diffusible and does not bind to heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, resulting in unrestricted diffusion from cells and minimal accumulation in the extracellular matrix.[7][32] In contrast, VEGF165, produced when exon 7 is retained but exon 6 is skipped, possesses a basic cluster of amino acids within its carboxyl terminus encoded by exon 7, conferring intermediate heparin-binding affinity.[7][32] This intermediate property of VEGF165 appears to represent an optimal balance between bioavailability and receptor engagement, as mice expressing only VEGF164 (the mouse ortholog) develop normally, suggesting this isoform achieves the "perfect balance" between diffusibility and heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding.[32]

The longer isoforms VEGF189 and VEGF206 retain exon 6, which encodes a twenty-four amino acid insertion highly enriched in arginine and lysine residues, creating highly basic proteins with extremely high affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans.[7][32] Consequently, VEGF189 and VEGF206 are predominantly sequestered in the extracellular matrix and cell surface rather than secreted into the soluble fraction, functioning as storage forms of VEGF that must be proteolytically processed by plasmin, matrix metalloproteinases, or other proteases to be released as bioactive, freely diffusible fragments.[32] This isoform-specific storage mechanism creates a spatial gradient of VEGF bioavailability, with diffusible shorter isoforms providing dynamic angiogenic signaling while matrix-bound longer isoforms serve as readily mobilizable reserves that can be activated during tissue remodeling or upon demand.[32] The differential expression of VEGF isoforms varies by tissue type and developmental stage, with longer isoforms predominating in certain tissues such as normal lung tissue, while shorter isoforms become relatively enriched in cancer and during pathological angiogenesis.[57]

Beyond the primary family of proangiogenic isoforms, alternative splice-site selection within exon 8 generates an entirely different class of proteins termed VEGF165b, VEGF121b, and related antiangiogenic variants.[2][7][38] Alternative splicing at the 3' end of exon 8 produces two mutually exclusive exon sequences: exon 8a encoding cysteine-aspartate-lysine-proline-arginine-arginine and exon 8b encoding serine-leucine-threonine-arginine-lysine-aspartate.[7] These six C-terminal amino acid differences confer radically different functional properties, with VEGF165b and other VEGFxxxb isoforms demonstrating antiangiogenic activity that opposes the proangiogenic effects of their conventional VEGF165 and VEGFxxx counterparts.[2][38] The antiangiogenic isoforms are expressed at elevated levels in normal, quiescent tissues but become dramatically downregulated in angiogenic diseases including cancer, proliferative retinopathy, and developmental pathologies such as preeclampsia and Denys-Drash syndrome.[2][38] These observations suggest that the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic VEGF isoforms may represent a fundamental regulatory mechanism controlling angiogenic potential, with loss of antiangiogenic isoforms contributing to pathological angiogenesis in disease states.

## VEGF Receptor Structure and Binding Interactions

VEGFA exerts its biological effects primarily through two receptor tyrosine kinases designated VEGFR1 (also known as Flt-1 or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1) and VEGFR2 (also known as KDR or kinase domain region), though it also engages co-receptors including neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2.[3][6][13] Both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases belonging to the split kinase domain family of receptors, featuring seven immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, a single transmembrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain containing a split tyrosine kinase.[6][13][14] The extracellular portions of both receptors, particularly the immunoglobulin-like domains 2 and 3 (IgD2 and IgD3), provide the primary VEGF-binding surfaces.[14][17] Despite structural similarity, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 differ substantially in their functional consequences when activated by VEGF: VEGFR1 binds VEGF-A with approximately 50-fold higher affinity than VEGFR2, yet exhibits only weak tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells upon VEGF-induced dimerization, resulting in minimal activation of downstream angiogenic signaling.[6][30] In contrast, VEGFR2 demonstrates more robust tyrosine phosphorylation upon VEGF engagement and mediates essentially all of the characterized pro-angiogenic responses to VEGF in endothelial cells, including proliferation, survival, migration, and vascular permeability.[3][6][13][14]

This apparent paradox of higher binding affinity paired with weaker signaling at VEGFR1 is resolved through understanding the distinct biological roles of these receptors: VEGFR1 functions primarily as a negative regulator of VEGFR2 signaling during early vascular development, and can function as a decoy receptor sequestering VEGF from VEGFR2 engagement.[6][30] A soluble splice variant of VEGFR1 designated sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) is secreted and functions as a circulating VEGF trap, effectively neutralizing circulating VEGF and preventing its interaction with cell surface VEGFR2.[6][30] This regulatory mechanism becomes physiologically critical during pregnancy, where the balance between circulating VEGF-A and sFlt-1 determines vascular permeability and endothelial function; dysregulation of this balance contributes to preeclampsia pathogenesis.[6] A third VEGF receptor designated VEGFR3 mediates responses to VEGF-C and VEGF-D but does not serve as a VEGF-A ligand, instead functioning in lymphangiogenesis.[6]

The co-receptor neuropilin-1 dramatically enhances VEGF signaling through mechanisms that remained incompletely understood until recent research clarified its role. VEGF165, the predominant isoform, binds to neuropilin-1 through its heparin-binding domain encoded by exon 7, whereas the shorter VEGF121 isoform, lacking exon 7, does not bind neuropilin-1.[8][9][12] The crystal structure of neuropilin-1 b1b2 domains in complex with a VEGF-derived peptide revealed that the basic tail of VEGF165 interacts directly with acidic residues on the neuropilin-1 b1 domain, with heparin serving as a critical bridge molecule that enhances the interaction between VEGF, neuropilin-1, and the extracellular matrix.[8][9] Surprisingly, recent genetic evidence demonstrates that neuropilin-1 promotes angiogenesis not primarily through enhancing VEGF binding, but rather through functioning as a co-receptor that regulates cell surface expression and trafficking of VEGFR2.[12] Specifically, neuropilin-1 guides internalized VEGFR2 from lysosomal degradation pathways into Rab11-positive recycling vesicles, thereby stabilizing VEGFR2 at the cell surface and amplifying VEGFR2-VEGF signaling.[12] This co-receptor function explains how neuropilin-1 can regulate angiogenesis even when direct VEGF-neuropilin-1 binding is disrupted, establishing neuropilin-1 as a critical regulator of endothelial cell responsiveness to VEGF rather than solely a ligand-binding protein.

## VEGFR2 Signaling Pathways and Downstream Effectors

Upon VEGF-A binding and VEGFR2 dimerization, the receptor undergoes rapid autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues within its intracellular domains, with each phosphorylation site serving as a docking platform for specific signaling adaptor proteins that initiate distinct downstream cascades.[14][17] The juxtamembrane domain tyrosine Y801 undergoes phosphorylation as part of the activation mechanism, where in its unphosphorylated state this domain physically interacts with the kinase domain activation loop in an autoinhibitory configuration.[14] Phosphorylation at Y801 relieves this autoinhibition, allowing the kinase domain to adopt an active conformation capable of transphosphorylating additional tyrosine residues.[14] Within the kinase domain proper, phosphorylation at Y951 and Y1054/Y1059 further enhance kinase catalytic activity, while the C-terminal domain contains critical sites at Y1175 and Y1214 that recruit specific effector proteins.[14][17]

The phosphorylated Y1175 residue recruits phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ) through its SH2 domain, initiating the PLCγ-PKC-MAPK pathway that represents the predominant pro-proliferative signal in endothelial cells.[13][14][17][25] PLCγ activation catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), leading to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and elevation of intracellular calcium concentration.[13][17] PKC then activates the Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription factors that induce gene expression required for endothelial cell DNA synthesis and proliferation.[13][17] Notably, analysis of VEGF-A isoforms reveals that different isoforms differentially activate this critical Y1175-PLCγ pathway, with VEGF165 inducing much greater ERK1/2 phosphorylation than VEGF121, suggesting that isoform-specific differences in signaling capacity may explain their distinct biological potencies.[2] The differential coupling to this pathway operates through variations in receptor phosphorylation kinetics, with VEGF165 stimulation of endothelial cells producing greater and more sustained VEGFR2 Y1175 phosphorylation compared to VEGF121.[2]

Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y951 within the kinase insert domain initiates the TSAd-Src-PI3K-Akt pathway, which is essential for endothelial cell survival.[13][14][17] Src-family kinases are recruited to phosphorylated Y951 and subsequently activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which catalyzes the conversion of PIP2 to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).[14][17] PIP3 then recruits and activates protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), which phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pro-apoptotic proteins including BAD (BCL2-associated agonist of cell death) and caspase-9, ensuring endothelial cell survival under VEGF stimulation.[14][17] This survival signal proves critical for maintaining vascular integrity and preventing endothelial cell loss under stress conditions. Additionally, Y951-mediated PI3K-Akt activation contributes to vascular permeability through parallel mechanisms including Rac1 GTPase activation and reactive oxygen species production.[33]

Phosphorylation at Y1214 recruits the NCK adaptor protein and initiates signaling through p38 MAPK and downstream MAPKAPK2/3 kinases, leading to actin remodeling and endothelial cell migration essential for angiogenic sprouting.[14][17][51] This pathway also involves activation of small GTPases including Rac and Cdc42, which orchestrate cytoskeletal reorganization required for directed cell movement.[14][51] The Y1175 site also recruits SHB adaptor protein, linking to FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and paxillin through a separate signaling axis that modulates focal adhesion turnover and cellular motility.[14] Collectively, these multiple phosphorylation sites on VEGFR2 enable the single VEGF ligand to activate multiple distinct signaling pathways within a single cell, allowing VEGF to simultaneously promote proliferation, survival, and migration—the three key endothelial functions required for effective angiogenesis.

Recent evidence has identified an additional layer of complexity in VEGFR2 signaling through the discovery that integrin αvβ3 can directly bind the heparin-binding domain of VEGF165, and that this integrin-VEGF interaction regulates VEGFR2 signaling.[35] Specifically, binding sites for integrin αvβ3 and VEGFR2 domain 1 overlap within the heparin-binding domain of VEGF165, suggesting that these two receptors compete for VEGF binding at this site.[35] The functional consequence of αvβ3 binding to VEGF165 is suppression of KDR domain 1 binding and reduced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, indicating that integrin αvβ3 can function as a negative regulator of VEGF signaling through competitive receptor binding.[35]

## Biological Functions in Angiogenesis and Vasculogenesis

VEGF-A functions as the master regulator of angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vasculature, and vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels from vascular progenitor cells, across all developmental and adult contexts.[52] During embryonic development, VEGF is initially expressed at high levels in the yolk sac and at embryonic sites of vessel formation, supporting the assembly of the cardiovascular system beginning around embryonic day 7.5 to 8.0 in mice.[49][52] The spatial localization of VEGF expression in the anterior mesoderm and its co-localization with VEGFR-expressing cells in posterior regions establishes a chemotactic gradient guiding vascular progenitor cell migration from posterior developmental regions toward anterior embryonic structures including the developing heart and forebrain.[49] This gradient-dependent cell migration represents a critical early step in cardiovascular morphogenesis, as inhibition of VEGFR signaling during this window substantially impairs the accumulation and migration of VEGFR-positive cells to their destination tissues.[49]

The process of vasculogenic tubulogenesis—the transformation of solid aggregates of endothelial progenitors (angioblasts) into patent blood vessels—depends absolutely on VEGFR2 signaling, as demonstrated by the embryonic lethality of VEGFR2 null mice at approximately embryonic day 8.5.[52] The development of a functional vascular network proceeds through distinct stages, beginning with the formation of primitive vascular plexuses that subsequently undergo sprouting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling to establish a hierarchical organization of vessels of varying diameters and functions.[44] VEGF initiates sprouting angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms: it stimulates endothelial cell proliferation through the PLCγ-PKC-MAPK pathway, promotes directed migration of endothelial cells through Rac1 and Cdc42-mediated actin remodeling, and increases vascular permeability to facilitate plasma protein extravasation and infiltration of supporting cells.[3][4][51] The temporal progression of VEGF expression during wound healing illustrates this multifaceted role: VEGF levels are dramatically upregulated 3-7 days post-wounding, the proliferative phase of repair during which capillary growth and differentiation peak, and VEGF neutralization with blocking antibodies substantially diminishes both chemotactic and angiogenic properties of wound fluid.[58]

The formation of vascular lumens, the hollow centers through which blood flows, involves specialized VEGF-mediated signaling and endothelial cell polarization mechanisms. During lumen formation, VEGF-activated endothelial cells must undergo dramatic morphological changes including actin remodeling, vesicle-mediated trafficking to the luminal membrane, and junctional reorganization to establish the inside versus outside orientation of developing vessels.[44] This process appears to involve multiple mechanisms coordinating simultaneously: Rab7-directed vectorial transport of vesicles to expand the developing lumen at the cord center, and concurrent redistribution of junctional proteins away from the cord center to preserve peripheral cell-cell contacts while creating a hollow channel.[44] The importance of endothelial cell polarity is evidenced by studies showing that loss of β1 integrin, which disrupts Par3 localization and endothelial polarity, results in accumulation of cytosolic Rab7+ vesicles and failure of vascular lumen formation despite apparently normal early vasculogenesis.[44]

## VEGF Secretion, Trafficking, and Subcellular Localization

VEGF-A contains an N-terminal signal sequence targeting it to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where the nascent protein undergoes rapid dimerization through disulfide bond formation and co-translational oxidation.[20] The trafficking of VEGF from the endoplasmic reticulum through the secretory pathway to the cell surface requires specific small GTPases: Sar1 and Arf1 regulate VEGF165 movement between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, while post-Golgi transport depends critically on N-linked glycosylation, a modification occurring within the Golgi compartment.[20] These early secretory steps can be regulated by signaling pathways; phorbol ester-induced protein kinase C activation, for instance, promotes VEGF165 secretion by increasing the flux through the entire secretory pathway, while the effect appears sensitive to intracellular calcium elevation.[20] A striking feature of VEGF165 trafficking is that a substantial fraction of the protein localizes to the outer surface of the plasma membrane in a punctate, string-like pattern rather than being immediately secreted into the surrounding medium.[20] From this plasma membrane location, approximately 50% of VEGF165-GFP undergoes shedding from the cell surface in association with membrane vesicles and other membrane components, suggesting a mechanism for regulated release of VEGF into the immediate microenvironment.[20]

Beneath the well-characterized extracellular functions of VEGF lies an emerging role for intracellular VEGF signaling termed intracrine signaling, wherein VEGF functions as a signaling molecule within cells without prior secretion.[48] Nuclear-localized VEGF and VEGFR2 have been detected in multiple cell types including endothelial cells, cancer cells, and hematopoietic cells, and evidence suggests these intracellular receptors participate in direct regulation of nuclear gene expression and metabolic homeostasis.[48] In cultured endothelial cells, VEGF knockdown results not in classical markers of apoptosis such as cleaved caspase-3, but rather in dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation accompanied by reduced metabolic activity and depressed mitochondrial function, suggesting intracrine VEGF maintains normal cellular metabolism through mitochondrial regulation.[48] In cancer cells including acute myeloid leukemia cells, a pool of VEGFR1 localizes to the nucleus rather than the cell surface, and neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies reduce nuclear VEGFR2 localization while shifting it toward the cell surface, indicating that autocrine VEGF released within cells promotes nuclear localization of its receptors.[48] The specific mechanisms by which nuclear-localized VEGF and VEGFR regulate transcription remain to be fully elucidated, but evidence suggests non-kinase functions of intracellular VEGFR1 may be involved, as some effects cannot be blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.[48] These intracrine functions expand the biological scope of VEGF beyond its classical role as a paracrine angiogenic factor, establishing it as a regulator of fundamental cellular processes including energy metabolism and survival.

## Regulation of VEGF Expression

VEGF-A gene expression is regulated by multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms responsive to physiological and pathological signals. Hypoxia represents perhaps the most important physiological regulator of VEGF expression, acting through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway wherein low oxygen tension stabilizes HIF-1α protein, which heterodimerizes with HIF-1β and directly binds to hypoxia response elements in the VEGFA promoter region.[21] However, VEGF regulation in certain contexts proceeds through HIF-1-independent pathways, as evidenced by studies showing that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, VEGF expression remains substantially elevated even when HIF-1α is genetically suppressed, with this HIF-1-independent expression controlled by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and transcription factor SP1.[21] This pathway diversity ensures that VEGF can be rapidly mobilized under conditions of metabolic stress regardless of the specific mechanism triggering cellular adaptation.

Genetic variation at the VEGFA locus, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene sequence or regulatory regions, influences baseline VEGF-A levels and individual susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and other vascular disorders.[43] Multiple VEGFA SNPs including rs6921438, rs4416670, rs6993770, and rs10738760 distributed across three chromosomes have been associated with circulating VEGF-A levels, collectively explaining up to 52% of the variance in total circulating VEGF-A.[43] The rs2010963 SNP in exon 1 of VEGFA associates with differential cardiovascular outcomes in different populations, with the CC/GC genotypes conferring increased risk of cardiac death within a five-year follow-up period in some coronary artery disease cohorts.[43] These genetic associations underscore how VEGF-A levels and signaling capacity are subject to substantial individual genetic variation, potentially explaining differential responsiveness to anti-VEGF therapeutics and variable disease progression among individuals exposed to similar risk factors.

At the post-transcriptional level, VEGF-A mRNA undergoes polyadenylation and export from the nucleus, and stability of VEGF mRNA is modulated by microRNA interactions and RNA-binding proteins.[21] The VEGF gene also contains a precursor form arising from initiation at an upstream in-frame CUG codon rather than the standard AUG initiation codon, generating a 47 kilodalton VEGF165 precursor with a 180-residue N-terminal extension.[15] This precursor form is processed by proteolytic cleavage and appears to have different properties than mature VEGF, as the precursor does not induce endothelial cell proliferation or expression of angiopoietin-2, yet adheres to the extracellular matrix, suggesting potential roles as a storage form or for localized VEGF generation.[15]

## VEGF in Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration

VEGF-A emerges as a uniquely important growth factor for ischemic wound healing, a conclusion supported by comparative studies demonstrating that VEGF surpasses basic fibroblast growth factor in promoting healing when tissue ischemia is the primary pathological driver.[55] During normal wound healing, VEGF mRNA expression is induced 3-5 fold by ischemia alone and 6-7 fold by wounding, with this upregulation evident as early as one day following injury and persisting throughout the experimental observation period.[55] The effect of exogenous VEGF165 application to wounds demonstrates substantially greater efficacy than VEGF121 in promoting granulation tissue formation: in nonischemic wounds, VEGF121 and VEGF165 application increased granulation tissue by 50% and 70% respectively at day 10, while ischemic wounds showed even more dramatic effects with VEGF165 producing the larger responses.[55] Mechanistically, VEGF promotes wound healing through multiple complementary pathways: it serves as an endothelial cell mitogen driving angiogenesis that improves tissue oxygenation, acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and inflammatory cells including macrophages, increases vascular permeability to enhance delivery of plasma proteins and cellular infiltration into the wound site, and induces endothelial cells to secrete numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines that support fibroblast function and tissue remodeling.[55][58] Notably, while VEGF powerfully promotes granulation tissue formation and angiogenesis, it has minimal effect on new epithelium formation, suggesting distinct mechanisms drive different components of the wound healing cascade.[55] This angiogenesis-focused role makes physiological sense, as VEGF acts primarily on endothelial cells, whereas epithelial cell growth requires other factors including keratinocyte growth factor, which fibroblasts produce in response to other signals.[55]

During skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, VEGF-A emerges as a critical mediator of the intercellular communication networks coordinating diverse cell types including myogenic progenitors, stromal fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells.[45] Remarkably, the source of VEGF-A production determines its function despite the ligand being identical: VEGF-A produced by myogenic progenitors and stromal fibroblasts exerts distinct effects on endothelial cell engagement and the trajectory of regeneration.[45] This spatial compartmentalization of signaling illustrates a fundamental principle wherein the same secreted factor executing identical molecular interactions can achieve distinct biological outcomes based on its cellular source and microenvironmental context. This observation suggests that anti-VEGF therapeutics targeting the total circulating VEGF may inadvertently eliminate tissue-autonomous VEGF functions that are incompletely captured by studies of circulating VEGF levels alone.

## Pathological VEGF Signaling in Cancer

Tumor angiogenesis represents perhaps the most clinically important pathological consequence of VEGF dysregulation, as developing tumors require new blood vessel formation to grow beyond a size of 1-2 millimeters.[37] VEGF is dramatically upregulated in the vast majority of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, with VEGF levels correlating with aggressive disease progression and increased metastatic potential.[37] The autocrine production of VEGF by tumor cells themselves, in addition to paracrine VEGF production by stromal cells, creates a microenvironment heavily biased toward angiogenesis, with increased vascular density supporting nutrient delivery and facilitating metastatic dissemination.[37] Beyond promoting angiogenesis via endothelial cells, evidence increasingly indicates that VEGF directly supports tumor cell survival and proliferation through autocrine signaling, as reduced VEGF expression in multiple cancer cell lines induces apoptosis and dramatically reduces cell proliferation and invasiveness.[39] In renal clear cell carcinoma, genetic suppression of VEGFA via RNA interference dramatically decreases phosphorylated-AKT and phosphoinositide 3-kinase expression, substantially inhibits cell proliferation, markedly increases apoptotic rates, and suppresses cell migration and invasion capacity, indicating that the PI3K/AKT pathway mediates tumor cell autonomous effects of VEGF.[39]

The pro-angiogenic effect of VEGF165 versus the antiangiogenic effect of VEGF165b isoforms illuminates potential therapeutic opportunities through manipulation of VEGF isoform balance rather than simply blocking all VEGF signaling.[38] Tumors expressing high levels of VEGF165 grow rapidly in murine xenograft models, while tumors engineered to express VEGF165b show substantially reduced growth associated with diminished microvascular density.[38] When VEGF165b and VEGF165 are co-expressed in tumors, the growth rate is intermediate between the two single-isoform expressing tumors, suggesting that VEGF165b actively antagonizes the angiogenic effects of VEGF165.[38] The mechanism by which VEGF165b exerts its antiangiogenic activity involves binding to both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, but initiating only weak signaling through these receptors that is insufficient to promote endothelial cell proliferation or migration.[38] This weak agonist activity allows VEGF165b to compete with VEGF165 for receptor occupancy while not providing sufficient signaling to drive angiogenesis, thereby functioning as a competitive inhibitor of pro-angiogenic VEGF signaling.[38]

Beyond its classical pro-angiogenic role, VEGF-A signaling directly affects tumor cell biological behavior through multiple mechanisms. In epithelial ovarian cancer, an activated tumor cell VEGFR2/AKT/mTOR pathway associates with increased ascites incidence and reduced overall survival in cisplatin-taxane treated patients with serous histology, suggesting that VEGF signaling acts on tumor cells as a direct stimulator of the AKT/mTOR protein synthesis pathway rather than acting solely through endothelial cells.[42] This finding implies that anti-VEGF therapeutics exert anti-tumor effects through at least two distinct mechanisms: direct suppression of tumor cell growth signaling and indirect effects through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.[42] The existence of direct VEGF-VEGFR signaling in tumor cells raises important mechanistic questions regarding the design and targeting of anti-VEGF therapeutics, suggesting that approaches enabling discrimination between endothelial and tumor cell VEGF signaling could improve therapeutic specificity.

## VEGF in Regulation of Vascular Permeability and Leukocyte Infiltration

VEGF-A functions as a potent regulator of vascular permeability, a property reflected in its alternative name as vascular permeability factor (VPF), and serves as a critical mediator of vascular barrier dysfunction in both physiological and pathological contexts.[3][33][36] The mechanism by which VEGF increases vascular permeability involves multiple signaling pathways: direct phosphorylation of endothelial junctional proteins including occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), downregulation of occludin and claudin expression, production of reactive oxygen species through Rac1-mediated mechanisms, and activation of Rho GTPases leading to cytoskeletal contraction and junctional disruption.[33] VEGF-induced Rac1 activation requires VEGFR2, active Src tyrosine kinase, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2, and ultimately Rac1 itself, establishing a signaling cascade from plasma membrane receptor engagement to GTPase activation driving actin reorganization.[33] Recent evidence indicates that VEGF also regulates vascular permeability through modulation of tight junction protein phosphatase activity: reactive oxygen species produced downstream of Rac activation can inactivate protein phosphatases by oxidizing critical cysteine residues in their catalytic sites, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 and maintaining their phosphorylated, permeability-increasing state.[33]

The regulation of endothelial junctional integrity by VEGF has been connected to macrophage functions through the discovery that the junctional adhesion molecule JAM-A positively regulates endothelial tight junction integrity by suppressing VEGF-A and VEGFR2 levels through downregulation of HIF-1α and transcription factor Id1.[36] JAM-A knockout mice demonstrate significantly enhanced basal vascular permeability compared to wild-type controls, with this enhanced permeability associated with a three-fold increase in plasma VEGF-A and significantly increased VEGFR2 mRNA and protein levels in endothelial cells.[36] Critically, inhibition of VEGFR2 using function-blocking antibodies completely abrogates both basal and VEGF-induced vascular permeability in JAM-A knockout mice, demonstrating that the enhanced permeability phenotype results from enhanced VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling rather than from structural defects in tight junctions.[36] This molecular mechanism reveals how loss of junctional protein expression can indirectly increase VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling through de-repression of VEGF transcription factors, creating a feedback loop wherein junctional dysfunction amplifies angiogenic signaling.

VEGF-A also regulates leukocyte-endothelial interactions through modulation of endothelial adhesion molecule expression. VEGF-A isoforms differentially regulate expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a key mediator of endothelial-leukocyte interactions, through isoform-specific stimulation of ERK1/2 and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) phosphorylation.[2] The VEGF-A165 isoform induces significantly greater VCAM-1 expression than VEGF-A121, resulting in increased leukocyte recruitment to VEGF-stimulated endothelium.[2] This differential regulation operates through isoform-specific kinetics of VEGFR2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling, with ATF-2 functioning as a nuclear "switch" converting short-term cytosolic-to-nuclear signaling into long-term endothelial responses including leukocyte recruitment.[2] The discovery of this switch mechanism illustrates how distinct VEGF-A isoforms with similar receptor-binding affinities can program differential endothelial responses through variations in signaling kinetics and substrate specificity.

## VEGF Signaling in Immune Cell Modulation

Beyond its classical functions in endothelial cells, VEGF-A exerts important regulatory functions in immune cell biology, particularly in macrophage phenotypic differentiation and function. IL-4, a prototypical macrophage-polarizing cytokine, coordinately regulates the VEGFA-VEGFR1 (FLT1) axis in alternatively polarized macrophages by simultaneously inhibiting pro-angiogenic VEGFA expression and inducing antiangiogenic soluble FLT1 expression through IL-4-STAT6 signaling and EGR2 transcription factor induction.[56] This IL-4-mediated shift in the VEGFA/sFLT1 balance transforms alternatively polarized macrophages into cells with attenuated pro-angiogenic capacity, suggesting that macrophage polarization state directly determines their contribution to angiogenesis regulation.[56] Furthermore, VEGF treatment of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages suppresses M1 markers including CXCL10, IL-12, and CCR7, while simultaneously upregulating M2 markers including CD206 and CD163, demonstrating that VEGF can directly promote macrophage polarization toward an alternatively activated M2 phenotype.[59] This pro-M2 effect of VEGF provides a potential mechanism whereby VEGF-rich tumoral microenvironments promote infiltration of M2 macrophages that support tumor growth and suppress anti-tumor immunity.[59]

VEGF also functions as a chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages, promoting their infiltration into tissues under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation.[59] The underlying molecular mechanism involves VEGF engagement of VEGFR1 on monocyte/macrophage surfaces, with evidence suggesting that both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are expressed on these cells with VEGFR1 demonstrating particularly high expression in M1 macrophages.[59] This pro-migratory effect has been documented in multiple model systems, including during uterine decidualization where conditioned medium from VEGF-producing decidualized endometrial stromal cells promotes macrophage migration in a manner dependent on VEGF, as blockade with soluble FLT1 substantially reduces macrophage recruitment.[59] In hematopoietic stem cells, evidence suggests that VEGF functions through intracrine signaling involving VEGFR1 to promote stem cell survival and in vivo repopulation capacity, suggesting intracellular VEGF-VEGFR1 signaling plays roles beyond endothelial regulation.[48]

## VEGF in Developmental Organogenesis

Beyond cardiovascular development, VEGF-A functions as an instructive signal for development of multiple organ systems, with experiments employing VEGF isoform-specific transgenic mice revealing that the balance of VEGF isoforms critically determines proper organ patterning and function. Mice expressing only VEGF120 (the mouse ortholog of human VEGF121) develop normally through birth, establishing that VEGF120 alone suffices to support vasculogenesis and overall VEGF functions.[52] However, these VEGF120/120 mice display defects in multiple organ systems including the heart, retina, bone, kidney, and lung, indicating that longer VEGF isoforms provide essential contributions to organ-specific vascular development and function.[52] Conversely, mice expressing only VEGF188 (the mouse ortholog of human VEGF189) suffer approximately 50% prenatal lethality due to severe defects in aortic arch remodeling, and surviving animals show defects in artery development in the eye and impaired epiphyseal bone vascularization.[52] These isoform-specific phenotypes indicate that the relative balance of diffusible versus matrix-bound VEGF isoforms—not merely the absolute level of total VEGF—determines proper vascular patterning during development and organ formation.[52]

In bone development, the spatial and temporal expression of VEGF isoforms is mechanically controlled by tissue tension, with VEGF189 preferentially expressed under conditions of increased stretch-induced cellular tension where it plays a role in vascularization during bone repair and remodeling.[52] This mechanical regulation of VEGF isoform expression exemplifies how developmental and tissue remodeling processes employ VEGF signaling with exquisite spatial and temporal specificity to achieve proper morphogenesis. The retention of longer VEGF isoforms in the extracellular matrix under mechanical stress conditions may create local reservoirs that can be mobilized during subsequent bone remodeling or fracture repair, providing a mechanism for coupling mechanical signals to angiogenic responses.

## Conclusion

VEGFA represents a paradigm of molecular multivalency wherein alternative splicing of a single gene generates distinct protein isoforms with profoundly different biological properties, spatial localization, and receptor engagement profiles, enabling execution of context-appropriate functions across development, tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and disease.[2][7][57] The cystine-knot structure of VEGFA confers remarkable stability and compact architecture permitting efficient disulfide bond formation even under the hypoxic conditions characteristic of developing tissues and ischemic disease states, enabling rapid mobilization of angiogenic signaling when oxygen availability becomes limiting.[11][19] The complexity of VEGF signaling extends far beyond canonical ligand-receptor binding at the cell surface, encompassing intracrine mechanisms wherein nuclear-localized VEGF and its receptors directly regulate gene expression and metabolic homeostasis within multiple cell types, expanding the biological scope of this molecule beyond classical paracrine angiogenic signaling.[48]

The discovery that the cellular source of VEGF-A determines its biological function despite molecular identity, and that spatial compartmentalization of signaling creates functionally distinct VEGF-mediated responses in myogenic progenitors versus stromal fibroblasts, reveals fundamental principles of intercellular communication wherein identical secreted factors execute distinct functions based on microenvironmental context.[45] The differential ability of VEGF165 and VEGF165b isoforms to activate or antagonize angiogenesis while possessing identical receptor-binding domains suggests that post-translational modifications or conformational mechanisms enable these isoforms to achieve opposite biological outcomes, highlighting mechanistic complexity that remains incompletely understood.[2][38] The regulation of VEGF expression and isoform balance through HIF-1-dependent and HIF-1-independent pathways ensures that VEGF mobilization occurs rapidly in response to metabolic stress through redundant mechanisms, while the modulation of VEGF action by receptor co-factors including neuropilin-1 adds additional layers of signal amplification and specificity.[12][21]

Future investigations of VEGFA biology will likely focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which VEGF isoform-specific differences in C-terminal sequences achieve differential receptor signaling kinetics and specificity, clarifying the functional significance and mechanisms of intracrine VEGF signaling in cancer and stem cell biology, and determining how spatial compartmentalization of VEGF production by distinct cell types within complex tissues translates molecular signals into distinct biological outcomes. The therapeutic targeting of VEGFA has emerged as a major treatment modality for multiple cancers through monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule receptor inhibitors, yet substantial therapeutic resistance develops in many cases, suggesting that understanding redundant VEGF pathways, cell-autonomous VEGF effects on tumor cells, and potentially isoform-specific contributions to tumor pathogenesis may enable development of next-generation therapeutics with improved efficacy.[37][42] The balance between pro-angiogenic VEGF isoforms and antiangiogenic VEGF-b variants in controlling physiological versus pathological angiogenesis offers potential therapeutic opportunities through isoform-selective modulation rather than global VEGF inhibition, a strategy that might preserve beneficial angiogenesis in wound healing and ischemic disease while suppressing pathological tumor angiogenesis.
