## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P47985
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit Rieske, mitochondrial; EC=7.1.1.8; AltName: Full=Complex III subunit 5; AltName: Full=Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 5; AltName: Full=Rieske iron-sulfur protein; Short=RISP; AltName: Full=Rieske protein UQCRFS1 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit; Contains: RecName: Full=Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 9 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13272}; Short=Su9 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13272}; Short=Subunit 9 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13272}; AltName: Full=8 kDa subunit 9 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13272}; AltName: Full=Complex III subunit IX; AltName: Full=Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 11; AltName: Full=UQCRFS1 mitochondrial targeting sequence; Short=UQCRFS1 MTS; AltName: Full=Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase 8 kDa protein {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13272}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=UQCRFS1 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:12587};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the Rieske iron-sulfur protein family.
- **Key Domains:** bc1_Rieske_TM_sf. (IPR037008); Globular_prot_asu/bsu. (IPR011070); Rieske_2Fe-2S. (IPR017941); Rieske_2Fe-2S_sf. (IPR036922); Rieske_Fe-S_prot. (IPR014349)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "UQCRFS1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'UQCRFS1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **UQCRFS1** (gene ID: UQCRFS1, UniProt: P47985) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Verified gene/protein identity: UQCRFS1 (HGNC:12587) encodes the Rieske 2Fe–2S subunit (RISP) of mitochondrial complex III (cytochrome bc1), with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and intermembrane-space-facing catalytic domain. Human disease genetics and mechanistic reviews confirm identity, localization, and function consistent with UniProt P47985 and the Rieske iron–sulfur protein family and domains (Rieske 2Fe–2S) (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2, banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- Organism verified: Homo sapiens (human) data are explicitly provided in sources (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 2-4, gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: All sources agree on the Rieske 2Fe–2S domain and role within the cytochrome bc1 complex; recent structural work captures the mobile Rieske head during catalysis (zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2, banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- No conflicting gene symbol usage found; literature matched the human UQCRFS1/RISP of complex III.

Key concepts and current understanding
- Core definition and role: UQCRFS1 is the catalytic Rieske iron–sulfur subunit of mitochondrial complex III (CIII2), participating in ubiquinol (QH2) oxidation at the Qo site during the Q‑cycle and shuttling an electron via its 2Fe–2S cluster to cytochrome c1; the protein is nuclear-encoded with an MTS, imported into mitochondria, and oriented to the intermembrane space where its globular head functions (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2, banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- Q‑cycle mechanism and ROS: CIII reoxidizes ubiquinol and contributes to proton pumping. Qo-site semiquinone can generate superoxide; inhibition at Qi vs Qo sites differentially modulates ROS (e.g., antimycin A increases ROS; stigmatellin decreases), underscoring CIII’s central role in redox signaling and proton-motive force support of NAD+/CoQ-linked metabolism (banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- Supercomplex context: CIII2 assembles into native respiratory supercomplexes with CI and CIV (respirasomes), supporting efficient electron transfer and providing a platform influencing CI/CIV stability and assembly (zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2, gusic2021roleofcoding pages 125-127).

Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- In situ cryo-EM of supercomplexes (2024): High-resolution in situ structures from porcine mitochondria captured multiple native organizations (I1III2IV1, I1III2IV2, I2III2IV2, I2III4IV2), resolved endogenous CoQ10/QH2 at Qo, and directly visualized stepwise movements of the Rieske head across catalytic states, providing atomic support for Q‑cycle electron/proton transfer in the native membrane environment (Nature, May 2024; includes URLs/DOI) (zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2).
- BCS1L conformational cycle (2024): Cryo-EM of human BCS1L during ATP hydrolysis shows a concerted ATP→ADP transition across subunits and demonstrates how folded UQCRFS1 can be trapped/released, clarifying the ATP-driven translocation mechanism for late-stage ISP incorporation into pre‑CIII (Nat Commun, May 2024) (sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 9-11).
- Complex III deficiency genetics update (2024): Review synthesizes nuclear gene defects (subunits and assembly factors) causing CIII deficiency, highlighting BCS1L as a key assembly ATPase and implicating quality control (TTC19) and accessory factors (SMIM4, TMEM223, SFXN1; BRAWNIN discussed across studies) in biogenesis and integrity of CIII and supercomplex formation (J Inherit Metab Dis, July 2024) (cunatova2024pathologicalvariantsin pages 11-12).

Biological processes, localization, and pathway placement
- Localization: UQCRFS1 is synthesized in cytosol, imported into mitochondria via its MTS; the catalytic globular domain resides in the intermembrane space attached by a transmembrane helix to CIII (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2).
- Pathway: Functions in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, receiving electrons from CoQ (reduced by CI/CII and other CoQ-linked dehydrogenases) and passing them to cytochrome c en route to CIV, coupling electron transfer to proton translocation through the Q‑cycle (banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- Assembly/biogenesis: UQCRFS1 is a late-incorporating subunit; LYRM7 (MZM1L) stabilizes the apo-protein and recruits 2Fe–2S cluster biogenesis machinery; BCS1L, an inner‑membrane AAA ATPase, translocates the folded Rieske subunit into pre‑CIII; TTC19 contributes to turnover of retained N-terminal fragments, preserving CIII integrity; these steps are linked to proper dimerization and supercomplex incorporation (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2, cunatova2024pathologicalvariantsin pages 11-12).

Disease relevance and precise role
- Pathogenic UQCRFS1 variants: Bi-allelic human variants cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency presenting with neonatal/infantile lactic acidosis, fetal bradycardia, severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (early death in one proband), thrombocytopenia, and alopecia totalis. Patient fibroblasts show reduced UQCRFS1 abundance, impaired import/assembly, and decreased respiration; lentiviral wild-type UQCRFS1 rescues cellular phenotypes. Reported variants include splice-site c.215-1G>C and others with ClinVar entries (American Journal of Human Genetics, Jan 2020) (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 2-4, gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 1-2, gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 7-8). Quantitatively, this initial report details two unrelated probands (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 7-8).
- BCS1L-related CIII deficiency: BCS1L mutations are a leading nuclear cause of pediatric CIII deficiency, with phenotypes ranging from neonatal GRACILE syndrome to Björnstad syndrome; mechanistically linked to failed UQCRFS1 translocation/assembly, causing loss of CIII activity and downstream supercomplex destabilization (reviewed 2022–2024) (banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5, cunatova2024pathologicalvariantsin pages 11-12).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Complex III as a drug target: Structural and mechanistic work define cytochrome bc1 as a validated target in pathogens; inhibitory principles at Qo/Qi sites are well described, informing medicinal chemistry and selectivity considerations. These insights underpin repurposing concepts (e.g., atovaquone) and broader therapeutic strategies that modulate CIII activity or CoQ flux (2024 structural perspective; 2022 biochemical review) (banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).
- Note on oncology trials: Repurposing of the Complex III inhibitor atovaquone in cancer is an active area, but specific trial details are outside the present evidence context returned here; nonetheless, the structural/drug-target literature supports the rationale for targeting CIII in disease (banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5).

Cancer associations and mechanistic links
- Ovarian cancer: UQCRFS1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and high expression correlates with worse overall/progression-free survival across TCGA/GEO datasets and 35 clinical samples. Functional knockdown in OC cell lines reduces proliferation, induces G1 arrest, increases apoptosis, elevates ROS and DNA-damage gene expression, and downregulates total and phosphorylated AKT/mTOR signaling, suggesting an OXPHOS‑dependent survival axis with downstream growth signaling (Scientific Reports, May 2023; includes URL/DOI) (sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 3-4, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 4-7, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 7-9, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 1-2).
- Therapy resistance and ISC maintenance: In EGFR‑TKI (osimertinib) adaptive resistance, ferritinophagy (NCOA4) is induced, sustaining iron–sulfur cluster protein synthesis (including UQCRFS1), enhancing OXPHOS; combined treatment with copper ionophores augments efficacy in models, highlighting a mitochondria/ISC‑linked vulnerability (Nature Communications, May 2024) (sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 7-9).

Quantitative and structural data points
- Human genetics: Two probands with bi‑allelic UQCRFS1 variants were described with detailed phenotypes and biochemical assays; cellular rescue by UQCRFS1 transgene was shown (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 2-4, gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 7-8).
- Ovarian cancer cohorts/assays: Analysis spanned TCGA/GTEx/GEO datasets and ~35 EOC clinical samples; functional assays in A2780 and OVCAR8 lines quantified proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, ROS, DNA-damage genes, and AKT/mTOR signaling changes upon UQCRFS1 knockdown (sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 4-7, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 7-9).
- Structural resolutions: In situ cryo-EM achieved up to ~1.8 Å local resolution, resolving Q10/QH2 at Qo and Rieske domain positions across states within native membranes (zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2).

Expert perspectives and synthesis
- Consensus places UQCRFS1 as a late-incorporating catalytic subunit essential for Q‑cycle chemistry and ROS control; its assembly depends on LYRM7 and BCS1L with TTC19-mediated quality control. Loss of CIII2 impacts supercomplex integrity, destabilizing CI/CIV and compromising CoQ‑linked metabolism. Recent in situ structural work provides direct visualization of catalytic intermediates and Rieske head dynamics, while mechanistic advances in BCS1L clarify how folded ISP is delivered to pre‑CIII. Together, these findings refine the molecular picture of CIII biogenesis, native operation, and disease vulnerabilities (gusic2021roleofcoding pages 125-127, cunatova2024pathologicalvariantsin pages 11-12, zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2, banerjee2022themitochondrialcoenzyme pages 4-5, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 9-11).

| Quantitative notes & cohort sizes | Key quantitative observations: Gusic et al. report two probands with biallelic UQCRFS1 variants (case series); Sun et al. analyzed TCGA/GEO data and ~35 OC samples for expression and in vitro functional assays; in situ cryo-EM achieved up to ~1.8 Å local resolution. | Gusic et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2020; Sun et al., Sci Rep, 2023; Zheng et al., Nature, 2024 | https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.12.005; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35572-z; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07488-9 | (gusic2020biallelicuqcrfs1variants pages 7-8, sun2023uqcrfs1servesas pages 7-9, zheng2024highresolutioninsitu pages 1-2) |
