description: >-
  UQCRFS1 encodes the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP), one of three catalytic
  subunits of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III, CIII2).
  UQCRFS1 contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster that is essential for electron transfer
  from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1 during the Q-cycle. The protein is
  nuclear-encoded, imported into mitochondria, and inserted as the penultimate
  subunit during CIII assembly via BCS1L-mediated translocation. The catalytic
  globular domain resides in the intermembrane space, attached to the complex
  by a single transmembrane helix. After insertion, the N-terminal
  mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved to generate subunit 9, a small
  fragment that remains associated with the complex. Bi-allelic pathogenic
  variants cause mitochondrial Complex III deficiency (MC3DN10) with
  cardiomyopathy, alopecia totalis, and lactic acidosis (PMID:31883641).
  Deep research review (UQCRFS1-deep-research-falcon.md) confirms UQCRFS1 as
  a late-incorporating catalytic subunit essential for Q-cycle chemistry and
  ROS control, with assembly depending on LYRM7 and BCS1L. Recent in situ
  cryo-EM structures have directly visualized the Rieske head domain movement
  during catalytic electron transfer (Zheng et al. 2024, Nature).

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for oxidoreductase activity. UQCRFS1 is a catalytic subunit
      of Complex III that participates in oxidoreduction during the Q-cycle,
      transferring electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1 via its [2Fe-2S]
      cluster (PMID:28380382). This term is correct but very broad. The more
      specific molecular function of UQCRFS1 as an individual subunit is
      electron transfer activity (GO:0009055), while the whole-complex activity
      is quinol-cytochrome-c reductase activity (GO:0008121). Since
      oxidoreductase activity is a parent of both of these, and the IBA
      inference is phylogenetically sound, this annotation is acceptable but
      could be made more specific. Deep research (UQCRFS1-deep-research-falcon.md)
      confirms the Rieske protein accepts an electron at the Qo site via its
      2Fe-2S cluster and undergoes head-domain movement during the Q-cycle.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      UQCRFS1 is indeed an oxidoreductase as part of Complex III, but this term
      is too broad for informative annotation. The subunit-specific molecular
      function is electron transfer activity (GO:0009055) -- the Rieske protein
      transfers electrons via its [2Fe-2S] cluster from ubiquinol at the Qo site
      to cytochrome c1. This is well established from structural and biochemical
      studies (PMID:28380382). GO:0016491 is a valid parent term but does not

      to proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane during
      the Q-cycle (PMID:28380382). UQCRFS1 contributes to this activity as a

      that together catalyze the quinol-cytochrome-c reductase reaction.
      However, as a single subunit, UQCRFS1 does not independently catalyze
      this full reaction -- it contributes to the complex activity. In GO

      of the complex that performs this reaction. The GOA file shows this with

  description: >-
    UQCRFS1 is the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, one of three catalytic subunits
    of mitochondrial Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex). Its primary
    subunit-specific molecular function is electron transfer activity
    (GO:0009055), mediated by its [2Fe-2S] cluster which accepts an electron
    from ubiquinol bound at the Qo site of cytochrome b and transfers it to
    cytochrome c1. The Rieske head domain undergoes a conformational swing
    between the b-site and c-site positions during each catalytic cycle. This
    electron transfer contributes to the overall quinol-cytochrome-c reductase
    activity (GO:0008121, EC 7.1.1.8) of the Complex III homodimer. UQCRFS1
    also binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster (GO:0051537). The protein is located in
    respiratory chain complex III (GO:0045275) at the mitochondrial inner
    membrane (GO:0005743), with the catalytic globular domain in the
    intermembrane space and a single transmembrane helix anchoring it to the
    complex. The core biological process is mitochondrial electron transport,
    ubiquinol to cytochrome c (GO:0006122).

  title: Electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c of complex III
  findings:
  - statement: UQCRFS1 participates in the core catalytic reaction of Complex III at the inner membrane.
    supporting_text: >-
      The protonmotive Q cycle is the mechanism by which complex III transfers
      electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this process to translocation
      of protons across the membrane.

  title: apo-UQCRFS1 binds LYRM7
  findings:
  - statement: Apo-UQCRFS1 binds chaperone LYRM7 in the mitochondrial matrix during Complex III biogenesis.
    supporting_text: >-
      the Complex III subunit UQCRFS1 (Rieske protein) binds to and is stabilized
      by the chaperone LYRM7 (MZM1L)

  title: 2Fe-2S is inserted in UQCRFS1
  findings:
  - statement: The [2Fe-2S] cluster is inserted into UQCRFS1 at the mitochondrial inner membrane during assembly.
    supporting_text: >-
      Frataxin (FXN) subunit of the 2Fe-2S transfer complex catalyzes the insertion
      of one 2Fe-2S cluster in the Complex III subunit UQCRFS1 (Rieske protein) as
      part of a UQCRFS1:LYRM7 complex.

  title: Unknown peptidase cleaves UQCRFS1 subunit
  findings:
  - statement: UQCRFS1 undergoes proteolytic processing after insertion into Complex III.
    supporting_text: >-
      Proteolytic processing is necessary for the correct insertion of UQCRFS1
      in the complex III dimer. An unknown peptidase cleaves the N-terminal 78
      amino acids of UQCRFS1
- id: Reactome:R-HSA-9906042
  title: TTC19 clears UQCRFS1 fragments from Complex III
  findings:
  - statement: TTC19 mediates clearance of UQCRFS1-derived fragments from Complex III at the inner membrane.
    supporting_text: >-
      N-terminal cleavage fragments of UQCRFS1 are cleared by TTC19, stabilizing
      the final complex.

  title: Deep research review for UQCRFS1 (Falcon/Edison)
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UQCRFS1 is the catalytic Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of mitochondrial complex III
      (CIII2), participating in ubiquinol (QH2) oxidation at the Qo site during the
      Q-cycle and shuttling an electron via its 2Fe-2S cluster to cytochrome c1.
  - statement: >-
      High-resolution in situ cryo-EM resolved multiple native supercomplex
      organizations and captured distinct Qo-site Q10/QH2 binding states and
      corresponding Rieske-domain movements, providing direct structural support
      for the Q-cycle mechanism (Zheng et al. 2024, Nature).
  - statement: >-
      UQCRFS1 is the last subunit incorporated into CIII; LYRM7 (MZM1L) chaperones
      Fe-S cluster insertion, BCS1L translocates the folded ISP into pre-CIII for
      late-stage incorporation, and TTC19 mediates turnover of N-terminal peptides
      for CIII integrity.
