  label: Homo sapiens
description: CAMK2A encodes the alpha subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that serves as a molecular switch in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. CaMKIIα is highly enriched in the brain, particularly at excitatory synapses, where it responds to calcium influx through NMDA receptors. Upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding, the kinase undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr286, generating Ca2+-independent activity that persists after calcium levels return to baseline - effectively storing a molecular memory of synaptic activity. The kinase forms dodecameric holoenzymes that phosphorylate numerous synaptic substrates including glutamate receptors, thereby strengthening synaptic transmission during long-term potentiation. Mutations in CAMK2A cause intellectual disability (MRD53) and are associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its critical role in cognitive development and function.

  review:
    summary: Core molecular function strongly supported by extensive biochemical and functional evidence. Multiple studies demonstrate direct Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity. IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is at the correct level of specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the fundamental molecular function of CAMK2A, supported by decades of biochemical characterization and phylogenetic conservation across metazoans. The IBA annotation correctly captures the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent aspect that distinguishes CAMK2A from other kinases.

    summary: Correct but very general. The more specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity (GO:0004683) better captures CAMK2A function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While overly broad, kinase activity is correct and represents a parent term. The more specific annotations for serine/threonine kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity are also present. IEA from UniProt keywords is appropriate for general molecular function.

    summary: Very general parent term for kinase activity. Kinases transfer phosphate groups from ATP to substrates. More specific terms are available.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct but extremely broad. Transferase activity is the parent class for all kinases. While not informative for CAMK2A specifically, it is not incorrect. IEA from UniProt keywords is acceptable for hierarchical terms.

    summary: CAMK2A is abundant in dendrites where it regulates synaptic plasticity. The kinase translocates from dendritic shafts to spines upon activation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Dendritic localization is well-established for CAMK2A. The kinase is found in dendritic shafts under basal conditions and translocates to dendritic spines upon calcium influx. IEA from UniProt subcellular location is appropriate.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While CAMK2A may transiently associate with endocytic vesicles during receptor trafficking, the primary localizations are cytoplasm, dendrites, and postsynaptic densities. This annotation represents a peripheral localization rather than core function.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Homodimerization is essential for CAMK2A holoenzyme assembly. The association domain mediates oligomerization into 12-subunit complexes. While the term could be more specific to the dodecameric complex, homodimerization accurately describes part of the assembly process.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Dendritic spine localization is essential for CAMK2A function in synaptic plasticity. The kinase binds to NMDA receptor subunits at spines and phosphorylates synaptic substrates. IEA from UniProt subcellular location is well-supported by experimental evidence.

    summary: CAMK2A requires Mg2+ as a cofactor for kinase activity and responds to Ca2+ via calmodulin. Metal ion binding is inherent to kinase function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Metal ion binding is correct. CAMK2A requires Mg2+ for catalysis (as annotated in UniProt cofactor) and its activity is regulated by Ca2+ through calmodulin. IEA from UniProt keywords is appropriate.

    label: postsynaptic density organization
  evidence_type: IEA
  review:
    summary: Essential structural component and organizer of the postsynaptic density through its dodecameric holoenzyme structure
    action: NEW
    reason: CAMK2A is a major structural component of the postsynaptic density (PSD), comprising up to 2% of total protein in some synapses. The protein forms large dodecameric holoenzymes that serve as scaffolds for organizing other synaptic proteins within the PSD. Beyond its kinase activity, CAMK2A's structural role in PSD organization is essential for proper synaptic function, receptor clustering, and synaptic transmission. This represents a core function distinct from its enzymatic activity.
