  id: NCBITaxon:9606
  label: Homo sapiens
description: CAMK2A encodes the alpha subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that serves as a molecular
  switch in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. CaMKIIα is highly enriched in
  the brain, particularly at excitatory synapses, where it responds to calcium influx
  through NMDA receptors. Upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding, the kinase undergoes autophosphorylation
  at Thr286, generating Ca2+-independent activity that persists after calcium levels
  return to baseline - effectively storing a molecular memory of synaptic activity.
  The kinase forms dodecameric holoenzymes that phosphorylate numerous synaptic substrates
  including glutamate receptors, thereby strengthening synaptic transmission during
  long-term potentiation. Mutations in CAMK2A cause intellectual disability (MRD53)
  and are associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its critical role
  in cognitive development and function.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Core molecular function strongly supported by extensive biochemical and
      functional evidence. Multiple studies demonstrate direct Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
      kinase activity. IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is at the correct
      level of specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the fundamental molecular function of CAMK2A, supported by decades
      of biochemical characterization and phylogenetic conservation across metazoans.
      The IBA annotation correctly captures the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent aspect that
      distinguishes CAMK2A from other kinases.

    summary: General protein kinase activity is correct but too broad. The more specific
      Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity (GO:0004683) better captures the core
      function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While broad, this annotation is correct and represents the parent term
      of the more specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity. IEA
      annotations from InterPro domains are appropriate for capturing general molecular
      functions based on conserved domains.

    summary: Correct Ser/Thr kinase activity. While the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
      aspect (GO:0004683) is more specific, this annotation correctly identifies the
      type of amino acids phosphorylated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CAMK2A is indeed a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylating these residues
      on substrates like AMPA receptors (S831 on GluA1), NMDA receptors (S1303 on
      GluN2B), and STAT1 (S727). This is a correct molecular function annotation.

    summary: Essential structural component and organizer of the postsynaptic density through its dodecameric holoenzyme structure
    action: NEW
    reason: CAMK2A is a major structural component of the postsynaptic density (PSD), comprising up to 2% of total protein in some synapses. The protein forms large dodecameric holoenzymes that serve as scaffolds for organizing other synaptic proteins within the PSD. Beyond its kinase activity, CAMK2A's structural role in PSD organization is essential for proper synaptic function, receptor clustering, and synaptic transmission. This represents a core function distinct from its enzymatic activity.

suggested_questions:
- question: How does autophosphorylation of CAMK2A create molecular memory and contribute
    to synaptic plasticity and learning?
- question: What determines the subcellular localization of CAMK2A and how does this
    regulate its access to different substrates?
- question: How do different splice variants of CAMK2A contribute to brain region-specific
    functions and neuronal plasticity?
- question: What are the mechanisms by which CAMK2A integrates calcium signals with
    other signaling pathways during synaptic transmission?
