# Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) – Comprehensive Gene Report

## Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (gene symbol **ABCC7**), functioning not as an active pump but as a **phosphorylation- and nucleotide-regulated anion channel** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). It primarily mediates passive **chloride ion conductance** across epithelial cell membranes, permitting Cl⁻ to flow down its electrochemical gradient when the channel is open ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). CFTR is often described as an **ATP-gated chloride channel**, since binding of ATP at its nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and subsequent ATP hydrolysis drive the opening and closing (gating) of its anion-selective pore ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). **Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase** (PKA) phosphorylation of CFTR’s regulatory R domain is a **prerequisite for channel activity** – in the dephosphorylated state the channel remains closed even if ATP is present ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). Upon PKA stimulation (e.g. via cAMP-elevating hormones), multiple serine residues in the R domain are phosphorylated, relieving an autoinhibitory interaction and enabling ATP-dependent conformational changes that open the channel ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=surface%20closes%20the%20channel,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). Structurally, ATP binding promotes dimerization of the two NBDs, which in turn triggers a reorientation of the transmembrane helices to open the channel gate; ATP hydrolysis at the NBDs later breaks the dimer and allows the channel to reset (close) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). This **cyclical gating mechanism** – ATP-driven NBD dimerization and hydrolysis-driven NBD separation – underlies CFTR’s activity as a tightly regulated, ligand-gated ion channel rather than a continuous transporter.

Importantly, CFTR is **selective for anions** and conducts chloride with high efficiency, but it can also conduct **bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ions** through the same pore (with roughly 20–30% of the chloride conductance) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=functions%20as%20a%20base%20loader,likely%20contributes%20to%20the%20epithelial)). This bicarbonate permeability is physiologically significant in organs like the pancreas and intestine, where CFTR-mediated HCO₃⁻ secretion helps alkalinize luminal fluids ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=functions%20as%20a%20base%20loader,likely%20contributes%20to%20the%20epithelial)). CFTR’s pore is lined with positively charged residues that attract anions, and it contains a single narrow gate near the extracellular side that controls ion flow ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). When the channel opens, Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ diffuse out of the cell (or into the lumen) following the electrochemical gradient ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=functions%20as%20a%20base%20loader,likely%20contributes%20to%20the%20epithelial)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). In this way, CFTR activity directly causes **chloride transmembrane transport** (GO:1902476) and contributes to **bicarbonate transport** (GO:0015701) in epithelial tissues.

Beyond its direct ion channel function, CFTR has important **regulatory interactions** with other transport proteins in epithelial cells. For example, CFTR activity **modulates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)**: in airway epithelia, active CFTR exerts a **negative regulatory effect on ENaC**, reducing Na⁺ absorption ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=Airway%20epithelia%20absorb%20Na,characterized%20by%20viscous%2C%20dehydrated%20mucus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=affects%20epithelia%20lining%20the%20intestines%2C,in%20a%20double%20hit%20of)). Loss of CFTR (as in cystic fibrosis) leads to hyperactive ENaC-mediated Na⁺ uptake, contributing to dehydrated mucus (see Disease Associations below). CFTR also forms macromolecular complexes with SLC26 family anion exchangers (such as SLC26A3 and SLC26A6) in tissues like the pancreas; these physical interactions allow **coupling of Cl⁻ secretion to Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange**, coordinating chloride and bicarbonate movements for efficient fluid secretion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2654087/#:~:text=C,Google%20Scholar)). Thus, CFTR can act as a **“transport regulator”**, influencing other channels/transporters (hence its name *conductance regulator*), in addition to functioning as a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ channel itself ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=Airway%20epithelia%20absorb%20Na,characterized%20by%20viscous%2C%20dehydrated%20mucus)). 

On a biochemical level, CFTR also binds ATP and exhibits an **ATPase activity** (GO:0016887), although unlike many ABC transporters that harness ATP hydrolysis to actively pump substrates, CFTR uses ATP hydrolysis to **toggle between open and closed channel states** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). CFTR’s ATPase cycle is relatively slow and probabilistic – one ATP is bound and hydrolyzed at a “consensus” NBD site to open the gate, and a second “degenerate” NBD site also binds/hydrolyzes ATP to influence gating kinetics ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). Mutagenesis studies (e.g. the **G551D** mutation in NBD1 or **E1371Q** in NBD2) that alter ATP binding/hydrolysis have confirmed the critical role of these processes in channel gating, as such mutations markedly reduce channel open probability or prevent channel closure ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=match%20at%20L429%20required%20the,domain%20physically%20interact%20in%20a)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain,Nairn%20AC%2C%20Gadsby%20DC%202000)). In summary, CFTR’s molecular function is best characterized as **intracellular ATP-gated chloride channel activity** (GO:0005260) – requiring PKA-mediated phosphorylation and ATP binding/hydrolysis to conduct anions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). This precise control mechanism ensures CFTR channels open only under appropriate stimulatory conditions (e.g. hormonal signals that raise cAMP), fitting their role in regulated epithelial fluid transport.

## Cellular Localization and Components  
At the cellular level, CFTR is predominantly localized to the **apical plasma membrane** of epithelial cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). It is an **integral membrane protein** (spanning the lipid bilayer multiple times) and is usually confined to the apical or luminal surface in polarized epithelia, rather than the basolateral membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=regulated%20chloride%20channel%20located%20primarily,can%20be%20detrimental%20and%20may)). **Immunolocalization studies** in various human tissues have shown CFTR at the apical domain of cells in the **airways, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic ducts, bile ducts, sweat gland ducts, and the male reproductive tract** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=regulated%20chloride%20channel%20located%20primarily,can%20be%20detrimental%20and%20may)). For example, in the airway, CFTR protein is highly enriched at the apical membrane of **submucosal gland serous cells** and a subset of surface epithelial cells, positioning it to control the composition of airway surface liquid ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1285365/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mucus%20in%20human%20lung)). In the intestine, CFTR is found in the brush-border (apical) membrane of crypt enterocytes, where it drives Cl⁻ and fluid secretion into the gut lumen. In sweat glands, CFTR is located in the apical membrane of reabsorptive duct cells, where it normally facilitates chloride (and thus sodium) reabsorption from sweat; absence of CFTR in these cells leads to the salty sweat characteristic of cystic fibrosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). In the **epididymis and vas deferens** of the male reproductive tract, CFTR is expressed on the luminal side of the duct epithelia, contributing to the fluid environment required for sperm maturation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=regulated%20chloride%20channel%20located%20primarily,can%20be%20detrimental%20and%20may)). This polarized apical localization aligns with CFTR’s role in secreting Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ *into* ducts or lumen spaces (airway surface, gut lumen, gland duct, etc.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)), which in turn drives water movement and affects mucus/fluid properties.

On the **subcellular level**, CFTR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traverses the secretory pathway to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane. Proper folding and maturation are required for it to exit the ER; the protein is **core-glycosylated in the ER and fully glycosylated in the Golgi**, yielding a mature ~170 kDa glycoprotein at the cell surface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=glycosylated%20transmembrane%20protein%20located%20in,1%20modules%20are)). Quality control is stringent – misfolded CFTR (for instance, the ΔF508 mutant form) is recognized by ER chaperones and targeted for **ER-associated degradation** (see Disease section) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=the%20mutation%20F508del,44%7D%20Subsequently%2C%20the%20mutant%20protein)). In healthy cells, CFTR that passes quality control is delivered to the apical membrane via vesicular traffic. CFTR also undergoes **endocytic recycling**: it is constitutively endocytosed from the plasma membrane and either recycled back to the apical surface or sent to lysosomes for degradation. This creates an intracellular pool of CFTR in **endosomal vesicles** just beneath the apical membrane that can be rapidly mobilized to the surface in response to cAMP stimuli. In secretory epithelia (e.g. intestinal crypts and submucosal glands), a fraction of CFTR resides in *subapical vesicular compartments*, which upon PKA activation can fuse with the membrane to add more CFTR channels to the surface, amplifying the secretory response ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20maintaining%20a%20dynamic%20balance,occur%20primarily%20between%20the%20opposing)). Such regulated trafficking ensures that the **density of CFTR at the cell surface** can be modulated by physiological signals.

CFTR’s **C-terminal tail** (last ~4 amino acids: *-DTRL*) contains a PDZ-domain binding motif that tethers CFTR to scaffolding proteins in the apical membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=number%20of%20proteins%20have%20been,article%20reviews%20the%20most%20recent)). CFTR forms part of large **protein complexes** at the apical compartment – it binds to PDZ domain-containing adaptors like NHERF1/EBP50, which link CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton and to signaling molecules ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=number%20of%20proteins%20have%20been,article%20reviews%20the%20most%20recent)). These interactions not only help **stabilize CFTR at the apical membrane** (preventing its diffusion or mislocalization) but also connect CFTR functionally to other proteins (e.g., linking CFTR to β2-adrenergic receptors, various kinases, and other ion channels co-localized in the apical microdomain) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=number%20of%20proteins%20have%20been,article%20reviews%20the%20most%20recent)). For instance, NHERF1 binding via the PDZ motif protects CFTR from rapid endocytosis by competing with an E3 ubiquitin ligase called CFTR-associated ligand (CAL); if CFTR’s PDZ-binding motif is deleted or NHERF is absent, CFTR is more rapidly removed from the membrane and degraded ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=NHERF1,CAL%20expression%20levels%20will%20increase)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=limits%20cell,using%20fluorescence%20polarization%2C%20isothermal%20titration)). Thus, CFTR’s **cellular component** annotations include **apical plasma membrane** (GO:0016324) as the primary location, with presence in the **plasma membrane** in general (GO:0005886), and association with specialized structures like **cell junctions** (CFTR has been detected near tight junctions in some epithelia) and **membrane microdomains** via scaffold proteins. Overall, CFTR’s localization is finely tuned to its role: it is positioned at the interface between the cell and lumen where it can control ion/fluid exchange, and it is embedded in protein networks that regulate its surface expression and function.

## Biological Processes Involvement  
As a cAMP-regulated chloride channel in epithelial cells, CFTR is a central player in numerous **biological processes** related to ion transport and fluid homeostasis. Its activity underlies the process of **chloride transmembrane transport** (GO:1902476), which is fundamental for producing and regulating epithelial secretions. By allowing Cl⁻ (and HCO₃⁻) to exit cells into luminal spaces, CFTR drives osmotic water movement, thus **coupling ion transport to fluid secretion** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). In organs like the **airways, CFTR-mediated Cl⁻ secretion and concomitant inhibition of Na⁺ absorption maintain the proper volume and hydration of the airway surface liquid**, which is crucial for mucociliary clearance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=Airway%20epithelia%20absorb%20Na,characterized%20by%20viscous%2C%20dehydrated%20mucus)). This ties CFTR to processes like *mucus transport* and *innate defense of the lung*. Indeed, **airway surface hydration** is a balance of CFTR-driven Cl⁻ secretion and ENaC-driven Na⁺ absorption; CFTR dysfunction skews this balance, leading to dehydrated mucus and impaired mucus clearance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=Airway%20epithelia%20absorb%20Na,characterized%20by%20viscous%2C%20dehydrated%20mucus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=affects%20epithelia%20lining%20the%20intestines%2C,in%20a%20double%20hit%20of)). Thus, CFTR is integral to the **biological process of epithelial fluid homeostasis** (often captured under GO terms like *transepithelial fluid transport* or *water homeostasis*) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). In line with this, CFTR-deficient pigs or ferrets develop thick airway secretions and infection, mirroring human cystic fibrosis and underscoring CFTR’s role in lung defense.

In the **gastrointestinal tract**, CFTR-mediated chloride and bicarbonate secretion by crypt cells and pancreatic ducts is essential for **fluid secretion, digestive enzyme function, and pH balance**. CFTR participates in **bicarbonate secretion processes** (GO:0015701), especially in the pancreatic ducts where a combination of CFTR and HCO₃⁻/Cl⁻ exchangers produces a bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=functions%20as%20a%20base%20loader,likely%20contributes%20to%20the%20epithelial)). If CFTR is non-functional, pancreatic ducts cannot secrete adequate HCO₃⁻ and fluid, leading to thick, protein-rich secretions that block the ducts (as seen in cystic fibrosis, causing pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). In the **intestines**, CFTR-driven Cl⁻ and water secretion helps lubricate and flush the content; it also underlies the fluid secretion in diarrhea. Notably, **enterotoxins (like cholera toxin)** cause life-threatening **secretory diarrhea** by hyperactivating CFTR via cAMP, leading to excessive Cl⁻ and water efflux into the gut ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=transepithelial%20fluid%20homeostasis,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). Thus, CFTR hyperactivity is a mechanism in diarrheal disease, whereas CFTR hypoactivity underlies constipation/meconium ileus in CF patients. These examples illustrate CFTR’s critical involvement in **ion transport (GO:0006811)** and **fluid secretion processes** in multiple organs.

CFTR also contributes to **salt balance and sweat production**. In sweat glands, the process of sweat duct reabsorption depends on CFTR-mediated chloride uptake from the lumen; CFTR works in conjunction with ENaC to reabsorb salt from primary sweat. In normal physiology, this results in low-salt sweat; in CF (CFTR absent), Cl⁻ cannot be reabsorbed, Na⁺ reabsorption is limited, and sweat remains abnormally high in salt. The **sweat test**, which measures sweat chloride, is a direct clinical reflection of the loss of CFTR’s chloride transport process in sweat ducts. Therefore, CFTR is involved in the **biological process of sweat electrolyte homeostasis**, contributing to overall salt balance.

In the **male reproductive system**, CFTR-mediated fluid secretion is required for the proper development of the vas deferens and epididymis. During embryonic development, CFTR expression in the developing male reproductive ducts helps drive fluid secretion that is thought to **luminally inflate and separate the ducts**. If CFTR is absent or dysfunctional, these ducts may collapse or fail to differentiate properly, often resulting in **agenesis (absence) of the vas deferens**, a condition known as CBAVD ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=CBAVD%20with%20resulting%20obstructive%20azoospermia%2C,mediated)). Indeed, CBAVD in otherwise healthy males is frequently due to mild CFTR mutations, highlighting CFTR’s role in the developmental process of **male genital duct morphogenesis**. CFTR is also expressed in sperm and thought to influence **sperm capacitation** (GO:0048240) and motility by affecting ion fluxes in the sperm flagellum and epididymal fluid; some CFTR variants have been linked to male subfertility even when the vas deferens is present, although these roles are less well-characterized than its duct developmental role.

Additional processes impacted by CFTR include: **regulation of extracellular pH** (via HCO₃⁻ secretion, important in lung and GI mucosa), **regulation of epithelial cell volume** (CFTR contributes to ion efflux during regulatory volume decrease in some cells), and even **insulin secretion in the pancreas**. CFTR is expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells and there is evidence that it helps modulate insulin release, possibly by affecting β-cell electrolyte homeostasis or vesicle exocytosis; consequently, CF patients can exhibit CFRD (CF-related diabetes). In line with this, CFTR has been annotated to processes like *positive regulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose* ([www.informatics.jax.org](https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/gograph/MGI%3A88388#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,J%3A221546)) and *positive regulation of exocytosis* ([www.informatics.jax.org](https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/gograph/MGI%3A88388#:~:text=Biological%20Process%20%20,J%3A164563)), though these are secondary to its principal roles in epithelial tissues.

On a broader scale, CFTR’s activity ties into **organism-level water and ion homeostasis (GO:0050891)**. It allows organs to secrete fluids (airway surface liquid, pancreatic juice, bile, intestinal fluids, tears, etc.) and thus plays a part in maintaining the hydration and ionic balance of these fluids. The **failure of CFTR function** in cystic fibrosis leads to multi-organ disruption of these processes – thick dehydrated mucus in the lungs, insufficient fluid and enzyme delivery in the gut and pancreas, salty sweat, etc. – demonstrating how one gene’s product is involved in an array of critical homeostatic processes. 

In summary, CFTR contributes to key biological processes such as **chloride and bicarbonate transmembrane transport**, **transepithelial fluid secretion**, **regulation of mucus viscosity**, **sweat chloride homeostasis**, and aspects of **development (vas deferens) and defense (mucociliary clearance)**. Its proper function is indispensable for the normal physiology of respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
**Mutations in CFTR** are the cause of **cystic fibrosis (CF)**, one of the most prevalent life-threatening autosomal recessive diseases in humans ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=CBAVD%20may%20occur%20as%20an,CFTR)). Cystic fibrosis is characterized by chronic progressive lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride, and male infertility, among other symptoms. Pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene lead to defective or absent CFTR protein function, resulting in **impaired chloride and bicarbonate transport** in epithelial tissues and a cascade of pathophysiological consequences. Over **2,000 mutations** in CFTR have been identified; these are classified into classes (I–VI) based on the molecular defect (e.g., absent production, trafficking defect, gating defect, etc.). The **most common mutation** is a three-base deletion removing a phenylalanine at position 508 (**ΔF508**), present on ~70% of CF alleles worldwide ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=have%20been%20described%2C%20among%20which,of%20CF)). Over 90% of CF patients carry at least one ΔF508 allele ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=match%20at%20L132%20alleles.%5E%7B43%7D%20F508del,CF%20patients%20are%20homozygous%20for)), making it the single most prevalent cause of CF. ΔF508 is a **folding and trafficking mutation** – the deletion destabilizes NBD1 and perturbes inter-domain interactions, causing the protein to misfold. As a result, ΔF508-CFTR is recognized as “misfolded” by cellular quality control and is **retained in the ER and targeted for degradation**, never reaching the plasma membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=the%20mutation%20F508del,44%7D%20Subsequently%2C%20the%20mutant%20protein)). This leads to a severe **class II** CF mutation phenotype: essentially no functional CFTR on the cell surface. Patients homozygous for ΔF508 typically have classic, severe CF: early onset of pancreatic insufficiency, recurrent respiratory infections, and high sweat chloride. Other relatively common CF mutations include **G551D** (a class III gating mutation where CFTR reaches the membrane but fails to open properly) and **W1282X** (a class I premature stop codon leading to no protein). Each class of mutations contributes to the CF phenotype by reducing chloride channel activity through different mechanisms (no protein, mislocalized protein, non-functional protein, etc.).

The **clinical phenotype of cystic fibrosis** stems from the loss of CFTR function in multiple organs. In the **lungs**, CF patients accumulate thick, sticky mucus in the airways due to **defective chloride secretion and unopposed sodium hyperabsorption** – this dehydrated mucus impairs mucociliary clearance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=%28CFTR%29%20anion%20channel,ENaC%20is%20negatively%20regulated%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=affects%20epithelia%20lining%20the%20intestines%2C,in%20a%20double%20hit%20of)). The lungs of CF patients are characterized by **viscous mucus, chronic colonization by bacteria, persistent neutrophilic inflammation, and progressive airway damage** (bronchiectasis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=affects%20epithelia%20lining%20the%20intestines%2C,in%20a%20double%20hit%20of)). Recurrent pulmonary infections (with characteristic pathogens like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus*) are common and lead to chronic respiratory failure, which is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. In the **pancreas**, CFTR dysfunction causes thick secretions that obstruct the pancreatic ducts, leading to **pancreatic insufficiency** (in ~85% of patients) and malabsorption of nutrients. Digestive symptoms such as failure to thrive, steatorrhea, and vitamin deficiencies are often present from infancy. The **sweat glands** in CF cannot reabsorb salt, so patients have **salty sweat** – sweat chloride concentration >60 mmol/L is a diagnostic hallmark. The **male reproductive tract** is affected such that >95% of men with CF have **obstructive azoospermia due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=CBAVD%20may%20occur%20as%20an,CFTR)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=match%20at%20L60%20anion%20secretion,reproductive%20physiology%20remains%20to%20be)). This is an important phenotype: during embryogenesis, CFTR absence leads to degeneration or atresia of the Wolffian ducts (which form the vas deferens), rendering most male CF patients infertile. (Notably, CBAVD can also appear in men without full CF; see below.) Other features of CF include **meconium ileus** in newborns (intestinal obstruction due to thick meconium), electrolyte imbalances, and clubbing of fingers due to chronic lung hypoxia. CF is typically diagnosed in early childhood via newborn screening or clinical features, and confirmed by genetic testing or sweat chloride test.

In addition to classic cystic fibrosis, **CFTR mutations cause a spectrum of CFTR-related disorders** with variable organ involvement. Some individuals carry *milder mutations* or are compound heterozygotes (one severe, one mild allele) and may **not have full CF**, but present with single-organ phenotypes. A prime example is **Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens (CBAVD)** in otherwise healthy men – this condition is **“CFTR-related infertility”**, where 60–80% of affected men have at least one CFTR mutation (often one mild and one severe allele) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=match%20at%20L60%20anion%20secretion,reproductive%20physiology%20remains%20to%20be)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=A%20meta,had%20two)). These men typically have normal lungs and pancreas, but due to CFTR-related developmental issues, their vas deferens is missing or blocked, causing obstructive azoospermia. **Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis** is another condition that can be CFTR-related: individuals with recurrent pancreatitis have a higher incidence of CFTR mutations (particularly mild or intermediate variants) than the general population, suggesting CFTR dysfunction can predispose to pancreatic duct blockages under stress. Similarly, some cases of **idiopathic bronchiectasis** in adults and **nasal polyposis** have been linked to mild CFTR mutations that didn’t cause full-blown CF but reduced channel function partially. These milder phenotypes are sometimes termed **CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD)** or CF “mono-symptomatic” disease. They reinforce the idea that CFTR activity >10–20% of normal can suffice to prevent systemic CF, but localized reductions can still cause organ-specific illness.

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that carrying a single CFTR mutation (being a CF carrier) might confer some advantage, such as resistance to secretory diarrheas (cholera, typhoid) – the **heterozygote advantage** theory. Indeed, cells with half-normal CFTR activity secrete less fluid during cholera toxin challenge, potentially improving survival from cholera ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=result%20in%20life,of%20mortality%20in%20early%20childhood)). This is one proposed reason for the relatively high carrier frequency of CFTR mutations (about 1 in 25 people of European descent carry a CF mutation). While this evolutionary hypothesis is hard to prove, it is consistent with epidemiological observations and experiments in CFTR-modulated mice intestines.

CFTR mutations are also associated with some **multisystem conditions** beyond CF. For instance, CFTR dysfunction leads to abnormally acidic airway surface liquid and impaired bacterial killing, contributing to the intense inflammation in CF lungs. Chronic infection and inflammation in CF can result in complications like **CF-related diabetes (CFRD)** (due to pancreatic damage), **osteoporosis** (from malabsorption and inflammation), and **liver disease** (biliary cirrhosis from clogged bile ducts in ~5% of patients). All these can be considered downstream phenotypes of CFTR loss.

In summary, **CFTR is crucial for normal physiology, and its loss-of-function causes cystic fibrosis**, defined by a triad of **respiratory, digestive, and reproductive manifestations** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=sterility%20of%20the%20lung,ENaC%20is%20negatively%20regulated%20by)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3784186/#:~:text=affects%20epithelia%20lining%20the%20intestines%2C,in%20a%20double%20hit%20of)). The discovery of CFTR in 1989 was a turning point that allowed genetic diagnosis of CF ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=77,Identification%20of%20the)), and decades of research have linked specific CFTR genotypes to phenotypes. For example, patients with residual CFTR function (from certain missense mutations or splice variants) often have pancreatic sufficiency and longer survival, whereas those with two severe null mutations have classic, severe CF (pancreatic insufficiency, early pulmonary disease). **Targeted therapies** now exist for some CFTR mutations (see Key Experimental Evidence), further underscoring the pathogenic role of CFTR defects. Beyond CF, **partial CFTR dysfunction** can cause selective disorders like CBAVD and pancreatitis, making CFTR a gene with a broad clinical impact depending on the extent of functional loss ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=match%20at%20L60%20anion%20secretion,reproductive%20physiology%20remains%20to%20be)).

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The CFTR protein is large (1480 amino acids) and has a complex domain architecture characteristic of ABC transporters. It consists of **five key domains** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=chloride%20ions%20across%20the%20epithelium,the%20two%20NBDs%20regulate%20the)):

- **Two Membrane-Spanning Domains (MSD1 and MSD2)**: Each MSD is composed of 6 **transmembrane helices**, so CFTR has 12 transmembrane segments in total ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=chloride%20ions%20across%20the%20epithelium,the%20two%20NBDs%20regulate%20the)). These helices form the **chloride channel pore** through the membrane. The arrangement is often described as a *6+6 topology*: MSD1 (helices 1–6) and MSD2 (helices 7–12) come together to create a continuous channel pathway. Within the pore, certain transmembrane segments – notably TM6 and TM12 – line the narrow portion of the channel and contribute critical residues that determine anion selectivity and conductance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Although%20the%20cargos%20for%20CFTR,see%20below)). For example, basic residues in these helices (like lysine and arginine) help attract Cl⁻ into the pore ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). CFTR’s pore has a gate located near the extracellular end of the transmembrane segments, which is closed in the resting state and opens upon ATP-driven conformational changes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=sites%20are%20identical,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). Notably, CFTR’s MSDs share structural homology with other ABC transporters – they have the same fold – but CFTR has evolved an open channel pore rather than an occluded substrate-binding chamber ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,bound%20NBDs)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Although%20the%20cargos%20for%20CFTR,see%20below)).

- **Two Nucleotide-Binding Domains (NBD1 and NBD2)**: These are **cytosolic domains** located on the intracellular side of the membrane, highly conserved in sequence among ABC transporters ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=chloride%20ions%20across%20the%20epithelium,the%20two%20NBDs%20regulate%20the)). NBD1 lies between MSD1 and the R domain, and NBD2 lies at the C-terminal tail after MSD2. The NBDs each bind ATP at a pocket formed at the dimer interface. Uniquely in CFTR, the two NBDs are somewhat asymmetric: NBD1 has a “degenerate” ATP-binding site (the Walker B lysine is missing), while NBD2 has a canonical ATP site. When ATP binds, NBD1 and NBD2 dimerize in a **head-to-tail fashion**, creating two composite ATP-binding sites at the interface ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). This NBD **dimerization** is the engine that opens the channel gate in the MSDs. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis (mainly at the NBD2 site) destabilizes the dimer, leading to gate closure. Thus, the NBDs **regulate the gating** of the channel pore ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=connected%20by%20the%20R%20domain%2C,phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain)). Each NBD of CFTR contains the typical ABC motifs: Walker A (P-loop), Walker B, the C-loop (ABC signature sequence LSGGQ), the H-loop, and the Q-loop. **ΔF508**, the deletion of phenylalanine 508, resides in NBD1 (within a loop connecting the β-strands of NBD1) and disrupts the packing and thermal stability of NBD1 as well as NBD1-NBD2 interface formation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=surface%20closes%20the%20channel,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). This illustrates how critical NBD structure is for CFTR folding and function. In healthy CFTR, the two NBDs work in concert: when **ATP binds both sites, the NBDs form a “nucleotide sandwich” dimer, which is linked to a conformational change that opens the channel pore** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). The NBDs also harbor binding sites for regulatory factors; for instance, NBD1 has a binding interface for the R domain (when unphosphorylated) and for some chaperones, and NBD2 contains the site of ATP hydrolysis that triggers channel closure.

- **Regulatory R Domain**: This is a unique domain found **only in CFTR** (absent in other ABC proteins) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=connected%20by%20the%20R%20domain%2C,phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain)). It is a ~200 amino acid-long **intracellular domain** that connects NBD1 to MSD2 (hence “R” for regulatory region between the two halves of the protein) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=chloride%20ions%20across%20the%20epithelium,the%20two%20NBDs%20regulate%20the)). The R domain is rich in serine and threonine residues and contains **multiple consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (approximately 8–10 sites)** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=et%20al,plus)). In its **unphosphorylated state**, the R domain acts as an inhibitory plug: it interacts with parts of NBD1 and likely the intracellular loops of the MSDs to **prevent channel opening** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). When PKA phosphorylates several of the serines (including S660, S737, S795, among others) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=et%20al,plus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)), the R domain undergoes a conformational and electrostatic change, disengaging from its binding sites. This **relieves inhibition** and permits the NBDs to dimerize and open the channel ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). Functional studies showed that deleting the R domain yields a CFTR channel that is constitutively open (even without PKA), confirming its role as a “gatekeeper” that must be phosphorylated to activate CFTR ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). Structurally, the R domain is **intrinsically disordered** or flexible in nature (which is why it wasn’t fully resolved in early CFTR structures) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Structure-of-CFTR-A-Linear-schematic-of-CFTR-domain-organization-B-Side-view-left_fig1_338553884#:~:text=view%20,EM)). However, recent cryo-EM of phosphorylated CFTR shows part of the R domain displaced away from the NBD interface, consistent with the model that the R domain, when phosphorylated, no longer blocks NBD dimerization ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=sites%20are%20identical,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). The R domain also contains sites for other modifications/regulation – e.g. it can be phosphorylated by PKC and AMPK (which modulate CFTR function), and it has been implicated in binding regulatory proteins. In summary, the R domain endows CFTR with **dynamic regulation by cellular signaling**, essentially turning CFTR into a tightly controlled ion channel that opens only under specific conditions (high cAMP/PKA activity) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain,Nairn%20AC%2C%20Gadsby%20DC%202000)). This is a key distinguishing feature of CFTR compared to constitutively active channels.

In addition to these core domains, CFTR has **N- and C-terminal tail regions** that serve important roles. The **C-terminus** (~30 residues after NBD2) contains the sequence *TRL*, a PDZ-binding ligand that anchors CFTR to scaffolding proteins as mentioned earlier ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=number%20of%20proteins%20have%20been,article%20reviews%20the%20most%20recent)). This C-terminal tail also has a biding site for filamin and other cytoskeletal elements, contributing to CFTR’s localization. The extreme N-terminus of CFTR (first ~80 residues) includes segments that help stabilize MSD1 and also an interaction site for coat proteins during trafficking. CFTR also has two predicted **glycosylation sites** in extracellular loop 4 (between TM7 and TM8), where N-linked oligosaccharides are attached in the Golgi ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=glycosylated%20transmembrane%20protein%20located%20in,1%20modules%20are)). These **glycosylations** are not required for channel function per se, but they appear to aid in proper folding and surface expression; glycosylation also increases CFTR’s molecular weight from ~140 kDa (core) to ~170 kDa (mature glycoform) and may protect it from proteases at the cell surface.

**Three-dimensional structural studies** have illuminated these domain features. In 2016, the first near-atomic resolution structure of CFTR (from zebrafish CFTR, 55% identical to human) was solved by cryo-EM ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,The%20structure%20also%20reveals%20why)). This structure captured CFTR in a **dephosphorylated, ATP-free “closed” state**, showing the two MSDs arranged with the pore closed by tight apposition of TM helices on the extracellular side ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=sites%20are%20identical,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). The R domain in this structure was not fully resolved (due to flexibility) but parts of it were seen occupying the space between NBD1 and NBD2, physically **preventing NBD dimerization** – a striking confirmation of the R domain’s inhibitory role ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=surface%20closes%20the%20channel,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). In 2017-2018, structures of human CFTR in an **ATP-bound, phosphorylated “open” state** were reported (e.g., with a gain-of-function mutation to trap it open). These revealed the NBDs in tight dimer, the R domain largely displaced, and a continuous open pore from the cytosol to the extracellular side. A comparison of closed vs open CFTR structures nicely explains how the domains move: upon phosphorylation, R domain moves away; upon ATP binding, NBDs clamp together, causing substantial rotation and straightening in certain transmembrane helices (like TM6 and TM12) that opens the channel gate. The pore is anion-selective due to rings of positively charged residues and a “bottleneck” region that likely corresponds to the selectivity filter ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). These structural insights also shed light on why certain mutations cause disease. For instance, the structures show that **F508 (phenylalanine 508)** in NBD1 sits at the interface that helps NBD1 dock onto MSD2; its deletion disrupts this interface, explaining the misfolding and instability of ΔF508-CFTR ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=surface%20closes%20the%20channel,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). Other mutation hotspots: **G551** (mutated to D in a common CF allele) lies in the ATP-binding site of NBD1, so G551D reduces ATP binding/hydrolysis, hence a gating defect; **R334** and **R347** in TM6 form part of the internal pore and their mutation alters ion conductance/selectivity; **N1303K** is in NBD2 and destabilizes the NBD or NBD-MSD coupling. The high conservation of these residues across species (many are identical from fish to human) underscores their structural importance ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,The%20structure%20also%20reveals%20why)).

In summary, CFTR’s protein structure comprises **two transmembrane domains forming the channel pore, two nucleotide-binding domains that govern gating, and a unique regulatory domain that must be phosphorylated for channel activity** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=chloride%20ions%20across%20the%20epithelium,phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain)). Additional features like the PDZ-binding C-terminus and glycosylation sites contribute to localization and stability. This **mosaic of domains** enables CFTR to function as a tightly controlled ion channel – a **“broken” ABC transporter that leaks anions** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,bound%20NBDs)), as it’s sometimes whimsically described, given that most ABC proteins are pumps. Each domain of CFTR is crucial: mutations in any one (MSDs, NBDs, R domain, or even the terminal tails) can impair channel function or stability and lead to disease. The structural and functional features detailed here form the basis for understanding how CFTR works normally and how it fails in cystic fibrosis.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
**Tissue Expression:** CFTR is expressed in a **tissue-specific** manner, largely in epithelial cells of organs involved in fluid and electrolyte transport. High levels of CFTR mRNA and protein are found in **exocrine tissues**, consistent with the clinical phenotype of CF. Key sites of expression include: 

- **Respiratory tract:** In the lungs, CFTR is expressed in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. Notably, its expression is **abundant in the submucosal glands** of the airways ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1285365/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mucus%20in%20human%20lung)). In submucosal gland serous cells, CFTR drives the secretion of Cl⁻ and fluid that, together with mucus from goblet cells, forms the airway surface liquid. CFTR is also present on the apical surface of ciliated cells in the surface epithelium, though single-cell RNA studies suggest a rare cell type called the **pulmonary ionocyte** may disproportionately express CFTR at very high levels to modulate airway surface hydration. (The identification of ionocytes as CFTR-rich cells was a recent finding in mice/humans, indicating CFTR expression can be quite cell-type specific even within a tissue.) In the nasal epithelium, CFTR is similarly expressed in the sinus and nasal gland cells – which is why nasal potential difference measurements (voltage changes due to CFTR-mediated Cl⁻ transport) are diagnostic for CF. 

- **Pancreas:** CFTR is highly expressed in the **ductal cells of the pancreas**. These cells lining the pancreatic ducts use CFTR to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid, which flushes digestive enzymes into the intestine and neutralizes acid. CFTR expression in acinar cells (enzyme-secreting cells) is low; it’s the duct cells that rely on CFTR for fluid secretion. The critical nature of CFTR in pancreatic ducts is highlighted by CF pathology: loss of CFTR causes ducts to clog and atrophy. 

- **Gastrointestinal tract:** In the **intestine**, CFTR is expressed in the **crypts of the small and large intestine**. Crypt enterocytes secrete Cl⁻ and fluids via CFTR, which is important for fecal hydration and mucosal function. CFTR is also found in the biliary tract epithelium (cholangiocytes in bile ducts), where it participates in bile fluid secretion. In the stomach, CFTR is present at lower levels, but interestingly, CFTR in **gastric and duodenal glands** helps secrete bicarbonate to protect the mucosa from acid. 

- **Sweat and salivary glands:** CFTR expression in **sweat gland ducts** is crucial for reabsorbing salt from sweat. It’s also present in salivary gland ducts, though CF patients don’t usually have dry mouth, suggesting redundancy in salivary glands. 

- **Kidney and reproductive tracts:** CFTR is expressed in parts of the kidney tubules (e.g., in the distal nephron/collecting duct, though kidney function is not grossly impaired in CF, possibly due to compensation by other channels). In the **male reproductive tract**, CFTR is found in the epididymal duct and vas deferens epithelia, as well as in developing **sperm**. In the female reproductive tract, CFTR is present in the endocervix and may contribute to cervical mucus properties. 

- **Other tissues:** CFTR has low-level expression in some tissues like the choroid plexus (brain) and some immune cells, but its functional significance there is less clear. 

These patterns show that CFTR is mainly in epithelial barriers and glandular tissues – aligning with its role in trans-epithelial ion transport. Indeed, **in situ hybridization and immunostaining** studies confirmed CFTR’s expression is **highly polarized and restricted** to certain cell types, even within an organ ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1285365/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mucus%20in%20human%20lung)). For example, one study showed **>90% of CFTR mRNA signal in human bronchus was from submucosal gland cells**, with only a minority from surface epithelium ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1285365/#:~:text=The%20cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance,of%20mucus%20in%20human%20lung)). Another example: in the intestine, CFTR is in crypt enterocytes but not on the surface villi cells which instead absorb nutrients and electrolytes. This **cell-specific expression** explains why CFTR mutations have pronounced effects on organs with those specialized cells.

**Regulation of Gene Expression:** The CFTR gene spans a large ~190 kb locus on chromosome 7q31.2, with 27 exons. **Transcriptional regulation** of CFTR is complex, involving tissue-specific promoters and long-range regulatory elements ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10341594/#:~:text=issue%2C%20we%20present%20several%20regulatory,gene%20to%20enhance%20our%20knowledge)). The **basal promoter** of CFTR (upstream of exon 1) is unusual in that it lacks a TATA box and initiator elements; it has multiple start sites and is embedded in a CpG island, suggesting a housekeeping or broadly active promoter structure. However, this promoter alone does not account for the highly restricted expression pattern. Research indicates that **cis-regulatory elements** (enhancers/silencers) located both upstream and within introns of CFTR confer tissue specificity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10341594/#:~:text=issue%2C%20we%20present%20several%20regulatory,gene%20to%20enhance%20our%20knowledge)). For instance, intron 1 of CFTR contains enhancer elements important for intestinal expression, and elements in intron 11 and 17a have been implicated in airway cell expression. **Chromatin looping** brings these enhancers in contact with the promoter in tissues where CFTR is active ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10341594/#:~:text=issue%2C%20we%20present%20several%20regulatory,gene%20to%20enhance%20our%20knowledge)). Identified transcription factors that positively regulate CFTR in certain tissues include *HNF1α* and *HNF1β* (which bind an enhancer in intron 1, critical for intestinal and pancreatic expression), *Forkhead box* factors, *Ets* factors, and others ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10341594/#:~:text=issue%2C%20we%20present%20several%20regulatory,gene%20to%20enhance%20our%20knowledge)). In airway epithelial cells, *CREB* and *AP-1* have been noted to bind CFTR regulatory regions in response to cAMP or inflammatory signals. Negative regulation can occur via factors like *FoxA2* in lung (which represses CFTR in goblet cells) and *TGF-β* signaling (inflammation and TGF-β can downregulate CFTR transcription, partly explaining why CFTR expression drops during chronic infection/inflammation in CF lungs). The CFTR gene also has **alternative promoters/first exons** that generate tissue-specific isoforms (e.g., a testis-specific transcript starting at exon 1b). Overall, CFTR gene expression is finely tuned, which is why even heterozygous carriers (with ~50% gene dose) typically have sufficient CFTR expression for normal function; many tissues likely express more CFTR mRNA than the minimum needed, providing a buffer.

**Post-transcriptional regulation** is also important. CFTR mRNA has a long 3′ UTR with regulatory sequences. Several **microRNAs** (miR-509-3p, miR-494, miR-145, etc.) have been shown to bind CFTR mRNA and reduce its stability or translation, thereby modulating CFTR levels in cells. These miRNAs are upregulated in some inflammatory states, which might partially explain the decreased CFTR expression in inflamed airways (as in chronic lung disease). On the other hand, RNA-binding proteins like HuR can stabilize CFTR mRNA under some conditions.

**Protein-level regulation:** The CFTR protein’s function is acutely regulated by **phosphorylation**. PKA is the primary activator via R domain phosphorylation (as described), but other kinases can fine-tune CFTR activity. **Protein kinase C (PKC)** can phosphorylate CFTR at alternate sites (including some in the R domain and NBD), generally potentiating PKA’s effect (PKC “primes” CFTR for PKA or can slightly activate CFTR independently) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=et%20al,plus)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). **AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)**, which senses cellular energy, can phosphorylate CFTR at a site (Ser768 in R domain) that **inhibits CFTR** – effectively AMPK signals low cellular ATP by damping CFTR activity, linking metabolic state to ion transport ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=2009.%20AMP,Google%20Scholar)). This multi-kinase regulation ensures CFTR activity is integrated with cell signaling networks. Moreover, CFTR is subject to **ubiquitination** and turnover: its C-terminal PDZ-binding keeps it in complexes that limit its ubiquitination. If CFTR is ubiquitinated (e.g., by the E3 ligase CHIP or the adaptor CAL), it is targeted to **endosomes and lysosomes for degradation**. Cell stress or certain signaling can accelerate CFTR internalization. For instance, activation of PKC can also promote internalization of CFTR (despite increasing its activity), as a feedback limit. Conversely, some signaling (like cAMP itself) slows CFTR endocytosis to retain it at the membrane during secretory responses.

**Developmental and cell-type regulation:** CFTR expression changes with developmental stage. In human fetal lung, CFTR is actually quite highly expressed in the canalicular stage (mid-gestation), possibly to help liquid secretion in developing airways. After birth, CFTR levels in lung change – interestingly, a drop in certain airway cells and restriction mostly to submucosal glands and ionocytes. In the pancreas, CFTR expression ramps up as the ducts mature. Hormonal regulation has been observed: e.g., **glucocorticoids** (stress hormones) can increase CFTR expression in lung epithelia, and **thyroid hormone** has been shown to influence CFTR levels during development. 

**Quantitative expression:** The absolute level of CFTR in most cells is fairly low compared to housekeeping proteins. It’s estimated there are only ~5,000 CFTR molecules per epithelial cell in the airway surface epithelium, and perhaps 20,000 per submucosal gland cell – which is why even a moderate reduction can tip the balance in those cells. Nevertheless, studies have shown that as little as 5–10% of normal CFTR function is enough to avoid the classical CF symptoms in most organs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10494266/#:~:text=restores%20epithelial%20function%20better%20than,and%20exogenous%20CFTR%20expression%20in)). This is evident in patients with certain mild mutations or in carriers: they have intermediate ion transport but usually not disease. This **threshold effect** motivates gene therapy or other upregulation strategies – even partial restoration of CFTR expression (to >10% normal) in the airway could be therapeutically beneficial, as seen with new drugs.

In summary, CFTR’s expression is **tightly controlled temporally, spatially, and by signaling pathways**. It is largely confined to specialized epithelial cells where its function is needed for secretion or absorption. Its gene regulation involves multiple layers (chromatin, transcription factors, mRNA stability) to achieve the correct expression pattern. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for Gene Ontology curation, as it connects CFTR to processes like *epithelial cell differentiation* (which transcription factors turn CFTR on in certain lineages), *response to hormonal stimulus* (CFTR upregulation by hormones), and *response to cellular stress* (downregulation by inflammatory signals). These regulation aspects ensure CFTR is present in the right place and time to fulfill its role in epithelial physiology.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
CFTR has a fascinating evolutionary story as it is the only ABC transporter known to function as an ion channel. CFTR appears to have arisen in the vertebrate lineage **over 550 million years ago**, diverging from a close ancestor similar to ABCC4 (an ATP-driven organic anion pump) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=structure%2Ffunction%20would%20provide%20novel%20insight,a%20CFTR%20orthologue%20in%20the)). A CFTR ortholog has been identified in the **sea lamprey**, an ancient jawless fish, which is thought to represent the most basal version of CFTR in evolution ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=clone%20and%20characterize%20the%20Lp,a%20CFTR%20orthologue%20in%20the)). Lamprey CFTR (Lp-CFTR) shares many features with human CFTR but also shows some functional differences (e.g., different single-channel conductance and regulation), indicating that CFTR’s channel function was still being optimized in early vertebrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=of%20CFTR%20and%20the%20recent,2019a)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=new%20orthologue%20thus%20provides%20the,the%20sea%20lamprey%20represents%20an)). As vertebrates evolved, CFTR sequences have been conserved with notable constraints on regions critical for function, reflecting strong **purifying selection** to maintain ion channel activity.

**Sequence conservation:** Across mammalian CFTR proteins, the amino acid identity is quite high. Human and chimpanzee CFTR are almost identical (>98%). Human vs. mouse CFTR is ~78% identical at the protein level (and ~88% similar including conservative substitutions). Importantly, domains essential for function (the MSDs and NBDs) are far more conserved than the disordered R domain or the terminal tails. **Cross-species functional studies** have shown that mouse CFTR can substitute for human in many assays (though there are subtle differences like mouse CFTR has a lower single-channel conductance and different regulation by nucleotides ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2230885/#:~:text=Comparison%20of%20the%20gating%20behaviour,Author))). CFTR is found in all mammals studied, as well as birds, reptiles, and amphibians, indicating it was present in their common ancestor (the tetrapods). In fish, most teleost (bony fish) have a CFTR gene that closely resembles mammalian CFTR in domain structure. The zebrafish CFTR (55% identity to human) has been functionally expressed in oocytes and shown to be cAMP-activated and ATP-gated just like human CFTR ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,The%20structure%20also%20reveals%20why)). In fact, structural studies used zebrafish CFTR to get the first high-res model, and they found that **42 of 46 known disease-causing missense sites in human CFTR are identical in zebrafish CFTR** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=electron%20cryo,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). This highlights an extraordinary conservation of critical residues – presumably those needed for folding, ion conduction, and gating – from fish to humans. Examples of such conserved residues are the nucleotide-binding motifs in NBDs, the signature sequence LSGGQ, the gating residue Walker B glutamate in NBD2, the pore-lining arginines (R347, R352) in TM6, etc., all of which are conserved and known that if mutated, often cause CF in humans ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,The%20structure%20also%20reveals%20why)).

**Unique evolutionary adaptations:** CFTR’s evolution from a transporter to a channel likely involved **“degrading” the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and solute transport**, effectively creating a leak channel. Comparisons between CFTR and its closest transporter relatives (like ABCC4, ABCC1) show that CFTR has acquired certain mutations that would be detrimental for a pump but are beneficial for a channel. For example, CFTR has substitutions in the MSDs that open an aqueous pathway: residues that are bulky or charged in CFTR pore correspond to smaller or hydrophobic residues in transporters. Two conserved salt bridges (R347-D924 and R352-D993, connecting TM6 to TM10/TM12) are found in all CFTRs of jawed vertebrates and help stabilize the open pore, but in related ABCC transporters those positions are different (one of the pair is hydrophobic) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=the%20evolutionary%20transition%20from%20transporter,consist%20of%20one%20residue)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=Evolution%20of%20pore,conserved%20features%2C%20in%20the%20evolutionary)). The appearance of these **intra-pore salt bridges** during evolution was a key step in converting the alternating-access transporter into a permanently open pathway when the gate is unlocked ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=the%20evolutionary%20transition%20from%20transporter,consist%20of%20one%20residue)). Another change is the incorporation of the **R domain**: CFTR is the only ABC protein with this regulatory extension. Sequence analysis suggests the R domain was pieced together by adding new sequence between the existing NBD1 and MSD2 of an ancestral transporter ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=connected%20by%20the%20R%20domain%2C,27)). The R domain is conserved among CFTR orthologs (even lamprey CFTR has a shorter R domain with phosphorylation sites), implying that the advent of PKA regulation coincided with the emergence of CFTR ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=MSD%20domains%20form%20a%20selective,16)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=Evolution%20of%20CFTR%20regulation%20by,phosphorylation%20of%20its%20R%20domain)). This provided a mechanism to tightly control channel opening – likely an advantage for organisms needing to regulate salt/water secretion in response to hormones.

**Orthologs and paralogs:** CFTR itself does not have paralogs in the human genome (there is just one CFTR gene). However, it is part of the **ABCC subfamily** (also called MRP family), which includes ABCC1, ABCC2, etc., through ABCC12. CFTR (ABCC7) is most closely related to ABCC4 and ABCC5 by sequence. Interestingly, in some lower vertebrates, there are multiple CFTR-like genes (probably due to genome duplications in teleost fish) – for instance, frogs or fish might have two CFTR genes, one of which can be more specialized. But in mammals, only one CFTR gene exists, and its function appears to cover all needed roles.

**Functional conservation:** Experiments swapping CFTR genes between species show conservation of function. Mouse CFTR “knock-in” (replacing the mouse Cftr with human CFTR) rescues the CF traits in Cftr-knockout mice, confirming that human CFTR can function in the mouse context and vice versa. However, there are some species differences in physiology: mice with CFTR deletion do not develop the same spontaneous lung disease as humans – partially due to differences in lung submucosal glands and alternative Cl⁻ channels. Pigs and ferrets, whose CFTR is ~95% identical to human, do develop CF-like disease when CFTR is knocked out, demonstrating the functional equivalence of these orthologs to human CFTR in vivo. 

From an evolutionary perspective, CFTR’s role in *salt and water homeostasis* may have been particularly important for land-dwelling vertebrates that need to regulate hydration of epithelial surfaces (lung, cornea, etc.) and conserve salt (sweat glands, kidneys). The presence of CFTR in fish suggests an ancestral role in osmoregulation as well – fish use CFTR in gill chloride cells to excrete salt in seawater species. Indeed, fish CFTR is expressed in gills and plays a role in ionic regulation of body fluids in different salinities.

**Disease mutations and evolution:** Sites of CFTR that are **not well-conserved** across species tend to be ones where human-pathogenic mutations are rarer, or where variation may modulate function without eliminating it. Conversely, many CF-causing mutations occur at **highly conserved residues**, indicating those positions are intolerant to change through evolution. Some researchers have analyzed CFTR through the lens of evolutionary **“actionability”** – positions that evolved differently in certain species might hint at ways to alter CFTR function. For example, sharks and skates (cartilaginous fish) have an anion channel similar to CFTR but somewhat different in regulatory properties (and they lack submucosal glands etc.). Studying these differences can provide insight (like certain residues in R domain or NBD2 that changed could inform how to make CFTR more or less active).

In conclusion, CFTR is **highly conserved among vertebrates**, with critical functional domains preserved from fish to humans ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,The%20structure%20also%20reveals%20why)). Its emergence was a key innovation allowing regulated chloride channel activity, which has been maintained due to its importance in physiological processes. The evolutionary constraint on CFTR is evidenced by the fact that even minor perturbations (mutations) at conserved sites often lead to cystic fibrosis in humans, underscoring that CFTR’s sequence has been honed by natural selection for an optimal balance of stability and function. From a GO perspective, one could say CFTR is involved in **evolutionarily conserved processes** like “anion transport” across epithelia, and its regulation by phosphorylation is an ancient mechanism that links environmental signals (like hormones) to ion transport – a principle that likely conferred advantages throughout vertebrate evolution ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7533508/#:~:text=MSD%20domains%20form%20a%20selective,16)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8640958/#:~:text=Evolution%20of%20CFTR%20regulation%20by,phosphorylation%20of%20its%20R%20domain)).

## Key Experimental Evidence and Landmark Studies  
- **Gene Identification (1989):** The CFTR gene was identified as the cystic fibrosis gene through positional cloning by Francis Collins, Lap-Chee Tsui, John R. Riordan and colleagues ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Effect%20of%20deleting%20the%20R,M%2C%20Smith%20AE%2C%20Welsh%20MJ)). In 1989 they isolated cDNA clones from chromosome 7q31 and discovered mutations (including the ΔF508 deletion) in CF patients, establishing CFTR as the causative gene ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=have%20been%20described%2C%20among%20which,of%20CF)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=the%20mutation%20F508del,44%7D%20Subsequently%2C%20the%20mutant%20protein)). This seminal discovery ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Effect%20of%20deleting%20the%20R,M%2C%20Smith%20AE%2C%20Welsh%20MJ)) led to a molecular test for CF and opened the door to studying CFTR biochemistry.

- **CFTR is a Chloride Channel (1991):** Shortly after cloning, confirming CFTR’s function was critical. In 1991, **Beer et al.** and **Anderson et al.** expressed CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian cell lines, showing that CFTR alone could induce cAMP-activated Cl⁻ currents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). **Welsh and coworkers** recorded **single-channel chloride currents** from CFTR expressed in planar lipid bilayers, demonstrating a linear I/V curve and ~8–10 pS conductance typical of a channel ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=HCO3,When%20channels%20were%20incubated%20with)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=different%20%5BCl,CFTR)). They also altered CFTR’s anion selectivity by mutating pore residues, definitively proving CFTR forms a chloride channel pore ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=AE%2C%20Welsh%20MJ%201991b,of%20the%20sixth%20transmembrane%20segment)). These experiments confirmed CFTR as a **bona fide ATP-gated Cl⁻ channel** and not a regulator of other channels only ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)).

- **Regulation by Phosphorylation (1991):** **Rich et al., Cell 1991** provided key evidence that the R domain controls channel gating. They created CFTR variants lacking most of the R domain and found these channels were constitutively active without PKA ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). This showed that the **unphosphorylated R domain exerts an inhibitory effect** on CFTR ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=How%20does%20the%20R%20domain,in%20the%20absence%20of%20PKA)). Complementary studies by **Tabcharani, Chang et al.** in 1991 demonstrated that adding PKA (or cAMP) dramatically increased open probability of wild-type CFTR in excised patches ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain,Nairn%20AC%2C%20Gadsby%20DC%202000)), and that mutating key serines in the R domain reduced this regulation. Together, this established PKA phosphorylation of the R domain as *the* activating switch for CFTR ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=Phosphorylation%20of%20the%20R%20domain,Nairn%20AC%2C%20Gadsby%20DC%202000)). 

- **ATP Gating and Hydrolysis (1991–1993):** Through patch-clamp analysis and kinetic modeling, **Gadsby, Hwang, and colleagues** worked out that CFTR gating follows a **cyclic ATP hydrolysis-driven scheme ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with))**. Notably, **Anderson & Welsh 1992** and **Hwang et al. 1993** observed that non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs could open CFTR but then the channel stuck open for prolonged durations, implying that ATP binding opens the gate and ATP hydrolysis closes it. The discovery of the **E1371Q mutant** (in NBD2) that greatly prolongs open time supported the idea that hydrolysis at NBD2 is the step required for closure ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=sites%20are%20identical,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). These studies showed CFTR functions like a “gated enzyme”: it requires ATP binding (thus CFTR has **ATPase-coupled channel activity**) and each gating cycle is coupled to ATP hydrolysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3530039/#:~:text=While%20other%20members%20of%20the,facing%E2%80%9D%20TMDs%20with)). This was a paradigm shift, distinguishing CFTR’s mechanism from other channels.

- **Bicarbonate Permeability (1994):** **Smith, Dawson, and Fitz** published in 1994 (PNAS) the first direct evidence that CFTR can conduct HCO₃⁻ ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=different%20%5BCl,CFTR)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=functions%20as%20a%20base%20loader,likely%20contributes%20to%20the%20epithelial)). Using patch-clamp and pH-sensitive dye, they measured CFTR-mediated currents in varying Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ conditions and found a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ permeability ratio ~3.8 (meaning HCO₃⁻ permeates ~25% as well as Cl⁻) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC43990/#:~:text=different%20%5BCl,CFTR)). This explained why CF patients have acidic secretions and laid groundwork for linking CFTR to bicarbonate-related issues (like in CF pancreatitis). It also extended CFTR’s GO annotations to **bicarbonate transport**, and led to subsequent findings that CFTR interacts with HCO₃⁻ exchangers (e.g. SLC26A6) to enhance bicarbonate secretion.

- **Protein Interactions and Localization (1998–2001):** Breakthroughs in understanding CFTR’s cellular context came when **Short et al. (1998)** and **Yesylevskyy et al.** identified the CFTR **C-terminal PDZ-binding motif** and showed CFTR binds to the EBP50/NHERF1 scaffold ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=number%20of%20proteins%20have%20been,article%20reviews%20the%20most%20recent)). In 1999, **Moyer et al. (JCI)** demonstrated that deleting the last 3 residues of CFTR (TRL) mislocalized CFTR away from the apical membrane, and that NHERF1 helps keep CFTR polarized apically ([www.jci.org](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/7453#:~:text=JCI%20,HA%20mAb%2012CA5.%20Cells)). Around the same time, **Sun et al. (2000)** and **Hegan et al.** discovered CFTR also associates with **ezrin, CAP70 (CAL), and other proteins** that form a protein complex regulating its endocytic recycling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=NHERF1,CAL%20expression%20levels%20will%20increase)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=limits%20cell,using%20fluorescence%20polarization%2C%20isothermal%20titration)). These findings constituted key evidence that CFTR’s function is modulated by a network of interacting proteins, explaining how CFTR is targeted to specific membrane domains and how its surface expression is dynamically regulated.

- **ΔF508 Folding Defect Characterization (1992–1995):** Early after CFTR’s discovery, it was found that ΔF508-CFTR fails to mature. **Cheng et al. (Cell 1990)** noted ΔF508 produces only the core-glycosylated band (Band B) and not the mature Band C, indicating ER retention. In 1992, **Gregory et al.** showed that incubating ΔF508-expressing cells at lower temperature (26–30°C) could partially rescue its folding (“temperature rescue”), which was key evidence that ΔF508’s major defect is **protein misfolding and quality control**. Later, **Denning et al. (1992)** confirmed that ΔF508 is degraded by the proteasome. These studies provided the rationale for *chemical chaperones* and, decades later, small-molecule **“correctors”** to rescue misfolded CFTR. Indeed, this body of work is at the foundation of modern CF therapeutics (corrector drugs like lumacaftor were designed to assist ΔF508 folding, based on these findings).

- **Pharmacological Rescue (2003–2012):** A major milestone was the discovery of **small-molecule modulators** of CFTR. In 2003, the compound **VX-770 (Ivacaftor)** was identified as a **CFTR potentiator** that can greatly increase the activity (open time) of certain mutant CFTR channels (notably G551D). Clinical trials of Ivacaftor in G551D CF patients showed dramatic improvement in lung function, marking the first medication to treat the CFTR defect itself. This was proof-of-concept that CFTR’s channel activity can be pharmacologically enhanced in vivo, vindicating decades of channel research. Subsequently, **corrector compounds** (like VX-809 lumacaftor, VX-661 tezacaftor, and VX-445 elexacaftor) were developed to **improve CFTR folding and trafficking** (especially for ΔF508). The FDA approvals of combination corrector/potentiator therapies (e.g., **Trikafta** in 2019) have resulted in life-changing outcomes for many CF patients, effectively increasing CFTR function from minimal to significant levels in patients with ΔF508 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=have%20been%20described%2C%20among%20which,of%20CF)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2989726/#:~:text=the%20mutation%20F508del,44%7D%20Subsequently%2C%20the%20mutant%20protein)). These therapeutic successes heavily relied on the prior experimental evidence about CFTR structure–function (to screen and design molecules) and cell-based assays of CFTR channel activity.

- **Structure Determination (2017):** The determination of CFTR’s 3D structure by **Liu, Zhang, Chen et al.** using cryo-EM was a landmark in CFTR research ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=channel%20evolved%20from%20the%20ATP,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). It provided direct visualization of CFTR’s MSD and NBD arrangement, the R-domain location, and explained the mechanistic basis of gating and many mutations. For instance, seeing the occluded vs open pore and the NBD dimer confirmed models from functional studies ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912062/#:~:text=sites%20are%20identical,to%20defects%20either%20in%20folding)). The structural data now guide structure-based drug design (new correctors binding at domain interfaces, potentiators stabilizing the open state, etc.). This experimental achievement was the culmination of many incremental advances (including low-res EM maps in 2002 and 3D reconstructions in 2008 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2573082/#:~:text=Conductance%20Regulator%20Chloride%20Channel%20Revealed,Structure%20with%20Orifices%20beneath%20the))), and it has since allowed researchers to simulate CFTR dynamics and better understand the **“molecular mechanics”** of CFTR function and dysfunction.

- **Animal Models (1992–2010s):** Creating Cftr-knockout mice (DorIN et al. 1992) was pivotal experimental evidence linking CFTR loss to disease phenotypes (meconium ileus in mice, etc.), albeit mice didn’t show lung disease spontaneously. Later, **Cftr^-/- pigs and ferrets** (2010s) were generated and they *did* develop CF-like lung infections and pancreatic disease, strongly validating CFTR’s role in those processes. These models provided experimental platforms to test gene therapy, genetic repair (e.g., CRISPR correction in patient-derived organoids), and understand the pathogenesis of CF lung disease in ways cell culture couldn’t – for example, pig models showed that submucosal gland dysfunction and reduced airway surface liquid precede infections, evidencing CFTR’s primary role in lung defense. 

Each of these experiments and milestones (from gene cloning to structural biology) forms the evidence base for our current understanding of CFTR, directly informing its annotation in the Gene Ontology. They connect CFTR to specific molecular functions (ATP binding, chloride channel activity), biological processes (ion transport, response to cAMP), and disease phenotypes (cystic fibrosis and related conditions) with high confidence. The rich literature on CFTR – spanning over three decades – continues to grow, with ongoing research into areas like CFTR’s role in the immune system, its detailed gating kinetics, and new therapies (e.g., mRNA therapy for CFTR). For GO curation purposes, CFTR is one of the best-characterized human genes, with extensive experimental support linking it to its myriad functions and effects in health and disease.
