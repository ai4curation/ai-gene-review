## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P13569
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator {ECO:0000305}; Short=CFTR; AltName: Full=ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 7; AltName: Full=Channel conductance-controlling ATPase; EC=5.6.1.6 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11524016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15284228, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26627831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8910473}; AltName: Full=cAMP-dependent chloride channel;
- **Gene Information:** Name=CFTR {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:1884}; Synonyms=ABCC7;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ABC transporter superfamily. ABCC family.
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ABC1_TM_dom. (IPR011527); ABC1_TM_sf. (IPR036640); ABC_transporter-like_ATP-bd. (IPR003439); ABC_transporter-like_CS. (IPR017871)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "CFTR" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'CFTR' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **CFTR** (gene ID: CFTR, UniProt: P13569) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Verified identity: CFTR, UniProt P13569, human; an ABC transporter (ABCC7) that functions as an ATP-gated anion channel. Domain architecture aligns with literature: two transmembrane domains (TMDs), two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1/2) harboring ABC/AAA+ ATPase motifs, and an intrinsically disordered regulatory (R) domain rich in PKA phosphorylation sites; localization to the apical membrane of epithelia is consistently reported. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in the retrieved human-focused sources (CFTR is not ambiguous here). (schenkel2024frompurificationto pages 40-43, zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 30-34, upadhyay2024currentandfuture pages 1-2, castanier2024novelgainoffunctionmutants pages 1-2, fiedorczuk2024thestructuresofa pages 32-34)

Comprehensive research report: CFTR (ABCC7; UniProt P13569)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCC subfamily (ABCC7). Unlike most ABC transporters that are pumps, CFTR is an ATP-gated anion channel. (Cell/structural and recent reviews; doi:10.1073/pnas.2409049121 [PNAS, 2024] and allied preprint; doi:10.1101/2024.05.28.596263; bioRxiv, 2024) (fiedorczuk2024thestructuresofa pages 32-34, zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 30-34)
- Domain architecture: CFTR comprises two membrane-spanning domains (TMD1/2) that form the anion-conducting pore, two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1/2) with canonical Walker A/B and ABC-signature motifs (AAA+ ATPase fold), and a unique regulatory (R) domain with multiple PKA sites necessary for activation. (doi:10.1007/s00018-024-05431-9; CMLS, 2024; doi:10.1101/2024.05.28.596263; bioRxiv, 2024; structural/biophysical summaries) (castanier2024novelgainoffunctionmutants pages 1-2, fiedorczuk2024thestructuresofa pages 32-34, schenkel2024frompurificationto pages 40-43)
- Ion selectivity and substrates: CFTR conducts chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3−), with bicarbonate transport playing key roles in pH regulation and mucus properties on epithelial surfaces. (mechanistic reviews, 2023–2025) (zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 30-34, upadhyay2024currentandfuture pages 1-2)
- Subcellular and tissue localization: CFTR resides at the apical plasma membrane of epithelia in airways, pancreas, intestine, and other exocrine tissues; its expression is enriched in specialized airway epithelial cells (e.g., ionocytes/secretory cells). (Frontiers reviews and interactome studies; 2024–2025) (castanier2025étudedela pages 221-222, upadhyay2024currentandfuture pages 1-2)

Mechanism and pathways (current understanding)
- Gating mechanism: Activation requires phosphorylation of the R domain by protein kinase A (PKA), which relieves autoinhibition and enables ATP-driven gating. ATP binding at the two NBDs promotes NBD dimerization and pore opening; the sites are asymmetric with one catalytically competent and one degenerate site. Hydrolysis at the competent site drives dimer separation and channel closure. Recent cryo-EM of CFTR in complex with PKA-C provides structural evidence for docking of PKA and for reversible (noncatalytic) potentiation by PKA-C binding in open states. (doi:10.1101/2024.05.28.596263; bioRxiv, 2024) (fiedorczuk2024thestructuresofa pages 32-34, zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 34-40)
- Ion conduction and pore architecture: Contemporary computational and structural analyses refine how basic residues at TM portals and pore-lining helices support anion entry and permeation, consistent with ATP- and phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes observed across states. (2025 mechanistic analyses and reviews) (zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 34-40, zeng2025molecularmechanismof pages 30-34)
- Interaction networks and epithelial context: CFTR is scaffolded by PDZ-domain proteins (e.g., NHERF1) and coordinates with ENaC and SLC26 exchangers to regulate epithelial salt/water transport and airway surface liquid. These interactions couple CFTR to cAMP/PKA microdomains and broader signaling assemblies at the apical membrane. (reviews and interactome-oriented sources, 2024–2025) (castanier2025étudedelaa pages 221-222, schenkel2024frompurificationto pages 40-43)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- PKA–CFTR structural complex (2024): Cryo-EM structures of CFTR bound by PKA catalytic subunit explain how PKA docks to create two “catalytic stations” to access multiple phosphorylation sites and also serves as a reversible potentiator of channel activity independent of catalysis.

Conclusion
Human CFTR (ABCC7; UniProt P13569) is an ABC-family, ATP-gated anion channel localized to the apical membrane of epithelia. Its gating integrates PKA phosphorylation of a unique R domain with ATP-dependent NBD dimerization to regulate Cl−/HCO3− conductance and epithelial fluid homeostasis. 2023–2024 advances include direct structural visualization of PKA docking and reversible activation, refined perspectives on pore architecture and gating asymmetry, and expansion of mutation‑agnostic therapeutics (inhaled CFTR mRNA) in early clinical trials. Real-world evidence from compassionate programs and registries underscores transformative clinical impact of CFTR modulators while highlighting the importance of equitable access and rigorous data systems.
