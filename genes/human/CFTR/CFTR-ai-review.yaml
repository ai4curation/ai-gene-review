description: 'CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is a unique ABC transporter family member that functions as a phosphorylation- and ATP-regulated anion channel rather than an active pump. It primarily conducts chloride and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell apical membranes, playing critical roles in fluid secretion and mucociliary clearance in airways, digestive enzyme secretion in pancreas, and salt balance in sweat glands. CFTR requires PKA phosphorylation of its regulatory R domain and ATP binding/hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains for channel gating. Loss-of-function mutations cause cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick mucus in lungs, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride, and male infertility due to vas deferens absence. The most common mutation is ΔF508, which causes protein misfolding and ER retention. CFTR also regulates other ion channels including ENaC and interacts with SLC26 anion exchangers to coordinate epithelial ion transport.'

  review:
    summary: 'This IBA annotation accurately captures CFTR''s primary molecular function as an ATP-gated anion channel requiring intracellular ATP binding and hydrolysis for channel gating. This function is well-supported by extensive structural and functional studies showing ATP binding at NBDs drives channel opening.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The term GO:0005260 precisely describes CFTR''s unique mechanism among ABC transporters - it functions as a phosphorylation- and nucleotide-regulated anion channel rather than an active pump. The channel requires PKA phosphorylation and ATP binding/hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains for gating cycles. This annotation, based on phylogenetic inference (IBA), correctly identifies the core molecular function.'
