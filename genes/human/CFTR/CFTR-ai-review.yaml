description: CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is a 
  unique ABC transporter family member that functions as a phosphorylation- and 
  ATP-regulated anion channel rather than an active pump. It primarily conducts 
  chloride and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell apical membranes, playing
  critical roles in fluid secretion and mucociliary clearance in airways, 
  digestive enzyme secretion in pancreas, and salt balance in sweat glands. CFTR
  requires PKA phosphorylation of its regulatory R domain and ATP 
  binding/hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains for channel gating. 
  Loss-of-function mutations cause cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick mucus
  in lungs, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride, and male 
  infertility due to vas deferens absence. The most common mutation is ΔF508, 
  which causes protein misfolding and ER retention. CFTR also regulates other 
  ion channels including ENaC and interacts with SLC26 anion exchangers to 
  coordinate epithelial ion transport.

    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: This IBA annotation accurately captures CFTR's primary molecular 
        function as an ATP-gated anion channel requiring intracellular ATP 
        binding and hydrolysis for channel gating. This function is 
        well-supported by extensive structural and functional studies showing 
        ATP binding at NBDs drives channel opening.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The term GO:0005260 precisely describes CFTR's unique mechanism 
        among ABC transporters - it functions as a phosphorylation- and 
        nucleotide-regulated anion channel rather than an active pump. The 
        channel requires PKA phosphorylation and ATP binding/hydrolysis at its 
        nucleotide-binding domains for gating cycles. This annotation, based on 
        phylogenetic inference (IBA), correctly identifies the core molecular 
        function.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
    review:
      summary: This IEA annotation correctly identifies CFTR as a chloride 
        channel, which is accurate but less specific than GO:0005260. CFTR does 
        function as a chloride channel, conducting Cl- ions down their 
        electrochemical gradient when open.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While GO:0005254 is correct, it lacks the specificity of 
        GO:0005260 which captures the ATP-gating mechanism. However, as an 
        automated annotation it appropriately identifies the chloride channel 
        function. This term is acceptable as it represents a parent term of the 
        more specific ATP-gated function. The channel primarily mediates passive
        chloride ion conductance across epithelial cell membranes.

    review:
      summary: This IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping correctly 
        identifies CFTR's nucleotide binding capability but is overly generic. 
        CFTR specifically binds and hydrolyzes ATP at its two nucleotide-binding
        domains to drive channel gating.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While nucleotide binding is correct, this annotation should be 
        more specific. CFTR specifically binds ATP (not just any nucleotide) at 
        its NBD1 and NBD2 domains. ATP binding promotes NBD dimerization 
        triggering channel opening, while ATP hydrolysis allows channel closure.
        The generic "nucleotide binding" term fails to capture this ATP-specific
        requirement for CFTR function.

      action: REMOVE
      reason: CFTR is primarily an apical membrane protein in polarized

        into lumens of airways, intestines, and ducts [PMID:11524016].

        While CFTR indirectly regulates water movement through its control of

        transport water directly.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: CFTR regulates transepithelial water transport indirectly by 
        controlling chloride and bicarbonate secretion, which creates osmotic 
        gradients that drive water movement. This is a downstream physiological 
        consequence of CFTR's chloride channel activity rather than direct water

    review:
      summary: This IEA annotation identifies ER membrane localization for CFTR.
        This is correct as CFTR is synthesized and initially folded in the ER 
        membrane before trafficking to the plasma membrane.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: CFTR is synthesized as an integral membrane protein in the ER, 
        where it undergoes folding and quality control. Immature CFTR 
        transiently resides in the ER membrane during biosynthesis. ER retention
        of misfolded CFTR (especially deltaF508-CFTR) is a hallmark of cystic 
        fibrosis pathogenesis. While not CFTR's functional destination, ER 
        membrane localization is part of its normal biogenesis pathway.

        for channel gating [PMID:8910473]. It has no known isomerase activity. 
        This annotation appears to be an incorrect automated transfer, possibly

      reason: CFTR transports bicarbonate ions, which can affect intracellular 
        pH. In sperm, CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport contributes to 
        intracellular alkalinization during capacitation. However, this is a 
        downstream physiological consequence of CFTR's bicarbonate transport 
        rather than its primary molecular function.

        and bicarbonate transport that determines mucus viscosity, pH, and
