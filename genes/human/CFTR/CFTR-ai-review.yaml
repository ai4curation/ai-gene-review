description: CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is a unique
  ABC transporter family member that functions as a phosphorylation- and ATP-regulated
  anion channel rather than an active pump. It primarily conducts chloride and bicarbonate
  ions across epithelial cell apical membranes, playing critical roles in fluid secretion
  and mucociliary clearance in airways, digestive enzyme secretion in pancreas, and
  salt balance in sweat glands. CFTR requires PKA phosphorylation of its regulatory
  R domain and ATP binding/hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains for channel
  gating. Loss-of-function mutations cause cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick
  mucus in lungs, pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride, and male infertility
  due to vas deferens absence. The most common mutation is Î”F508, which causes protein
  misfolding and ER retention. CFTR also regulates other ion channels including ENaC
  and interacts with SLC26 anion exchangers to coordinate epithelial ion transport.

- term:
    id: GO:0005260
    label: intracellularly ATP-gated chloride channel activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation accurately captures CFTR's primary molecular function
      as an ATP-gated anion channel requiring intracellular ATP binding and hydrolysis
      for channel gating. This function is well-supported by extensive structural
      and functional studies showing ATP binding at NBDs drives channel opening.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The term GO:0005260 precisely describes CFTR's unique mechanism among
      ABC transporters - it functions as a phosphorylation- and nucleotide-regulated
      anion channel rather than an active pump. The channel requires PKA phosphorylation
      and ATP binding/hydrolysis at its nucleotide-binding domains for gating cycles.
      This annotation, based on phylogenetic inference (IBA), correctly identifies
      the core molecular function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation correctly identifies CFTR as a chloride channel,
      which is accurate but less specific than GO:0005260. CFTR does function as a
      chloride channel, conducting Cl- ions down their electrochemical gradient when
      open.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0005254 is correct, it lacks the specificity of GO:0005260 which
      captures the ATP-gating mechanism. However, as an automated annotation it appropriately
      identifies the chloride channel function. This term is acceptable as it represents
      a parent term of the more specific ATP-gated function. The channel primarily
      mediates passive chloride ion conductance across epithelial cell membranes.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping correctly identifies
      CFTR's nucleotide binding capability but is overly generic. CFTR specifically
      binds and hydrolyzes ATP at its two nucleotide-binding domains to drive channel
      gating.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While nucleotide binding is correct, this annotation should be more specific.
      CFTR specifically binds ATP (not just any nucleotide) at its NBD1 and NBD2 domains.
      ATP binding promotes NBD dimerization triggering channel opening, while ATP
      hydrolysis allows channel closure. The generic "nucleotide binding" term fails
      to capture this ATP-specific requirement for CFTR function.

  review:
    summary: CFTR is a transmembrane protein that spans the plasma membrane and functions as an ion channel. Its membrane topology is essential for its role in anion transport across epithelial cell membranes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: As a transmembrane chloride channel, CFTR must be embedded in the plasma membrane to function properly, with extracellular and intracellular domains positioned on opposite sides of the membrane to enable ion transport.

  review:
    summary: CFTR functions as an ATP-gated chloride channel specifically localized to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells, where it regulates anion secretion and fluid transport across epithelial barriers.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Apical plasma membrane localization is critical for CFTR function as it enables proper directional chloride secretion from epithelial cells into luminal spaces, which is essential for maintaining proper fluid balance in airways, intestines, and other epithelia.

  review:
    summary: CFTR regulates intracellular and extracellular pH through bicarbonate transport across epithelial membranes
    action: NEW
    reason: CFTR directly regulates pH homeostasis through its bicarbonate transport function. The channel conducts bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining proper pH in various secretions including pancreatic juice, airway surface liquid, and reproductive tract fluids. CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport contributes to both intracellular and extracellular pH regulation, and defects in this function contribute to the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.

  review:
    summary: CFTR is essential for proper mucus secretion and properties through ion and water transport regulation in secretory epithelia
    action: NEW
    reason: CFTR plays a critical role in mucus secretion by regulating the ionic composition and hydration of mucus. The channel provides chloride and bicarbonate transport that determines mucus viscosity, pH, and antimicrobial properties. In cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysfunction leads to dehydrated, viscous mucus that cannot be effectively cleared, demonstrating CFTR's essential role in normal mucus secretion and properties. CFTR regulates both the volume and composition of mucus through its ion transport functions.
