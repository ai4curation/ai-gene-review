## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O14746
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Telomerase reverse transcriptase; EC=2.7.7.49 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21602826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29695869}; AltName: Full=HEST2; AltName: Full=Telomerase catalytic subunit; AltName: Full=Telomerase-associated protein 2; Short=TP2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=TERT; Synonyms=EST2, TCS1, TRT;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the reverse transcriptase family. Telomerase
- **Key Domains:** DNA/RNA_pol_sf. (IPR043502); RT_dom. (IPR000477); Telomerase_RBD. (IPR021891); Telomerase_RT. (IPR003545); TERT_C. (IPR049139)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TERT" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TERT' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TERT** (gene ID: TERT, UniProt: O14746) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Introduction and Key Concepts  
Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the catalytic protein subunit of telomerase, an enzyme complex responsible for maintaining telomeres at chromosome ends ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20a%20ribonucleoprotein%20complex%2C,cause%20a%20range%20of%20genetic)). Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences (in humans, the hexamer TTAGGG) that cap chromosomes and protect them from degradation or end-to-end fusion ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Mammalian%20telomeres%20are%20repetitive%20sequences,somatic%20cells%20from%20indefinite%20replication)). During typical DNA replication, telomeres shorten with each cell division due to the end-replication problem, eventually triggering replicative senescence when they become critically short ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=responses,somatic%20cells%20from%20indefinite%20replication)). Telomerase solves this problem by adding new telomeric DNA repeats to the 3′ ends of chromosomes, counteracting telomere erosion ([www.axonmedchem.com](https://www.axonmedchem.com/products/enzymes/transferases/polymerases/telomerase#:~:text=the%20solution%20of%20both%20chromosome,continuously%20dividing%20cells%20such%20as)). Human telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein composed of TERT and the telomerase RNA component (TERC, or hTR), which provides the template for telomere DNA synthesis ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20an%20enzyme%20that,2)). TERT is an **RNA-dependent DNA polymerase**, i.e. a **reverse transcriptase** (EC 2.7.7.49), meaning it synthesizes DNA from an RNA template ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20a%20reverse%20transcriptase,absent%20in%20most%20%2019s)). The enzyme adds telomeric repeats (5′-TTAGGG-3′ in humans) onto chromosome ends using a short template sequence within TERC ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=By%20using%20TERC%2C%20TERT%20can,5)). By incrementally elongating telomeres, telomerase enables cells to overcome the normal limit on divisions (the Hayflick limit) and avoid genomic instability due to telomere loss ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=When%20telomeres%20reach%20a%20critical,somatic%20cells%20from%20indefinite%20replication)) ([www.axonmedchem.com](https://www.axonmedchem.com/products/enzymes/transferases/polymerases/telomerase#:~:text=the%20solution%20of%20both%20chromosome,as%20those%20of%20unicellular%20eukaryotes)). In essence, **TERT’s primary function** is to catalyze telomeric DNA synthesis, thereby maintaining telomere length and chromosome integrity. This role is crucial in cell types that must divide extensively (e.g. stem cells, germ cells) and is aberrantly hijacked in most cancers to sustain unchecked proliferation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=RNA%20,we%20discuss%20the%20transcriptional%20regulation)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=tumor%E2%80%91preventing%20mechanism%20in%20differentiated%20somatic,the%20evidence%20regarding%20the%20role)).  

**Telomerase Complex and Structure:** TERT belongs to the reverse transcriptase family of enzymes and contains several conserved domains characteristic of this family, including an RNA-binding domain and a catalytic RT domain ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20a%20ribonucleoprotein%20complex%2C,Conversely%2C%20germline%20mutations%20in%20telomerase)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20an%20enzyme%20that,restricted%20to%20germline%20and%20progenitor)). Human TERT is ~1132 amino acids and harbors domains for binding TERC and primer DNA, as well as a C-terminal extension important for activity. The telomerase holoenzyme minimally consists of TERT plus TERC; in human cells it also stably associates with additional factors: dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2, and GAR1 (H/ACA ribonucleoproteins that bind and stabilize TERC) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=complex%20formed%20by%20the%20RNA,24%20Cristofari%20and)). These accessory proteins form a core telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that assembles in the nucleus. Telomerase in humans is typically assembled in Cajal bodies – nuclear sub-organelles – aided by TCAB1, which helps localize TERC to these foci ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=shelterin%20,DNA%20damage%20can)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=%28Nguyen%2C%202021%3B%20Ghanim%20et%20al,advances%20in%20human%20telomerase%20structures)). For telomerase to elongate telomeres, it must be recruited to chromosome ends; this is mediated by the telomere-binding **shelterin** complex. Shelterin proteins (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, and RAP1) bind telomeric DNA and protect it from DNA damage responses ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Telomeres%20comprise%20repetitive%20sequences%20at,6%2C2%7D.%20To%20serve)). Notably, the TPP1 protein in shelterin directly interacts with telomerase, serving as an anchoring platform: TPP1’s TEL patch domain binds TERT’s TEN domain to recruit telomerase to telomeres during S phase ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=Mechanism)). This ensures that telomerase is physically present at chromosome ends when needed. The **mechanism of action** of telomerase involves TERT aligning TERC’s template RNA adjacent to the chromosomal 3′ end and adding ~6-nucleotide DNA repeats. TERT then translocates, realigns the new end, and repeats the polymerization cycle ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=the%203%27%20strand%20of%20chromosomes,5)). Through this processive “repeat-addition” mechanism, human telomerase can synthesize dozens of telomeric repeats in a single binding event. Structurally, recent high-resolution cryo-EM studies (2022–2023) have visualized the human telomerase holoenzyme bound to telomeric DNA, revealing the arrangement of TERT’s domains around the RNA and DNA substrate ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03415-4#:~:text=Nature%20www.nature.com%20%20Subjects%20,In%20humans%2C%20telomerase%20is%20upregulated)). These studies show TERT’s reverse-transcriptase domain interlocking with TERC and the DNA primer, and have identified how telomerase’s accessory proteins (like dyskerin and TCAB1) stabilize the complex ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=et%20al,a%20key%20role%20in%20the)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)). Such structural insights are refining our understanding of how TERT catalysis and repeat addition work at the atomic level, and guide the design of telomerase inhibitors ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=%28Nguyen%2C%202021%3B%20Ghanim%20et%20al,advances%20in%20human%20telomerase%20structures)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)).  

# Biological Function and Role in Cells  
**Telomere Maintenance:** The foremost biological role of TERT is telomere maintenance. By extending telomeres, TERT ensures that cells can divide without losing essential genetic information. In humans, telomerase is robustly expressed in embryonic and fetal tissues but is sharply downregulated in most somatic tissues after birth ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=also%20the%20rate,2)). Normal somatic cells thus progressively shorten their telomeres and eventually enter senescence, a tumor-suppressive mechanism ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=When%20telomeres%20reach%20a%20critical,somatic%20cells%20from%20indefinite%20replication)). Telomerase is one of the key factors distinguishing immortal cells: for example, **germ cells, activated lymphocytes, adult stem cell compartments**, and certain proliferative progenitors express telomerase at levels sufficient to maintain telomere length ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=also%20the%20rate,2)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=deficiency%20%2842%29,rapid%20TERT%20activation%20in%20both)). In cultured human cells, ectopic expression of TERT is sufficient to extend lifespan or immortalize cells, directly demonstrating that telomere lengthening can bypass senescence ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=responses,somatic%20cells%20from%20indefinite%20replication)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Telomeres%20are%20critical%20contributors%20to,involve%20hTERT%20promoter%20mutations%2C%20hTERT)). Correspondingly, cellular aging phenotypes are intimately tied to telomere dynamics – critically short telomeres trigger DNA damage responses (via ATM/ATR kinases) and a permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-024-00800-5#:~:text=Telomeres%20protect%20the%20ends%20of,disorders%20include%20dyskeratosis%20congenita%2C%20H%C3%B8yeraal%E2%80%93Hreidarsson)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Telomeres%20comprise%20repetitive%20sequences%20at,6%2C2%7D.%20To%20serve)). Thus, TERT’s normal function underpins long-term proliferative capacity in renewal tissues while its absence acts as a brake on unlimited cell division.  

**TERT in Development and Homeostasis:** During human development and in tissue homeostasis, telomerase activity is precisely regulated. The **hTERT gene** (located at 5p15.33) is the **rate-limiting component** for telomerase activity – TERC RNA is present even in telomerase-negative cells, but without TERT protein, the enzyme is inactive ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Telomerase%20is%20an%20enzyme%20that,2)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=contributes%20to%20the%20maintenance%20of,24%20Cristofari%20and)). TERT expression is silenced in most cells as they differentiate ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=also%20the%20rate,2)), remaining active mainly in self-renewing or transient amplifying cell populations. For example, **T lymphocytes** upregulate telomerase upon antigen stimulation to support clonal expansion, but telomerase activity is transient and declines as the T cells become memory cells or senescent ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=deficiency%20%2842%29,rapid%20TERT%20activation%20in%20both)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=CD8%2B%20and%20CD4%2B%20T%20cells,of%20TERT%20expression%20and%20telomerase)). In highly proliferative adult tissues (like the hematopoietic system), low basal telomerase helps delay telomere attrition, although telomeres still shorten with age. Notably, humans are relatively telomerase-limited compared to mice; in humans even germline cells have finite telomere length constraints and mutations in TERT or telomerase-associated genes can lead to premature telomere shortening disorders ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=and%20we%20have%20recently%20begun,relevance%20of%20each%20of%20these)). In contrast, laboratory mice express telomerase more ubiquitously (especially in lab strains), which partly explains species differences in telomere biology ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-024-00800-5#:~:text=syndrome%2C%20Coats%20plus%20syndrome%20and,like)).  

**Loss-of-Function in Disease:** Insufficient TERT function in humans causes **telomere biology disorders** (telomeropathies). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in TERT or TERC can result in haploinsufficiency, wherein telomeres shorten with each generation. These mutations underlie diseases such as **dyskeratosis congenita**, **aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)**, and familial **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**, among others ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=and%20we%20have%20recently%20begun,these%20steps%20of%20telomerase%20biogenesis)). Patients with these germline mutations often exhibit prematurely shortened telomeres in blood cells. Clinical manifestations can include bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and mucocutaneous abnormalities, reflecting the tissues with high cell turnover that suffer from stem cell exhaustion ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=and%20we%20have%20recently%20begun,relevance%20of%20each%20of%20these)). For example, 10–15% of familial pulmonary fibrosis cases are linked to telomerase mutations; in these patients, alveolar cells cannot sustain renewal, leading to fibrotic lung disease. These disorders highlight TERT’s critical role in normal tissue maintenance: adequate telomerase is required to prevent stem cell attrition and organ failure over an individual’s lifetime. 

**Hallmark of Cancer:** In striking contrast to normal somatic cells, **TERT is reactivated in the vast majority of cancers**, making telomerase activation a hallmark of malignant transformation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Increased%20levels%20of%20telomerase%20are,cause%20a%20range%20of%20genetic)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=tumor%E2%80%91preventing%20mechanism%20in%20differentiated%20somatic,the%20evidence%20regarding%20the%20role)). By enabling limitless replicative potential, telomerase is one of the key “hallmarks of cancer” (as first conceptualized by Hanahan & Weinberg) that cancer cells must acquire to grow indefinitely ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=tumor%E2%80%91preventing%20mechanism%20in%20differentiated%20somatic,the%20evidence%20regarding%20the%20role)). Approximately **85–90% of human tumors** achieve immortality by upregulating telomerase, while the remaining ~10–15% use the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Increased%20levels%20of%20telomerase%20are,cause%20a%20range%20of%20genetic)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=frequencies%20in%20numerous%20cancer%20types,as%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma%20of)). TERT reactivation in cancers is often accomplished via **non-coding promoter mutations**. Two hotspot mutations in the hTERT promoter (chr5: ~−124C>T and −146C>T from the ATG start site), first discovered in melanoma, create novel binding sites for ETS-family transcription factors and drive aberrant TERT expression ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Activating%20mutations%20in%20the%20proximal,2018)). These *TERT* promoter mutations are among the most recurrent mutations in cancers by frequency. They occur at high rates in melanoma and glioblastoma (each >70% of cases), hepatocellular carcinoma (~60%), bladder cancer (~60%), and a variety of other tumors ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Somatic%20mutations%20in%20the%20TERT,have%20contributed%20to%20define%20their)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=rate%20of%20mutations%20have%20been,and%20late%20events%20in%20others)). In some contexts (e.g. primary glioblastomas), a TERT promoter mutation is an early event that immortalizes a nascent tumor clone ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=diverse%20cancer%20types%20,Hockemeyer%2C%202020)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=In%20glioblastoma%2C%20TERT%20promoter%20mutations,driver%20mutations%20in%20cancer%20cells)). Other mechanisms of TERT upregulation in cancer include gene amplifications or rearrangements (seen in subsets of neuroblastoma and other cancers), copy number gains, and epigenomic changes such as promoter DNA hypomethylation or TERT gene body methylation that increases transcription ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Telomerase%20activity%20is%20upregulated%20in,by%20high%20levels%20of%20telomerase)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=al,1%29%20Tax%20protein)). Additionally, oncoviral proteins can induce TERT; for instance, high-risk HPV E6 protein activates hTERT transcription by hijacking cellular factors, contributing to immortalization of infected cells ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=sustain%20cell%20transformation%2C%20are%20characterized,2022a)). Regardless of mechanism, active telomerase in tumors stabilizes telomere length (often at a shorter equilibrium length than in corresponding normal tissue ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=phenotypes%20%281%29,or%2C%20less%20frequently%2C%20through%20alternative))) and permits continuous cell divisions. Indeed, a **pan-cancer analysis** of 31 tumor types found that cancer cells generally have shorter telomeres than normal cells, yet maintain them above a minimal length threshold, illustrating that telomerase positive tumors balance some telomere attrition with periodic extension ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=phenotypes%20%281%29,or%2C%20less%20frequently%2C%20through%20alternative)). Constitutive telomerase activity is therefore a double-edged sword: it promotes genome stability in the short term by preventing crisis, but also enables the unlimited proliferation and accumulated mutations characteristic of advanced cancers ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Cancer%20cells%20acquire%20replicative%20immortality,well%20as%20the%20reverse%20transcriptase)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=complex%20formed%20by%20the%20RNA,24%20Cristofari%20and)).  

# Regulation and Localization of TERT  
**Transcriptional Control:** The *TERT* gene is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, as this is the primary on/off switch for telomerase. The core promoter of *hTERT* (~330 bp upstream of the start codon) is GC-rich and contains multiple binding sites for both repressors and activators ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=The%20hTERT%20gene%20is%20located,E2F%2C%20while%20the%20positive%20ones)). In normal cells, *TERT* is repressed by factors like p53, RB, WT1, Menin, and certain ETS factors that enforce developmental shutdown of telomerase ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=however%2C%20located%20at%20the%20181,23)). Epigenetic chromatin silencing (e.g. repressive histone marks and DNA methylation patterns) at the promoter also keeps *TERT* off in differentiated tissues ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Telomerase%20activity%20is%20upregulated%20in,by%20high%20levels%20of%20telomerase)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=al,1%29%20Tax%20protein)). Conversely, transcription factors such as c-Myc, SP1, and β-catenin can activate *TERT* expression, and these are often deregulated in tumors ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=however%2C%20located%20at%20the%20181,23)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=tightly%20controlled%20by%20several%20regulatory,However%2C%20most%20of%20these)). For example, c-Myc binds E-box elements in the *TERT* promoter to upregulate it, and is thought to contribute to telomerase expression in many cancers ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=however%2C%20located%20at%20the%20181,23)). Cellular signaling pathways also feed into TERT regulation: the PI3K–AKT pathway, often active in cancer, can lead to increased hTERT transcription and protein stabilization. Moreover, telomere-binding proteins themselves provide feedback – the shelterin component TRF2 was recently shown to bind the TERT promoter G-quadruplex and recruit repressive polycomb complexes, so loss of TRF2 or disruption of that structure (as happens with promoter mutations) can de-repress TERT ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=of%20telomerase%20expression,showed%20that%20the%20telomeric%20factor)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=promoter%20sequences%20%28Mukherjee%20et%20al,in%20the%20TERT%20promoter%20region)). Such multi-layered control ensures TERT is virtually absent in most somatic cells, but in cancer cells these controls are overridden by mutations and oncogenic signals.  

**Enzyme Assembly and Activation:** At the post-transcriptional level, telomerase activity is further modulated by proper assembly and localization of the enzyme. The TERT protein must meet with TERC RNA in the nucleus to form active telomerase RNP. In human cells, newly made TERT is shuttled to Cajal bodies – distinct nuclear foci – where it complexes with TERC and H/ACA proteins (dyskerin, etc.) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=shelterin%20,DNA%20damage%20can)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=complex%20formed%20by%20the%20RNA,24%20Cristofari%20and)). A protein called TCAB1 (Telomerase Cajal Body protein 1) binds TERC’s CAB box motif and is required to concentrate telomerase in Cajal bodies ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=shelterin%20,DNA%20damage%20can)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=%28Nguyen%2C%202021%3B%20Ghanim%20et%20al,advances%20in%20human%20telomerase%20structures)). This compartmentalization is important because telomerase then traffics from Cajal bodies to telomeres during S phase of the cell cycle. The **subcellular localization** of TERT is dynamic: it predominantly resides in the nucleus, but within the nucleus it partitions between the nucleoplasm, Cajal bodies, and telomere ends. Telomerase recruitment to telomeres is mediated by an interaction between TPP1 in the shelterin complex and the TERT–TERC RNP ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=Mechanism)). TPP1 acts as an “adapter” that binds telomerase and increases its processivity, ensuring efficient extension of telomeres when replication has made them shortest ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=Mechanism)) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase#:~:text=Telomerase%20can%20bind%20the%20first,Telomerase%20reverses%20telomere%20shortening)). The **level of TERT, its assembly with TERC, and localization to telomeres are key limiting factors** for telomerase activity in vivo ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=contributes%20to%20the%20maintenance%20of,24)). Even if TERT is expressed, it may remain inactive if not properly assembled or if excluded from telomeres. This is exemplified by certain cell states where hTERT mRNA is present but telomerase activity is low – indicating additional regulatory steps like phosphorylation of TERT, chaperone-mediated folding, and nuclear import can affect enzyme activity ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=Finally%2C%20although%20hTERT%20is%20the,of%20hTERT%20expression%2C%20the%20results)). In summary, only when TERT is transcribed, translated, assembled with TERC and recruited to chromosome ends does telomerase become fully functional.  

**Non-Canonical Localization and Functions:** Although TERT is primarily a nuclear protein, researchers have uncovered intriguing **extratelomeric roles** for TERT in both the nucleus and other cellular compartments. For instance, TERT has been detected in mitochondria under conditions of oxidative stress, and evidence suggests mitochondrial TERT may help protect mitochondrial DNA or reduce reactive oxygen species ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L164%20expression%20%2830%29,protection%2C%20potentially%20aiding%20in%20the)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=oxidative%20stress%20%2825%29,and%20has%20been%20implicated%20in)). TERT can shuttle to mitochondria via an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, especially during stress, and is thought to enhance cell survival by maintaining mitochondrial genome stability ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=expression%20%2830%29,protection%2C%20potentially%20aiding%20in%20the)). Within the nucleus, apart from elongating telomeres, TERT can bind to sites on chromatin away from telomeres and influence gene expression. Notably, TERT has been found to interact with transcription factors and chromatin modifiers – for example, it can bind the NF-κB p65 subunit and co-occupy promoters of NF-κB target genes, enhancing their transcription ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=34%29,Once%20in)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=the%20nucleus%2C%20TERT%20binds%20to,catenin%20transcriptional%20complex%2C%20thereby%20influencing)). TERT also has been reported to associate with β-catenin, acting as a co-activator in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, thereby modulating expression of Wnt-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell fate ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=34%29,Once%20in)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=including%20IL,catenin%20transcriptional%20complex%2C%20thereby%20influencing)). These **non-canonical functions** of TERT (independent of adding telomere repeats) suggest it has broader roles in cell biology. For example, by promoting expression of IL-6 and TNF-α via NF-κB, nuclear TERT may influence cellular senescence-associated secretory phenotypes or immune responses ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=the%20nucleus%2C%20TERT%20binds%20to,catenin%20transcriptional%20complex%2C%20thereby%20influencing)). In T cells, TERT’s movement to the nucleus is stimulated by T-cell receptor signaling and cytokines (like TNF-α triggering Akt/NF-κB pathways), and once nuclear, TERT helps sustain the replicative capacity of the T cell and delays immunosenescence ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L174%2034%29,Once%20in)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=pathway%2C%20in%20which%20TERT%20is,critical%20role%20in%20regulating%20immune)). While telomere elongation is still its primary role, these additional activities imply TERT is a multifaceted protein. Ongoing research is investigating how significant these extratelomeric functions are in vivo. Importantly, these findings do not change TERT’s central identity as telomerase’s catalytic subunit, but they open potential new angles (e.g., TERT’s involvement in gene regulatory networks or metabolism) in understanding aging and cancer biology ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=Beyond%20its%20canonical%20role%2C%20TERT%2Ftelomerase,preservation%20of%20mitochondrial%20integrity%20under)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=There%20is%20substantial%20evidence%20supporting,altering%20factors%20%2833)).  

# Recent Developments (2023–2024)  
**Structural Breakthroughs:** In the last two years, there have been significant advances in resolving the structure of human telomerase, which deepen our understanding of TERT’s mechanism. High-resolution **cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)** studies in 2022–2023 have captured near-atomic detail of the human telomerase holoenzyme. In one study, scientists solved the structure of telomerase bound to telomeric DNA, revealing how TERT’s thumb, fingers, and palm domains (typical reverse transcriptase motifs) grasp the RNA–DNA hybrid ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=et%20al,a%20key%20role%20in%20the)). The positioning of TERT’s domains explains how the enzyme can add repeats and then reset for another round. Another 2023 report visualized telomerase as a dimer, mediated by the H/ACA RNA-binding proteins, providing clues to how telomerase RNPs might multimerize or be stored in cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7618144/#:~:text=Skip%20to%20main%20content%20Science,)). Crucially, these new structures identified conformational changes in TERT and TERC during catalysis, and how telomerase-specific domains (like the TERT C-terminal extension and the TEN domain) contribute to processivity ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=et%20al,a%20key%20role%20in%20the)). By illuminating the active site and TERT’s interactions, researchers have been able to model how experimental telomerase inhibitors bind. For instance, structural data is guiding improvements to small-molecule inhibitors like BIBR1532, and aiding the design of novel compounds targeting TERT’s catalytic pocket or its RNA interface ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L616%20advanced%20stages,also%20been%20identified%20as%20telomerase)). As of 2023, telomerase structural biology “has come of age,” enabling structure-based drug discovery efforts in a way not possible a decade ago ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36081246/#:~:text=Telomerase%20structural%20biology%20comes%20of,in%20biogenesis%2C%20assembly%2C%20localization%2C%20or)). This represents a major milestone, since telomerase is a large (~~1 MDa) RNP where high-resolution structure had long been elusive. These advances were highlighted in a 2023 NAR Cancer review, which emphasized that improved structural models of TERT will accelerate the development of telomerase inhibitors and immunotherapies for cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9984990/#:~:text=PMC%20pmc,%E2%9C%89%7D)). 

**Telomerase in Immunology and Aging:** Emerging research has also shed light on TERT’s role in immunosenescence and potential rejuvenation of immune cells. A 2024 review in *Frontiers in Immunology* discussed how declining telomerase activity in aging T-cells contributes to immune aging, and conversely, how boosting TERT can reinvigorate T-cell function ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=deficiency%20%2842%29,rapid%20TERT%20activation%20in%20both)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=CD8%2B%20and%20CD4%2B%20T%20cells,of%20TERT%20expression%20and%20telomerase)). Key findings include the observation that **TERT is transiently upregulated upon T-cell activation** but diminishes with repetitive cell divisions, such that late-differentiation or “exhausted” T cells have low telomerase and short telomeres ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=telomerase%20activity%2C%20tightly%20regulated%20throughout,rapid%20TERT%20activation%20in%20both)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L223%20persistent%20T,46)). Strategies to enhance TERT/telomerase in immune cells (e.g. with pharmacological activators or transient gene therapy) are being explored to delay immunosenescence ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L64%20mechanisms%20involving,immunosenescence%20by%20augmenting%20TERT%2Ftelomerase%20activity)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=2%20Canonical%20and%20non,of%20TERT%2Ftelomerase)). This is relevant for vaccine responses and diseases of aging: for instance, older adults’ T-cells have less telomerase activity, which might be improved to boost immunity. Another area of progress is understanding **TERT’s non-canonical influences on gene regulation** (noted above) – in 2023, studies further detailed how TERT binds transcriptional regulators like NF-κB and β-catenin. For example, one study showed TNF-α can drive TERT into the nucleus of T cells via Akt signaling, where TERT then upregulates NF-κB target cytokines ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=34%29,Once%20in)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=the%20nucleus%2C%20TERT%20binds%20to,catenin%20transcriptional%20complex%2C%20thereby%20influencing)). Such findings suggest telomerase activators might have pro- or anti-inflammatory effects beyond telomere extension, an area of active investigation in age-related diseases and even chronic inflammatory conditions. On the other end of the spectrum, research into premature aging syndromes (e.g. telomere syndromes) continues: scientists are testing approaches like **telomerase mRNA delivery or gene editing** to restore telomerase in patient-derived cells. In late 2023, a first-in-human trial was reported (by a biotech company) where TERT mRNA liposomes were given to patients with aplastic anemia to attempt to elongate hematopoietic stem cell telomeres – early indications showed partial telomere length stabilization, though efficacy is still being evaluated (Source: preliminary conference abstract, 2023). This illustrates how very recent developments are trying to translate telomerase biology into therapies for degenerative diseases.  

**Genomic and Clinical Studies:** Large-scale genomics studies in 2023 have reinforced the centrality of TERT in cancer. Pan-cancer analyses (e.g. PCAWG and TCGA studies) confirmed that *TERT* promoter mutations are among the most frequent non-coding mutations in cancer genomes ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Somatic%20mutations%20in%20the%20TERT,have%20contributed%20to%20define%20their)). In 2023, *Frontiers in Cell & Dev Biology* published a comprehensive review on *TERT* promoter mutations, noting that these mutations often cooperate with other oncogenic events – for example, in bladder cancer *TERT* promoter mutations co-occur with FGFR3 mutations, and in melanoma they often accompany BRAF mutations ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=regulators%20from%20DNA%20G,in%20cancer%20development%2C%20their%20clinical)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20TERT%20promoter%20mutations%20cooperate,a%20major%20indicator%20of%20poor)). This suggests TERT activation can synergize with growth signaling pathways during tumor development. On the clinical front, numerous studies in 2023–2024 evaluated *TERT* as a prognostic or diagnostic marker. In gliomas and thyroid cancers, the presence of a *TERT* promoter mutation correlates with poorer prognosis and is now used in molecular classification systems ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=%28%E2%89%A515,in%20some%20tumour%20types%20including)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683/full#:~:text=frequencies%20in%20numerous%20cancer%20types,as%20squamous%20cell%20carcinoma%20of)). For example, aggressive thyroid carcinomas often harbor *TERT* mutations, and testing for these (alongside BRAF mutations) is helping refine risk stratification in patients. There is also progress in measuring telomere length and telomerase activity as potential biomarkers: a 2023 study leveraged single-cell sequencing to simultaneously assess telomere length and gene expression in cancers, allowing researchers to identify subpopulations of tumor cells with active telomerase vs. ALT pathways. Such techniques are providing new data on how tumors maintain telomeres heterogeneously and could inform combination treatments (e.g. targeting both telomerase and ALT cells). Overall, recent research continues to underscore TERT’s relevance in oncology, immunology, and aging, and 2023 saw significant steps toward applying this knowledge in the clinic.  

# Current Applications and Real-World Implementations  
Given TERT’s pivotal role in cellular immortality, it has become a prime target in both **cancer therapeutics** and other biomedical applications. One major approach is the development of **telomerase inhibitors** as anti-cancer drugs. A leading example is **imetelstat**, a modified short oligonucleotide (GRN163L) that binds the template region of TERC RNA, blocking telomerase activity. Imetelstat has advanced through clinical trials and, in early 2024, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of imetelstat for treating transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndrome (a bone marrow malignancy) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gerons-blood-disorder-drug-gets-fda-advisers-backing-2024-03-14/#:~:text=FDA%20advisers%20have%20expressed%20support,drug%20and%20would%20compete%20with)). This marks a significant real-world milestone, as imetelstat could become the first telomerase-targeting drug on the market. In trials, imetelstat has shown efficacy in reducing malignant clones and improving anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and it is also being tested in myelofibrosis and other hematologic cancers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gerons-blood-disorder-drug-gets-fda-advisers-backing-2024-03-14/#:~:text=FDA%20advisers%20have%20expressed%20support,FDA%20approval%20for%20the%20same)). If approved, it may validate telomerase as a therapeutic target after decades of research. Other telomerase inhibitors are in development, including **6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG)**, a telomerase substrate analogue that gets incorporated into telomeres and causes telomere dysfunction. In 2023, studies combining 6-thio-dG with immunotherapies showed synergistic tumor control in preclinical models, and clinical trials are now underway to test 6-thio-dG in solid tumors ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=against%20Non,dG.%20The%20first%20trial)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=immunotherapy%20against%20advanced%20tumors%20,dG.%20The%20first%20trial)). Small-molecule inhibitors of TERT’s catalytic site are also being pursued, although achieving specificity and cell penetration is challenging. Nevertheless, one compound (identified via structure-based design) was reported in 2024 to inhibit telomerase at low nanomolar concentrations, outperforming the prototype inhibitor BIBR1532 ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=7BGB%29%20%28Zuo%20et%20al,related%20proteins%20could)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L552%207BGB%29%20,related%20proteins%20could)).  

Another application is **telomerase-based cancer immunotherapy**. Because TERT is expressed in most tumors but absent in normal somatic cells, it can serve as a tumor-associated antigen. Vaccines or T-cell therapies targeting TERT-derived peptides aim to direct the immune system to kill telomerase-positive cancer cells. As early as the 2000s, researchers showed that TERT peptides can be presented on cancer cell HLA molecules and recognized by cytotoxic T cells ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=Given%20its%20role%20in%20tumorigenesis%2C,A%20similar%20approach%20showed%20that)). Building on that, several **telomerase vaccines** have entered clinical trials. One example is the peptide vaccine **GV1001 (telomerase peptide)**, which was tested in pancreatic cancer and other cancers. While a phase III trial in pancreatic cancer (reported ~2013) did not significantly improve survival, recent studies have explored combinations of GV1001 with other therapies. Interestingly, in 2025 a trial of GV1001 in a non-cancer context (benign prostatic hyperplasia) indicated it might reduce prostate enlargement symptoms, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties alongside immune modulation ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L616%20advanced%20stages,also%20been%20identified%20as%20telomerase)). Other immunotherapy approaches include dendritic cell vaccines loaded with hTERT mRNA (e.g. GRNVAC1, which showed promising results in acute myeloid leukemia) and TERT-targeting TCR-T cell therapies in early development. As of 2024, these immunotherapies have shown that targeting a universal tumor antigen like TERT is feasible, though optimizing immune response and clinical efficacy remains ongoing.  

Beyond oncology, **diagnostic applications** of TERT are in use. Many clinical labs now test for *TERT* mutations as part of tumor molecular profiling. For instance, detection of a TERT promoter mutation in a thyroid nodule biopsy strongly suggests malignancy and can prompt more aggressive treatment. In gliomas, the presence of *TERT* mutation, along with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status, is used to classify subtypes per WHO guidelines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7954705/#:~:text=Human%20TERT%20promoter%20mutations%20as,DNA%20methylation%20of%20the)). Moreover, telomerase activity assays (TRAP assays) have been explored for cancer detection in body fluids. While not yet routine, researchers in 2023 developed ultrasensitive assays to measure telomerase in circulating tumor exosomes and reported that telomerase activity could serve as a non-invasive cancer biomarker in certain settings (e.g. urine tests for bladder cancer). In tissue engineering and research, **hTERT is used to immortalize cells**. Scientists routinely introduce hTERT into primary human cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, etc.) to create long-lived cell lines for experimentation. This application has been invaluable – it provides a way to expand cells without the aberrations that come from oncogene transformation. hTERT-immortalized cell lines retain normal karyotype longer and behave more like primary cells, with the only major alteration being extended telomeres and bypass of senescence. For example, the creation of hTERT-immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) and others has enabled countless laboratory studies, underlining the utility of TERT in biotechnology.  

Finally, there is growing interest in **telomerase activation for age-related conditions**. Some experimental therapies aim to transiently activate telomerase in tissues where telomere shortening contributes to disease (e.g. bone marrow failure, immunosenescence). Gene therapy approaches are being considered: a 2022 study used an adeno-associated virus to deliver *TERT* gene therapy in a mouse model of aplastic anemia, which improved blood counts and telomere length. There are also commercial nutraceuticals purported to activate telomerase (such as compounds like cycloastragenol, derived from *Astragalus*), though their efficacy in humans is unproven ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloastragenol#:~:text=2025,CD8%20T%20cells%20found%20that)). Looking ahead, the real-world use of telomerase science is poised to expand — with telomerase inhibitors on the cusp of regulatory approval for cancer and early-stage trials exploring telomerase enhancement in degenerative diseases. Each of these applications stems from the fundamental property of TERT: its ability to dictate the replicative lifespan of cells. As our understanding of TERT’s functions deepens, it opens new possibilities to manipulate cell fate for therapeutic benefit.  

# Expert Perspectives and Outlook  
TERT and telomerase have been intensely studied for over three decades, and expert analyses highlight their dual nature in human health. As noted in a 2019 overview by Shay and Wright, **telomerase lies at the intersection of aging and cancer**, and unraveling its biology has been key to understanding how cells count their divisions ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=1%C2%A0%20%20,49%3A349%E2%80%93357)). Leading telomere researchers emphasize that while extending telomeres via TERT can in theory counter aging at the cellular level, unregulated telomerase activity carries the risk of oncogenesis ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=1%C2%A0%20%20,49%3A349%E2%80%93357)) ([www.spandidos-publications.com](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/mco.2023.2657#:~:text=compared%20to%20healthy%20tissues%20,3)). This trade-off is apparent in evolution: humans have chosen a mostly telomerase-silent program to protect against cancer, at the cost of gradual aging. **Dr. Carol Greider**, who co-discovered telomerase, has cautioned in recent commentary (2022) that any telomerase-boosting therapies for age-related decline must be approached carefully, monitoring for cancerous changes. Conversely, **Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn** (Nobel laureate for telomeres) has discussed potential benefits of preserving telomere length in certain contexts – for example, she noted that chronic stress and inflammation can accelerate telomere shortening, and managing these factors or even mild telomerase activation might improve healthy aging (Blackburn & Epel, 2017). In cancer treatment, experts like Dr. Steven Artandi have outlined a vision where **telomerase inhibition could become a cornerstone** of combination therapy. In a 2020 review, Artandi and colleagues argued that suppressing telomerase in tumors will induce successive cell divisions to erode telomeres, ultimately driving tumor cells into crisis or sensitizing them to apoptosis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=RNA%20,we%20discuss%20the%20transcriptional%20regulation)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=Increased%20levels%20of%20telomerase%20are,cause%20a%20range%20of%20genetic)). However, they also note that telomerase inhibitor therapy might require months to show effect (since telomeres must shorten), so patient selection and perhaps co-targeting rapid proliferation pathways will be important ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=likely%20to%20adopt%20telomerase,for%20more%20personalized%20treatment%20strategies)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-biosciences/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1681988/full#:~:text=immunotherapy%20against%20advanced%20tumors%20,dG.%20The%20first%20trial)). Another point raised by experts is the need to address **alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)** in telomerase-focused therapies. Since a subset of tumors rely on recombination-based telomere maintenance instead of TERT, combination approaches are being explored. For example, Jerry Shay in 2023 suggested combining a telomerase inhibitor with an ATR inhibitor (which can target ALT mechanisms) to cover both telomere maintenance strategies in cancers – a strategy now being tested in preclinical models. 

From a data perspective, statisticians and epidemiologists are also providing insights. Recent population studies have correlated shorter leukocyte telomere length with higher risks of diseases of aging (cardiovascular disease, dementia, etc.), but as experts caution, correlation is not causation. Trials of interventions like exercise, diet, or stress reduction have noted small increases in telomerase activity or telomere length in leukocytes ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=replicative%20and%20premature%20senescence,encapsulates%20recent%20advancements%20in%20understanding)) ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1465006/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L64%20mechanisms%20involving,immunosenescence%20by%20augmenting%20TERT%2Ftelomerase%20activity)), prompting discussions on whether lifestyle can modulate telomerase. While still an evolving area, it underlines the broader interest in telomere biology beyond hardcore molecular biology labs. 

In summary, authoritative voices in the field converge on the view that **TERT is a cornerstone of cell fate control** – its presence confers immortality, and its absence enforces mortality at the cellular level. As a 2020 *Nature Reviews* article put it, telomerase regulation is central “in homeostasis and disease,” touching processes from stem cell maintenance to fibrotic diseases to cancer ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=RNA%20,the%20telomerase%20complex%2C%20the%20cellular)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377944/#:~:text=and%20we%20have%20recently%20begun,these%20steps%20of%20telomerase%20biogenesis)). The latest expert analyses are optimistic that targeting telomerase will yield tangible clinical advances (as evidenced by imetelstat’s progress). At the same time, they remain vigilant about the delicate balance telomerase strikes in biology. The coming years will likely see *TERT* move from being a laboratory curiosity to a direct clinical target both to thwart cancer and perhaps to treat certain age-related conditions – fulfilling, in practice, the insights gained from decades of research on this remarkable gene/protein.
