description: TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) is the catalytic protein subunit of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme essential for telomere maintenance. TERT catalyzes the template-directed addition of TTAGGG repeats to the 3' ends of telomeres using RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity, with the telomerase RNA component (TERC) providing the template. The enzyme operates as part of the telomerase holoenzyme complex containing TERT, TERC, DKC1, NOP10, NHP2, GAR1, and WRAP53/TCAB1. TERT is essential for cellular immortalization and is reactivated in ~90% of cancers. Beyond telomere maintenance, TERT exhibits non-canonical functions including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity when complexed with RMRP RNA, modulation of Wnt signaling, mitochondrial DNA protection, and regulation of cellular senescence and apoptosis. Germline mutations in TERT cause dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis due to defective telomere maintenance.

  findings:
  - statement: TERT contains four conserved domains - TEN, TRBD, RT, and CTE - that form a toroidal structure
    supporting_text: Human TERT contains four evolutionarily conserved structural domains that work together to accomplish the unique enzymatic function of telomere extension. These domains are arranged linearly from the N-terminus to C-terminus - the telomerase essential N-terminal (TEN) domain, the telomerase RNA-binding domain (TRBD), the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, and the C-terminal extension (CTE) domain.
  - statement: Template translocation is a unique two-phase catalytic cycle distinguishing telomerase from conventional polymerases
    supporting_text: The first phase is the nucleotide addition phase, during which TERT synthesizes a single telomeric repeat by copying the template region of TERC onto the chromosome 3' end. The second phase is template translocation, which is unique to telomerase among polymerases.
  - statement: TPP1 TEL patch directly recruits telomerase to telomeres
    supporting_text: TPP1 interacts directly with TERT through a specific surface region called the TEL patch (TPP1 glutamate and leucine-rich patch) located within the N-terminal OB-fold domain of TPP1. The TEL patch contains four glutamic acid residues that confer a negative charge, which complements the highly basic TEN domain of TERT.
  - statement: TERT promoter mutations create de novo ETS binding sites in cancer
    supporting_text: Two hotspot point mutations in the TERT promoter (C228T and C250T), located 124 and 146 bp upstream of the translation start site, are found in over 50 cancer types with frequencies exceeding 80% in glioblastoma and melanoma. These mutations create an identical 11-nucleotide sequence that generates a de novo binding site for ETS family transcription factors.

core_functions:
- description: TERT functions as the catalytic subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, where it exhibits telomerase activity (GO:0003720). TERT catalyzes telomere maintenance via telomerase (GO:0007004) by adding TTAGGG repeats to the 3' ends of chromosomes. This activity occurs within the telomerase holoenzyme complex (GO:0005697) localized to the nucleoplasm (GO:0005654).

    supporting_text: Human TERT contains four evolutionarily conserved structural domains that work together to accomplish the unique enzymatic function of telomere extension. These domains are arranged linearly from the N-terminus to C-terminus - the telomerase essential N-terminal (TEN) domain, the telomerase RNA-binding domain (TRBD), the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, and the C-terminal extension (CTE) domain.
suggested_questions:
- question: What is the physiological significance of the TERT-RMRP RdRP complex?
  experts:
  - telomerase biology
  - RNA biology
- question: How significant are TERT's non-canonical functions (Wnt signaling, mitochondrial protection) relative to its telomerase function?
  experts:
  - cancer biology
  - aging research
suggested_experiments:
- description: Separation-of-function TERT mutants that retain telomerase activity but lack RdRP activity to assess in vivo importance of non-canonical functions.
  experiment_type: genetic
  hypothesis: Non-canonical TERT functions contribute to cellular fitness independent of telomere maintenance.
