## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O14746
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Telomerase reverse transcriptase; EC=2.7.7.49 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21602826, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29695869}; AltName: Full=HEST2; AltName: Full=Telomerase catalytic subunit; AltName: Full=Telomerase-associated protein 2; Short=TP2;
- **Gene Information:** Name=TERT; Synonyms=EST2, TCS1, TRT;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the reverse transcriptase family. Telomerase
- **Key Domains:** DNA/RNA_pol_sf. (IPR043502); RT_dom. (IPR000477); Telomerase_RBD. (IPR021891); Telomerase_RT. (IPR003545); TERT_C. (IPR049139)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "TERT" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'TERT' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **TERT** (gene ID: TERT, UniProt: O14746) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and identity verification
- Target: Human TERT (UniProt O14746), telomerase reverse transcriptase, catalytic subunit of telomerase RNP. Verified organism Homo sapiens and identity by concordance with recent structural and biochemical reviews describing human TERT domain architecture, reverse transcriptase family membership, and assembly within the human telomerase holoenzyme (TEN, TRBD, RT, CTE/CTE-CTE/TERT_C) (2023 NAR Cancer review; 2023 Blood Advances) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3, waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Telomerase: an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that extends 3′ telomeric DNA (TTAGGG)n using its intrinsic RNA (hTR/TERC) as template, thereby counteracting end-replication shortening and enabling long-term proliferative capacity in select normal cells and most cancers (Jan 2023; Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010; https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3, waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).
- Human TERT (hTERT): the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase; rate-limiting for telomerase activity; features four conserved domains—TEN (telomerase essential N-terminus), TRBD (RNA-binding), RT (polymerase active site), and CTE (C-terminal extension)—that coordinate RNA templating, DNA binding, and repeat addition processivity (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- Telomerase holoenzyme architecture: a bilobal RNP in which hTR bridges a catalytic lobe containing TERT (and an H2A–H2B module) and an H/ACA RNP lobe built on dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1; TCAB1 enables trafficking (Aug 2023; Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903; https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2, welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- Cancer activation: Most cancers upregulate telomerase, commonly via TERT promoter mutations at −124 and −146 bp (C>T) that create de novo ETS-factor sites; epigenetic changes at THOR, TERT/TERC copy gain, and enhancer rearrangements also contribute (Nov 2023; Jan 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17020257) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2, iskandar2025areviewof pages 6-8).

2) Enzymatic function and substrate specificity
- Reaction: hTERT catalyzes addition of telomeric d(TTAGGG) repeats to the 3′-overhang of chromosome ends using the hTR template; it is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.49) with RT motifs and a processivity mechanism sustained by TRBD–CR4/5 and t/PK/template interactions that position template and product DNA (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- Substrates: single-stranded telomeric DNA 3′ ends and internal RNA template within hTR; activity is coordinated by shelterin (TPP1–POT1) that recruits telomerase and stimulates processivity at telomeres (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).

3) Domain architecture and holoenzyme assembly
- TERT domains: TEN (DNA engagement/anchor), TRBD (recognizes hTR CR4/5 and t/PK), RT (active site polymerase motifs), CTE (stability and product handling); recent cryo-EM studies define these modules and their arrangement in human telomerase (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- hTR folding and binding: the pseudoknot/template and CR4/5 domains wrap around TERT, stabilizing the catalytic core; an H/ACA RNP lobe (dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2, GAR1) plus TCAB1 mediates hTR maturation/trafficking (Aug 2023; Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903; https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2, welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).

4) Subcellular localization and trafficking
- Nuclear localization: Catalytic telomerase assembly and function occur in the nucleus; telomerase components concentrate in subnuclear Cajal bodies for maturation/trafficking, and are recruited to telomeres via shelterin and TPP1–POT1 interactions (Aug 2023; Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903; https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2, welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- Mitochondrial and extra-telomeric localization: A fraction of hTERT localizes to mitochondria and the cytoplasm; extratelomeric roles include modulation of mitochondrial function/ROS, gene regulation, and interactions with signaling pathways (Aug 2024; Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5, giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).

5) Pathways and biochemical context
- Telomere protection: Shelterin (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1, POT1, RAP1) shapes T- and D-loops, suppresses DNA damage signaling, and coordinates telomerase access; G-quadruplex and higher-order telomeric DNA structures modulate accessibility and regulation (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).
- Transcriptional/epigenetic regulation: TERT expression is controlled by transcription factors (SP1, MYC, NF-κB, ETS, etc.) and by promoter CpG methylation (THOR); canonical promoter mutations create ETS motifs that elevate expression (Nov 2023; Jan 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17020257) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2, iskandar2025areviewof pages 6-8).
- Noncanonical signaling: hTERT can interact with Wnt/β-catenin, NF-κB, growth factor networks, and mitochondrial programs impacting biogenesis and oxidative stress (Aug 2024; Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5, giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).

6) Disease mechanisms and quantitative data
- Cancer: TERT promoter hotspot mutations at −124/−146 bp (C>T) create de novo ETS binding sites and drive ectopic hTERT transcription; these events occur early in tumorigenesis and associate with poor outcomes in multiple cancers (Nov 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2).
- Frequency (overview): The majority of human cancers reactivate telomerase (often cited ~85–90%), with the remainder using ALT; promoter-mutation prevalence varies by tumor type and is comparatively lower in many hematologic malignancies (Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).
- Telomere biology disorders (TBDs): Germline defects in telomerase and associated biogenesis factors cause bone marrow failure and multisystem syndromes (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis); mechanistic reviews emphasize impaired telomerase biogenesis, trafficking, and function (Aug 2023; Aug 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2, boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5).

7) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Structural biology advances: Near-atomic cryo-EM structures of human telomerase define a bilobal architecture, TERT domain arrangement, and RNA–protein interfaces that explain processivity and recruitment, refining drug-design hypotheses (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- TERT promoter reactivation mechanisms: 2023 synthesis clarifies how hotspot mutations remodel ETS binding, G-quadruplex dynamics, and chromatin/telomere looping at the TERT locus; promoter methylation at THOR and enhancer hijacking also contribute (Nov 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2).
- Extratelomeric and mitochondrial roles: 2024–2025 reviews highlight hTERT’s nucleo-mitochondrial shuttling, ROS modulation, and broader signaling crosstalk in cancer and immunity (Aug 2024; Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5, giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).
- Emerging therapeutic modality—TERT degraders: 2025 medicinal chemistry study reports covalent VHL-recruiting degraders that acutely reduce hTERT protein and potentiate DNA damage after irradiation, suggesting benefits beyond catalytic inhibition (May 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2025.130286) (frost2025telomerasereversetranscriptase pages 10-14).

8) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Telomerase inhibitor imetelstat (GRN163L): a direct telomerase inhibitor that has advanced farthest in clinical development for myeloid malignancies; clinical reviews summarize promising activity and ongoing development in lower-risk MDS and related neoplasms (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).
- Therapeutic rationale: Structure-enabled approaches (e.g., template engagement, processivity interfaces) and next-generation strategies (degraders) aim to overcome latency to telomere crisis and potential ALT escape observed with purely catalytic inhibitors (Jan 2023; May 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2025.130286) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3, frost2025telomerasereversetranscriptase pages 10-14).

9) Expert opinions and analysis
- Translational perspective: Blood Advances (2023) concludes telomerase remains a broadly relevant cancer target; imetelstat shows the most advanced clinical trajectory among inhibitors in myeloid diseases (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).
- Structural outlook: NAR Cancer (2023) emphasizes that new human cryo-EM insights resolve long-standing uncertainty about telomerase assembly and recruitment, enabling rational inhibitor design targeting TERT–RNA and telomere-engagement interfaces (Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3).
- Promoter mutations in oncology: 2023 review argues TERT promoter hotspot mutations act as early drivers and poor-prognosis markers across multiple tumors, interacting with oncogenic pathways and epigenetic states to sustain hTERT (Nov 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2).

10) Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- Cancer prevalence of telomerase activation: the majority of cancers reactivate telomerase; commonly cited range ~85–90% (Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).
- Mechanistic hotspots: TERT promoter C>T transitions at −124/−146 bp upstream of ATG are the dominant somatic drivers of hTERT reactivation across diverse tumor types (Nov 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683) (tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2).
- Clinical development status: imetelstat has shown promising activity in myeloid malignancies and remains the telomerase inhibitor with the most advanced clinical evidence among its class (Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).

Notes on localization and assembly evidence
- Nuclear RNP assembly within a bilobal holoenzyme; hTR H/ACA RNP maturation/TCAB1-dependent trafficking and TPP1–POT1-mediated recruitment are consistently supported by 2023 structural/biological reviews (Jan 2023; Aug 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010; https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3, waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2).
- Mitochondrial roles are supported by recent reviews of aging/cancer cross-talk and extratelomeric TERT biology (Aug 2024; Mar 2025) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17071165) (boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5, giunco2025beyondtelomeresunveiling pages 2-4).

Conclusion
Human TERT (O14746) encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase of the telomerase holoenzyme. High-resolution structural work now robustly defines TERT domain architecture and RNP assembly, while oncogenic reactivation is most often driven by promoter hotspots and epigenetic remodeling. Subcellular trafficking integrates Cajal body maturation with shelterin-guided recruitment to telomeres, and extra-telomeric hTERT functions—particularly in mitochondria—broaden TERT’s impact on cancer cell fitness. Clinically, telomerase is actionable: direct active-site inhibitors such as imetelstat are the most advanced, and emerging protein-degradation approaches may suppress both catalytic and noncanonical TERT activities. These insights provide a current, mechanism-centered functional annotation of hTERT and map tangible translational paths for oncology and telomere biology disorders (Jan 2023; Aug 2023; Nov 2023; Aug 2024; May 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1093/narcan/zcad010; https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2023009903; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1286683; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25158542; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2025.130286) (welfer2023recentadvancementsin pages 1-3, waksal2023telomerasetargetedtherapiesin pages 1-2, tornesello2023reactivationoftelomerase pages 1-2, boccardi2024agingcancerand pages 3-5, frost2025telomerasereversetranscriptase pages 10-14).
