description: >-
  UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1) is a large (~173 kDa)
  soluble ER-resident enzyme that serves as the central quality control sensor and
  folding checkpoint in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. UGGT1 recognizes
  glycoproteins with minor folding defects (preferentially molten-globule-like
  intermediates, not fully folded or completely unfolded proteins) and
  reglucosylates their N-glycans, thereby tagging them for re-engagement with the
  calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system. Its core molecular function is
  UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase activity (EC 2.4.1.-), transferring
  glucose from UDP-glucose to deglucosylated high-mannose N-glycans on misfolded
  substrates. Structurally, UGGT1 has a seven-domain architecture: four N-terminal
  thioredoxin-like domains (TRXL1-TRXL4) arranged in an arc that mediate substrate
  recognition, two beta-sandwich domains (betaS1, betaS2), and the C-terminal GT24
  catalytic domain (~20% of the protein) (DOI:10.1073/pnas.1703682114). Substantial
  interdomain conformational flexibility enables UGGT1 to accommodate diverse client
  shapes and to glucosylate glycans at least ~40 angstroms from localized disordered
  regions. UGGT1 writes a site-selective "glyco-code" that determines which ER
  chaperones engage substrates and when during maturation
  (DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2023.11.006). UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation competes with
  EDEM-family mannose trimming in a "tug-of-war" that determines whether substrates
  are retained for refolding or committed to ERAD
  (DOI:10.1101/2023.10.18.562958). UGGT1 activity is modulated by the partner
  selenoprotein SELENOF/SEP15 (DOI:10.1073/pnas.2315009121). UGGT1 is the dominant
  mammalian reglucosyltransferase (UGGT2 is ~7-30% of UGGT1 abundance in tested
  cell lines). Described as a "gatekeeper for quality control" that prevents
  transport of improperly folded glycoproteins out of the ER (PMID:10694380).

      reglucosylation step. This is analogous to how a kinase recognizes its protein
      substrates -- we would not annotate a kinase with "substrate protein binding"
      simply because it must bind substrates to phosphorylate them. The term GO:0051082

      UGGT1 acts after the initial glycosylation and trimming steps, adding glucose
      back to N-glycans on misfolded proteins to retain them in the ER for refolding.

      complexes is not a core defining feature of UGGT1 -- its core function
      is its glucosyltransferase enzymatic activity. The SELENOF complex

      The IDA annotation to GO:0051082 from PMID:10694380 reflects the experimental
      observation that UGGT1 selectively recognizes and acts upon misfolded/unfolded
      glycoproteins. Arnold et al. (2000) demonstrated that HUGT1 (UGGT1) extracts
      show a 27-fold increase in transfer of [14C]glucose from UDP-[14C]glucose to
      denatured substrates. The assay measured glucosyltransferase activity toward
      denatured substrates, not an independent binding activity. UGGT1's interaction
      with unfolded glycoproteins is substrate recognition intrinsic to its
      glucosyltransferase catalytic cycle: the N-terminal domain senses folding
      defects, and the C-terminal catalytic domain then reglucosylates the substrate.
      UniProt describes the FUNCTION as "Recognizes glycoproteins with minor folding
      defects. Reglucosylates single N-glycans near the misfolded part of the protein."
      This is an enzymatic activity, not a standalone binding function. The term
      GO:0051082 is also being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      The experimental evidence in PMID:10694380 demonstrates glucosyltransferase

      separately from the glucosyltransferase activity is an over-annotation -- it

      UGGT1 is not a chaperone that simply binds and holds unfolded proteins; it is an

      assists in protein folding. It is an enzyme that tags misfolded proteins
      for re-entry into the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone cycle. The term
      implies direct folding assistance, which is misleading for UGGT1. A

      chaperone system. "De novo post-translational protein folding" implies direct

    UGGT1 catalyzes the reglucosylation of N-glycans on misfolded glycoproteins
    in the ER lumen, serving as the central folding sensor and checkpoint of the
    calnexin/calreticulin quality control cycle. Its seven-domain architecture
    (TRXL1-4, betaS1-2, GT24 catalytic domain) provides interdomain
    conformational flexibility that enables recognition of diverse
    molten-globule-like folding intermediates and glucosylation of glycans at
    variable distances from misfolded regions (DOI:10.1073/pnas.1703682114).
    UGGT1 writes a site-selective "glyco-code" that programs which ER chaperones
    engage substrates at specific glycosylation sites
    (DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2023.11.006). This reglucosylation competes with
    EDEM-family mannose trimming in a "tug-of-war" that determines substrate
    fate between refolding and ERAD commitment
    (DOI:10.1101/2023.10.18.562958). UGGT1 also promotes substrate solubility
    by maintaining misfolded glycoproteins in the lectin-chaperone cycle,
    reducing insoluble aggregation (DOI:10.1091/mbc.e13-02-0101). Activity is
    modulated by the partner selenoprotein SELENOF/SEP15, which affects a

  title: Interdomain conformational flexibility underpins the activity of UGGT, the
    eukaryotic glycoprotein secretion checkpoint.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1 has a seven-domain topology with four N-terminal thioredoxin-like
      domains (TRXL1-4) arranged in an arc, two beta-sandwich domains, and a
      C-terminal GT24 catalytic domain
  - statement: >-
      Interdomain conformational flexibility is required for activity;
      engineered interdomain disulfides that rigidify UGGT reduce catalytic
      function

  title: ER chaperones use a protein folding and quality control glyco-code.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation writes a programmable glyco-code that
      determines which ER chaperones engage substrates at specific
      glycosylation sites
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1 deletion reduces monoglucosylated AAT by more than half; UGGT1/2
      double deletion abolishes glucosylation
  - statement: >-
      UGGT preferentially modifies particular glycosylation sites (e.g., AAT
      N247 more than N83), supporting positional logic in the glyco-code

  title: UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation of N-glycan competes with ER-associated degradation
    of unstable and misfolded glycoproteins.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1 delays degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in a tug-of-war
      between reglucosylation/refolding and EDEM-mediated mannose trimming
      that commits substrates to ERAD
  - statement: >-
      UGGT2 protein levels are ~6.9% (HCT116) and ~29.8% (HeLa) of UGGT1,
      establishing UGGT1 as the dominant mammalian reglucosyltransferase
- id: DOI:10.1073/pnas.2315009121
  title: Insights into the interaction between UGGT, the gatekeeper of folding in the
    ER, and its partner, the selenoprotein SEP15.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      AlphaFold-multimer predicts a specific UGGT1/SEP15 complex with SEP15
      selenocysteine positioned proximal to UGGT1 catalytic region
  - statement: >-
      About 27% of expressed SEP15 co-occurs with UGGT1; interface mutants
      reduce binding to ~3.8-6.5%
  - statement: >-
      SEP15 affects a subset of UGGT1 clients rather than globally shifting
      all UGGT activity (26 proteins with significantly altered glucosylation
      in SELENOF-null cells)
- id: DOI:10.1091/mbc.e13-02-0101
  title: UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT1) promotes substrate solubility
    in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1 enzymatic activity increases the soluble fraction of misfolded
      alpha-1 antitrypsin variants and reduces insoluble aggregation,
      maintaining ER solubility of folding intermediates through
      monoglucosylation and lectin-chaperone cycling
- id: DOI:10.7554/eLife.63997
  title: Quantitative glycoproteomics reveals cellular substrate selectivity of the
    ER protein quality control sensors UGGT1 and UGGT2.
  findings:
  - statement: >-
      UGGT1 preferentially modifies large, complex glycoproteins (often
      membrane/plasma-membrane targeted), while UGGT2 preferentially modifies
      smaller soluble/lysosomal proteins
