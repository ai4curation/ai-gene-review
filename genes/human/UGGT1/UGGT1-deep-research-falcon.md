2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'UGGT1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional Annotation Research Report — Human UGGT1 (UniProt Q9NYU2)

Publication window emphasis: 2023–2024 where available; foundational work included for mechanistic completeness.

1. Executive summary

UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1; UniProt Q9NYU2) is a soluble, luminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycosyltransferase that acts as a folding sensor (quality-control checkpoint) for N-glycosylated secretory and membrane proteins by transferring a glucose from UDP-glucose onto deglucosylated high-mannose N-glycans on non-native substrates (“reglucosylation”), thereby regenerating the monoglucosylated glycan signal that recruits the lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4)

Across recent studies, UGGT1 emerges as (i) the dominant mammalian reglucosyltransferase that “writes” a site- and time-dependent “glyco-code” controlling lectin-chaperone engagement (2023), (ii) a factor that delays mannose-trimming–dependent ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in a “tug-of-war” between refolding and disposal (2024), and (iii) a protein whose substrate selection can be modulated by the UGGT1 partner selenoprotein SEP15/SELENOF via a defined binding interface supported by AlphaFold-multimer predictions and validated by co-IP and glycoproteomics (2024). (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10, ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 1-5, williams2024insightsintothe pages 5-6)

2. Target identity verification (critical disambiguation)

UGGT1 (Q9NYU2) is the ER quality-control “UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase” that modifies N-linked glycans of glycoproteins; it is not a member of the drug-metabolizing UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A locus, nor a glycolipid glucosyltransferase. The literature summarized here explicitly defines UGGT1 as an ER luminal folding checkpoint enzyme acting in the CNX/CRT cycle through N-glycan reglucosylation, consistent with UniProt’s enzyme description and domain family assignment. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2, adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4)

3. Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)

3.1 The calnexin/calreticulin cycle and “reglucosylation”

Newly synthesized N-glycoproteins in the ER carry N-glycans that are processed to monoglucosylated forms that bind CNX/CRT; after deglucosylation (e.g., by glucosidase II), substrates release from CNX/CRT. UGGT1 functions as a checkpoint by re-adding a glucose onto the N-glycan of incompletely folded proteins, restoring lectin binding and retaining clients in the ER for additional folding attempts. This cycle is schematized in a structural review figure (Figure depicting UGGT and glucosidase II roles), which captures the conceptual flow of trimming → lectin binding → deglucosylation → UGGT-mediated re-entry. (kozlov2020calnexincycle– media d42ce2c5, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2)

3.2 Enzymatic reaction and substrates

Reaction (physiologic): UGGT1 transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to N-linked high-mannose glycans on non-native glycoproteins, generating monoglucosylated N-glycans that are recognized by CNX/CRT. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2)

Donor: UDP-glucose. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2)

Acceptors: deglucosylated high-mannose N-glycans on incompletely folded glycoproteins; UGGT recognition is tied to protein conformational state rather than strict primary sequence. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4)

3.3 Substrate recognition principles (“folding sensor” behavior)

UGGT1 preferentially recognizes partially structured, molten-globule-like clients and is inactive toward fully folded or completely unfolded proteins, consistent with a role in identifying near-native folding intermediates rather than terminally unfolded chains. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10)

Recognition involves exposed hydrophobic regions of the polypeptide (a structural hallmark of non-native states) and glycan features (e.g., likely involvement of the innermost GlcNAc), and UGGT can sense local folding defects in otherwise folded proteins. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4)

Spatial reach: UGGT can glucosylate N-glycans at least ~40 Å away from a localized disordered region, supporting a model where UGGT bridges a misfold “sensor” site and a separate glycan “writer” site. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10)

4. Protein features: localization, domain architecture, and structure–function

4.1 Subcellular localization

UGGT is a large, soluble ER-resident protein with a C-terminal KDEL-like retrieval sequence, consistent with ER luminal residency and retrieval. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10)

Beyond the ER, immunolocalization evidence indicates UGGT can also be found in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), consistent with ER/early secretory pathway surveillance. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2)

4.2 Domain architecture (folding-sensor + catalytic “writer” modules)

UGGT has a multi-domain architecture in which the catalytic activity resides in the C-terminal portion (~20% of the protein) corresponding to a GT family 24 catalytic domain, while N-terminal regions contribute to folding sensing and substrate engagement. (suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10, takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2)

Structural studies describe a seven-domain topology: four N-terminal thioredoxin-like domains (TRXL1–TRXL4) arranged in an arc, followed by two seven-stranded β-sandwich domains (βS1, βS2) that clasp the C-terminal glucosyltransferase (GT) domain. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 2-2)

4.3 Structural basis for promiscuity and checkpoint activity

A cryo-EM reconstruction at ~15 Å and crystallography show substantial interdomain conformational flexibility in the TRXL region; engineered interdomain disulfides that rigidify UGGT reduce activity, supporting the hypothesis that flexibility enables UGGT to accommodate diverse client shapes and to position its catalytic domain relative to glycans at variable distances from misfolds. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 2-2)

Reported structural dimensions from crystals: molecules of approximately 6 × 8 × 12 nm. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2)

5. Recent developments (prioritized 2023–2024)

5.1 2023: A “glyco-code” for ER chaperone selection (Guay et al., Molecular Cell; 2023-12; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.11.006)

Concept: UGGT1-mediated reglucosylation is framed as a programmable “glyco-code” that determines which ER chaperones engage a given glycoprotein and when during maturation. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10, guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 1-3)

Quantitative data (notable statistics): In the serpin models alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and antithrombin III (ATIII), wild-type AAT was reported as ~23% glucosylated and wild-type ATIII as ~31% glucosylated, indicating differing baseline engagement by the UGGT/lectin system. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10)

UGGT isoform contribution: UGGT1 deletion reduced monoglucosylated AAT by more than half and reduced ATIII glucosylation by ~25%, while UGGT1/2 double deletion abolished glucosylation, establishing UGGT1 as the predominant writer of monoglucosylation for these substrates. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10)

Site selectivity: UGGT preferentially modifies particular glycosylation sites (e.g., AAT N247 more than N83; ATIII N192 highest among assayed sites), supporting a positional logic to the glyco-code. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 10-11)

5.2 2024: UGGT1 competes with ERAD to delay degradation (Ninagawa et al., eLife; 2024-09; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.18.562958)

Finding: In human cells with genetic disruption of UGGT1/2, UGGT1 was shown to delay degradation of misfolded and unstable glycoproteins (including ATF6α), contradicting earlier assumptions that reglucosylation does not affect degradation rates for some substrates. (ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 1-5)

Mechanistic framing: The authors propose a “tug-of-war” where UGGT1-driven reglucosylation and refolding compete against EDEM-family mannose trimming that commits substrates to glycoprotein ERAD. (ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 1-5)

Isoform dependence and abundance estimate: UGGT2 protein levels were much lower than UGGT1, estimated at ~6.9% of UGGT1 in HCT116 cells and ~29.8% in HeLa, consistent with UGGT1 being the dominant determinant of the observed ERAD-delay phenotype. (ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 5-9)

5.3 2024: Structural and functional dissection of the UGGT1–SEP15/SELENOF complex (Williams et al., PNAS; 2024-08; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2315009121)

Structural modeling: AlphaFold2/AlphaFold-multimer models predict a specific UGGT1/SEP15 complex with interface features (including buried surface area contributions from UGGT1 residues such as F243, F244, L262) and position SEP15’s redox-active selenocysteine proximal to UGGT1’s catalytic region, suggesting a potential redox-adjacent modulatory role. (williams2024insightsintothe pages 4-5, williams2024insightsintothe pages 2-3)

Experimental validation (quantitative): Coimmunoprecipitation showed ~27% of expressed SEP15 co-occurs with UGGT1; interface mutants in UGGT1 markedly reduced binding (to ~3.8% and ~6.5% SEP15 bound, depending on mutant). (williams2024insightsintothe pages 5-6)

Client modulation: In SELENOF/ALG6 double knockout cells, quantitative glycoproteomics found 26 proteins with significantly altered UGGT-mediated glucosylation, with seven proteins showing ≥50% changes in reglucosylation, indicating SEP15 affects a subset of UGGT1’s cellular client landscape rather than globally shifting all UGGT activity. (williams2024insightsintothe pages 5-6)

6. Current applications and real-world implementations

6.1 Host-factor biology and antiviral concepts

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry: UGGT1 was identified as an SR-BI-interacting protein, and UGGT1 silencing reduced SR-BI protein level and reduced HCV entry/infection, supporting UGGT1 as a proviral host factor via its role in ER quality control and folding of the N-glycosylated entry co-receptor SR-BI. (Frontiers in Microbiology; 2019-09; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02043) (huang2019srbiinteractomeanalysis pages 1-2, huang2019srbiinteractomeanalysis pages 8-11)

Therapeutic angle (expert analysis): A structural/virology-focused dissertation assessing calnexin cycle components discusses UGGT1 inhibition as a candidate host-target antiviral concept and notes that only UDP (product) is a known small-molecule inhibitor in that context, motivating fragment-based discovery; it also reports virus-specific dependence of different viruses on UGGT isoforms (e.g., UGGT1 KO reducing Zika secretion in their assays). (hill2018structuralcharacterisationof pages 32-36, hill2018structuralcharacterisationof pages 212-217)

6.2 Proteostasis engineering / biomanufacturing-relevant implications

UGGT1 as an anti-aggregation/solubilizing factor: In a cell-based primary study, UGGT1 enzymatic activity increased the soluble fraction of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin variants (NHK, ATZ) and reduced insoluble aggregation/polymerization signals, consistent with a role in maintaining ER solubility of folding intermediates through monoglucosylation and lectin-chaperone cycling. (Molecular Biology of the Cell; 2013-09; https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e13-02-0101) (ferris2013udpglucoseglycoproteinglucosyltransferase(uggt1) pages 2-3, ferris2013udpglucoseglycoproteinglucosyltransferase(uggt1) pages 7-8)

This mechanism implies practical leverage points in recombinant glycoprotein production and in therapeutic protein engineering: modulating UGGT1/lectin-cycle engagement can shift the balance between soluble folding intermediates and aggregated material for difficult-to-fold glycoproteins. (ferris2013udpglucoseglycoproteinglucosyltransferase(uggt1) pages 2-3, suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10)

7. Expert opinions and authoritative interpretations (with evidence basis)

UGGT1 as “gatekeeper/checkpoint”: Reviews and primary literature consistently characterize UGGT as the folding checkpoint in the ER lectin cycle—its unique role is to selectively reglucosylate non-native glycoproteins to retain them in the ER, preventing premature ER exit. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4)

Flexibility enables broad surveillance: Structural work interprets interdomain conformational flexibility as a functional requirement for recognizing a wide variety of misfolded glycoprotein conformations and for geometrically reaching glycans positioned variably relative to folding defects. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 2-2)

UGGT1 vs UGGT2 division of labor: Proteomics-based and functional work supports an isoform specialization in which UGGT1 is the dominant reglucosyltransferase in many cellular contexts and preferentially modifies large, complex (often membrane/plasma-membrane targeted) substrates, while UGGT2 preferentially modifies smaller soluble/lysosomal proteins and may be lower abundance in some cell types. (adams2020quantitativeglycoproteomicsreveals pages 1-4, ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 5-9)

8. Key statistics and data points (selected)

Reglucosylation prevalence and isoform dependence in serpins (2023): WT AAT ~23% glucosylated; WT ATIII ~31% glucosylated; UGGT1 deletion reduces AAT monoglucosylation by >50% and reduces ATIII glucosylation by ~25%; UGGT1/2 double deletion abolishes glucosylation. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10)

SEP15 modulation of UGGT1 client set (2024): ~27% SEP15 co-occurs with UGGT1; binding reduced to ~3.8% and ~6.5% by UGGT interface mutants; 26 proteins significantly altered in glucosylation in SELENOF−/−/ALG6−/− vs ALG6−/−, with seven proteins changing ≥50%. (williams2024insightsintothe pages 5-6)

UGGT2 relative abundance estimates (2024): ~6.9% (HCT116) and ~29.8% (HeLa) relative to UGGT1 (as reported in the study’s experimental context). (ninagawa2024uggt1mediatedreglucosylationof pages 5-9)

Structural/biophysical metrics: UGGT crystal molecule size ~6 × 8 × 12 nm; cryo-EM reconstruction ~15 Å; ability to target glycans ≥~40 Å from local disorder. (roversi2017interdomainconformationalflexibility pages 1-2, suzuki2021foldingandquality pages 9-10)

9. Limitations and open questions (evidence-based)

Catalytic parameters (Km/kcat) and detailed acceptor-branch specificity for human UGGT1 are not directly reported in the retrieved excerpts; therefore, this report focuses on validated qualitative/quantitative cellular readouts (monoglucosylation fractions, substrate lists, binding fractions) and structural principles rather than enzyme kinetics. (takeda2016effectsofdomain pages 1-2, guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10)

UGGT1’s precise rules for choosing which glycan(s) on a multi-glycosylated substrate to reglucosylate are being clarified by recent site-selective glycoproteomics (“glyco-code”), but the generality of these rules across diverse endogenous clients remains an active research area. (guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 8-10, guay2023erchaperonesuse pages 10-11)
