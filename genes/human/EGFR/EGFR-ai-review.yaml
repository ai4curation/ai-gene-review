description: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1/HER1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (EC 2.7.10.1)
  that binds EGF family ligands (EGF, TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, betacellulin, epiregulin, epigen, HB-EGF)
  to initiate signal transduction cascades controlling cell proliferation, survival, differentiation,
  and migration. Upon ligand binding, EGFR undergoes homo- or heterodimerization (with ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4),
  which activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain through trans-autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail serve as docking sites for SH2/PTB domain-containing adaptor
  proteins (GRB2, SHC, etc.), leading to activation of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK), PI3K-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC,
  and STAT signaling pathways. EGFR localizes primarily to the plasma membrane and continues signaling
  from early endosomes after clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Receptor downregulation occurs through CBL-mediated
  ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. EGFR mutations and overexpression drive multiple cancers including
  non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioblastoma.

  review:
    summary: Core catalytic function of EGFR as a receptor tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates substrate
      proteins on tyrosine residues
    action: NEW
    reason: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
      on target substrate proteins. Upon ligand binding and receptor dimerization, EGFR undergoes autophosphorylation
      of its C-terminal tyrosine residues, which then serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins. EGFR
      also phosphorylates numerous downstream substrate proteins on tyrosine residues to propagate growth
      factor signaling. This peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation activity is fundamental to EGFR's mechanism
      of signal transduction.

  review:
    summary: Essential mechanism of EGFR activation through trans-autophosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine
      residues upon ligand-induced dimerization
    action: NEW
    reason: Protein autophosphorylation is the fundamental mechanism by which EGFR activates its signaling
      cascade. Upon EGF or other ligand binding, EGFR undergoes dimerization, which brings two kinase
      domains into proximity for trans-autophosphorylation. EGFR phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues
      in its own C-terminal tail (including Y1068, Y1086, Y1148, Y1173), creating docking sites for SH2
      and PTB domain-containing signaling proteins. This autophosphorylation is essential for EGFR signal
      transduction and downstream pathway activation.
