description: 'SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine), also known as
  osteonectin or BM-40, is a 303-amino acid matricellular glycoprotein that modulates
  cell-matrix interactions rather than providing direct structural support. SPARC
  exhibits modular architecture comprising an acidic N-terminal domain (Ca2+ binding),
  a central follistatin-like domain with a Kazal-like protease inhibitor motif, and
  a C-terminal extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain containing two EF-hand motifs.
  The protein binds 8-10 Ca2+ ions per molecule with both high-affinity (EF-hand)
  and low-affinity (acidic domain) sites. SPARC is a high-affinity collagen-binding
  protein with sequence-specific recognition of the GVMGFO motif in collagens I, IV,
  and V. Its primary biological role is as a counter-adhesive factor that disrupts
  focal adhesions and promotes cell rounding/deadhesion, paradoxically regulating
  cell-matrix interactions through context-dependent effects on cell adhesion, migration,
  and ECM assembly. SPARC also functions in regulating angiogenesis (both pro- and
  anti-angiogenic depending on context), bone mineralization by linking hydroxyapatite
  to collagen, and tissue remodeling during wound healing and development. The protein
  is highly expressed in tissues undergoing morphogenesis, remodeling, and repair.
  Recessive mutations in SPARC cause osteogenesis imperfecta type 17 (OI17), highlighting
  its essential role in collagen secretion and bone matrix organization.'

      reason: This IBA annotation suggests a role in semicircular canal

      reason: SPARC is definitively a high-affinity calcium-binding protein with
