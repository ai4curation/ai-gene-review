## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q07507
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dermatopontin; AltName: Full=Tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein; Short=TRAMP; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DPT;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the dermatopontin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Dermatopontin. (IPR026645); DERM (PF14704)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DPT" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DPT' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DPT** (gene ID: DPT, UniProt: Q07507) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation: **DPT (Dermatopontin)**

## Introduction and Key Concepts  
**Dermatopontin (DPT)** is a protein-coding gene (UniProt Q07507) that encodes the *dermatopontin* protein, also known as tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein (TRAMP). Dermatopontin is a small (~200-amino-acid) **extracellular matrix (ECM)** protein that is highly conserved across species ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=well%20conserved%20among%20the%20species,an%20infarct%20zone%20of%20experimental)). In humans, the DPT gene is located on chromosome 1q24 and primarily expressed by fibroblasts and related connective tissue cells. The protein is secreted and localized to the ECM – for example, in skin dermis it is found on the surface of collagen fibrils ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=well%20conserved%20among%20the%20species,this%20protein%27s%20involvement%20in%20wound)). Dermatopontin is characterized by an abundance of tyrosine residues (many of which are post-translationally sulfated) and an overall acidic composition ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,helical%20collagen%20comprise%20an)). It belongs to the dermatopontin family (of which it is the principal member in mammals) and contains a single conserved *DERM* domain (PF14704) responsible for its ECM interactions. Notably, dermatopontin is not an enzyme or receptor, but a **matricellular protein** – a class of ECM proteins that modulate cell–matrix interactions and signaling without forming structural fibers ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,in%20many%20physiological%20and%20pathological)). Early studies and database annotations posited that DPT “**mediates adhesion by cell surface integrin binding**” and serves as a link between fibroblasts and their extracellular environment ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Proximity%20extension%20assay,show%20less)). It has also been *“postulated to modify the behavior of TGF-β”* (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) through interactions with other matrix components ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Biological%20process%20%28UniProt%29,beta%20through)). In summary, DPT is defined as an ECM-associated regulator protein that influences cell adhesion, matrix assembly, and growth factor signaling.

## Structure and Localization  
The dermatopontin protein is translated as a precursor with an N-terminal signal peptide, directing it to the secretory pathway (consistent with its detection in secretory vesicles ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Mixed%20function%20%28mainly))). The mature protein (~185 amino acids) is released to the extracellular space, where it becomes incorporated into the matrix. **Dermatopontin lacks large glycosaminoglycan chains** (it is not a proteoglycan itself), but its many tyrosines can be sulfated – up to six sulfate groups have been observed on bovine corneal dermatopontin ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=discovered%20that%20DPT%20is%20present,similar%20to%20that%20of%20the)). This high degree of tyrosine sulfation gives the protein a highly negative charge, which is functionally significant for binding positively charged sites on other proteins (such as collagen, discussed below). Dermatopontin does not form fibrils on its own; instead, it exists as a soluble or matrix-bound globular protein. Its structure has been challenging to solve experimentally (no X-ray or NMR structure was reported as of 2023), but *in silico* modeling suggests a beta-sheet-rich fold ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=consequently%20expressed%20in%20several%20tissues,FN%2C%20and%20perceived)). Functionally, dermatopontin may form protein–protein interfaces via specific motifs: a notable example is a conserved **adhesion motif** (sequence *GQVVVAVR* in bovine DPT) that mediates cell binding ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=Adhesion%20of%20HaCaT%20cells%20to,4%20was%20strongly)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). In terms of tissue distribution, DPT is ubiquitously present in connective tissues. It is **predicted to be secreted to the extracellular matrix**, with experimental evidence localizing it at sites like the dermal collagen network and the stromal interface of organs ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=well%20conserved%20among%20the%20species,an%20infarct%20zone%20of%20experimental)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF)). The Human Protein Atlas indicates DPT is **enriched in fibroblast-rich locations** and is indeed found in the extracellular matrix of tissues such as skin, tendon, and the adventitia of vessels ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Predicted%20location,Mixed%20function%20%28mainly)) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20specificity,assigned%20CANCER%20%26%20CELL%20LINES)). Intracellularly, DPT is observed in the vesicular compartment of fibroblasts (consistent with secretion) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Tissue%20profile,Mixed%20function%20%28mainly)), and a portion can transiently reside on the cell surface. Overall, DPT’s structure and localization enable it to function as an **interface molecule** between cells and the structural matrix.

## Expression Profile and Tissue Distribution  
**DPT gene expression** is broadly detected in human tissues, with highest levels in those rich in connective tissue. RNA profiling (NCBI and GTEx data) shows **strong expression in adipose tissue (fat)** with RPKM ~270, and high levels in **heart, skin, and lung** among others ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1805#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20is%20an%20extracellular%20matrix,14%20other%20tissues%20See%20more)). Dermatopontin is expressed in both fetal and adult tissues; one study noted it is *“strongly expressed in human fetal and adult liver, kidney, and spleen”* while weaker in heart and ovary ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF)). Single-cell RNA data indicate DPT is particularly enriched in fibroblasts and related mesenchymal cells – for example, it is group-enriched in **dermal fibroblasts, testicular Leydig cells, and peritubular cells** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Single%20cell%20type%20specificity,ECM%20organization%20%28mainly)). In line with this, tissues like skin dermis, intestinal submucosa, and smooth muscle stroma show high DPT levels (HPA classifies DPT as “tissue enhanced” in intestine and smooth muscle) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=TISSUE%20RNA%20EXPRESSION%20Tissue%20specificity,Single%20cell%20type)). Notably, **immune cells do not express DPT** ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Tissue%20cell%20type%20classification,no%20cluster%20assigned)), and it is low in parenchymal cells like hepatocytes or neurons, underscoring that DPT is a product of the stromal compartment.  

At the protein level, dermatopontin is a component of the extracellular matrix across various organs. It has been detected in **wound fluid and blood plasma** at low concentrations, especially during tissue injury. For instance, dermatopontin is present in the **fibrin clot and wound exudate** in early wound healing, at higher concentration than in normal serum ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=We%20report%20that%20dermatopontin%20,When%20incubated%20with%20DP)). In the cornea (a collagen-rich tissue), DPT is fairly abundant – about 0.02% of corneal stromal protein by mass ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=discovered%20that%20DPT%20is%20present,similar%20to%20that%20of%20the)) – reflecting its role in corneal matrix organization. Changes in DPT expression are observed in disease states: **dermatopontin levels often decrease in fibrotic or scarred tissues.** Fibroblasts cultured from hypertrophic scars and from systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) lesions show *significantly reduced DPT mRNA and protein* compared to normal skin fibroblasts ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=expression%20of%20dermatopontin%20mRNA%20and,We)). In hypertrophic scar tissue, DPT was lower in lesion areas than in patient-matched normal skin ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=expression%20of%20dermatopontin%20mRNA%20and,We)). This downregulation likely results from the altered cytokine milieu; indeed, DPT expression in fibroblasts can be regulated by factors like TGF-β1 and IL-4 (both prominent in fibrosis) as well as by the abundance of collagen matrix ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20is%20a%20recently%20discovered,We)). In cancer, a somewhat analogous pattern is seen: **loss of DPT expression has been noted in tumor stroma.** For example, in **hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**, DPT mRNA is normally high in liver fibroblasts but was found to be *significantly downregulated in HCC tumors*, with the protein weakly expressed in cancerous regions compared to surrounding tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF)). HCC areas with active TGF-β signaling showed low DPT, suggesting tumors may suppress DPT to modify their matrix environment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=tumor,beta1%20and%20other%20potential%20mechanisms)). On the other hand, certain pathological conditions show **increased DPT expression as part of tissue remodeling**. A striking example is obesity: in adipose tissue of obese individuals, DPT expression is elevated (discussed further below) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=of%20DPT%20on%20ECM%20remodelling,p)). Likewise, in osteoarthritic cartilage, *DPT is upregulated* relative to healthy cartilage, reflecting ongoing ECM remodeling in osteoarthritis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=analysis%20identified%20ALB%2C%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,ssGSEA%20results%20revealed%20that%20abnormal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=match%20at%20L56%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,progression%20and%20immune%20cell%20infiltration)). In summary, DPT is broadly expressed in the body’s connective tissues under homeostatic conditions, and its levels can fluctuate in response to tissue remodeling, injury, or disease – generally decreasing in some fibrotic and cancerous contexts, while increasing in others like degenerative cartilage or inflamed adipose tissue.

## Biological Function and Mechanisms  
Dermatopontin plays a multifaceted role in the extracellular matrix, impacting both the **structural assembly of the matrix and the behavior of cells interacting with the matrix**. Key functions and mechanisms include:

- **Cell Adhesion Mediator:** One of dermatopontin’s earliest identified functions was to promote cell adhesion. It was initially purified from dermal extracts as a **cell-binding protein**. DPT **binds to cell surface integrins** and other receptors, effectively gluing cells to the ECM ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,show%20less)). For example, studies with human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) showed that these cells adhere strongly to a DPT-coated surface, spreading and forming actin stress fibers ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=dermis%2C%20promoted%20cell%20adhesion%20of,is%20a%20novel%20epidermal%20cell)). This adhesion was inhibited by EDTA (implicating integrins, which require divalent cations) and by heparin ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=dermis%2C%20promoted%20cell%20adhesion%20of,is%20a%20novel%20epidermal%20cell)). Further analysis revealed **two parallel binding interactions**: (1) DPT engages **α3β1 integrin** on the cell membrane, and (2) DPT binds to a **heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor** on the cell (most likely a syndecan) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). Notably, a synthetic DPT peptide (“DP-4”, corresponding to residues 33–43 of bovine dermatopontin) could block cell adhesion to DPT and, when immobilized, this peptide itself promoted cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=Adhesion%20of%20HaCaT%20cells%20to,4%20was%20strongly)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). The core active sequence (GQVVVAVR) within this peptide was pinpointed as critical for binding ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=PHGQVVVAVRS%3B%20bovine%20dermatopontin%20residues%2033,chondroitinase%20ABC%20treatment%20did%20not)). The DP-4 peptide’s activity was abolished by heparitinase (which cleaves heparan sulfate chains on syndecans), confirming that **dermatopontin’s adhesive function involves binding to syndecan proteoglycans on the cell surface** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). In summary, DPT acts as a **bridging molecule**: one part of DPT binds integrins and another part binds syndecan (heparan sulfate), bringing the cell into firm contact with the ECM. Through this dual mechanism, dermatopontin serves as a *multifunctional adhesion molecule for epidermal and dermal cells* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=heparin%2C%20and%20this%20interaction%20was,multifunctional%20adhesion%20molecule%20for%20epidermal)).

- **Collagen Fibrillogenesis and Matrix Assembly:** Dermatopontin is deeply involved in organizing collagen fibers, a fundamental component of connective tissues. It **binds to fibrillar collagens (such as type I, II, III)** at specific sites and influences fibril formation. According to UniProt annotations and experimental evidence, DPT *“accelerates collagen fibril formation, and stabilizes collagen fibrils against low-temperature dissociation”* ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,show%20less)). Recent biochemical research has illuminated how DPT interacts with collagen. In 2022, Chakravarti and colleagues purified dermatopontin from corneal tissue and mapped its binding on collagen using peptide toolkits ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=discovered%20that%20DPT%20is%20present,similar%20to%20that%20of%20the)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=residues.%20This%20collagen,the%20corresponding%20arginine%20residues%20in)). They discovered that **DPT preferentially binds collagen at arginine-rich sequences** in the triple helix – notably, regions involved in collagen cross-linking and the site where collagenase enzymes cleave collagen ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=helical%20collagens%20II%20and%20III,of%20the%20three%20arginine%20residues)). The binding motif recognized by DPT (an arginine- and hydrophobic-rich sequence) is strikingly similar to the motif recognized by the collagen chaperone HSP47 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=find%20that%20strong%20DPT,44%20resulted%20in%20almost)). This suggests **dermatopontin may function like an extracellular collagen chaperone**, stabilizing or arranging collagen molecules once they are secreted ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=residues.%20This%20collagen,the%20corresponding%20arginine%20residues%20in)). Indeed, the authors propose DPT “assumes the role of HSP47 after secretion” in guiding proper fibril assembly ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=residues.%20This%20collagen,the%20corresponding%20arginine%20residues%20in)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=residues.%20This%20collagen,the%20corresponding%20arginine%20residues%20in)). The functional consequence is that DPT can facilitate the **timely formation of collagen fibrils** and enhance their tensile stability. Supporting this, targeted deletion of DPT in mice resulted in a phenotype similar to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a collagen disorder): the mice had abnormally elastic, fragile skin due to disorganized collagen fibrils ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=decorin%29,beta1%20interacts%20with)). This in vivo outcome underscores that DPT is required for normal collagen architecture. Furthermore, DPT’s binding to collagen may have implications in disease: the same study noted that certain collagen genetic mutations (arginine substitutions in collagens I and II) which cause osteogenesis imperfecta and other dysplasias occur at the sites that **abolish DPT binding** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=Collagen%20Toolkit%20II%20peptides,of%20the%20role%20of%20DPT)). It is speculated that loss of DPT–collagen interaction in those mutants contributes to the connective tissue pathology ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=Collagen%20Toolkit%20II%20peptides,of%20the%20role%20of%20DPT)). In summary, dermatopontin helps orchestrate collagen assembly in the ECM, ensuring fibers form correctly and interact properly with other matrix components.

- **Interaction with Fibronectin and Provisional Matrix Formation:** Besides collagens, **dermatopontin interacts with fibronectin**, another key ECM glycoprotein. Fibronectin exists in a soluble form in plasma and in an insoluble fibrillar form in the ECM; the conversion requires fibronectin unfolding and fibril assembly. A 2011 *Journal of Biological Chemistry* study by Kato *et al.* demonstrated that DPT can bind fibronectin and **promote fibronectin fibril formation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=with%20both%20fibrin%20and%20fibronectin,The)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=III_,initial%20stage%20of%20wound%20healing)). In wound healing models, DPT was found to colocalize with **fibrin and fibronectin in the clot**, indicating it is present in the *provisional matrix* of early wounds ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=We%20report%20that%20dermatopontin%20,When%20incubated%20with%20DP)). There, DPT markedly enhanced cell adhesion to a fibrin–fibronectin matrix: both normal human fibroblasts and HT1080 cells (fibrosarcoma cells) showed significantly increased attachment when DPT was added ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=We%20report%20that%20dermatopontin%20,When%20incubated%20with%20DP)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=with%20both%20fibrin%20and%20fibronectin,The)). This adhesion was mediated primarily by **α5β1 integrin**, the main fibronectin-binding integrin on cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=provisional%20matrix%20at%20the%20initial,fibronectin%20with%20DP%20were%20the)). Mechanistically, DPT alters fibronectin’s conformation. It was shown to bind to specific fibronectin type III domains (particularly III_13 and III_14 domains) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=electron%20microscopy,by%20changing%20the%20fibronectin%20conformation)). By doing so, DPT *inhibited* interactions that keep fibronectin in a compact, inactive form and *enhanced* interactions that lead to fibronectin unfolding and fibril assembly ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=III_,by%20changing%20the%20fibronectin%20conformation)). In essence, **dermatopontin acts as a co-factor that triggers fibronectin to polymerize into fibrils** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=III_,initial%20stage%20of%20wound%20healing)). Electron microscopy confirmed that mixing fibronectin with DPT leads to robust fibronectin fibril networks, whereas fibronectin alone remains more soluble ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=fibronectin%20matrix%20were%20dose,12%E2%80%9314%7D%20was%20specifically%20and%20strongly)). This activity has important functional consequences: in the presence of DPT, cells adhering to the fibronectin matrix had more organized cytoskeletons and presumably stronger adhesion, which is beneficial for the stability of a healing wound ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=with%20both%20fibrin%20and%20fibronectin,The)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=involved%20in%20forming%20a%20globular,initial%20stage%20of%20wound%20healing)). Thus, DPT accelerates the formation of a mature ECM from the initial fibrin/fibronectin-rich clot, effectively **bridging early wound matrix to a stable scar**. This explains why DPT is heavily present in wound fluid – it’s part of the molecular toolkit for wound repair. Taken together, by promoting collagen and fibronectin assembly, dermatopontin plays a central role in **ECM organization** and in creating a microenvironment that supports tissue integrity.

- **Modulation of Growth Factor Signaling (TGF-β1):** Dermatopontin has a significant biochemical interaction with the cytokine **Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)**, a master regulator of fibrosis and cell growth. However, DPT does not bind TGF-β1 directly with high affinity – instead, it interacts with **decorin**, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that is a known TGF-β *binder*. In a seminal 1999 study, Yamaguchi *et al.* found that DPT and decorin form a complex: *“Dermatopontin reacted with decorin with an apparent Kd of 100 nM”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=extracellular%20matrix%2C%20was%20studied%20for,by%20dermatopontin%20or%20decorin%20alone)). DPT by itself **inhibited decorin’s ability to bind TGF-β1**, and conversely decorin could compete DPT off TGF-β, suggesting they bind overlapping regions on the cytokine ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=bioactivity,luciferase%20construct%2C%20although)). Intriguingly, when decorin and DPT were both present, the *complex* bound about **3-fold more TGF-β1** than either component alone ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=bioactivity,luciferase%20construct%2C%20although)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=beta1%20complex,the%20proliferation%20of%20mink%20lung)). In functional assays, **dermatopontin markedly augmented the biological activity of TGF-β1** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=each%20component%20individually%2C%20and%20binding,beta)). Specifically, in cells transfected with a TGF-β–responsive reporter (PAI-1 promoter-luciferase), the addition of DPT led to higher luciferase expression in response to TGF-β1 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=each%20component%20individually%2C%20and%20binding,beta%20on)). DPT alone did not activate the reporter, but it **enhanced TGF-β’s effect**. Correspondingly, in cell proliferation assays, DPT showed a weak growth-inhibitory effect by itself, but when combined with TGF-β1 it made TGF-β’s antiproliferative effect more potent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20augmented%20the%20biological%20activity,in%20the%20microenvironment%20of%20the)). The authors concluded that *“dermatopontin increases the cellular response to TGF-β”* and *“modifies the behavior of TGF-β through interaction with decorin in the ECM”* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20showed%20weak%20inhibitory%20activity,in%20the%20microenvironment%20of%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=these%20cells,the%20extracellular%20matrix%20in%20vivo)). In simpler terms, **dermatopontin can concentrate or present TGF-β1 to cell receptors by tweaking decorin’s sequestration of TGF-β**. Decorin normally binds and neutralizes TGF-β; DPT appears to loosen this restraint, allowing more TGF-β to engage cells, thereby **promoting TGF-β-mediated signaling**. This finding is very relevant to tissue remodeling and pathology: TGF-β is key to collagen production and fibrosis, so DPT can indirectly boost matrix deposition via TGF-β. It may seem counterintuitive that DPT, which is downregulated in scars, enhances TGF-β (which promotes scarring). One interpretation is that **DPT provides feedback control**: in normal healing, DPT helps TGF-β drive productive repair, but in chronic fibrosis, sustained high TGF-β may suppress DPT (as noted in scars ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=proteoglycan%20and%20cell,We))), creating a vicious cycle of disordered matrix. In any case, the DPT–decorin–TGF-β axis is a prime example of dermatopontin’s role in **modulating biochemical signals in the ECM microenvironment**.

- **Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation:** By virtue of its effects on adhesion and growth factor signaling, dermatopontin influences fundamental cell behaviors. Generally, **DPT tends to enforce a non-proliferative, differentiated state in cells embedded in the matrix**. The UniProt functional summary notes that DPT *“inhibits cell proliferation”* (observed in multiple cell types) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=Protein%20function%20%28UniProt%29,temperature%20dissociation%20%28By)). When cells adhere strongly to matrix (with DPT’s help) and are exposed to active TGF-β, they often exit the cell cycle and differentiate. For example, experiments in muscle cell culture (C2C12 myoblasts) showed that adding DPT or increasing its expression **promoted myoblast differentiation into myotubes**, while **reducing cell proliferation** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,yet%20unknown%2C%20and%20validated%20it)). DPT knockdown had the opposite effect: myoblasts with depleted DPT were less adherent, proliferated more, and had impaired differentiation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30970625/#:~:text=the%20extracellular%20matrix%20predominantly%20found,silico)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30970625/#:~:text=of%20DPT%20in%20myogenesis%20and,FN)). Similarly, in mesenchymal stem cells from the periodontal ligament, DPT expression rises during **osteogenic differentiation**, and if DPT is silenced, the stem cells show **decreased mineralization and differentiation into osteoblasts** (along with reduced proliferation capacity) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111923000264#:~:text=DPT%20was%20upregulated%20during%20the,osteogenic%20differentiation%20of%20hPDLSCs)). These data suggest that DPT is required to create a pro-differentiation niche – likely by organizing the ECM and activating signals like TGF-β that push cells towards a mature phenotype. There are also indications that DPT can affect apoptosis and cell cycle via interactions not fully understood (some studies mention a potential integrin-mediated signaling pathway). However, the consistent theme is that **dermatopontin discourages unchecked cell growth** and encourages cells to **adhere and specialize**. This fits with its proposed role as a tumor suppressive factor in certain cancers (its loss in tumors could remove restraints on cell proliferation ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF))). It’s important to note that in some contexts, DPT’s effect on proliferation is “context-dependent” – for instance, one study found DPT itself didn’t affect endothelial cell proliferation but still promoted angiogenic behavior ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=when%20plated%20on%20a%20matrigel,angiogenic)). Nevertheless, in the majority of connective tissue cells studied (fibroblasts, myocytes, stem cells), **DPT’s presence correlates with slower growth and enhanced differentiation**, aligning with the needs of stable tissue maintenance ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,yet%20unknown%2C%20and%20validated%20it)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20augmented%20the%20biological%20activity,in%20the%20microenvironment%20of%20the)).

- **Angiogenesis and Wound Healing:** Beyond structural and growth factor roles, dermatopontin has been implicated in the process of new blood vessel formation (**angiogenesis**), particularly in healing wounds. DPT is strongly upregulated in the dermis surrounding wounds and in infarcted heart tissue, hinting it might assist tissue repair ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=decorin%29,beta1%20interacts%20with)). A 2017 study provided evidence that **dermatopontin has pro-angiogenic properties** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=assays%20apparently%20depicted%20that%20DPT,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)). In *in vitro* assays, adding recombinant DPT to endothelial cells did not make them proliferate, but it significantly promoted **endothelial cell migration and tube formation** on a Matrigel matrix ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=when%20plated%20on%20a%20matrigel,angiogenic)). In organ explant models (aortic ring or CAM assays), DPT stimulated **neovessel sprouting** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=effect%20on%20the%20proliferation%20of,therapeutic%20values%20in%20managing%20chronic)). Moreover, treating endothelial cells with DPT led to changes in gene expression: notably, it **modulated the expression of TGF-β1 and integrin α3β1 in these cells** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20endothelial%20cells,therapeutic%20values%20in%20managing%20chronic)). Both TGF-β1 and α3β1 integrin are known to influence angiogenesis (TGF-β has complex pro- and anti-angiogenic roles; α3β1 integrin helps endothelial cells interact with the matrix). The upregulation of these factors suggests a mechanism whereby DPT makes endothelial cells more responsive to the matrix and growth factors. The study concluded that *“DPT possesses vital pro-angiogenic properties”* and could have therapeutic value in chronic wounds (where inducing angiogenesis is beneficial) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20endothelial%20cells,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=and%20integrin%20%CE%B13%CE%B21%20which%20are,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)). This pro-angiogenic effect may seem surprising given DPT’s anti-proliferative reputation, but in the coordinated setting of wound healing, DPT’s ability to organize matrix and present growth factors can indirectly favor angiogenesis. Indeed, **wound healing is a context where DPT’s multiple roles converge**: it strengthens the provisional matrix (via fibronectin/fibrin binding) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=We%20report%20that%20dermatopontin%20,When%20incubated%20with%20DP)), helps recruit and anchor fibroblasts (via integrins) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=with%20both%20fibrin%20and%20fibronectin,The)), amplifies TGF-β to drive granulation tissue formation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20augmented%20the%20biological%20activity,in%20the%20microenvironment%20of%20the)), and apparently aids endothelial cells to invade and form new vessels ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=assays%20apparently%20depicted%20that%20DPT,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)). All these activities make DPT a key **“architect” of the healing tissue**. Consistently, wounds in Dpt-knockout mice exhibit delayed collagen maturation and possibly altered vascularization (though detailed in vivo wound studies are still limited). 

- **Other Molecular Interactions:** Dermatopontin’s interactome extends to other matrix molecules. It has been shown to bind **decorin** (as discussed) and also was reported to interact with **fibromodulin** (another small ECM protein). In muscle cells, DPT and fibromodulin positively regulate each other’s expression, forming a regulatory loop that enhances myogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=consequently%20expressed%20in%20several%20tissues,FN%2C%20and%20perceived)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=differentiation,stages%20of%20the%20myogenic%20process)). DPT can also bind to the glycosaminoglycan components of proteoglycans – early work indicated DPT associates with decorin’s dermatan sulfate chain and perhaps other sulfated glycans ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=well%20conserved%20among%20the%20species,an%20infarct%20zone%20of%20experimental)). It is therefore part of a network of ECM proteins and proteoglycans that collectively determine matrix supramolecular structure. In invertebrate species, dermatopontin homologues (often called “SPOCK” or similar proteins in some organisms) act as **cell adhesion molecules or elastic fibers** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=activity%20of%20this%20protein%20for,In)). For instance, a DPT-like protein in sea anemone functions as an agglutinin that sticks cells or structures together ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=activity%20of%20this%20protein%20for,In)). These evolutionary parallels reinforce that DPT’s fundamental role is to *bind matrix components and cells together*.  

In summary, dermatopontin is a central player in ECM biology with **multiple mechanisms**: it reinforces the physical scaffold (by organizing collagen and fibronectin), it links cells to that scaffold (via integrins and proteoglycans), and it modulates the biochemical signals that control cell growth and differentiation (notably TGF-β). Through these actions, DPT helps maintain tissue homeostasis and orchestrate the complex events of tissue repair.

## Recent Developments (2020–2024) and Current Research  
In the past few years, research on DPT has accelerated, uncovering new roles and potential applications. Below are **some recent developments (circa 2020-2024)** highlighting dermatopontin’s importance:

- **Dermatopontin as an Adipokine (Metabolic Research):** A 2020 clinical study identified dermatopontin as a **novel adipokine** – a signaling protein secreted by adipose (fat) tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=Compelling%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20dermatopontin,The%20impact)). This study by Unamuno *et al.* examined DPT levels in obese vs. lean individuals. It found that **circulating DPT protein is significantly elevated in obesity** (including in obese patients with type 2 diabetes) compared to healthy controls ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=of%20DPT%20on%20ECM%20remodelling,p)). Likewise, DPT mRNA expression in visceral adipose tissue was higher in obese subjects ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=related%20genes%20were%20analysed,13%2C%20critical%20cytokines%20mediating)). To understand the implications, researchers treated human adipocytes with various factors: pro-inflammatory stimuli (like LPS, a bacterial endotoxin, and the cytokine TGF-β) and a saturated fatty acid (palmitate) all **upregulated DPT expression** in fat cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=%28T2D%29%20increased%20%28p%20,These%20findings%20provide)). Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 **downregulated DPT** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=expression%20levels%20of%20DPT%20were,These%20findings%20provide)). These treatments mimic the inflammatory environment of obesity, suggesting DPT is induced as part of the adipose tissue stress response. Functionally, when the researchers added recombinant DPT to adipocyte cultures, it **triggered increased expression of ECM remodeling genes (such as collagen VI, elastin, MMP9) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α)** in those cells ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=expression%20levels%20of%20DPT%20were,influencing%20AT%20remodelling%20and%20inflammation)). In essence, DPT pushed adipocytes towards a more fibrotic, inflammatory state. This was the *first evidence* linking DPT to obesity-related tissue changes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=anti,influencing%20AT%20remodelling%20and%20inflammation)). The authors concluded that DPT contributes to **extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation in obesity**, possibly exacerbating the fibrotic inflammatory milieu of expanding fat tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=%28T2D%29%20increased%20%28p%20,These%20findings%20provide)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=anti,influencing%20AT%20remodelling%20and%20inflammation)). This discovery positions DPT as both a **biomarker** of metabolic syndrome (circulating levels reflect obesity status) and a potential **therapeutic target**. If DPT drives adipose fibrosis (which is linked to insulin resistance), then inhibiting DPT might alleviate metabolic dysfunction – a concept so promising that a patent has been filed for “Dermatopontin as a therapeutic for metabolic disorders” ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10398752B2/ja#:~:text=Publication%20date%202019,Publication%20of%20US20180036371A1%20publication%20Critical)). While clinical therapies are not yet available, ongoing research is examining DPT’s role in conditions like type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular risk in obesity.

- **Musculoskeletal and Regenerative Medicine:** Research has also focused on DPT in muscle and bone tissue contexts. In 2019, Kim *et al.* reported that **dermatopontin is critical for skeletal muscle differentiation** (myogenesis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,yet%20unknown%2C%20and%20validated%20it)). They showed DPT enhances myoblast adhesion and fusion into myotubes, in part by interacting with fibronectin and fibromodulin in the muscle ECM ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=consequently%20expressed%20in%20several%20tissues,FN%2C%20and%20perceived)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523808/#:~:text=differentiation,stages%20of%20the%20myogenic%20process)). Loss of DPT impeded muscle cell differentiation, which could have implications for muscle regeneration. More recently, a 2023 study explored DPT in **periodontal ligament stem cells**, which are progenitors that can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). The study found that **DPT expression naturally increases when these stem cells are induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation**, indicating DPT might be part of the program that builds bone matrix ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111923000264#:~:text=DPT%20was%20upregulated%20during%20the,osteogenic%20differentiation%20of%20hPDLSCs)). When DPT was knocked down in these cells, their ability to proliferate and to form mineralized bone nodules was significantly **inhibited** ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111923000264#:~:text=DPT%20was%20upregulated%20during%20the,osteogenic%20differentiation%20of%20hPDLSCs)). Conversely, providing extra recombinant DPT did not further boost proliferation, suggesting that a baseline level of DPT is necessary but additional DPT is not limiting (there may be a saturation point) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111923000264#:~:text=DPT%20knockdown%20inhibited%20the%20proliferation,of%20hPDLSCs)). The study also noted DPT rises during chondrogenic (cartilage) differentiation ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111923000264#:~:text=mineralization%20%28Stein%20and%20Lian%2C%201993%29,important%20role%20in%20the%20chondrogenic)), hinting at a broader role in skeletal tissue formation. These findings are driving interest in DPT for **tissue engineering and regenerative medicine**. For example, one could envisage coating scaffolds with DPT to improve stem cell adherence and differentiation in bone grafts. In fact, the importance of DPT in stem cell niches is highlighted by a patent from 2017 which proposes using DPT to **maintain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in culture** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5599243/#:~:text=mass%20spectrometry%20and%20found%20dermatopontin,There%20are%20likely%20overlapping%20cellular)). This idea stemmed from observations that bone marrow stromal cells produce DPT and that HSCs adhere better and survive longer on DPT-containing matrices ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5599243/#:~:text=The%20hematopoietic%20marrow%20microenvironment%20is,SLAM%20%28LSK%2C%20CD48%5E%7B%E2%88%92%7D%2C%20CD150)). A related 2017 *Stem Cell Reports* study found that murine HSCs adhere more to decellularized bone marrow ECM containing DPT, although DPT knockout mice surprisingly did not show major hematopoietic deficits (likely due to compensation by other adhesion factors) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5599243/#:~:text=mass%20spectrometry%20and%20found%20dermatopontin,There%20are%20likely%20overlapping%20cellular)). Nonetheless, these advances underscore DPT’s utility in designing better stem cell culture systems or improving regeneration of tissues like muscle, bone, and marrow by harnessing its matrix-organizing functions.

- **Osteoarthritis and Cartilage Degeneration:** In 2024, Sun *et al.* published a systems biology study identifying **DPT as a key gene in osteoarthritis (OA)** progression ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=analysis%20identified%20ALB%2C%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,ssGSEA%20results%20revealed%20that%20abnormal)). By analyzing multiple patient gene expression datasets, they found DPT (along with HTRA1 and MXRA5) to be consistently **overexpressed in OA cartilage compared to healthy cartilage** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=analysis%20identified%20ALB%2C%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,ssGSEA%20results%20revealed%20that%20abnormal)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=match%20at%20L56%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,progression%20and%20immune%20cell%20infiltration)). Machine learning and validation in independent cohorts confirmed DPT is elevated in diseased joints and correlates with severity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=progression,results%20also%20confirmed%20these%20findings)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=patients%2C%20while%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C%20MXRA5%2C,validation%20set%2C%20only%20three%20genes)). DPT expression had a high diagnostic accuracy for OA (ROC AUC ≈ 0.84 in distinguishing OA vs. normal) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=patients%2C%20while%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C%20MXRA5%2C,validation%20set%2C%20only%20three%20genes)). Furthermore, high DPT levels in cartilage were associated with changes in immune cell infiltration: patients with higher DPT in their joint tissues showed greater presence of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and lower CD8 T cell levels, indicating DPT may be linked to **inflammatory processes in the joint** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=Correlation%20between%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C%20MXRA5%2C,P%E2%80%89%3C%E2%80%890.001)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=match%20at%20L432%20analysis%20revealed,8D)). While this study was correlative, it suggests that **DPT could serve as a biomarker for OA** and perhaps play a role in the cartilage breakdown or repair processes. One hypothesis is that increased DPT in OA reflects the chondrocytes’ attempt to remodel the damaged cartilage matrix (since DPT can promote collagen fibril assembly, its upregulation might be a response to collagen network disruption in arthritis). There is also interest in whether **measuring DPT in synovial fluid** could help in early detection of OA or monitoring of disease progression. This is an example of how newer research is translating the molecular knowledge of DPT into clinical contexts.

- **Dermatopontin in Cancer:** Although not entirely new, recent observations continue to support a role for DPT in tumor biology. As mentioned, **low DPT expression is often noted in cancers** such as liver cancer ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF)), and the Human Protein Atlas currently lists DPT as a favorable prognostic marker in liver HCC (meaning patients with higher DPT in their tumors tend to have better survival) ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=CANCER%20%26%20CELL%20LINES%20Prognostic,i%7D%20No)). In 2022-2023, bioinformatics studies of other cancers (e.g., breast, pancreatic) have begun to include DPT in signatures of stromal genes that correlate with outcomes or therapy response, although these are preliminary. Meanwhile, some cancer cell line experiments show that adding DPT can suppress proliferation or migration of tumor cells, consistent with its adhesive, anti-proliferative influence on the microenvironment. Another angle of cancer research is DPT’s role in **angiogenesis**: since tumors require new blood vessels, DPT’s pro-angiogenic effect ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=assays%20apparently%20depicted%20that%20DPT,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)) could paradoxically aid tumor growth if present. It has been reported that in certain cancers like breast carcinoma, stromal DPT is reduced, possibly to favor a more disorganized, neovascularized stroma. This complex role is the subject of ongoing investigation.

- **Expert Commentary:** Contemporary experts in matrix biology view dermatopontin as an important but somewhat underappreciated ECM component. A 2006 review called *dermatopontin “a novel player in the biology of the extracellular matrix”* ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=well%20conserved%20among%20the%20species,an%20infarct%20zone%20of%20experimental)) and described it as *“largely uncharacterized”* at the time, with multiple roles being gradually discovered. Fast-forward to late 2010s and 2020s, and the picture is much clearer: DPT is now recognized as a **core organizer of the matrix and modulator of cell-matrix signaling**. Its “cardinal roles in cutaneous wound healing” have been emphasized by researchers ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20,in%20many%20physiological%20and%20pathological)), and it is frequently classified among **matricellular proteins** like SPARC, osteopontin, and tenascin, which have regulatory (not purely structural) functions in the ECM. The accumulating evidence from recent studies – spanning metabolism, orthopedics, and immunology – highlights **dermatopontin’s broad relevance**. As Dr. Ashley Kramer and colleagues succinctly put in 2017, DPT is one of the ECM components that *“cooperate with other ECM proteins to promote cell adherence”* in niches like the bone marrow, but organisms can compensate for its loss to a degree ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5599243/#:~:text=mass%20spectrometry%20and%20found%20dermatopontin,There%20are%20likely%20overlapping%20cellular)). This suggests functional redundancy in vivo, yet in situations of stress or disease (e.g., wound healing, metabolic overload, aging), DPT’s contributions become critical. Indeed, the presence of dermatopontin in a variety of specialized matrices (cornea, skin, muscle, etc.) indicates it was conserved for its ability to fine-tune tissue properties.

## Current and Potential Applications  
Given its influential role in extracellular matrix dynamics, dermatopontin is being explored in several applied contexts:

- **Biomarker Potential:** Changes in DPT levels in blood or tissues can reflect pathological remodeling. For instance, elevated serum DPT in obesity could serve as a **biomarker for metabolic syndrome** or adipose tissue fibrosis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=of%20DPT%20on%20ECM%20remodelling,p)). Downregulation of DPT in skin fibrosis (keloids or scleroderma) might predict poor wound healing outcomes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=expression%20of%20dermatopontin%20mRNA%20and,We)). In osteoarthritis, as noted, DPT is a candidate **diagnostic biomarker** for early cartilage degeneration ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=match%20at%20L56%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C,progression%20and%20immune%20cell%20infiltration)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=patients%2C%20while%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C%20MXRA5%2C,validation%20set%2C%20only%20three%20genes)). Having a secreted protein like DPT measurable by ELISA or mass-spectrometry is advantageous; indeed, DPT has been detected in human plasma by mass spec and targeted proteomic assays ([www.proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/Q07507#:~:text=PROTEINS%20IN%20BLOOD%20Upregulated%20in,i%7D%20Data%20available%20%28High%20detectability)). Large-scale proteomic studies (e.g., in cardiovascular disease or aging) could clarify how DPT levels correlate with disease states. One caveat is that DPT is mostly matrix-bound, so blood levels may be low unless there is active tissue remodeling releasing it (such as during injury or in obesity where adipose releases matrix fragments). Still, in specific contexts, DPT has shown up as part of multi-marker panels for diseases (for example, a 2021 study in heart failure patients noted DPT among ECM proteins linked to cardiac fibrosis).

- **Therapeutic Avenues:** Direct therapeutic targeting of DPT is not yet in clinical trials, but a few strategies are conceivable:
  - **Enhancing DPT activity for tissue repair:** Since dermatopontin fosters collagen and fibronectin organization, boosting its function might improve wound healing or skin aging. *Cosmetic and dermatological applications* are already being patented – a 2015 European patent describes **“dermatopontin-activating peptides”** to be included in topical formulations, aiming to increase DPT expression in the skin ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2638059B1/en#:~:text=,N%20Glycerine%20Chemical%20compound%20OCC%28O%29CO)) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2638059B1/en#:~:text=,N%20Glycerine%20Chemical%20compound%20OCC%28O%29CO)). The idea is that higher DPT in aging or UV-damaged skin could ramp up collagen fibril formation and improve skin elasticity (essentially an anti-wrinkle strategy). While clinical evidence is pending, some skincare products are beginning to mention matricellular proteins like DPT as targets for “firming” treatments.
  - **Blocking DPT in fibrosis:** In pathological fibrosis (e.g. liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis), one might consider inhibiting DPT to reduce TGF-β activation and fibrotic matrix assembly. However, given DPT is actually *lower* in many fibrotic scars ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=expression%20of%20dermatopontin%20mRNA%20and,We)), it’s unclear if further inhibition would help; paradoxically, increasing DPT might even normalize matrix deposition (by organizing collagen more properly). This area needs careful exploration. Notably, **decorin**, a binding partner of DPT, has anti-fibrotic effects by neutralizing TGF-β, so any intervention on DPT-decorin must consider the balance. 
  - **Metabolic disease therapy:** As mentioned, a patent (granted 2019) by researchers in Singapore proposes **using DPT or modulators of DPT for treating metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes** ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10398752B2/ja#:~:text=Publication%20date%202019,Publication%20of%20US20180036371A1%20publication%20Critical)). This was driven by data that DPT is an adipocyte-secreted factor influencing metabolism. The therapeutic approach could be either to neutralize DPT (if DPT’s pro-fibrotic effect in fat is harmful) or to mimic it (if one aims to harness any beneficial signaling it might have systemically). The patent suggests DPT as a target to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce adipose inflammation. It’s a nascent concept – future studies in animal models will be needed to validate if modifying DPT levels can indeed ameliorate metabolic syndrome or fatty liver.
  - **Regenerative medicine and cell culture:** DPT could be added to **biomaterials or cell culture systems** to improve cell adhesion and maintain stem cells. For example, coating culture dishes with recombinant dermatopontin might help hematopoietic stem cells stay in an undifferentiated but adherent state, thereby maintaining the stem cell pool during ex vivo expansion (a crucial challenge in bone marrow transplants). The 2017 patent WO2017021543A1 specifically claims the **use of DPT to maintain HSCs in culture** by preventing their differentiation or death ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017021543A1/en#:~:text=and%2For%20progenitor%20cells%20in%20culture,the%20survival%2Fproliferation%20of%20HSCs%20cultured)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5599243/#:~:text=mass%20spectrometry%20and%20found%20dermatopontin,There%20are%20likely%20overlapping%20cellular)). Similarly, in tissue-engineered grafts for muscle or bone, incorporating DPT might enhance the integration and maturation of the graft by promoting ECM assembly. These applications are still experimental, but they leverage DPT’s natural role as a scaffold organizer.
  - **Drug targeting and signaling pathways:** Understanding DPT’s position in pathways like TGF-β and integrin signaling opens up indirect targeting options. For instance, small molecules or biologics that disrupt the DPT–decorin interaction could modulate TGF-β activity in a tissue-specific manner (potential anti-fibrotic therapy). Conversely, peptides derived from DPT (like the DP-4 peptide) that mimic its adhesion site could be used to coat implants or wound dressings to improve cell attachment and healing ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=Adhesion%20of%20HaCaT%20cells%20to,4%20was%20strongly)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). Another idea is using DPT as a carrier or scaffold for delivering growth factors in tissue repair, since it binds TGF-β – one could design a matrix with DPT to locally concentrate TGF-β where needed (for example, in bone healing, where TGF-β aids callus formation).

In all these potential applications, it will be crucial to balance DPT’s effects – too much DPT could lead to excessive matrix (fibrosis) and inflammation (as seen in obesity models) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=expression%20levels%20of%20DPT%20were,influencing%20AT%20remodelling%20and%20inflammation)), while too little leads to frail matrix (as in the knockout mouse skin) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=decorin%29,beta1%20interacts%20with)). Therefore, therapeutic approaches might aim to **normalize DPT levels or function** rather than simply increase or decrease it arbitrarily.

## Conclusion  
Dermatopontin (DPT) is a prime example of an extracellular matrix protein that, despite being non-structural, profoundly influences tissue structure and function. It acts as a **matrix organizer and a mediator of cell-matrix crosstalk**. Key takeaways about DPT include: 

- **Structural Role:** DPT binds major matrix proteins (collagens, fibronectin, fibrin) and promotes their assembly into stable fibrils and networks ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=electron%20microscopy,by%20changing%20the%20fibronectin%20conformation)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35306228/#:~:text=helical%20collagens%20II%20and%20III,of%20the%20three%20arginine%20residues)). This activity is essential for proper tissue tensile strength – without DPT, collagen fibers form aberrantly (as evidenced by Ehlers-Danlos-like changes in DPT-null mice) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16987749/#:~:text=decorin%29,beta1%20interacts%20with)). 

- **Adhesive and Signaling Role:** Dermatopontin helps cells adhere to their surrounding matrix by bridging integrins and proteoglycans to the collagenous scaffold ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19928997/#:~:text=adhesive%20activity%20of%20dermatopontin,We%20conclude%20that)). Through these interactions, it can regulate cell shape, migration, and mechanical signaling. Additionally, by modulating growth factors like TGF-β (enhancing TGF-β signaling) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1220007/#:~:text=Dermatopontin%20augmented%20the%20biological%20activity,in%20the%20microenvironment%20of%20the)), DPT influences cellular proliferation and differentiation programs in the local environment. It essentially **amplifies context-specific signals** that tell a cell to slow down proliferation and start building or remodeling tissue.

- **Physiological Importance:** DPT is crucial in contexts such as **wound healing**, where it accelerates the formation of a functional repair matrix and assists in angiogenesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3083196/#:~:text=involved%20in%20forming%20a%20globular,initial%20stage%20of%20wound%20healing)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=assays%20apparently%20depicted%20that%20DPT,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)). It ensures that the initial scar has the right organization of fibers and that cells populate the wound correctly. It also plays roles in maintaining the normal architecture of skin, cornea, muscle, and other tissues during homeostasis.

- **Pathological Implications:** Dysregulation of DPT is associated with disease. **Excessive matrix remodeling stimuli** (inflammation, high TGF-β, mechanical stress) can alter DPT expression – sometimes up (as in obesity, where it contributes to fibrotic adipose tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283761/#:~:text=%28T2D%29%20increased%20%28p%20,These%20findings%20provide))), other times down (as in chronic scars or certain cancers, potentially to the tissue’s detriment ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10233760/#:~:text=expression%20of%20dermatopontin%20mRNA%20and,We)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19916908/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20DPT,via%20possible%20interaction%20with%20TGF))). Because DPT’s functions are tightly linked to collagen quality and cell growth, its imbalance may exacerbate conditions like fibroses, osteoarthritis, or tumor progression. Conversely, restoring proper DPT function might mitigate such conditions by re-establishing normal matrix structure and signaling. For example, in osteoarthritis research, DPT’s elevation is being interpreted as part of the joint’s attempt to repair cartilage, and measuring it could guide interventions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=progression,results%20also%20confirmed%20these%20findings)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=patients%2C%20while%20HTRA1%2C%20DPT%2C%20MXRA5%2C,validation%20set%2C%20only%20three%20genes)).

- **Future Directions:** Ongoing research is delving into **structural biology** of DPT (to design mimetics or inhibitors), **omics studies** in human diseases (to firmly establish its biomarker utility), and **therapeutic experiments** in animal models (e.g., testing if DPT modulation affects obesity-related fibrosis or improves wound healing outcomes). As an ECM protein, DPT is an attractive drug target because therapies can be delivered locally (e.g., in a wound or joint) to minimize systemic effects. The coming years will likely see more insights from fibrosis and regenerative medicine fields about how DPT can be leveraged. 

In conclusion, dermatopontin serves as a critical node in the extracellular matrix: it **connects the dots between structural scaffold, cell adhesion, and growth factor signaling**. This integrative role is what makes it so impactful – and also why disturbances in DPT levels reverberate through tissues. Prioritizing recent findings, we now appreciate that DPT is involved not only in classical connective tissue function but also in metabolic and immune-related remodeling of tissues. With its newly recognized status as an adipokine and a biomarker in joint disease, DPT has moved to the forefront as a protein of interest in translational research. Efforts to manipulate DPT or its pathways hold promise for novel therapies in wound healing, fibrotic diseases, osteoarthritis, and possibly metabolic disorders. As our understanding grows, dermatopontin exemplifies how a once “obscure” matrix protein can emerge as a **key orchestrator of functional anatomy**, bridging the gap between cells and the scaffolds that support them ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325630/#:~:text=progression,results%20also%20confirmed%20these%20findings)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28336087/#:~:text=analysis%20revealed%20that%20endothelial%20cells,managing%20chronic%20wounds%20and%20cancer)).
