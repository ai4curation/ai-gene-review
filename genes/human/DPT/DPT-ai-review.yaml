description: >-
  Dermatopontin (DPT) is a secreted, tyrosine-rich acidic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein
  that plays key roles in ECM organization and cell-matrix interactions. DPT accelerates collagen
  and fibronectin fibrillogenesis and functionally interacts with decorin and TGF-beta to modulate
  matrix assembly and growth factor activity. It promotes cell adhesion and migration through
  engagement of integrin alpha3beta1, particularly important in keratinocyte migration during
  wound re-epithelialization. DPT is highly expressed in dermis and dermal fibroblasts, with
  negligible expression in epidermis, consistent with a paracrine role where dermal DPT promotes
  keratinocyte function. Recent studies show Dpt+ fibroblasts serve as a dominant fibroblast
  population that supplies CSF1 to maintain dermal macrophage subsets essential for skin homeostasis
  and wound healing. DPT also has tumor suppressor activity in breast cancer through direct binding
  to YAP and inhibition of Hippo signaling.

  review:
    summary: >-
      DPT promotes collagen fibrillogenesis as a core function. Deep research confirms DPT
      accelerates collagen and fibronectin fibrillogenesis and interacts with decorin and
      TGF-beta to modulate matrix assembly. Mouse DPT deficiency causes altered collagen
      microfibril organization with Ehlers-Danlos-like phenotypes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Collagen fibril organization is a well-supported core function of DPT. The IBA annotation
      from phylogenetic inference aligns with experimental evidence from mouse knockout studies
      showing DPT deficiency disrupts collagen organization. UniProt also notes DPT
      "Accelerates collagen fibril formation, and stabilizes collagen fibrils."

      DPT promotes cell adhesion through integrin alpha3beta1 engagement. This is supported by
      functional studies showing DPT enhances adhesion and migration in keratinocytes and

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cell adhesion is a core function of DPT. The IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping
      is well-supported by experimental evidence showing DPT promotes cell adhesion via integrin
      alpha3beta1. UniProt states DPT "Seems to mediate adhesion by cell surface integrin binding."

  original_reference_id: PMID:30082873
  review:
    summary: >-
      The IPI annotation indicates DPT binds to LOX propeptide (P28300-PRO_0000018520) based on
      IntAct curation. PMID:30082873 discusses LOX propeptide interactions and mentions that
      dermatopontin binds to mature LOX. While the interaction is likely valid, the term
      "protein binding" is uninformative for annotation purposes.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      GO:0005515 (protein binding) is too vague to be informative. DPT has specific functional
      interactions with decorin, TGF-beta, collagens, and integrins that are more meaningfully
      captured by process annotations. The interaction with LOX is mentioned in PMID:30082873
      but the generic "protein binding" term does not convey the biological significance of
      this interaction in ECM assembly and crosslinking.

      DPT functions as a structural component of the ECM that modulates matrix organization
      through interactions with collagen, decorin, and other matrix components.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core molecular function of DPT. As a secreted ECM glycoprotein that promotes
      collagen/fibronectin fibrillogenesis and modulates matrix assembly through interactions
      with decorin and TGF-beta, DPT clearly functions as an ECM structural constituent.
      The IEA from Ensembl Compara is well-supported by the literature.
