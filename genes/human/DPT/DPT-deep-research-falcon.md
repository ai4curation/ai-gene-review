## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q07507
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dermatopontin; AltName: Full=Tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein; Short=TRAMP; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=DPT;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the dermatopontin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Dermatopontin. (IPR026645); DERM (PF14704)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "DPT" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'DPT' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **DPT** (gene ID: DPT, UniProt: Q07507) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview: We verified identity and nomenclature (human DPT encodes dermatopontin, a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein) and collected recent mechanistic and translational literature prioritizing 2023–2024 sources. We synthesized key concepts, recent developments, applications, expert perspectives, and quantitative findings, and created a concise artifact summarizing major points with citations and URLs.

Comprehensive research report: DPT (Dermatopontin; gene DPT; UniProt Q07507) in human

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and basic properties: Dermatopontin (DPT) is a secreted, tyrosine‑rich acidic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein (historically called TRAMP). It is highly expressed in the dermis and by dermal fibroblasts, while expression in the epidermis and keratinocyte lines is negligible, consistent with a paracrine dermis-to-epidermis role (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07385, Dec 2014) (krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 3-4).
- Core ECM mechanisms: DPT promotes matrix assembly by accelerating collagen and fibronectin fibrillogenesis and functionally interacting with decorin and TGF‑β, linking it to growth-factor bioactivity and ECM organization. Loss of DPT disrupts collagen microfibril organization and yields Ehlers–Danlos–like connective-tissue phenotypes in mice, underscoring its structural role (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900, Jul 2024) (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10, yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 10-11).
- Cell-adhesion interface: DPT enhances adhesion and migration via integrin α3β1 engagement in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, supporting cell–matrix interactions during re‑epithelialization (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07385, Dec 2014) (krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Fibroblast–macrophage niche in skin: 2024 work shows Dpt+ fibroblasts constitute a dominant fibroblast population (>80% of fibroblasts express Dpt) and are a key source of CSF1 that sustains dermal macrophage subsets. Depleting Dpt+ fibroblasts or deleting Csf1 in these fibroblasts causes marked loss of CD206hi CD64+ macrophages and delayed wound healing, implicating DPT-marked fibroblasts in a CSF1–CSF1R axis essential for skin immune homeostasis and repair (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708, Nov 2024) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 7-10, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 24-27).
- Skin aging/photoaging: In vivo profiling (2024) demonstrates significant reduction of DPT mRNA in naturally aged human skin and in photoexposed conditions, consistent with global matrisome decline and altered matrix transcripts with aging (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900, Jul 2024) (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10).
- Cancer signaling and tumor suppression: In breast cancer, DPT is downregulated; restoring DPT directly binds YAP, increases YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, limits YAP nuclear accumulation, and suppresses migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo, identifying a DPT–YAP axis with therapeutic implications (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8, Feb 2023) (ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8).
- Immune modulation in cholangiocarcinoma: Low DPT associates with poorer prognosis and less immune infiltration; DPT secreted from tumor cells elevates macrophage CCL19 secretion in co‑culture, potentially enhancing immune cell recruitment and improving response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-023-05532-1, Feb 2024) (xu2024downregulationofdermatopontin pages 15-19).
- Osteoarthritis biomarker discovery: Multi‑cohort bioinformatics and RT‑PCR validation (2024) identify DPT as consistently upregulated in osteoarthritis and correlated with immune-cell infiltration, nominating DPT as a candidate biomarker for OA progression (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-024-07758-7, Aug 2024) (sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Wound repair: Recombinant DPT enhances keratinocyte migration and lamellipodia formation without stimulating proliferation, supporting its potential as a bioactive matrix component for improving re‑epithelialization in skin repair strategies (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07385, Dec 2014) (krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 2-3, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2).
- ECM and fibrosis targeting: The skin Dpt+ fibroblast–CSF1–macrophage axis suggests new strategies to modulate CSF1 provision by fibroblasts to influence macrophage niches in fibrotic skin diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis), offering an alternative to systemic CSF1R blockade that has tolerability concerns (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708, Nov 2024) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 24-27, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 4-7).
- Cancer biomarkers/therapeutics: In breast cancer, DPT’s suppression of YAP activity suggests biomarker and therapeutic angles for Hippo pathway‑driven tumors; in cholangiocarcinoma, DPT levels correlate with immune infiltration and predicted response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 therapy, supporting its development as a prognostic/theranostic marker (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-023-05532-1) (ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8, xu2024downregulationofdermatopontin pages 15-19).
- Degenerative joint disease: DPT’s consistent upregulation and immune correlations in OA datasets position it for further translational validation as a diagnostic/prognostic biomarker (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-024-07758-7) (sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- ECM organizational role: Reviews and in vivo skin studies emphasize DPT as a “novel player” in ECM biology that interacts with decorin and affects collagen fibrillogenesis; human skin aging work highlights decreased DPT transcripts with age and photoexposure, consistent with expert consensus that matrisome decline contributes to structural and functional skin aging (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900, 2024) (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 10-11, yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10).
- Fibroblast ecology and immune niches: The 2024 skin study provides a coherent framework linking Dpt+ fibroblast identity to macrophage maintenance via CSF1, integrating fibroblast heterogeneity, ECM programs, and immunoregulatory circuits that impact wound healing and fibrotic disease—an emerging expert view of fibroblast–immune crosstalk in tissue homeostasis (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708, 2024) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 7-10, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 24-27, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4).
- Cancer pathway integration: The DPT–YAP mechanistic connection in 2023 underscores the role of ECM glycoproteins as upstream regulators of Hippo signaling, aligning with expert perspectives that mechanical/ECM cues tune YAP/TAZ activity in tumor progression (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8, 2023) (ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Dpt+ fibroblast prevalence in skin: >80% of skin fibroblasts show robust Dpt expression by single‑cell/CITE‑seq (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708, Nov 2024) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4).
- Macrophage niche dependency: Genetic depletion of Dpt+ fibroblasts or Csf1 deletion in Dpt+ fibroblasts induces a marked reduction of CD206hi CD64+ macrophages across dermis, dWAT, and adventitia, and delays intermediate/late wound closure (qualitatively significant; detailed counts shown in the study figures) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708, Nov 2024) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 7-10, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 24-27).
- Keratinocyte migration potency: Recombinant DPT promoted keratinocyte migration in scratch assays at 50–500 pg/mL with statistically significant effects (e.g., P = 0.0258 for an indicated concentration/time comparison) and did not increase keratinocyte proliferation up to 100 ng/mL for 72 h (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07385, Dec 2014) (krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 2-3, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2).
- Breast cancer cohort and signaling statistics: In a 100 paired‑tissue breast cancer cohort, DPT was “drastically downregulated”; pathway enrichment implicated Hippo signaling (P < 0.01). In vitro/in vivo, DPT overexpression decreased tumor volumes and weights and increased YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, with consistent statistical support in the study (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8, Feb 2023) (ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8).
- Osteoarthritis datasets: Multi‑cohort analyses identified DPT as consistently increased in OA training/validation cohorts, with correlation to immune infiltration and RT‑PCR confirmation (URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-024-07758-7, Aug 2024) (sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12).
- Aging/photoaging skin: Quantitative RT‑PCR in human skin showed significant reductions in DPT mRNA in aged compared with young skin, and photoexposure alters matrisome transcripts (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900, Jul 2024) (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10).

6) Functional and mechanistic model
- Molecular functions and partners: DPT modulates ECM assembly (collagen/fibronectin fibrillogenesis), binds decorin and influences TGF‑β activity, and promotes cell adhesion/migration via integrin α3β1 in skin cells, directly linking ECM structure to cell motility. In cancer, DPT physically interacts with YAP to restrain Hippo signaling activity, aligning ECM cues with oncogenic transcriptional control (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07385; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8) (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2, ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8).
- Tissue localization and context: DPT acts predominantly in the extracellular space of dermis and other connective tissues; Dpt+ fibroblasts organize immune niches via CSF1 provision to macrophages, affecting tissue remodeling and repair (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 7-10).

7) Disease links and translational perspectives
- Fibrotic skin disease and wound healing: The Dpt+ fibroblast–CSF1 axis connects fibroblast identity, macrophage maintenance, and wound healing; fibroblast‑derived CSF1 correlates with macrophage abundance and disease severity in systemic sclerosis skin, highlighting a targetable stromal–immune pathway (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 4-7, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 24-27).
- Cancer: In breast cancer, DPT downregulation and DPT–YAP antagonism support DPT as a tumor suppressor and potential biomarker; in cholangiocarcinoma, DPT is positively associated with immune infiltration and may predict better response to PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade; both support future clinical exploration (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05657-8; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-023-05532-1) (ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8, xu2024downregulationofdermatopontin pages 15-19).
- Osteoarthritis and aging: DPT increase in OA and decline in aged skin suggest bidirectional associations with pathological ECM remodeling, with potential use in monitoring disease progression or therapeutic impact in joint and skin biology (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-024-07758-7; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080900) (sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12, yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10).

*Table: Concise summary table of human dermatopontin (DPT) functions, localization, mechanisms, and key 2014–2024 findings with primary-source DOIs and contextual citations from gathered evidence.*

Limitations and open questions
- Preclinical skin fibroblast–macrophage studies are from a 2024 preprint; while mechanistically compelling, peer‑reviewed confirmation and human functional validation will strengthen translational claims (URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624708) (vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 4-7, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4).
- Quantitative diagnostic metrics (e.g., AUCs) for DPT in OA and cancers require additional prospective validation beyond current retrospective and in silico studies (sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12, ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8, xu2024downregulationofdermatopontin pages 15-19).

Conclusion
Human DPT encodes a secreted ECM glycoprotein that organizes collagen/fibronectin assembly and modulates growth‑factor and integrin signaling, enabling keratinocyte migration and re‑epithelialization. Recent work highlights Dpt+ fibroblasts as central organizers of a CSF1‑dependent macrophage niche essential for skin homeostasis and repair and links DPT to cancer immunity and YAP signaling. These findings nominate DPT as a mechanistic node across ECM biology, immune microenvironments, tissue repair, fibrosis, and cancer, with promising biomarker and therapeutic implications requiring continued clinical validation (yan2024alterationsofmatrisome pages 8-10, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 1-2, krishnaswamy2014roleofdermatopontin pages 2-3, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 1-4, vollmers2024dermatopontinexpressingfibroblastsmediate pages 7-10, ye2023dnmt3adermatopontinaxissuppresses pages 4-8, xu2024downregulationofdermatopontin pages 15-19, sun2024identificationofhtra1 pages 12-12).
