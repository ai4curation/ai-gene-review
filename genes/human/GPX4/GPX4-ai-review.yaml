description: 'GPX4 (Glutathione Peroxidase 4, also known as PHGPx) is a monomeric selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase containing
  an active-site selenocysteine (Sec46). It uniquely reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOHs) directly within membranes
  to their corresponding alcohols using reduced glutathione (GSH) as the electron donor. GPX4 is the central enzymatic suppressor
  of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. Three isoforms exist from alternative
  promoters: cytosolic (cGPX4), mitochondrial (mGPX4), and nuclear (nGPX4), with distinct subcellular functions including
  protection of membrane lipids, mitochondrial integrity, and sperm chromatin stability during spermatogenesis.'

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: GPX4 is a key antioxidant enzyme that protects cells from oxidative damage by reducing lipid hydroperoxides.
      The deep research confirms GPX4 plays a key role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by preventing membrane lipid
      peroxidation (GPX4-deep-research-falcon.md). This annotation is appropriate as a broader process encompassing GPX4's
      core protective function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GPX4's primary role is to detoxify lipid hydroperoxides, which is a central response to oxidative stress. The
      IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic evidence and consistent with GPX4's function across orthologs.

    summary: GPX4 reduces hydroperoxy products of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway, thereby regulating the flux through this pathway.
      PMID:11115402 demonstrated that both GPx-1 and PHGPx are involved in the regulatory network of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GPX4's role in the lipoxygenase pathway is experimentally documented. The enzyme reduces 12-HpETE to 12-HETE,
      modulating the balance between reduction and isomerization routes. This represents a core function of GPX4 in arachidonic
      acid metabolism.

    summary: GPX4 is a member of the glutathione peroxidase family and exhibits glutathione peroxidase activity. PMID:36608588
      directly demonstrated GPX4 reduces H2O2 and other soluble hydroperoxides using glutathione, though with lower efficiency
      than GPX1 for simple substrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GPX4's more specific function is phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase activity (GO:0047066),
      general glutathione peroxidase activity is also correct. Both annotations should be retained. GPX4 can reduce H2O2,
