### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GPX4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GPX4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GPX4** (gene ID: GPX4, UniProt: P36969) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target is human GPX4 (UniProt P36969), also known as phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), a selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase. Literature consistently identifies GPX4 as a human selenoenzyme in the glutathione peroxidase family with a thioredoxin-like fold and a catalytic selenocysteine (Sec) active site, matching the UniProt description and domains/family provided. No conflicting gene symbol usage was found for a different protein/organism in the cited sources (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2, auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).

Comprehensive research report on human GPX4 (UniProt P36969)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Enzyme class and reaction: GPX4 is a monomeric selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase that reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOHs) to their corresponding alcohols (PLOHs) using reduced glutathione (GSH) as the electron donor, thereby preventing membrane lipid peroxidation. Mechanistically, the active-site selenocysteine (Sec, at position ~46 in human GPX4) cycles through selenenic intermediates during two-electron reduction of lipid hydroperoxides; the GSH is oxidized to GSSG. GPX4 is unique among GPX family members in directly reducing complex membrane phospholipid hydroperoxides and even cholesterol hydroperoxides, positioning it as the core enzymatic brake on ferroptosis (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764, published Jun 2023) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6, published Jul 2024) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).
- Active site and structure: Human GPX4 contains a conserved catalytic tetrad centered on Sec46, supported by residues Gln81, Trp136, and Asn147 (numbering per human sequence). The protein exhibits a thioredoxin-like fold; unlike other GPX isoenzymes, GPX4 lacks a bulky surface loop, facilitating access to bulky lipid substrates embedded in membranes (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).
- Core pathway context: GPX4 is the central effector of the system xc−–GSH–GPX4 axis. Cystine import via system xc− and GSH biosynthesis sustain GPX4 activity; loss of cystine transport/GSH synthesis or direct GPX4 inhibition triggers ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, lipid peroxide–driven regulated cell death (Autophagy 2023; IJMS 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021607, published Jan 2023) (chen2023prospectsforantitumor pages 2-4).

2) Isoforms and subcellular localization
- Isoform diversity: Human GPX4 is expressed as three isoforms from a single gene through alternative promoters/starts: cytosolic GPX4 (cGPX4), mitochondrial GPX4 (mGPX4; N-terminal targeting sequence), and nuclear GPX4 (nGPX4). These isoforms show distinct spatiotemporal expression and specialize in protecting different subcellular compartments from lipid peroxidation (Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- Localization and functions: cGPX4 is broadly expressed and is the most essential isoform for ferroptosis suppression in many cell types. mGPX4 targets mitochondria and preserves mitochondrial membrane integrity; nGPX4 localizes to nuclei during spermatogenesis and contributes to chromatin stability and sperm nuclear maturation, consistent with specialized roles in the male germ line (Autophagy 2023; MRA 2025 review) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v13i8.6801, published Jan 2025) (wu2025unravelingthedual pages 1-3).
- Essentiality/embryogenesis: Global GPX4 knockout is embryonically lethal in mice (death around E8), and isoform-selective expression studies indicate non-redundant roles; these findings underscore the essential protective function of GPX4 during development (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).

3) Pathways and biochemical specificity
- Ferroptosis: GPX4 is the key suppressor of ferroptosis by detoxifying PUFA-containing phospholipid hydroperoxides that otherwise propagate lethal lipid peroxidation chain reactions. Loss or inhibition of GPX4 is sufficient to induce ferroptosis; conversely, GPX4 upregulation abrogates ferroptosis (Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- Lipid substrate scope: GPX4 directly reduces membrane-embedded oxidized fatty acyl phospholipids and cholesterol hydroperoxides. Its flat active-site surface with surrounding basic residues facilitates interaction with acidic phospholipid headgroups and access to lipid peroxides in bilayers (CMBL 2024; Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- Compensatory antioxidant axes: When GPX4 is compromised, parallel systems such as FSP1–CoQ10, DHODH (mitochondrial), and the GCH1–BH4 axis can partially buffer ferroptosis, but GPX4 remains the dominant membrane anti-ferroptotic enzyme (IJMS 2025 HNC review summarizing broader literature) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136452, published Jul 2025) (lee2025emergingtherapeuticstrategies pages 2-4).

4) Structural and regulatory features
- Biosynthesis of selenocysteine in GPX4: Sec is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon and requires a 3′-UTR SECIS element, SECIS-binding protein 2, and Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, linking GPX4 expression to selenium availability and mevalonate-pathway metabolites that support selenoprotein synthesis (Autophagy 2023; IJMS 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021607) (chen2023prospectsforantitumor pages 2-4).
- Post-translational modifications (PTMs): Multiple PTMs regulate GPX4 stability and activity, including ubiquitination (e.g., Lys47/80/107/135/162/167), phosphorylation (e.g., Ser13/Ser40/Tyr96), and cysteine modifications (succination at Cys93; alkylation at Cys107). These PTMs can promote proteasomal degradation or modulate catalytic output and ferroptosis sensitivity (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).
- Palmitoylation: Recent work indicates GPX4 undergoes palmitoylation at Cys66, affecting protein stability and ferroptosis sensitivity, highlighting lipidation as a regulatory layer in GPX4 biology (MRA 2025 review summarizing primary studies) (https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v13i8.6801) (wu2025unravelingthedual pages 3-4).

5) Key inhibitors/activators and translational applications
- Covalent inhibitors: RSL3 and related covalent GPX4 inhibitors (e.g., ML210) directly inactivate the enzyme and are widely used to induce ferroptosis in research contexts; suppression of cystine import or GSH synthesis also lowers GPX4 activity and triggers ferroptosis (Autophagy 2023; IJMS 2025 HNC review) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 4-6); (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136452) (lee2025emergingtherapeuticstrategies pages 2-4).
- Approved drug repurposing: A 2025 preclinical study demonstrated that sodium aurothiomalate (ATM), an approved gold drug, induces ferroptosis by covalently modifying GPX4 at its active-site Sec46 and cysteines (C66, C148), reducing enzymatic activity and destabilizing the protein. Reported GPX4-targeting potencies include ATM IC50 ≈ 40.1 µM and thiomalate IC50 ≈ 54.8 µM in biochemical/cellular assays, with mechanistic mass-spectrometric mapping and biophysical analyses. These findings suggest a translational path for GPX4 targeting using drug-like thiol-delivering agents (BioRxiv preprint, Nov 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.13.687868) (hugo2025sodiumaurothiomalateinduces pages 30-33).
- Additional modalities: Reviews summarize strategies to modulate GPX4 stability (e.g., HSPA5-mediated protection) and transcriptional upregulation by Nrf2 and other factors; conversely, promoting GPX4 degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system or selective autophagy can induce ferroptosis in cancer models (IJMS 2023; Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021607) (chen2023prospectsforantitumor pages 2-4); (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 4-6).

6) Disease associations and biology
- Cancer: GPX4 expression varies across hematopoietic differentiation and is elevated in many acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes; higher GPX4 expression correlates with worse prognosis, and ferroptosis-inducing strategies that inhibit GPX4 show preclinical promise in AML. This underscores GPX4’s role in tumor survival under oxidative stress and drug resistance (Cellular & Molecular Biology Letters 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).
- Developmental disorders: The pathogenic GPX4 missense variant R152H causes Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, a fatal neonatal skeletal dysplasia, reinforcing the enzyme’s essential function in human development (Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- Neurodegeneration, ischemia–reperfusion injury, infertility and other conditions: Reviews synthesize evidence implicating GPX4 loss-of-function and ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia–reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and male infertility. nGPX4 plays specialized roles in sperm nuclear maturation, and mGPX4 supports mitochondrial integrity in germ cells (MRA 2025 review; Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.18103/mra.v13i8.6801) (wu2025unravelingthedual pages 3-4); (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).

7) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024) with data
- 2023 mechanistic synthesis: A 2023 Autophagy review integrates GPX4 structure–function, Sec biosynthesis, isoforms, ferroptosis pathway placement, and regulatory PTMs, and curates disease-linked variants including R152H (Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- 2024 hematologic oncology: A peer-reviewed 2024 review details GPX4 expression patterns across myeloid differentiation, its elevation in AML, and links high GPX4 to poor prognosis, consolidating the rationale for GPX4-directed ferroptosis therapies in AML (CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).
- 2024 oncology breadth: A 2025 IJMS review synthesizing broader oncology data (including 2023–2024 studies) highlights GPX4’s centrality in therapy resistance and the feasibility of targeting the system xc−–GSH–GPX4 axis alongside compensatory pathways (FSP1/CoQ10, DHODH, GCH1/BH4) (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136452) (lee2025emergingtherapeuticstrategies pages 2-4).
- 2025 inhibitor innovation with quantitative biophysics: The sodium aurothiomalate preprint maps covalent modification sites on GPX4 (Sec46/Cys66/Cys148) with docking and mass spectrometry, reports activity losses, IC50 values (ATM ~40.1 µM), and membrane-binding impacts, showing a repurposing path for clinically used thiol–gold chemistry toward GPX4 targeting (BioRxiv 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.13.687868) (hugo2025sodiumaurothiomalateinduces pages 30-33).

8) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Research tools and preclinical strategies: Covalent GPX4 inhibitors (e.g., RSL3, ML210) are widely used to study ferroptosis and have demonstrated synthetic lethalities in cancer models, though drug-like liabilities persist. Targeting GSH synthesis, cystine transport, or promoting GPX4 degradation are complementary routes under active preclinical exploration (Autophagy 2023; IJMS 2023; IJMS 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 4-6); (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021607) (chen2023prospectsforantitumor pages 2-4); (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26136452) (lee2025emergingtherapeuticstrategies pages 2-4).
- Translational prospects: Elevated GPX4 in AML and other therapy-resistant tumors provides a biomarker/rationale for combination therapies that induce ferroptosis by undermining GPX4. Gold-based drugs like aurothiomalate, with mapped GPX4 covalent engagement, offer a potential repurposing avenue that may circumvent liabilities of earlier chloroacetamide inhibitors, pending rigorous pharmacology and safety profiling (CMBL 2024; BioRxiv 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.13.687868) (hugo2025sodiumaurothiomalateinduces pages 30-33).

9) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Consensus view: Leading reviews emphasize GPX4 as the principal enzymatic barrier to ferroptosis across mammalian cells, integrating metabolic inputs (cystine/GSH, selenium/Sec synthesis) and redox signaling, with multi-layered regulation by PTMs and proteostasis. The 2023 Autophagy review by Tang/Klionsky and colleagues provides an authoritative synthesis that is widely cited, aligning with specialized oncology reviews in 2024 (Autophagy 2023; CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2); (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).

10) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Quantitative inhibitor data: Sodium aurothiomalate (ATM) shows GPX4-targeting activity with reported IC50 ≈ 40.1 µM (thiomalate ≈ 54.8 µM) and mass-spectrometric evidence of covalent modification at Sec46 and cysteines, accompanied by decreased enzyme function and altered membrane-binding kinetics at ≥1 µM, supporting a direct mechanism for ferroptosis induction (BioRxiv 2025) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.13.687868) (hugo2025sodiumaurothiomalateinduces pages 30-33).
- Developmental essentiality: Embryonic lethality upon GPX4 deletion (mouse models) and the human R152H pathogenic variant causing Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia provide strong genetic evidence for the indispensable role of GPX4 in development and human physiology (Autophagy 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2023.2218764) (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2).
- Hematologic malignancy association: Elevated GPX4 expression in AML relative to normal counterparts, with high expression correlating to adverse prognosis, underscores potential utility as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target; detailed cohort statistics vary by study design but the association is consistent across multiple AML subtypes (CMBL 2024) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s11658-024-00613-6) (auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2).

Conclusions
Human GPX4 (UniProt P36969) is a Sec-containing glutathione peroxidase that uniquely reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides in membranes, constituting the central anti-ferroptotic enzyme. It exists as cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear isoforms with distinct localizations and functions, especially in mitochondria and sperm nuclei. Multiple regulatory layers—including selenium/Sec biosynthesis, GSH supply, proteostatic control, and PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation)—tune GPX4 activity and stability. Disease links span embryonic development, hematologic malignancies (AML), neurodegeneration, ischemia–reperfusion injury, and infertility. Translational efforts increasingly aim to harness ferroptosis for cancer therapy via direct GPX4 inhibition (e.g., RSL3-class compounds) or emerging repurposing candidates such as sodium aurothiomalate, though improving selectivity and pharmacology remains a key challenge (xie2023gpx4incell pages 1-2, auberger2024emergingroleof pages 1-2, lee2025emergingtherapeuticstrategies pages 2-4, chen2023prospectsforantitumor pages 2-4, hugo2025sodiumaurothiomalateinduces pages 30-33, wu2025unravelingthedual pages 3-4).
