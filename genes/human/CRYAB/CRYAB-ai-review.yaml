description: >-
  CRYAB (alpha-crystallin B chain, also known as HSPB5) is a small heat shock protein
  that functions as a molecular chaperone with holdase activity. It binds partially denatured
  or destabilized proteins in an ATP-independent manner to prevent their aggregation, but
  unlike HSP70-family foldase chaperones, it does NOT actively refold substrates. CRYAB
  forms large polydisperse oligomeric complexes, typically of 10-40 subunits, and can
  hetero-oligomerize with CRYAA (HSPB4). The canonical sHSP architecture comprises a
  central alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) flanked by a variable N-terminal domain (NTD) and
  a short C-terminal domain (CTD); chaperone activity is tightly coupled to oligomeric
  assembly and dynamic subunit exchange (DOI:10.1038/s41467-024-54647-7). A conserved
  N-terminal IXI-like motif (NT-IXI) engages the ACD hydrophobic groove, and perturbation
  of this motif transforms native assemblies into reversible elongated helical fibrils, as
  resolved by cryo-EM (DOI:10.1038/s41467-024-54647-7). Stress-activated phosphorylation
  at Ser19/Ser45/Ser59 by p38 MAPK modulates oligomeric state; the p38-CRYAB(pS59) cascade
  is a stress-response module that can shift CRYAB condensates toward less dynamic,
  aggregate-prone states under pathological conditions (DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2024.109510,
  DOI:10.1172/jci163730). In the eye lens, CRYAB serves dual roles as a structural protein
  contributing to transparency and refractive index, and as a chaperone preventing aggregation
  of damaged crystallins. Outside the lens, it is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal
  muscle where it associates with cytoskeletal elements including desmin intermediate
  filaments and titin at Z-bands and intercalated disks. CRYAB also functions as a
  mitochondrial chaperone and anti-apoptotic protein, binding pro-apoptotic factors Bax,
  Bcl-X(S), cytochrome c, and VDAC; the E105K mutation causing hereditary optic atrophy
  reduces these interactions and impairs mitochondrial OXPHOS assembly
  (DOI:10.1172/jci.insight.182209). CRYAB is secreted via extracellular vesicles and exerts
  paracrine effects including promotion of angiogenesis in cardiac contexts
  (DOI:10.1186/s13287-023-03468-4, DOI:10.1038/s42003-022-04402-9). Mutations in CRYAB
  cause myofibrillar myopathy, cataracts, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy,
  and hereditary optic atrophy.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for negative regulation of apoptotic process, phylogenetically
      propagated across small heat shock protein family members (CRYAA, CRYAB, HSPB1).
      CRYAB has well-documented anti-apoptotic activity. It binds pro-apoptotic Bax
      and Bcl-X(S) to prevent their translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during
      staurosporine-induced apoptosis (PMID:14752512). This preserves mitochondrial
      integrity and blocks caspase-3 activation and PARP degradation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      CRYAB is a bona fide anti-apoptotic protein. PMID:14752512 demonstrates that
      alpha-crystallins bind Bax and Bcl-X(S) both in vitro and in vivo, preventing
      their translocation to mitochondria. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      appropriate and reflects a well-established function of CRYAB beyond its lens
      chaperone role. This is a core function of CRYAB, particularly in cardiac and

      IBA annotation for protein refolding, propagated from Drosophila sHSP
      orthologs. This is problematic for CRYAB specifically. While some sHSPs in
      other organisms may participate in protein refolding pathways (by passing
      substrates to foldase chaperones like HSP70), CRYAB itself is a holdase -- it
      prevents aggregation of denatured proteins but does NOT actively refold them.
      PMID:19464326 explicitly tested refolding activity: HSPB1 and HSPB5 chaperoned
      heat unfolded substrates and kept them folding competent, but the refolding
      itself depends on downstream HSP70/HSP40 machinery. The term protein refolding
      implies direct refolding activity which CRYAB does not have.

      CRYAB is a holdase chaperone that prevents aggregation but does NOT perform
      protein refolding. The IBA may be appropriate at the broader sHSP family level
      where some members participate in refolding pathways, but for CRYAB
      specifically, protein refolding is misleading. CRYAB keeps substrates in a
      folding-competent state for downstream foldases (PMID:19464326), which is
      better captured by GO:0050821 protein stabilization (already annotated via
      IMP from PMID:12235146). The annotation should be modified to better reflect

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962).
      CRYAB/HSPB5 does bind partially denatured or destabilized proteins, but the term
      "unfolded protein binding" is problematic because it implies a simple binding function
      rather than the chaperone holdase activity that CRYAB performs. CRYAB acts as a
      molecular chaperone that suppresses aggregation of destabilized proteins in an
      ATP-independent manner (PMID:16303126), but unlike HSP70-family foldase chaperones,
      it does NOT actively refold substrates. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      propagated from sHSP family members, which is appropriate at the family level since
      small heat shock proteins share this holdase chaperone function. However, the term
      itself needs replacement. GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" (defined as "Binding
      to a protein or a protein-containing complex to assist the protein folding process")
      is the closest available MF term. This is an imperfect replacement because CRYAB
      specifically does NOT assist in protein folding -- it prevents aggregation (holdase
      activity). A dedicated holdase-specific GO term does not yet exist and should be
      requested. UniProt describes CRYAB as having "chaperone-like activity, preventing
      aggregation of various proteins under a wide range of stress conditions."
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. CRYAB has well-documented chaperone-like holdase
      activity: alpha-crystallins (including CRYAB) increase the solubility of destabilized
      T5P gamma C-crystallin and reduce the size of its aggregates both in vitro and in
      transfected cells (PMID:16303126). However, CRYAB does NOT refold proteins -- it is a
      holdase, not a foldase. The best available interim MF replacement is GO:0044183
      "protein folding chaperone," though this term is not ideal because its definition
      references "protein folding process" which is not what CRYAB does. A new
      holdase-specific term should be requested. GO:0050821 "protein stabilization" is
      appropriate as a BP term and is already annotated for CRYAB via PMID:12235146.

      CRYAB does indeed serve as a structural protein in the eye lens, contributing to

      This IPI annotation is based on PMID:16303126, which demonstrated that alpha
      B-crystallin (CRYAB) suppresses the aggregation of the cataract-causing T5P mutant
      gamma C-crystallin. In this study, CRYAB increased the solubility of T5P gamma
      C-crystallin both in vitro (by sedimentation assay and sucrose gradient
      centrifugation) and in transfected cells, and significantly reduced the size of
      T5P gamma C-crystallin aggregates. The interacting partner (WITH/FROM) is the
      destabilized T5P gamma C-crystallin. The paper describes this as "chaperone-like
      activity" with a "dual role" -- increasing soluble protein fraction and reducing
      aggregate size. This is classic holdase activity: CRYAB binds partially denatured
      proteins and prevents their aggregation, but does NOT refold them. The term
      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is the best available interim replacement
      MF term, though it is imperfect because CRYAB does not assist in protein folding
      per se -- it prevents aggregation. A holdase-specific GO term does not yet exist

      The paper explicitly describes "a dual role for these chaperones in maintaining
      transparency in the lens": increasing the proportion of soluble protein and
      reducing aggregate size. This is not passive "unfolded protein binding" but
      active suppression of aggregation (holdase function). The IPI evidence with

  description: >-
    CRYAB (HSPB5) is a small heat shock protein that functions as an ATP-independent
    holdase chaperone. It binds partially denatured or destabilized proteins to prevent
    their aggregation, maintaining clients in a refolding-competent state for downstream
    ATP-dependent chaperone systems such as HSP70, but does NOT actively refold substrates
    itself. CRYAB forms highly polydisperse oligomers (approximately 10-40 subunits)
    with rapid subunit exchange dynamics that are important for chaperone activity
    (DOI:10.1038/s41467-024-54647-7). The canonical architecture comprises a central
    alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) mediating dimerization, flanked by a variable N-terminal
    domain (NTD) and a short C-terminal domain (CTD). A conserved N-terminal IXI-like
    motif (NT-IXI) engages the ACD hydrophobic groove to govern assembly; perturbation
    of this motif transforms native assemblies into reversible elongated helical fibrils
    as resolved by cryo-EM (DOI:10.1038/s41467-024-54647-7). Stress-activated
    phosphorylation (notably p38 MAPK targeting Ser59) modulates oligomeric state and
    can shift CRYAB condensates toward protective or pathological material states
    (DOI:10.1016/j.isci.2024.109510, DOI:10.1172/jci163730). Substrates bound by CRYAB
    can subsequently be refolded by HSP70/HSP40 foldase chaperones, or routed to the
    ubiquitin-proteasome system for degradation.

    label: structural constituent of eye lens
  description: >-
    CRYAB is one of the major structural proteins of the vertebrate eye lens, contributing
    to lens transparency and refractive index. In the lens, it serves a dual role as both
    a structural protein (maintaining lens transparency through high concentration and
    ordered short-range interactions) and a chaperone (preventing aggregation of damaged
    crystallins that would cause light-scattering opacification).

    label: cytoskeletal protein binding
  description: >-
    CRYAB binds desmin intermediate filaments in a manner dependent on desmin assembly
    status and subunit organization, acting as a sensor for assembly intermediates. In
    cardiac and skeletal muscle, CRYAB associates with sarcomeric structures including
    Z-bands and intercalated disks, and interacts with titin. Mutations in CRYAB (e.g.,
    R120G) cause desmin-related myopathy through aggregation of desmin filaments. Recent
    work shows that phosphorylation at Ser59 can shift CRYAB condensates toward less
    dynamic, aggregate-prone states that mislocalize cytoskeletal and sarcomeric client
    proteins, a pathological mechanism termed condensatopathy; the phosphomimetic S59D
    behaves similarly to the R120G cardiomyopathy mutant (DOI:10.1172/jci163730).
