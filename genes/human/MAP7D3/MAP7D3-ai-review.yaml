description: >-
  MAP7D3 (MAP7 domain-containing protein 3, also known as MDP3) is a microtubule-associated
  protein belonging to the MAP7 family. It promotes microtubule assembly and stability
  through direct binding to tubulin and microtubules via two distinct regions: N-terminal
  coiled-coil domains and a C-terminal MAP7 domain with C-terminal tail. The C-terminal
  region (MDCT) binds microtubules with Kd ~3.0 uM by engaging the tubulin C-terminal
  tails and competes with tau for overlapping binding sites. MAP7D3 also recruits
  and
  activates kinesin-1 motor protein through its MAP7 domain, enhancing kinesin-1 landing
  rate and processivity on microtubules. Unlike other MAP7 family members, MAP7D3
  can be co-transported with kinesin-1 due to its higher kinesin affinity and lower
  microtubule affinity. Additionally, MAP7D3 modulates HDAC6 activity to maintain
  tubulin acetylation. The protein localizes to the mitotic spindle and microtubule
  cytoskeleton throughout mitosis, with expression varying during the cell cycle.

        IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. MAP7D3 is a well-established
        member of the MAP7 family that regulates microtubule organization through
        promoting assembly and stability (PMID:22142902, PMID:24927501). This annotation
        is supported by experimental evidence from other annotations and is phylogenetically
        consistent with MAP7 family function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        The IBA annotation accurately captures MAP7D3's role in microtubule cytoskeleton
        organization. Direct experimental evidence demonstrates that MAP7D3 regulates
        cellular microtubule assembly in cold recovery and nocodazole washout assays
        (PMID:22142902) and promotes microtubule polymerization in vitro (PMID:24927501).
        This function is conserved across MAP7 family members.

        microtubule polymerization. Yadav et al. (2014) demonstrated that the MDCT

        This is a core function of MAP7D3. The paper provides compelling in vitro
        evidence using purified proteins that MAP7D3 promotes microtubule polymerization.
        The MDCT fragment was shown to promote polymerization more effectively than
        the individual MD or CT domains, and this activity was dependent on the
        tubulin C-terminal tail. This represents a more specific annotation than

        HDA annotation from high-throughput mass spectrometry proteomics study of

        This annotation is not incorrect - MAP7D3 was detected in membrane proteomics
        experiments. However, MAP7D3 is primarily a cytoskeletal protein that localizes
        to microtubules and the spindle. The membrane association is likely transient
        or reflects association with membrane-associated microtubules rather than
        direct membrane localization. This is not a core localization for the protein.
        UniProt also lists membrane (HDA) but the primary localization is cytoplasm/cytoskeleton/spindle.
