## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8IWC1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=MAP7 domain-containing protein 3;
- **Gene Information:** Name=MAP7D3; Synonyms=MDP3 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:22142902};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the MAP7 family. .
- **Key Domains:** MAP7_domain-containing. (IPR051483); MAP7_fam. (IPR008604); MAP7 (PF05672)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "MAP7D3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'MAP7D3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **MAP7D3** (gene ID: MAP7D3, UniProt: Q8IWC1) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Human MAP7D3 (MAP7 domain-containing protein 3; UniProt Q8IWC1)

Identity verification and nomenclature
- Gene/protein: MAP7D3 (also known as MDP3) encodes a MAP7 family microtubule-associated protein in Homo sapiens. Domain architecture and family assignment agree across primary literature: an N-terminal microtubule-binding region (coiled-coil/positively charged) and a C-terminal MAP7 domain that engages kinesin-1; MAP7D3 is one of four mammalian MAP7 paralogs (MAP7, MAP7D1, MAP7D2, MAP7D3) (Hooikaas et al., J Cell Biol, 2019; published Feb 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3). Yadav et al. (PLoS ONE, 2014; published Jun 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) refer to MAP7D3 as a MAP7-domain protein with both N-terminal and C-terminal tubulin/microtubule-interacting elements (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular role: Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that binds microtubules and modulates microtubule-based transport by recruiting and activating kinesin-1. In vitro, MAP7D3 increases kinesin-1 microtubule landing rate and processivity via transient association with the kinesin stalk; compared with MAP7, MAP7D3 binds kinesin-1 more strongly and microtubules more weakly and can be co-transported with the motor (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- Biochemistry of microtubule binding: The C-terminal region containing the MAP7 domain and tail (MDCT fragment) of MAP7D3 binds along the microtubule lattice, promotes polymerization, and stabilizes microtubules against disassembly by engaging the C-terminal tail of tubulin; it competes with tau for overlapping binding sites (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2).
- Regulation of tubulin acetylation/HDAC6: MAP7D3 (MDP3) associates with HDAC6 and modulates its activity; depletion reduces tubulin acetylation and destabilizes microtubules, indicating part of its stabilizing effect is via HDAC6 inhibition in addition to direct microtubule binding (PLoS ONE, 2014; published Mar 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090932) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).

Mechanisms, interactions, and pathways
- Domain-function map: N-terminal basic/helical region + unstructured linker bind microtubules; C-terminal MAP7 domain binds the kinesin-1 stalk. This architecture underlies dual functions: tethering to microtubules and activating kinesin-1 (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- Kinesin-1 recruitment/activation: In cells (HeLa) and reconstitution, MAP7D3 increases kinesin-1 landing frequency and run length/processivity; unlike MAP7, MAP7D3 can be co-transported with kinesin-1, consistent with higher kinesin affinity and lower microtubule affinity (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- Microtubule polymerization and stabilization: MAP7D3’s C-terminal MDCT fragment promotes polymerization with a reported microtubule-binding Kd ~3.0 ± 0.5 μM and stabilizes microtubules against dilution-induced depolymerization; binding maps to the tubulin C-terminal tail and overlaps with tau binding (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2).
- Tubulin acetylation axis: MAP7D3 binds HDAC6 and limits its deacetylase activity on tubulin; MDP3 loss increases HDAC6 activity and reduces acetylated tubulin, linking MAP7D3 to the “tubulin code” and microtubule stability (PLoS ONE, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090932) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).
- Redundancy/specificity within MAP7 family: MAP7, MAP7D1, and MAP7D3 act redundantly to enable kinesin-1-dependent transport in HeLa cells; nevertheless, paralogs differ in biophysical parameters (e.g., MAP7D3 exhibits higher kinesin affinity and lower microtubule affinity than MAP7) (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3). Insights from related paralogs support centrosome-proximal localization and distinct stabilization mechanisms (Map7D2 vs Map7D1) in neuronal models, underscoring paralog diversification (Kikuchi et al., Life Sci Alliance, 2022; published Mar 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.27.466197) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 9-12).
- Wnt/Dishevelled interface: Emerging data suggest MAP7-family members couple Dishevelled (DVL) to microtubules; reviews/screens report MAP7D3 can recruit DVL3 to microtubules in lysate-based TIRF assays, while MAP7/MAP7D1 facilitate DVL cortical targeting via kinesin-1 (review, 2025; Kohoutová, 2025) (kohoutova2025microtubuleassociatedproteinsas pages 63-67). While this extends family context, direct MAP7D3–DVL mechanistic roles in migration remain less established than for MAP7/MAP7D1 (kohoutova2025microtubuleassociatedproteinsas pages 63-67).

Cellular localization and context of action
- Localization: MAP7D3 decorates the microtubule lattice in cells and in vitro (immunostaining of MDCT along preassembled microtubules) (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2). In HeLa cells, MAP7-family proteins are required for kinesin-1-dependent recruitment to microtubules and organelle distribution (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3). Paralog data place MAP7D family members at the centrosome and along microtubules in neuronal cells, indicating potential centrosome-proximal enrichment of MAP7 paralogs in certain contexts (Kikuchi et al., 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.27.466197) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 9-12).
- Cellular processes: By enhancing kinesin-1 recruitment and motility, MAP7D3 contributes to organelle transport and likely cell polarity and trafficking organization; reconstitution and cellular assays demonstrate family-level control of plus-end-directed transport (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3). Its ability to promote polymerization and stabilize microtubules indicates roles in maintaining microtubule networks under stress (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) and via HDAC6 modulation (Tala et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090932) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Cancer biology—triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): MAP7D3 is upregulated in more metastatic TNBC sublines; its knockdown reduces 3D colony formation, migration, and invasion; increases sensitivity to docetaxel and gemcitabine; suppresses Rac1 activity; and markedly impairs tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic mouse models. Clinically, higher MAP7D3 expression correlates with metastatic lymph nodes, advanced stage/grade, lymph node metastasis, and poorer survival in TNBC cohorts (Biology Direct, 2023; published Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-023-00400-x) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12).
- Family-level mechanistic baseline (for interpreting 2023–24 work): Robust in vitro cell-free and cellular evidence that MAP7D3 enhances kinesin-1 landing and processivity and can be co-transported with kinesin-1 (Hooikaas et al., 2019) underpins hypotheses for MAP7D3-mediated metastatic phenotypes via altered transport and cytoskeletal dynamics (https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biomarker and therapeutic target in TNBC: MAP7D3 serves as an adverse prognostic marker in TNBC and a functional driver of invasiveness and cancer-initiating properties; genetic inhibition sensitizes to taxane/nucleoside analog chemotherapy and reduces metastasis in vivo, suggesting translational potential for patient stratification and combination therapy design (Kuo et al., 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-023-00400-x) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic levers for intervention: The kinesin-activation interface and HDAC6 modulation suggest druggable axes—either disrupting MAP7D3–kinesin-1 interactions to reduce anterograde transport or enhancing HDAC6 activity modulation to rebalance microtubule acetylation—though direct inhibitors specific to MAP7D3 have not been reported in the cited literature (Hooikaas et al., 2019; Tala et al., 2014) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- JCB mechanistic study (2019) frames MAP7D3 as a microtubule-tethered kinesin-1 activator, with transient interactions that promote motor landing and processivity and with unique co-transport capability relative to MAP7. These features rationalize potential impacts on long-range cargo distribution and cellular polarity (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- PLoS ONE studies (2014) emphasize dual microtubule-stabilization mechanisms—direct lattice engagement via tubulin C-terminal tails and HDAC6 modulation—providing a biochemical basis for MT network resilience that could intersect with motility and invasion pathways in cancer (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539; Tala et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090932) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).
- Family paralog perspective: Distinct yet overlapping roles among MAP7 paralogs in neurons (Map7D2/Map7D1) underscore that paralog-specific properties (e.g., acetylation dependence) can shape phenotypes; this supports cautious extrapolation and motivates direct MAP7D3-specific experiments in relevant cell types (Kikuchi et al., 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.27.466197) (kikuchi2022map7d2andmap7d1 pages 9-12).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Microtubule binding and polymerization: MAP7D3 MDCT fragment binds microtubules with Kd ~3.0 ± 0.5 μM; promotes polymerization and stabilizes against dilution-induced disassembly; competes with tau for overlapping binding sites on tubulin C-terminal tails (Yadav et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099539) (yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2).
- Kinesin-1 motility: MAP7D3 increases kinesin-1 landing rate and processivity in vitro reconstitution assays; MAP7D3 is co-transportable with the motor, consistent with higher kinesin affinity and lower microtubule affinity than MAP7 (Hooikaas et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201808065). The study further demonstrates redundancy of MAP7, MAP7D1, and MAP7D3 in supporting kinesin-driven transport in HeLa (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- TNBC disease metrics: In cell and mouse models, MAP7D3 knockdown reduces colony formation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, and enhances docetaxel/gemcitabine sensitivity; clinical datasets associate higher MAP7D3 expression with lymph node metastasis and inferior survival in TNBC. Specific numerical hazard ratios or effect sizes were not available in the extracted segments; readers should consult Kuo et al. (2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13062-023-00400-x) for cohort-level statistics (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).

Open questions and future directions
- Direct structural determinants for MAP7D3–kinesin-1 interaction and how co-transport is molecularly choreographed remain active areas. Whether MAP7D3 uniquely tunes cargo selectivity versus other MAP7 paralogs is still unclear (Hooikaas et al., 2019) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3).
- The extent to which MAP7D3 interfaces with Wnt/Dishevelled signaling in specific tissues and disease contexts requires further validation beyond lysate-based assays and reviews (Kohoutová, 2025) (kohoutova2025microtubuleassociatedproteinsas pages 63-67).
- In cancer, defining the upstream regulators of MAP7D3 expression and identifying vulnerabilities created by MAP7D3 dependency (e.g., synthetic-lethal partners) are promising translational directions (Kuo et al., 2023) (kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2).

Summary
Human MAP7D3 is a MAP7-family microtubule-associated protein that binds microtubules and the kinesin-1 stalk to promote motor recruitment and processivity; uniquely, it can co-ride with kinesin-1. Its C-terminal region binds the tubulin C-terminal tail to stimulate polymerization and stabilize microtubules, and it tempers HDAC6 activity to maintain tubulin acetylation. Family-level redundancy supports kinesin-1 transport in cells, but paralogs differ in microtubule versus kinesin affinities and context-specific roles. In TNBC models and clinical datasets, MAP7D3 correlates with aggressive disease and functions as a driver of metastasis and chemoresistance, nominating it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Hooikaas et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2014; Tala et al., 2014; Kuo et al., 2023) (hooikaas2019map7familyproteins pages 1-3, yadav2014cterminalregionof pages 1-2, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 1-2, kuo2023map7d3anovel pages 11-12).
