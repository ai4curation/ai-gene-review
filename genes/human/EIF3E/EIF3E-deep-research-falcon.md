## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P60228
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit E {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004}; Short=eIF3e {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004}; AltName: Full=Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 6 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004}; AltName: Full=Viral integration site protein INT-6 homolog; AltName: Full=eIF-3 p48 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004};
- **Gene Information:** Name=EIF3E {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004}; Synonyms=EIF3S6 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004}, INT6 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03004};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the eIF-3 subunit E family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** eIF3e. (IPR016650); eIF3e_N. (IPR019010); PCI_dom. (IPR000717); WH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036390); eIF3_N (PF09440)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "EIF3E" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'EIF3E' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **EIF3E** (gene ID: EIF3E, UniProt: P60228) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human EIF3E (eIF3e/INT6; UniProt P60228)

Verification of identity and context
- Target verified: human EIF3E (aliases eIF3e/INT6/EIF3S6), UniProt P60228. EIF3E is a PCI-domain subunit of the eIF3 complex, consistent with its placement in the PCI-containing octameric module of eIF3. This aligns with recent structural/organizational descriptions of human eIF3 (PCI/octamer architecture). (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Definition and role: EIF3E encodes eIF3e, a PCI-domain–containing subunit of the human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. eIF3e participates in assembly/stability of the eIF3 octamer and contributes to bridging cap-recognition machinery to the 43S/48S pre-initiation complex (PIC), thereby supporting mRNA-selective initiation. (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2, choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2, duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)
- Functional module with eIF3d: eIF3e forms a functional d–e module with eIF3d. This module promotes selective translation of cohorts of mRNAs encoding membrane-associated and mitochondrial proteins and contributes to early steps in their translation. (Duan et al., EMBO J, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)
- Gatekeeper of initiation fidelity and transcript selectivity: Core eIF3 subunits, including eIF3e, modulate start codon fidelity in human cells; depletion of core eIF3 subunits promotes near-cognate start codon usage, indicating a role for eIF3 in accurate initiation site selection. (She et al., Nucleic Acids Res, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad329) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)

> EIF3E (eIF3e/INT6): concise definition
> EIF3E (UniProt P60228) is a PCI-domain subunit of the eIF3 translation initiation complex and forms part of the PCI-containing octamer of peripheral subunits. (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26, duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)
> It functionally partners with eIF3d as a d–e module that selectively promotes translation of membrane- and mitochondrial-associated proteins and contributes to early steps of their translation. (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)
> Acute depletion of eIF3e remodels the translatome—reducing translation of MAPK pathway components while increasing translation of TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins—showing transcript-selective roles in initiation and homeostatic responses. (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
> Mechanistically, eIF3 operates at the eIF3–eIF4G1 interface that bridges cap-binding machinery to the 43S/48S PIC, and eIF3d-dependent, eIF4E-independent cap recognition provides an alternative initiation route in which eIF3e serves as a structural partner. (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2, duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)


*Blockquote: A 4-sentence, citation-backed concise definition summarizing human EIF3E's domain architecture, eIF3 complex membership, functional partnership with eIF3d, translatome effects upon depletion, and mechanistic placement at the eIF3–eIF4G1/eIF3d axis; useful as a quick reference anchored to 2023–2024 sources.*

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Translatome remodeling upon eIF3e depletion: Ribo-seq in HeLa cells showed that acute depletion of eIF3e reduces translation of multiple MAPK pathway components yet paradoxically increases MAPK/ERK signaling activity. eIF3e depletion also increases translation of TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other translational machinery components, and modulates mRNAs with short uORFs (e.g., MDM2, ATF4). These data highlight mRNA-selective regulatory roles of eIF3e in stress/homeostatic adaptation. (Herrmannová et al., eLife, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.95846) (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
- Mechanistic interface with eIF4G1: GIGYF1 can repress translation initiation by binding eIF3 at the eIF3–eIF4G1 interaction interface, disrupting eIF3 binding to eIF4G1. This places eIF3 subunits (including eIF3e) at a critical mechanistic junction that regulates cap-dependent translation via the eIF3–eIF4G1 bridge. (Choi et al., Sci Adv, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)
- Alternative cap recognition under stress: eIF4E1-independent translation of a subset of mRNAs is largely eIF3d-dependent via an eIF3d cap-binding pocket. This delineates an alternative cap-recognition route through eIF3, consistent with eIF3e partnering with eIF3d within the complex. (Roiuk et al., Nat Commun, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51027-z) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)
- eIF3e–eIF3d module and selective translation: eIF3e supports selective translation of membrane/mitochondrial protein mRNAs in human cells, reinforcing the concept of subunit-specific mRNA selectivity within eIF3. Endogenous tagging showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization, consistent with roles at ribosomes/polysomes. (Duan et al., EMBO J, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Functional genomics and disease-relevant translation programs: Acute depletion paradigms (AID-tagging/CRISPRi; Ribo-seq) are used to interrogate eIF3e’s contribution to oncogenic pathways (MAPK) and translational capacity (TOP mRNAs), offering actionable readouts for pathway modulation in cancer biology. (Herrmannová et al., eLife, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.95846) (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
- Targeting initiation interfaces: The demonstration that RBPs such as GIGYF1 repress initiation by interfering with the eIF3–eIF4G1 interface suggests potential for small-molecule or biologic strategies to modulate this interface, impacting transcripts under eIF3-mediated control. (Choi et al., Sci Adv, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)
- Stress and alternative initiation: Recognition that eIF3d-mediated cap recognition can sustain translation when eIF4E is inhibited provides a rationale for context-specific therapeutic strategies that consider eIF3-driven initiation modes (e.g., hypoxia, mTORC1 inactivation). (Roiuk et al., Nat Commun, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51027-z) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- EMBO Journal and eLife studies support a model in which individual eIF3 subunits are not universally essential but carry distinct, transcript-selective functions; eIF3e lies within a module with eIF3d that shapes mitochondrial/membrane protein synthesis and influences early translational steps. These expert-led studies endorse moving beyond a monolithic view of eIF3 toward subunit-resolved biology with disease relevance. (Duan et al., EMBO J, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2) (Herrmannová et al., eLife, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.95846) (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
- The Nucleic Acids Research CRISPRi screens emphasize eIF3 core subunits (including eIF3e) as regulators of start codon selectivity, reinforcing their gatekeeping role in initiation fidelity—a position echoed by mechanistic mapping of the eIF3–eIF4G1 interface. (She et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad329) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26) (Choi et al., Sci Adv, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Translatome effects: In HeLa cells, eIF3e depletion by RNAi followed by Ribo-seq reduced translation of multiple MAPK pathway components while increasing translation of TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other translational machinery; specific gene-level examples include effects on MDM2 and ATF4 uORF-regulated transcripts. (Herrmannová et al., eLife, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.95846) (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
- Initiation fidelity screens: Genome-wide CRISPRi in K562 cells found that depletion of core eIF3 subunits—eIF3e among them—promoted near-cognate start codon usage, indicating quantifiable shifts in start-site selection upon eIF3 perturbation. (She et al., Nucleic Acids Res, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad329) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)
- Module-specific selectivity: Acute depletion/tagging approaches in human cells showed the eIF3e–eIF3d module selectively promotes translation of membrane/mitochondrial cohorts and that eIF3e is predominantly cytoplasmic, supporting its functional placement at PICs/polysomes. (Duan et al., EMBO J, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)
- Interface regulation: Biochemical mapping in human cells demonstrated that GIGYF1 binding at the eIF3–eIF4G1 interface displaces eIF3 from eIF4G1, quantitatively repressing initiation on specific transcripts (e.g., innate immune effectors). (Choi et al., Sci Adv, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)
- Alternative cap binding: Ribosome profiling and biochemical assays showed that under conditions blocking eIF4E1 activity, a subset of mRNAs remains efficiently translated through eIF3d cap-binding, delineating a measurable, eIF3-based alternative initiation route. (Roiuk et al., Nat Commun, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51027-z) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)

Subcellular localization and site of action
- Localization: Endogenous tagging and imaging show eIF3e localizes primarily to the cytoplasm, consistent with roles in cytosolic ribosomes and polysomes. Functional studies place eIF3e at the initiating 43S/48S complexes via the eIF3–eIF4G1 interface. (Duan et al., EMBO J, May 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2) (Choi et al., Sci Adv, Jul 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)

Pathways and mechanism of action
- Cap-dependent initiation: eIF3e, within the eIF3 complex, participates in bridging eIF4F (via eIF4G1) to the 43S/48S PIC, supporting scanning and start-codon recognition on capped mRNAs. (Choi et al., Sci Adv, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl5638) (choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2)
- eIF4E-independent initiation: Under stress or 4E-BP activation, eIF3d’s cap-binding pocket enables cap-dependent but eIF4E-independent initiation; eIF3e’s partnership with eIF3d situates it in this alternative mode. (Roiuk et al., Nat Commun, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51027-z) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)
- Transcript selectivity and early elongation: The eIF3e–eIF3d module confers mRNA selectivity, particularly favoring membrane/mitochondrial protein biogenesis, with evidence for influence on early translational steps. (Duan et al., EMBO J, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)
- Initiation fidelity control: eIF3 core subunits, including eIF3e, restrain near-cognate start site usage, supporting accurate ORF selection. (She et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad329) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)

Clinical and disease relevance (overview from recent studies)
- Cancer-relevant translation programs: Altered eIF3 subunit stoichiometry, including eIF3e depletion, remodels translation of key signaling networks (MAPK), ribosome biogenesis (TOP mRNAs), and stress response mRNAs, illuminating mechanisms by which eIF3 misregulation may contribute to oncogenesis and therapy responses. (Herrmannová et al., eLife, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.95846) (herrmannova2024perturbationsineif3 pages 1-2)
- Mitochondrial/membrane proteome support: eIF3e’s partnership with eIF3d to promote translation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins suggests potential links to metabolic reprogramming and tumor cell bioenergetics. (Duan et al., EMBO J, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022112362) (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2)

Limitations and open questions
- Nuclear roles and non-translation complexes: While legacy literature has posited connections of “INT6” to other complexes, the 2023–2024 sources analyzed here focus on eIF3e’s role within cytosolic eIF3 at ribosomes and do not provide primary evidence for nuclear or proteasome/CSN functions for human eIF3e. This remains an area for careful, context-specific verification in future work. (duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 1-2, choi2024repressionofmrna pages 1-2, duan2023eif3mrnaselectivity pages 26-26)
