description: >-
  EIF3E (also known as INT6 or eIF3-p48) encodes eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit E,
  a 48 kDa PCI domain-containing non-core subunit of the eIF3 complex. EIF3E forms part of
  module C of eIF3 together with EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3K and EIF3L. It functions as a structural
  component of eIF3 that bridges cap-recognition machinery to the 43S/48S pre-initiation complex,
  supporting mRNA-selective translation initiation. EIF3E partners with EIF3D to form a functional
  d-e module that promotes selective translation of membrane-associated and mitochondrial protein
  mRNAs. Additionally, EIF3E plays a specialized role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD),
  participating in the pioneer round of translation through interactions with the nuclear cap-binding
  protein CBP80 and the NMD factor UPF2. The protein localizes to both cytoplasm and nucleus,
  with nuclear localization in PML bodies that varies with cell cycle phase. EIF3E contributes to
  start codon fidelity and controls translation of specific mRNA cohorts including MAPK pathway
  components and TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins.

      EIF3E is a well-established component of the eIF3 complex. Multiple structural and biochemical
      studies confirm its membership in eIF3, where it forms part of module C together with EIF3C,

      eIF3 complex extensively.

      EIF3E exhibits dual localization in cytoplasm and nucleus. The protein contains nuclear
      localization and export signals enabling shuttling between compartments. Nuclear EIF3E

    summary: >-
      EIF3E is a component of eIF3 which is essential for translation initiation. The eIF3 complex
      associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit and facilitates recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A,
      eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex. EIF3 also
      stimulates mRNA recruitment and scanning for AUG recognition.

core_functions:
- description: >-
    EIF3E is an integral component of the 13-subunit human eIF3 complex, forming part of
    module C with EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3K, and EIF3L. It contributes to translation initiation
    factor activity as part of the eIF3 complex, which is required for 43S and 48S
    preinitiation complex formation and mRNA recruitment to the ribosome.

- description: >-
    EIF3E participates in mRNA-selective translation regulation. The eIF3 complex can both
    activate (e.g., c-Jun) and repress (e.g., BTG1) translation of specific mRNAs through
    binding to 5' UTR stem-loop structures.

suggested_questions:
- question: What determines whether eIF3 binding to a specific mRNA results in translational activation versus repression, given that eIF3 can both activate (e.g., c-Jun) and repress (e.g., BTG1) translation of different mRNA targets through binding to 5' UTR stem-loop structures?

- question: What is the mechanism by which EIF3E is selectively required for NMD but not for general translation, given that EIF3E knockdown specifically inhibits NMD without affecting bulk translation?

- question: How does EIF3E nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling relate to cell cycle regulation, given that nuclear EIF3E levels decrease during early S phase?

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Determine cryo-EM structures of EIF3E-containing eIF3 bound to specific target mRNAs
    to reveal how EIF3E contributes to mRNA-selective translation regulation.

- description: >-
    Perform proximity labeling (BioID/APEX) of nuclear versus cytoplasmic EIF3E pools
    to identify compartment-specific interaction partners and functions.

- description: >-
    Conduct ribosome profiling after acute EIF3E depletion to identify the specific mRNAs
    whose translation depends on EIF3E.
