description: 'SMAD3 (Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3) is a receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) that serves as the principal
  intracellular signal transducer and transcriptional modulator in the TGF-beta/activin signaling pathway. Upon TGF-beta receptor
  activation, SMAD3 is phosphorylated at its C-terminal SSXS motif by TGF-beta type I receptor (ALK5/TGFBR1), forms heteromeric
  complexes with SMAD4 (co-SMAD), and translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds DNA at SMAD binding elements (SBE:
  GTCT/AGAC) and CAGA-box variants through its MH1 domain. SMAD3 cooperates with transcription factors such as c-Jun/c-Fos
  at composite AP-1/SMAD elements. It also participates in activin and nodal signaling. Key biological outcomes include regulation
  of cell proliferation, EMT, fibrosis, immune regulation, and cell differentiation. Germline mutations cause Loeys-Dietz
  syndrome type 3.'

    label: RNA polymerase II cis-regulatory region sequence-specific DNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: SMAD3 directly binds DNA at SMAD binding elements (SBEs) in cis-regulatory regions of target genes, demonstrated
      by crystal structure (PMID:9741623), CASTing assays (Itoh et al. 2024), and ChIP-seq studies. IBA is well-supported
      across SMAD family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function of SMAD3. The MH1 domain directly binds SBE sequences (GTCT/AGAC) in promoter/enhancer
      regions, extensively validated by structural and functional studies.

  review:
    summary: SMAD3 is involved in anatomical structure morphogenesis via TGF-beta signaling. IBA supported across species.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This is a broad downstream biological process. While SMAD3 contributes to morphogenesis through TGF-beta signaling,
      this is a pleiotropic outcome rather than a core function. IBA is valid at this level for SMAD family.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Broad downstream process. TGF-beta/SMAD3 signaling regulates differentiation in many contexts (chondrocyte, osteoblast,
      T cell, etc.), but this is a pleiotropic outcome rather than core function.

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While SMAD3 can interact with beta-catenin in certain cellular contexts as part of Wnt/TGF-beta signaling crosstalk,
      beta-catenin binding is not a core molecular function of SMAD3. This IEA annotation likely represents a context-dependent
      interaction rather than an intrinsic binding activity.

    label: sequence-specific DNA binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:10823886
  review:
    summary: 'SMAD3 directly binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The MH1 domain of SMAD3 recognizes the SMAD binding
      element (SBE: GTCT/AGAC) and CAGA-box variants. Structural studies confirm zinc-dependent DNA binding by the MH1 domain
      (PMID:10823886, PMID:12686552).'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function. Sequence-specific DNA binding through the MH1 domain is a fundamental activity of SMAD3.
      This is well-established by crystal structures, EMSA, and ChIP experiments. Consistent with the IEA annotation for this
      term already accepted.

core_functions:
- description: 'SMAD3 functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor for RNA polymerase II. The MH1 domain
    directly binds SMAD binding elements (SBE: GTCT/AGAC) and CAGA-box motifs, and cooperates with coactivators (p300/CBP)
    or corepressors (Ski/SnoN/TGIF) to regulate target gene transcription.'

- description: SMAD3 binds the activated TGF-beta type I receptor (ALK5/TGFBR1) as the principal intracellular signal transducer.
    Upon receptor binding and C-terminal SSXS phosphorylation, SMAD3 forms heteromeric complexes with SMAD4 and translocates
    to the nucleus.
