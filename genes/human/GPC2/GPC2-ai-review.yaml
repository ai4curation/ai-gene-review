description: >-
  Glypican-2 (GPC2) is a GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) belonging to the
  glypican family. The protein functions as a cell-surface signaling co-receptor that modulates
  ligand-receptor interactions through its heparan sulfate chains. GPC2 binds growth factors
  such as pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MDK) via its heparan sulfate moieties, promoting
  neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth during development. The protein is involved
  in multiple signaling pathways including Wnt/smoothened signaling. GPC2 exhibits an
  oncofetal expression pattern, being expressed during neural development and re-expressed
  in certain tumors (particularly neuroblastoma, where it is MYCN-regulated), making it a
  target for immunotherapy approaches. The mature protein is located on the external side
  of the plasma membrane attached via a GPI anchor, though it can also be secreted after
  cleavage.

      GPC2 functions as a signaling co-receptor at the cell surface, modulating ligand-receptor
      interactions through its heparan sulfate chains. It binds growth factors such as PTN

      GPC2 is annotated to cell migration based on phylogenetic inference (IBA). Glypicans
      are known to modulate cell motility through their effects on growth factor signaling.
      UniProt states GPC2 may fulfill a function related to the motile behaviors of
      developing neurons. While the annotation is phylogenetically supported and consistent
      with glypican family function, direct experimental evidence for human GPC2 in cell
      migration is limited.

      GPC2 is annotated to extracellular matrix based on phylogenetic inference. As a
      GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan, GPC2 is primarily localized to the cell
      surface, not as a structural component of the extracellular matrix. While glypicans
      can interact with ECM components and may transiently associate with the ECM,
      particularly after shedding, this annotation conflates the secreted form with
      typical ECM structural components.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While GPC2 may interact with ECM components or be shed into the extracellular space,
      its primary localization is as a GPI-anchored cell surface protein. The ECM annotation
      is not incorrect but represents a secondary localization rather than the core function.

      Glypicans are well-established modulators of Hedgehog/smoothened signaling, with
