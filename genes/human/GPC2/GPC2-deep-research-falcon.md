## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8N158
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Glypican-2; Contains: RecName: Full=Secreted glypican-2; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=GPC2;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glypican family. .
- **Key Domains:** Glypican. (IPR001863); Glypican_CS. (IPR019803); Glypican (PF01153)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "GPC2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'GPC2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **GPC2** (gene ID: GPC2, UniProt: Q8N158) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
We verified the research target as human glypican-2 (GPC2), a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, consistent with the user-provided UniProt record (Q8N158) and with recent literature that describes GPC2 as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell-surface signaling co-receptor (human context, glypican family) (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 2-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and family: GPC2 is a glypican-family heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) that localizes to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. Glypicans serve as signaling co-receptors by presenting heparan sulfate chains that modulate ligand-receptor interactions at the cell surface (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4). In cancer biology, GPC2 is characterized as an oncofetal, cell-surface oncoprotein with differential expression between normal and tumor tissues (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 2-4, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 20-22).
- Cellular localization: GPC2 is cell-surface localized and GPI-anchored, consistent with glypican family features and its role as an extracellular signaling co-receptor (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4). In preclinical models, it is readily detected on the surface of neuroblastoma cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2).
- Regulatory context: GPC2 expression is MYCN-regulated in neuroblastoma, supporting its linkage to aggressive disease biology (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 20-22).
- Pathway roles: As a GPI-anchored HSPG, GPC2 functions as a signaling co-receptor implicated in canonical oncogenic pathways (e.g., WNT signaling), aligning with its role in promoting proliferation and tumor growth in neuroblastoma (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4, alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Translational immunotherapy targeting GPC2: Multiple groups have advanced GPC2-directed therapeutics, including fully human antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. A comprehensive 2025 preclinical translation study (data generated 2021–2024) reported D3-GPC2 CAR T cells that were selective and potent against neuroblastoma and also active against GPC2-positive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) models; these data supported the first-in-human pediatric trial NCT05650749 (Clinical Cancer Research, Sep 2025; DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 2-4, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 20-22). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- Brain tumor applications: In 2025, an NPJ Precision Oncology study profiled extracellular matrix and cell-surface landscapes in pediatric/adult gliomas and prioritized GPC2 among top immunotherapy targets; the authors validated GPC2-directed CAR activity in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) models and summarized prior evidence of efficacy in neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, including transient mRNA GPC2-CAR T approaches (NPJ Precision Oncology, Jun 2025; DOI: 10.1038/s41698-025-00956-z) (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-025-00956-z (published Jun 2025).
- Cytokine augmentation of GPC2-CAR T: A 2024 JITC study reported that long-acting IL-7 (rhIL‑7‑hyFc, NT‑I7) enhances the efficacy of CAR T cells targeting multiple solid tumor antigens including GPC2, by increasing CD4+ CAR occupancy, expansion, and stem-like memory phenotypes while reducing exhaustion markers; this improved efficacy in low-antigen-density contexts across several solid tumor xenografts, including neuroblastoma (Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer, Jul 2024; DOI: 10.1136/jitc-2024-008989) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-008989 (published Jul 2024).
- Field perspective/reviews (2025, reflecting 2023–2024 advances): Reviews summarize GPC2 as a GPI-anchored glypican oncoprotein, note its WNT-associated signaling role in neuroblastoma, correlations between high GPC2 and worse outcomes, and ongoing optimization of CAR constructs and combination strategies (Frontiers in Oncology, Mar 2025; DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2025.1553511) (alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6). URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1553511 (published Mar 2025).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- CAR T cells (neuroblastoma and beyond): D3-GPC2 CAR T cells (second-generation designs with CD28 or 4‑1BB costimulation) show potent, antigen-specific cytotoxicity in vitro and drive significant neuroblastoma xenograft regressions in vivo with no activation against multiple normal human primary cell types and no GPC2-CAR–related toxicities on necropsy in murine models; activity extends to GPC2-positive SCLC (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- ADCs and other antibody-based approaches: D3-derived ADCs have shown preclinical efficacy in neuroblastoma and SCLC; the D3 binder recognizes a tumor-selective, conformational epitope and has been engineered into ADCs and CARs, enabling cross-species preclinical modeling due to conserved epitope structure (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025; synthesis of earlier work) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 16-18, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 19-20). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- CNS tumors: Cell-surface proteomic and orthogonal analyses identify GPC2 as a prioritized immunotherapy target in pediatric high-grade glioma and DIPG, with in vitro validation of GPC2-CAR T cell killing of DIPG models, supporting extension of GPC2 targeting beyond neuroblastoma (NPJ Precision Oncology, 2025) (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4). URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-025-00956-z (published Jun 2025).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Translational credentialing: Giudice et al. conclude that GPC2 is a bona fide CAR T target meeting optimal solid-tumor target criteria—differential tumor expression, limited normal tissue expression (oncofetal pattern), essentiality for tumor growth, and epitope suitable for selective targeting—supporting first-in-human evaluation (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 2-4, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 20-22).
- CNS tumor immunotherapy perspective: ECM-focused target discovery and prioritization nominate GPC2 highly for pediatric CNS tumors, with functional CAR validation; the authors advocate evaluation of low-affinity GPC2 CARs to balance efficacy with safety in the CNS (NPJ Precision Oncology, 2025) (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4).
- Field review of neuroblastoma targeting: Reviews emphasize heterogeneity of GPC2 expression, enrichment in high-risk disease, WNT-associated growth signaling, and the need for biomarker-driven selection and persistence-enhancing strategies for GPC2 CAR T cells (Frontiers in Oncology, 2025) (alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Selectivity and safety in vitro/in vivo: D3-GPC2 CAR T cells did not activate or kill across nine primary human normal cell lines in co-incubation assays and produced significant regression of GPC2-positive neuroblastoma xenografts in mice without observed treatment-related toxicities on necropsy (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- Xenograft regression kinetics: In multiple MYCN-amplified PDX models (e.g., NB‑1643, COG‑N‑421x), D3-GPC2 CAR constructs (4‑1BBζ or CD28ζ) induced rapid tumor regressions, with responses evident within approximately one week and improved progression-free survival; activity was comparable to GD2 CARs in an aggressive model (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- Breadth of tumor types: Preclinical activity extends to SCLC models in vivo, suggesting broader applicability beyond pediatric solid tumors (Clinical Cancer Research, 2025) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-25-0089 (published Sep 2025).
- Cytokine augmentation (2024): rhIL‑7‑hyFc (NT‑I7) combined with GPC2 CAR T cells enhanced CAR T expansion, reduced exhaustion markers (PD‑1, LAG‑3), increased stem-like memory phenotypes, and improved efficacy against tumors with low antigen density across several solid tumor xenografts, including neuroblastoma (JITC, Jul 2024) (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14). URL: https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-008989 (published Jul 2024).

Biology and function synthesis
- Functional role: As a GPI-anchored HSPG, GPC2 serves as a cell-surface co-receptor that modulates ligand-receptor interactions, prominently in WNT signaling pertinent to neuroblastoma growth. Its expression is developmentally regulated (oncofetal), reactivated or amplified in tumors, and in neuroblastoma is transcriptionally driven by MYCN. These properties, together with restricted normal tissue expression, make it a compelling immunotherapy target (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4, alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 20-22).
- Epitope targeting: The D3 antibody recognizes a conformational, tumor-selective epitope conserved between mouse and human GPC2, enabling cross-species preclinical modeling and facilitating the engineering of selective ADCs and CARs (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 16-18, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2).

Expression patterns in development and cancers
- Neuroblastoma: High and prevalent surface expression across neuroblastoma tumors and cell models, including MYCN-amplified PDXs; associated with aggressive biology and poorer outcomes per review synthesis (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14, alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6).
- CNS tumors: Ranked among top cell-surface/ECM-associated targets in pediatric high-grade glioma/DIPG; validated GPC2-CAR activity against DIPG models in vitro (day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4).
- Small cell lung cancer: GPC2 CARs exhibited cytotoxicity against GPC2-positive SCLC models in vivo (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2).

Clinical trials (real-world implementations)
- NCT05650749 (GPC2 CAR T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma and Metastatic Retinoblastoma): Phase 1, single-institution (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia; lead PI Stephan Grupp), open-label dose-escalation/expansion; status RECRUITING; estimated enrollment 45; evaluates autologous GPC2-directed CAR T cells in relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma and metastatic retinoblastoma; primary endpoints include MTD and safety, with secondary endpoints including manufacturing feasibility, persistence, and preliminary activity. URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05650749 (recorded start May 23, 2023) (NCT05650749, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2).
- NCT07087002 (GPC2‑CAR T Cell Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Medulloblastoma in Children and Young Adults): Phase 1, Stanford University; status RECRUITING; estimated enrollment 18; intracerebroventricular administration up to 8 doses q28 days with intrapatient dose escalation after lymphodepletion (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide); eligibility requires tumor GPC2 expression (IHC H‑score ≥100). URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07087002 (actual start Aug 28, 2025; estimated primary/completion Aug 2027) (NCT07087002).

Conclusions and outlook
GPC2 (glypican‑2) is a human, GPI‑anchored HSPG with oncofetal expression and MYCN-linked regulation in neuroblastoma. Its cell-surface localization and role as a signaling co-receptor, including in WNT-associated tumor growth, make it amenable to targeted immunotherapies. Recent preclinical advances demonstrate selective, potent activity of D3‑GPC2 CAR T cells against neuroblastoma and SCLC with favorable preliminary safety, while CNS-focused analyses rank GPC2 among top targets in pediatric gliomas with supportive in vitro efficacy. Ongoing Phase 1 trials in neuroblastoma/retinoblastoma and medulloblastoma are evaluating feasibility, safety, and early activity, and combinatorial strategies such as long-acting IL‑7 are under exploration to improve efficacy and persistence in solid tumors (giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 1-2, giudice2025d3gpc2–directedcart pages 13-14, day2025definingtheextracellular pages 3-4, NCT05650749, NCT07087002, alkhazal2025emergingclinicaland pages 5-6).
