description: >-
  CHMP3 (also known as VPS24/hVps24) is a core component of the ESCRT-III complex,
  belonging to the SNF7 protein family. It functions as a non-enzymatic structural
  subunit that co-polymerizes with CHMP2A and CHMP4B to form helical/spiral
  polymers that constrict and sever membrane necks in "reverse topology"
  membrane fission events (budding away from the cytosol). CHMP3 is maintained
  in an autoinhibited cytosolic state and is activated upon recruitment to
  membranes through interaction with other ESCRT-III components. The VPS4 AAA+
  ATPase disassembles CHMP3-containing polymers after membrane scission. CHMP3
  participates in multivesicular body (MVB) formation and cargo sorting to
  lysosomes, cytokinetic abscission at the midbody, nuclear envelope reformation
  during telophase, plasma membrane repair, and is hijacked by enveloped viruses
  (notably HIV-1) for budding. It also plays roles in autophagosome maturation
  and endosomal proteostasis relevant to neurodegenerative disease.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the precise sequence of CHMP subunit assembly and 
      VPS4-driven remodeling during membrane scission?
  - question: How do different ESCRT-III paralogs contribute to 
      compartment-specific functions (MVB vs. lysosomal microautophagy)?
  - question: What regulates CHMP3 recruitment to different cellular sites 
      (endosomes vs. midbody vs. nuclear envelope)?
