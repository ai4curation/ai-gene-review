## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P05112
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Interleukin-4; Short=IL-4; AltName: Full=B-cell stimulatory factor 1; Short=BSF-1; AltName: Full=Binetrakin; AltName: Full=Lymphocyte stimulatory factor 1; AltName: Full=Pitrakinra; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IL4;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IL-4/IL-13 family. .
- **Key Domains:** 4_helix_cytokine-like_core. (IPR009079); IL-4. (IPR002354); IL-4/IL-13. (IPR001325); IL-4/IL-13_CS. (IPR018096); IL4 (PF00727)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IL4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IL4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IL4** (gene ID: IL4, UniProt: P05112) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report: IL4 (UniProt P05112) – human Interleukin-4 (IL‑4)

Target verification and identity
- Gene/protein checked: IL4 encodes human IL‑4, a secreted cytokine of the IL‑4/IL‑13 family. Contemporary structure-guided engineering confirms IL‑4’s four-helix bundle topology and three conserved disulfide bonds (Cys3–Cys127, Cys24–Cys65, Cys46–Cys99), aligning with UniProt’s family/domain annotations (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Organism: Homo sapiens confirmed throughout cited 2023–2024 literature (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and structure: IL‑4 is a short-chain class I cytokine adopting a four‑α‑helix bundle stabilized by three disulfides. Structure–function mapping identifies site I on helices A–C as the IL‑4Rα interface (key residues Glu9, Arg88) and site II mediating recruitment of γc or IL‑13Rα1 to form signaling complexes (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Receptor usage and signaling: IL‑4 signals via two receptor complexes: type I (IL‑4Rα/γc) largely on hematopoietic cells and type II (IL‑4Rα/IL‑13Rα1) on many non‑hematopoietic cells. JAK–STAT is canonical: type I (primarily JAK1/JAK3) and type II (JAK2/TYK2 reported), converging on STAT6; IRS‑2→PI3K/MAPK pathways also contribute to survival/proliferation programs (Exploration of Immunology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2025.1003183, Feb 2025) (wong2025theroleof pages 11-13). Mechanistic reviews in asthma corroborate STAT6-centric signaling in type‑2 immunity (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 7-8, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 13-14).
- Cellular sources: Major producers include Th2 cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), basophils, mast cells, and, context‑dependently, eosinophils; basophils are highlighted as early IL‑4 sources in allergic priming (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7). Additional overviews emphasize Th2/mast cell/basophil sources and effector actions (Exploration of Immunology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2025.1003183, Feb 2025) (wong2025theroleof pages 11-13).
- Primary functions: IL‑4 drives Th2 differentiation (via STAT6→GATA3), B‑cell proliferation and class‑switch recombination to IgE, and alternative (M2) macrophage activation; IL‑13 overlaps but acts more directly on structural cells (epithelium, smooth muscle, fibroblasts) (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7). IL‑4/IL‑13 redundancy in IgE biology supports shared‑receptor therapeutic strategies (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Localization: IL‑4 is secreted and acts via cell‑surface IL‑4Rα‑containing receptors; downstream signaling is intracellular (wong2025theroleof pages 11-13, thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Structural and engineering advances: Structure‑guided mutational and glycoengineering studies refined IL‑4’s receptor‑binding sites and produced antagonistic IL‑4 variants, supporting domain‑level understanding and drug design. The 2023 ACS Omega study details site I (IL‑4Rα) and site II (γc/IL‑13Rα1) determinants and demonstrates glycan attachment strategies that convert IL‑4 into long‑lived antagonists, highlighting translational avenues beyond antibodies (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Immunobiology of type‑2 airway disease: A 2024 review synthesizes IL‑4/IL‑13 roles in severe eosinophilic asthma, including DC‑mediated Th2 priming, effects on goblet cell differentiation/mucus production, smooth muscle hyperreactivity, and airway remodeling. It emphasizes basophils/ILC2s as critical contributors and documents clinical efficacy of IL‑4Rα blockade (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Rationale for dual‑pathway blockade: Because IL‑4 and IL‑13 share IL‑4Rα and have overlapping functions in allergic disease, shared‑receptor inhibition (e.g., dupilumab) outperforms single‑cytokine strategies that historically under‑performed (e.g., pascolizumab, some anti‑IL‑13 programs). 2023 structure‑guided analyses and therapeutic reviews converge on IL‑4Rα as the optimal node (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Dupilumab (anti‑IL‑4Rα): mechanism and clinical translation
  - Mechanism: Human IgG4 mAb targeting IL‑4Rα to block both IL‑4 and IL‑13 signaling, suppressing STAT6‑dependent type‑2 programs (Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1631321, Aug 2025) (ameer2025exploringdupilumabfor pages 2-3).
  - Asthma (moderate–severe, T2‑high and selected T2‑low): Pooled/long‑term clinical data summarized in 2025 reviews report sizable reductions in severe exacerbations and improvements in pre‑bronchodilator FEV1. Quantitatively, patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300/µL experienced a 65.8% reduction in annualized severe exacerbations; in OCS‑dependent asthma, oral glucocorticoid use decreased by 70.1%. Long‑term extensions showed sustained efficacy and a safety profile notable for transient blood eosinophilia (~4.1%) (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 13-14). Although these summaries consolidate earlier pivotal trials, they reflect continued clinical adoption into 2023–2024.
  - CRSwNP: Contemporary therapeutic overviews and cost‑effectiveness analyses (2023) position dupilumab as effective for T2‑biased nasal polyposis in line with its airway biology; 2024 field reviews of T2 inflammation in CRSwNP recapitulate IL‑4/IL‑13’s pathobiology underpinning efficacy (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1356298, Apr 2024) (varut2025targetedbiologictherapies pages 11-13).
  - Atopic dermatitis and EoE: Cross‑indication efficacy is consistent with IL‑4/IL‑13’s central role in barrier dysfunction and type‑2 inflammation; recent reviews detail broad improvements in AD and EoE with IL‑4Rα blockade as of 2023–2024 (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31) and asthma‑focused synopses with EoE notes (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 7-8, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16).
- Earlier/alternative IL‑4 pathway agents
  - Pitrakinra (recombinant IL‑4 mutein; IL‑4/IL‑13 signaling antagonist): Phase 2a allergen‑challenge studies showed attenuated FEV1 decline vs placebo (study examples: maximum FEV1 decrease 17.1% vs 23.1%; average decrease 4.4% vs 15.9%), but development did not proceed to approval (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16, massey2021recentadvancesin pages 4-6).
  - Pascolizumab (anti‑IL‑4 mAb): clinical efficacy in asthma was insufficient, and the program was discontinued; results, together with variable anti‑IL‑13 outcomes, support targeting IL‑4Rα rather than a single cytokine (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (massey2021recentadvancesin pages 4-6, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16).

Expert opinions and authoritative syntheses
- Field reviews integrating immunology and translation (2024–2025) concur that IL‑4 is a central driver of type‑2 endotypes (eosinophilic/allergic) across airway and barrier diseases, and that IL‑4Rα blockade delivers clinically meaningful benefit across multiple indications by intercepting redundant IL‑4/IL‑13 signaling (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7); (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1356298, Apr 2024) (varut2025targetedbiologictherapies pages 11-13); (ACS Omega, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c00726, Jul 2023) (thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Asthma (clinical outcomes with anti‑IL‑4Rα):
  - Annualized severe exacerbations reduced by 65.8% in patients with eosinophils ≥300/µL; oral glucocorticoid dose reduced by 70.1% in OCS‑dependent cohorts; improvements in pre‑BD FEV1 and biomarkers (FeNO↓; transient eosinophils↑). Long‑term extensions reported TEAEs in ~76–95% (expected for chronic biologic therapy) with ~4% blood eosinophilia and rare serious AEs (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 13-14).
- Pitrakinra (phase 2a allergen‑challenge protection): maximum FEV1 decrease 17.1% vs 23.1% (placebo) and average FEV1 decrease 4.4% vs 15.9% (placebo), illustrating target engagement but limited development (Biomedicines, 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13061342, May 2025) (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16).

Functional annotation summary (mechanism, pathways, and localization)
- Biochemical role: IL‑4 is a secreted cytokine that binds IL‑4Rα-containing heterodimeric receptors (type I or II) at the plasma membrane to initiate intracellular JAK–STAT6 signaling. It instructs Th2 differentiation (GATA3 program), promotes B‑cell class switch to IgE, and polarizes macrophages toward M2 states; IL‑13 shares downstream pathways, with greater action on non‑hematopoietic targets (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7); (Exploration of Immunology, 2025; https://doi.org/10.37349/ei.2025.1003183, Feb 2025) (wong2025theroleof pages 11-13).
- Cellular/subcellular localization: IL‑4 is secreted and functions in the extracellular space; signaling occurs at/through cell‑surface IL‑4R complexes with cytoplasmic JAKs and STAT6 effectors (wong2025theroleof pages 11-13, thomas2023designofglycoengineered pages 28-31).
- Disease pathways: IL‑4 is a master regulator in type‑2 inflammatory diseases—atopy, asthma, atopic dermatitis, CRSwNP, and eosinophilic esophagitis—through effects on antigen presentation, IgE production, eosinophil recruitment, epithelial remodeling, mucus hypersecretion, and fibrosis (Biomolecules, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14050546, May 2024) (nakagome2024thepossibleroles pages 5-7); (Frontiers in Immunology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1356298, Apr 2024) (varut2025targetedbiologictherapies pages 11-13).

Notes on evidence prioritization and limitations
- 2023–2024 sources prioritized: ACS Omega (2023) provided structural and therapeutic‑engineering specificity; Biomolecules (2024) and Frontiers in Immunology (2024) covered IL‑4/IL‑13 biology in airway disease and CRSwNP. Quantitative dupilumab outcomes in asthma are summarized in 2025 peer‑reviewed syntheses that consolidate earlier pivotal trials with continuing real‑world/extension data (Biomedicines, 2025; Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2025); exact 2023–2024 trial readouts are consistent with these summaries but not all primary trial URLs were captured in the retrieved corpus (reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 7-8, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 14-16, ameer2025exploringdupilumabfor pages 2-3, reza2025inflammationinasthma pages 13-14).
