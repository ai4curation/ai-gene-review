description: 'Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a secreted four-helix bundle cytokine of the IL-4/IL-13 family,
  produced primarily by Th2 cells, basophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and group 2 innate lymphoid
  cells (ILC2s). It functions as the master regulator of type 2 immunity by binding the IL-4 receptor
  alpha chain (IL4RA) and signaling through two receptor complexes: the type I complex (IL4RA/IL2RG)
  on hematopoietic cells, and the type II complex (IL4RA/IL13RA1) on non-hematopoietic and some
  hematopoietic cells. IL-4 signals canonically through JAK1/JAK3-STAT6, leading to GATA3 induction
  that drives Th2 differentiation, B cell class switch recombination to IgE and IgG4, MHC class II
  upregulation on B cells, and M2 macrophage polarization. IL-4 also activates IRS-2/PI3K pathways
  contributing to cell survival and proliferation. It is a central mediator of allergic inflammation,
  anti-helminth defense, and various immune regulatory processes. The protein has three disulfide
  bonds (Cys3-Cys127, Cys24-Cys65, Cys46-Cys99) and one N-glycosylation site (Asn62). An alternatively
  spliced isoform (IL-4delta2) lacking exon 2 acts as a natural antagonist.'

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IL-4 is the defining ligand of the IL-4-mediated signaling pathway. It binds IL4RA
      to initiate JAK/STAT6 signaling cascades that drive Th2 differentiation, IgE class switching,
      and other downstream effects. This is a core biological process for IL-4.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most specific and appropriate BP term for IL-4 as the initiating ligand
      of this pathway. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically well-supported and represents the
      central biological role of the protein. Extensively documented in the deep research and
      UniProt function annotation.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

    reason: While there is evidence that IL-4 can regulate cell migration, this is not a

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

    summary: PMID:18579517 demonstrates that IL-4 stimulation negatively regulates expression
      of LEF-1 and TCF-1 transcription factors in primary T cells, creating a positive
      feedback loop that reinforces IL-4 gene expression by removing transcriptional
      repressors. This represents IL-4 negatively regulating transcription of specific
      target genes (LEF-1, TCF-1).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The paper provides direct evidence that IL-4 downregulates LEF-1 and TCF-1
      expression, which are Wnt pathway transcription factors. This is consistent with
      the existing KEEP_AS_NON_CORE annotation for GO:0000122 (negative regulation of

  original_reference_id: PMID:18579517
  review:
    summary: PMID:18579517 demonstrates that IL-4 positively regulates its own gene expression
      through a feedback mechanism. IL-4 stimulation suppresses LEF-1 and TCF-1, which are
      negative regulators of the IL-4 promoter. Knockdown of LEF-1 by siRNA increased IL-4
      mRNA expression, confirming that LEF-1 is a transcriptional repressor of IL-4. By
      removing this repression, IL-4 indirectly promotes transcription of IL-4 and potentially
      other Th2 cytokine genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The paper provides evidence that IL-4 positively regulates transcription through
      a feedback loop involving suppression of LEF-1/TCF-1 transcriptional repressors. This
      is consistent with the other ACCEPT annotations for GO:0045893 from IBA, IDA (PMID:19346497,
