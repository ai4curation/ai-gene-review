## Question

Research the SCGB1A1 (P11684) gene in human, focusing on its molecular function, biological processes, and cellular localization. Include information about protein domains, known interactions, and any disease associations.

## Output

The **SCGB1A1 gene** (UniProt: P11684), also known as uteroglobin, encodes a small secreted protein with key roles in anti-inflammation, phospholipase A2 inhibition, and the binding/sequestration of hydrophobic ligands. It is primarily expressed in the lung, especially in club (Clara) cells, and is associated with respiratory health and disease, notably asthma and certain lung cancers[1][3][4][6][12].

---

### 1. Key Concepts and Definitions

- **Gene/Protein Names:** SCGB1A1, uteroglobin, CC10, CC16, club cell secretory protein (CCSP), club cell phospholipid-binding protein (CCPBP)[1][3][5][7].
- **Protein Family:** Secretoglobin family; small, secreted, disulfide-bridged dimeric proteins found only in mammals[3].
- **Location:** Chromosome 11q12.3[2].

---

### 2. Molecular Function

- **Phospholipase A2 Inhibitor:** SCGB1A1 is a potent inhibitor of phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in the release of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators[1][3][5][7].
- **Ligand Binding:** Binds phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and weakly binds progesterone[1][3][5][7].
- **Immunomodulation:** Modulates immune responses, including negative regulation of interleukin-13, interleukin-4, and interleukin-5 production, and T cell proliferation[5][8].
- **Other Functions:** Involved in the regulation of mRNA stability, response to cytokines, glucocorticoids, lipopolysaccharide, ozone, and xenobiotic stimuli[5].

---

### 3. Biological Processes

- **Anti-inflammatory Activity:** Reduces airway inflammation by sequestering inflammatory mediators and inhibiting phospholipase A2[1][3][8].
- **Regulation of Immune Response:** Negatively regulates Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), T cell proliferation, and type II interferon production[5][8].
- **Response to Environmental Stimuli:** Involved in the response to environmental insults such as ozone and xenobiotics[5].
- **Embryo Implantation and Pregnancy:** Implicated in embryo implantation and female pregnancy, though these roles are better established in animal models[5].
- **Lung Homeostasis:** Maintains epithelial integrity and modulates alveolar macrophage function[8].

---

### 4. Cellular Localization

- **Secreted Protein:** SCGB1A1 is secreted into the extracellular space[1][5][7].
- **Tissue Expression:** Highly expressed in the cytoplasm of club (Clara) cells in the bronchial epithelium of the lung[6][12].
- **Subcellular Localization:** Detected in extracellular exosomes, secretory granules, and the nuclear envelope[5].

---

### 5. Protein Domains

- **Pfam Domain:** Uteroglobin (PF01099)[5].
- **Structure:** 91 amino acids, forms an antiparallel disulfide-linked homodimer[3][5].
- **Signal Peptide:** Amino acids 1–21 constitute the signal region for secretion[5].

---

### 6. Known Interactions

- **Ligand Interactions:** Binds phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol), PCBs, and weakly binds progesterone[1][3][5][7].
- **Protein Interactions:** Binds fibronectin; in animal models, this interaction is implicated in glomerulopathy (Goodpasture's syndrome-like disease)[3].
- **Inflammatory Mediators:** Binds and sequesters prostaglandins and other inflammatory molecules[8].

---

### 7. Disease Associations

- **Asthma:** Genetic defects in SCGB1A1 are associated with increased susceptibility to asthma[1][2][4].
- **Bronchiolitis Obliterans:** Linked to this chronic lung disease[1].
- **Lung Cancer:** Altered expression is associated with lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer[2].
- **Other Respiratory Diseases:** Used as a biomarker for small airway epithelial damage and is implicated in the response to environmental lung insults[9].
- **Animal Models:** Knockout mice show increased susceptibility to respiratory inflammation and altered responses to environmental challenges[3][8].

---

### 8. Recent Developments and Research (2023–2024)

- **Immunomodulatory Role:** Recent studies highlight SCGB1A1’s influence on alveolar macrophage phenotype and function, suggesting a broader role in lung immune homeostasis and potential therapeutic applications in airway diseases[8] (Frontiers in Immunology, 2020; no 2023–2024 studies found in the provided results, but this is the most recent peer-reviewed research available).
- **Cancer Biomarker:** Ongoing research explores SCGB1A1 as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in lung cancer and other respiratory diseases[2].

---

### 9. Expert Opinions and Analysis

- **Protective Role:** Experts consider SCGB1A1 a key protective factor in the lung, with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that are critical for respiratory health[1][3][8].
- **Therapeutic Potential:** There is interest in leveraging SCGB1A1 or its analogs for treating inflammatory airway diseases and as a biomarker for lung injury and cancer[2][8].

---

### 10. Relevant Statistics and Data

- **Protein Size:** 91 amino acids; molecular weight ~9.99 kDa; theoretical pI 4.71[5].
- **Expression:** Highly selective for club cells in the bronchial epithelium; detectable in serum as a marker of lung epithelial damage[6][9][12].
