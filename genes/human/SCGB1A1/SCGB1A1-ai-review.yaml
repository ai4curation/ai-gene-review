description: 'SCGB1A1 (Secretoglobin family 1A member 1), also known as uteroglobin or club cell secretory protein (CCSP/CC10), is a small secreted homodimeric protein that functions as a multifunctional immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory agent. It is predominantly expressed in club cells (Clara cells) of the respiratory tract, where it is one of the most abundant secreted proteins in airway lining fluid. SCGB1A1 exhibits multiple protective functions including potent inhibition of phospholipase A2, sequestration of hydrophobic inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, phospholipids, polychlorinated biphenyls), regulation of macrophage and dendritic cell function, and prevention of pathological fibronectin deposition. The protein forms an antiparallel disulfide-linked homodimer with a central hydrophobic cavity that binds diverse lipophilic ligands. Reduced SCGB1A1 levels are associated with asthma, COPD, and other inflammatory lung diseases.'
