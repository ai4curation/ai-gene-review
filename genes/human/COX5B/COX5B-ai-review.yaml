description: 'Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B, nuclear-encoded peripheral membrane protein (~12.5 kDa)
  that is a structural component of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in mitochondrial inner membrane.
  Complex IV is terminal enzyme of electron transport chain, catalyzing reduction of O₂ to H₂O using electrons
  from cytochrome c, contributing to proton electrochemical gradient for ATP synthesis. Complex IV comprises
  14 subunits (3 mtDNA-encoded catalytic core: COX1/2/3, plus 11 nuclear-encoded including COX5B). COX5B
  lacks transmembrane helix, instead attaches to matrix-exposed surface of enzyme. Primary role is structural
  - helps form quaternary structure and is necessary for complex stability and optimal function, though
  doesn''t bind substrate or perform redox chemistry. Localized to matrix side of inner mitochondrial
  membrane. Critical for Complex IV assembly and maintenance - incorporated early during assembly (with
  COX2/3 modules), required for progression to fully assembled holoenzyme. Knockdown causes accumulation
  of assembly intermediates and overall Complex IV deficiency, leading to decreased COX activity, loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired respiration, energy deficits, and excess ROS. Interacts
  with PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) on matrix side - this binding inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity,
  suggesting cAMP/PKA pathway can regulate respiration by targeting COX5B. Interacts with MAVS (mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling protein) on outer membrane, negatively regulating antiviral signaling - during viral
  infection MAVS triggers ROS production and upregulates COX5B, which in turn dampens MAVS signaling by
  reducing ROS and coordinating with autophagy to limit MAVS aggregation. Links mitochondrial electron
  transport status to immune signaling, preventing excessive ROS/apoptosis during antiviral defense. "Moonlighting"
  regulatory roles beyond structural function - integrates into broader cellular networks, modulating
  signals and balancing metabolic activity with cell signaling and stress responses. Essential for oxidative
  phosphorylation - as part of Complex IV contributes to respiratory electron transport and ATP synthesis
  coupled to proton transport. Synthesized in cytosol with targeting signal, imported to mitochondrial
  matrix for Complex IV integration. No disease-causing mutations in COX5B definitively identified in
  humans, but experimental knockdowns produce clear mitochondrial dysfunction.'

  review:
    summary: COX5B is essential structural subunit of Complex IV which catalyzes final step of electron
      transport chain - transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. While COX5B itself doesn't
      directly catalyze electron transfer (performed by catalytic core subunits COX1/2/3), it is required
      for complex assembly, stability, and optimal activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core biological process annotation. Phylogenetic inference combined with extensive experimental
      evidence shows COX5B is absolutely required for this process. Knockdown studies demonstrate loss
      of COX5B causes accumulation of assembly intermediates, decreased COX activity, and impaired electron
      transport.
