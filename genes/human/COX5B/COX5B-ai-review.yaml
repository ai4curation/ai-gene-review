description: 'Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B, nuclear-encoded peripheral membrane
  protein (~12.5 kDa) that is a structural component of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)
  in mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex IV is terminal enzyme of electron transport
  chain, catalyzing reduction of O₂ to H₂O using electrons from cytochrome c, contributing
  to proton electrochemical gradient for ATP synthesis. Complex IV comprises 14 subunits
  (3 mtDNA-encoded catalytic core: COX1/2/3, plus 11 nuclear-encoded including COX5B).
  COX5B lacks transmembrane helix, instead attaches to matrix-exposed surface of enzyme.
  Primary role is structural - helps form quaternary structure and is necessary for
  complex stability and optimal function, though doesn''t bind substrate or perform
  redox chemistry. Localized to matrix side of inner mitochondrial membrane. Critical
  for Complex IV assembly and maintenance - incorporated early during assembly (with
  COX2/3 modules), required for progression to fully assembled holoenzyme. Knockdown
  causes accumulation of assembly intermediates and overall Complex IV deficiency,
  leading to decreased COX activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired
  respiration, energy deficits, and excess ROS. Interacts with PKA regulatory subunit
  (PKA-R) on matrix side - this binding inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity, suggesting
  cAMP/PKA pathway can regulate respiration by targeting COX5B. Interacts with MAVS
  (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein) on outer membrane, negatively regulating
  antiviral signaling - during viral infection MAVS triggers ROS production and upregulates
  COX5B, which in turn dampens MAVS signaling by reducing ROS and coordinating with
  autophagy to limit MAVS aggregation. Links mitochondrial electron transport status
  to immune signaling, preventing excessive ROS/apoptosis during antiviral defense.
  "Moonlighting" regulatory roles beyond structural function - integrates into broader
  cellular networks, modulating signals and balancing metabolic activity with cell
  signaling and stress responses. Essential for oxidative phosphorylation - as part
  of Complex IV contributes to respiratory electron transport and ATP synthesis coupled
  to proton transport. Synthesized in cytosol with targeting signal, imported to mitochondrial
  matrix for Complex IV integration. No disease-causing mutations in COX5B definitively
  identified in humans, but experimental knockdowns produce clear mitochondrial dysfunction.'
