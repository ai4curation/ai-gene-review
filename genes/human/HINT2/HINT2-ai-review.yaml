description: HINT2 (Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2) is a mitochondrial
  adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase belonging to the HIT (histidine triad) superfamily.
  The enzyme hydrolyzes purine nucleotide phosphoramidates with a single phosphate
  group, using the conserved His-X-His-X-His catalytic motif. HINT2 localizes to mitochondria
  where it functions as an apoptotic sensitizer and regulator of mitochondrial NAD+
  homeostasis, influencing SIRT3-dependent protein deacetylation. The protein is highly
  expressed in liver and pancreas, and is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) where low expression correlates with poor prognosis.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for cytoplasm based on phylogenetic inference. While the
      IBA includes cytoplasmic HINT family members (e.g., HINT1 is cytoplasmic), human
      HINT2 is specifically characterized as a mitochondrial protein. PMID:16762638
      demonstrates clear mitochondrial localization via immunofluorescence, fractionation,
      and GFP-fusion. The cytoplasmic annotation may reflect family-level inference
      that does not apply to HINT2 specifically.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Human HINT2 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and experimental
      evidence demonstrates exclusive mitochondrial localization. Unlike the cytoplasmic
      HINT1, HINT2 functions within mitochondria. The IBA inference from the broader
      HINT family does not apply to this paralog.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for mitochondrial matrix based on Ensembl Compara transfer
      from mouse ortholog. This is consistent with the N-terminal mitochondrial
      targeting sequence (aa 1-17 per UniProt) which would direct the mature protein
      to the matrix after import and cleavage. The Reactome annotation suggesting
      outer membrane localization appears to be erroneous (see review of GO:0005741).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The mitochondrial matrix localization is well-supported by the protein's
      N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. UniProt annotates residues 1-17
      as a transit peptide for mitochondrial import. After cleavage, the mature
      protein (aa 18-163) would be expected to reside in the matrix. This is
      consistent with HINT2's role in regulating mitochondrial NAD+ homeostasis
      and SIRT3-dependent deacetylation, as SIRT3 is a matrix-localized sirtuin.
      The Reactome outer membrane annotation appears to be erroneous and should
      not be used to question the matrix localization. The PMID:18653718 study
      also noted that HINT2 appeared "associated with mitochondrial membranes,

  review:
    summary: TAS annotation based on Reactome pathway R-HSA-9693214 claiming RHOD
      binds HINT2 at the mitochondrial outer membrane to trigger Ca2+ influx. The
      Reactome entry cites "Chen et al. 2017" and "Bagci et al. 2020". However, this
      annotation conflicts with multiple lines of evidence showing HINT2 has an
      N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (aa 1-17 per UniProt) that directs
      the mature protein to the matrix. The Reactome interpretation may be erroneous
      or conflating HINT2 with a different protein.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation should be removed for several reasons. (1) HINT2 has a
      well-characterized N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (aa 1-17 per
      UniProt FT TRANSIT) that directs the protein to the mitochondrial matrix, not
      the outer membrane. (2) The primary characterization study (PMID:16762638)
      localized HINT2 to mitochondria but did not demonstrate outer membrane
      localization specifically. (3) The Reactome citation to "Chen et al. 2017"
      for RHOD-HINT2 interaction triggering Ca2+ influx is questionable - more
      recent literature (e.g., PMC8677646) shows HINT2 interacts with MCU
      (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) which is in the inner membrane/matrix,
      not the outer membrane. The outer membrane localization may be a curation
      error conflating the Ca2+ signaling function with outer membrane localization.
      HINT2's N-terminal targeting sequence is incompatible with outer membrane
      localization of the mature protein.

      interaction extremely unlikely. HINT2 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting
      sequence and multiple studies confirm its mitochondrial localization
      (PMID:16762638). CFTR is a plasma membrane chloride channel. There is no

      exacerbates hepatic steatosis through effects on mitochondrial NAD+/SIRT3
      pathways, but this represents an indirect consequence of disrupted
      mitochondrial function rather than direct involvement in lipid metabolic
      enzymes or pathways. HINT2's primary function is adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase

      angiotensin II, K+, forskolin, or hydroxycholesterol stimulation. However,
      the mechanism is explicitly stated as unknown, and the effect appears to be
      through mitochondrial calcium signaling and membrane potential rather than
      direct participation in steroidogenic enzymes.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The evidence from Lenglet et al. (2008) is correlative and the mechanism
      is explicitly unknown. The abstract states that HINT2's effects "could be related
      to its ability to maintain a favorable mitochondrial potential" and that the
      mechanism "still remains to determine at the molecular level." Importantly,
      HINT2 overexpression had "no effect" on steroidogenesis - only knockdown showed
      effects, suggesting HINT2 is not rate-limiting but rather maintains basal
      mitochondrial function required for optimal steroidogenic capacity. HINT2 is
      NOT a steroidogenic enzyme (like CYP11A1, HSD3B, etc.) - it is an adenosine
      5'-monophosphoramidase. The steroidogenic effects are likely secondary to
      disruption of mitochondrial calcium handling or membrane potential rather
      than direct involvement in steroid biosynthetic pathways. This represents

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for apoptotic process based on UniProt keyword mapping

      sensitizes hepatoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (reduced viability, enhanced
      mitochondrial depolarization, increased caspase cleavage). However, this is
      a PHENOTYPIC observation in a specific cell model, not evidence of direct
      mechanistic involvement in the apoptotic machinery. The authors describe HINT2
      as an "apoptotic sensitizer" - meaning it modulates sensitivity to apoptotic
      stimuli, likely through effects on mitochondrial function (membrane potential,
      NAD+ homeostasis), rather than being a core component of apoptotic signaling.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The evidence from Martin et al. (2006) demonstrates that HINT2 modulates
      cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stress, but does not establish HINT2 as a
      direct participant in apoptotic signaling pathways. The observed effects
      (mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation) are downstream consequences
      of HINT2's role in mitochondrial function, not evidence of direct apoptotic
      function. The abstract explicitly states the "biological function" of HINT2
      is "uncertain" and classifies it as an "apoptotic sensitizer" rather than
      an apoptotic regulator. More recent studies (Wang et al. 2025, Fan et al. 2020)
      link HINT2 to mitochondrial NAD+ homeostasis and SIRT3-dependent deacetylation,
      suggesting the apoptotic phenotype is secondary to bioenergetic roles. GO

core_functions:
- description: Adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase activity - hydrolyzes purine nucleotide
    phosphoramidates with a single phosphate group (e.g., AMP-NH2 to AMP + NH2). Catalytic
    activity depends on the conserved His-X-His-X-His histidine triad motif, with
    His-149 essential for catalysis (kcat = 0.0223 s-1, Km = 128 uM for AMP-pNA substrate).

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the physiological substrate of HINT2 in mitochondria?
- question: How does HINT2 regulate mitochondrial NAD+ homeostasis?
- question: Is HINT2 truly localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane in addition
    to the matrix?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Determine sub-mitochondrial localization using protease protection
    assays to clarify whether HINT2 is in the matrix (as predicted by targeting sequence)
    or accessible at the outer membrane (as suggested by RHOD interaction data).
- description: Identify endogenous substrates using metabolomics by comparing metabolite
    profiles in HINT2 knockout vs wildtype mitochondria to identify accumulating phosphoramidates
    that may be endogenous substrates.
