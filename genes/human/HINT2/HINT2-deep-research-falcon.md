## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BX68
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase HINT2 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:16762638}; EC=3.9.1.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16762638, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31990367}; AltName: Full=HINT-3 {ECO:0000303|Ref.4}; AltName: Full=HIT-17kDa {ECO:0000303|Ref.1}; AltName: Full=Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2, mitochondrial {ECO:0000305}; Short=HINT-2 {ECO:0000303|Ref.3}; AltName: Full=PKCI-1-related HIT protein {ECO:0000303|Ref.2}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=HINT2 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:18344};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HINT family. .
- **Key Domains:** Histidine_triad_CS. (IPR019808); Histidine_triad_HIT. (IPR001310); HIT-like. (IPR011146); HIT-like_sf. (IPR036265); HIT (PF01230)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "HINT2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'HINT2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **HINT2** (gene ID: HINT2, UniProt: Q9BX68) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human HINT2 (UniProt Q9BX68)

Summary and identity verification
- Gene/protein identity and domains: HINT2 encodes a histidine triad (HIT) family hydrolase with a conserved His–X–His–X–His catalytic motif and an N‑terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. Human HINT2 localizes to mitochondria and is a 163‑amino‑acid protein, consistent with the UniProt entry for Q9BX68 (human). Mitochondrial localization was demonstrated by immunofluorescence co‑localization with MitoTracker, mitochondrial fractionation, and GFP‑fusion constructs; mutation of the middle histidine (H149A) abolished enzymatic function, confirming the HIT active site’s role (Martin et al., 2006; Gastroenterology; published June 2006; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 1-2, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).

Key concepts and definitions
- Primary biochemical function: HINT2 is an adenosine 5′‑monophosphoramidase (EC 3.9.1.-) consistent with HIT family hydrolases. Using the model substrate AMP‑pNA, human HINT2 exhibits kcat = 0.0223 ± 0.0031 s−1 and Km = 128 ± 35 µM; activity depends on the conserved histidine triad (H149A mutant abolishes activity). These data establish nucleoside monophosphoramidase activity and implicate the histidine triad in catalysis (Martin et al., 2006; Gastroenterology; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 1-2, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).
- Subcellular localization and tissue expression: HINT2 is localized to mitochondria and is most abundantly expressed in liver and pancreas (Martin et al., 2006; Gastroenterology; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Functional role in apoptosis: In hepatoma cells, HINT2 acts as a mitochondrial apoptotic sensitizer. Overexpression in HepG2 cells increased sensitivity to anti‑Fas + actinomycin D, reducing viable cells and enhancing mitochondrial depolarization and caspase cleavage; xenografts overexpressing HINT2 formed smaller tumors with increased apoptosis (Martin et al., 2006; Gastroenterology; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).

Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024 where possible)
- Mitochondrial NAD+ homeostasis and SIRT3 axis: New mechanistic work demonstrates HINT2 enhances mitochondrial NAD+ availability and SIRT3‑dependent deacetylation in liver disease models. In mouse and cell systems, loss of Hint2 decreased mitochondrial NAD+ and SIRT3 activity, increased mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, and exacerbated diet‑induced steatosis; HINT2 overexpression increased mitochondrial NAD+, reduced triglycerides, and improved mitochondrial function. These effects were linked to the mitochondrial NAD+ carrier SLC25A51 (NDTM1), whose modulation shifted mitochondrial vs cytosolic NAD+ pools; HINT2 increased SLC25A51 protein indirectly (no co‑IP). AMPK activity changes were implicated in this regulation (Wang et al., 2025; Exp. & Mol. Med.; published May 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01445-w) (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).
- Cardiomyocyte protection after MI and NMN dependence: In a post‑MI mouse model, AAV9‑mediated HINT2 overexpression preserved cardiac function, increased ATP production, improved metabolic readouts, and reduced apoptosis and fibrosis. HINT2 raised mitochondrial NAD+ in neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes under hypoxia; its protective effect required NAMPT activity or exogenous NMN. Biophysical assays supported direct HINT2–NMN binding (Fan et al., 2020; Acta Physiologica; published Jan 2020; https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13439) (fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9).
- Note on 2023–2024 literature: Within the present evidence set, the most up‑to‑date mechanistic study is 2025 (Exp. & Mol. Med.) on the HINT2–NAD+–SIRT3–SLC25A51 axis. Contemporary 2023–2024 references could not be validated in the current context; therefore, conclusions emphasize directly supported studies (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9).

Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Prognostic biomarker potential in HCC: Transcriptomic analyses indicate HINT2 is down‑regulated in HCC, and higher HINT2 expression correlates with longer recurrence‑free survival. In a TCGA‑based analysis, high HINT2 was associated with reduced recurrence risk (univariate HR 0.567, 95% CI 0.339–0.950, P = .031; multivariate HR 0.560, 95% CI 0.317–0.991, P = .047). Clinical translation remains investigational due to limited sample sizes and lack of circulating biomarker detectability, but IHC assessment in tumor tissues is recommended (Zhou et al., 2019; Medicine; published Nov 2019; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000017815) (zhou2019clinicalsignificanceof pages 3-4).
- Therapeutic concepts in cardiology and liver disease: Preclinical AAV‑HINT2 delivery post‑MI and metabolic modulation via NAD+ (e.g., NMN) illustrate potential strategies to support mitochondrial bioenergetics; in hepatic models, restoring HINT2 function or downstream NAD+/SIRT3 pathways mitigated steatosis and improved mitochondrial function (Fan et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13439; Wang et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01445-w) (fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9, wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic integration (apoptosis and bioenergetics): Early work situated HINT2 as a mitochondrial apoptotic sensitizer in liver cancer models, implicating mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation without changes in cytochrome c release or Bcl‑2 phosphorylation under the tested conditions (Martin et al., 2006; Gastroenterology; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7). Later studies connect HINT2 to mitochondrial NAD+ handling and SIRT3‑mediated deacetylation, providing a unifying framework where HINT2 can influence both apoptotic sensitivity and mitochondrial protein acylation states through NAD+ availability (Fan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2025) (fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9, wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).
- Pathway context and transport: The data support a functional link between HINT2 and mitochondrial NAD+ influx mediated by SLC25A51, although direct physical interaction was not detected (implying upstream regulatory control). AMPK emerges as a candidate intermediary modulated by HINT2 in hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01445-w) (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Enzymology and catalytic dependence:
  • AMP‑pNA hydrolysis: kcat 0.0223 ± 0.0031 s−1; Km 128 ± 35 µM; abolished by H149A mutation (Martin et al., 2006; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2006.03.024) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 1-2, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).
- Apoptosis and tumor suppression in vitro/in vivo (hepatoma):
  • Anti‑Fas + actinomycin D viability: 32.2% ± 0.6% (HINT2 OE) vs 57.7% ± 4.6% (control), P < .02; mitochondrial depolarization at 16 h: 87.8% ± 2.3% vs 49.7% ± 1.6%, P < .05; xenograft tumor weight: 0.32 ± 0.13 g vs 0.85 ± 0.35 g, P < .05 (Martin et al., 2006) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).
- HCC prognosis:
  • Recurrence‑free survival HRs: univariate 0.567 (95% CI 0.339–0.950), P = .031; multivariate 0.560 (95% CI 0.317–0.991), P = .047 (Zhou et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000017815) (zhou2019clinicalsignificanceof pages 3-4).
- Metabolic liver disease mechanisms (MASLD):
  • HINT2 loss reduces mitochondrial NAD+ and SIRT3 activity; NMN (500 mg/kg i.p. every 2 days) restored mitochondrial NAD+/SIRT3 activity and improved hepatic lipids in Hint2‑deficient settings. SLC25A51 overexpression lowered cellular triglycerides; SLC25A51 knockdown shifted NAD+ away from mitochondria (Wang et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01445-w) (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).
- Cardioprotection post‑MI and NAD+ handling:
  • HINT2 overexpression improved cardiac ATP, increased mitochondrial NAD+ in hypoxic cardiomyocytes, and reduced apoptosis/fibrosis. HINT2’s benefit required NAMPT or NMN; direct NMN–HINT2 binding supported by biolayer interferometry (Fan et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13439) (fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9).

Disease associations and mechanistic roles beyond HCC
- Colorectal cancer (CRC): HINT2 is downregulated in primary CRC and metastatic lesions, associated with stage progression. Functional experiments showed that HINT2 loss increased migration/invasion and promoted liver metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, HINT2 downregulation induced EMT via HIF‑2α‑dependent transcriptional activation of ZEB1; ZEB1 silencing rescued CDH1 repression and migration/invasion phenotypes (Li et al., 2017; Oncotarget; published Jan 2017; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14587). Note: journal quality caveat applies to Oncotarget publications; findings should be independently validated (li2017hint2downregulationpromotes pages 1-3, li2017hint2downregulationpromotes pages 5-7).
- Metabolic liver disease (steatosis, acetylation): Evidence links HINT2 deficiency to mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation and worsened steatotic phenotypes. Restoring mitochondrial NAD+ and SIRT3 activity ameliorates these outcomes (Wang et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-025-01445-w) (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).
- Cardiac injury: Post‑MI AAV9‑HINT2 delivery improved metabolic and functional outcomes in mice, implicating mitochondrial NAD+ maintenance as a protective mechanism (Fan et al., 2020; https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13439) (fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9).

Clarifications, limitations, and open questions
- MCU/calcium handling: Direct experimental evidence for physical interaction between HINT2 and the MCU complex is not present in the current evidence set. While HINT2’s mitochondrial role suggests potential crosstalk with calcium signaling, specific MCU/HINT2 mechanisms require further study and are not concluded here (no supporting context IDs).
- 2023–2024 update emphasis: Aside from the 2025 mechanistic paper, few 2023–2024 HINT2‑focused primary studies were recoverable in the present context. The core conclusions therefore rely on 2006–2020 primary data and the 2025 mechanistic advance; newer studies should be incorporated as they become available (wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7).

*Table: Concise, evidence‑mapped summary of human HINT2 (UniProt Q9BX68) covering identity, enzymology, localization, functions (apoptosis and mitochondrial NAD/SIRT3 regulation), links to SLC25A51, and disease associations with key quantitative data and sources (context IDs shown).*

Conclusions
Human HINT2 (Q9BX68) is a mitochondrial HIT‑family adenosine 5′‑monophosphoramidase whose activity depends on the histidine triad, with strong expression in liver and pancreas. Functionally, HINT2 sensitizes hepatocytes to apoptosis and regulates mitochondrial bioenergetics by promoting mitochondrial NAD+ availability, SIRT3 activity, and balanced protein acetylation. In cancer, HINT2 is downregulated in HCC and CRC, with prognostic implications in HCC and EMT regulation in CRC via HIF‑2α/ZEB1. In cardiometabolic disease models, augmenting HINT2 improves post‑MI cardiac outcomes and mitigates hepatic steatosis through NAD+/SIRT3 pathways. Together, these findings prioritize HINT2 as a mitochondrial regulator with translational potential in oncology and metabolic/cardiac disease, with current therapeutic hypotheses centered on restoring HINT2 expression or leveraging its NAD+‑linked mechanisms (Martin et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2025) (martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 10-17, martin2006hint2amitochondrial pages 6-7, zhou2019clinicalsignificanceof pages 3-4, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 11-14, fan2020overexpressionofthe pages 6-9, wang2025histidinetriadnucleotidebinding pages 9-11).
