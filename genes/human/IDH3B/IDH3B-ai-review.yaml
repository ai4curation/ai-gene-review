description: >-
  IDH3B encodes the beta subunit of mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3).
  The functional IDH3 enzyme is a heterotetramer with alpha2-beta-gamma stoichiometry (2alpha:1beta:1gamma),
  where the alpha subunits (IDH3A) are catalytic, while beta (IDH3B) and gamma (IDH3G) play structural
  and regulatory roles. IDH3B does NOT have intrinsic catalytic activity on its own - expression of
  beta subunit alone shows no detectable activity [PMID:10601238]. The alphabeta and alphagamma dimers
  exhibit significant IDH activity, but the full heterotetramer is required for maximal activity and
  proper allosteric regulation [PMID:14555658]. The IDH3 complex catalyzes the irreversible oxidative
  decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle. Beta-Arg99 is required for
  normal ADP activation of the enzyme but is not essential for catalysis [PMID:14555658]. IDH3B localizes
  to the mitochondrial matrix. Biallelic variants cause retinitis pigmentosa 46 (RP46). IDH3B exists
  as multiple isoforms (beta1 and beta2) due to alternative splicing, with tissue-specific expression
  patterns affecting the pH optimum of the enzyme complex [PMID:10601238].

      IDH3B is a component of the NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes
      a key step of the TCA cycle. While the beta subunit is not itself catalytic, it is essential
      for proper complex assembly and function in the TCA cycle [PMID:10601238, PMID:14555658].

      This annotation is inferred from InterPro domain IPR019818 (IsoCit/isopropylmalate_DH_CS).
      However, in the IDH3 complex, Mg2+ (or Mn2+) binding occurs at the active site in the
      catalytic alpha subunit, not in the structural beta subunit. The deep research notes
      that the enzyme "is a heterooctamer containing two copies of a heterotetramer of two
      IDH3A, one IDH3B, one IDH3G, and two Mn++" [Reactome:R-HSA-70967], suggesting metal
      binding is associated with the catalytic subunits. No direct evidence supports
      magnesium binding by IDH3B specifically.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      While the InterPro domain is present, the functional magnesium/metal binding site is

core_functions:
- description: >-
    IDH3B functions as a structural/regulatory subunit of the mitochondrial NAD-dependent
    isocitrate dehydrogenase complex. It does not have intrinsic catalytic activity but is
    essential for proper complex assembly, stability, and allosteric regulation. The beta
    subunit contributes to ADP-mediated activation of the enzyme.
