## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O43837
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit beta, mitochondrial; AltName: Full=Isocitric dehydrogenase subunit beta; AltName: Full=NAD(+)-specific ICDH subunit beta; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=IDH3B;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the isocitrate and isopropylmalate
- **Key Domains:** IsoCit/isopropylmalate_DH_CS. (IPR019818); Isocitrate_DH_NAD. (IPR004434); IsoPropMal-DH-like_dom. (IPR024084); Iso_dh (PF00180)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "IDH3B" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'IDH3B' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **IDH3B** (gene ID: IDH3B, UniProt: O43837) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status update: We verified the target identity and collected recent, authoritative sources focused on the human IDH3B subunit of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3). We synthesized functional, mechanistic, localization, regulation, disease, and quantitative data, prioritizing 2022–2024 peer‑reviewed literature where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human IDH3B (UniProt: O43837)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and gene/protein verification: IDH3B encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 complex (IDH3). IDH3 catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha‑ketoglutarate (α‑KG) and CO2, reducing NAD+ to NADH in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. These features distinguish IDH3 (NAD+-dependent, mitochondrial) from IDH1/2 (NADP+-dependent; IDH1 cytosolic/peroxisomal; IDH2 mitochondrial) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387, Sep 2022; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426, Dec 2018; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883, May 2023) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Organism confirmation: All cited primary and review sources explicitly address mammalian/human IDH3 and subunits including IDH3B (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Family/domains alignment: IDH3B belongs to the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 family and carries conserved isocitrate dehydrogenase domains shared with the IsoCit/isopropylmalate_DH clan; the beta subunit plays primarily structural/regulatory roles within the complex (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).

2) Molecular function, reaction, substrate specificity, and localization
- Enzymatic reaction: IDH3 catalyzes isocitrate + NAD+ → α‑KG + CO2 + NADH. Unlike IDH1/2, IDH3 is NAD+-specific and functions in the canonical TCA cycle (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Substrate/cofactor specificity: Substrate is isocitrate; cofactor is NAD+. The reaction is physiologically irreversible in the TCA direction under mitochondrial conditions (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Complex composition/stoichiometry: Functional IDH3 is an α2βγ heterotetramer; α subunits are catalytic, β (IDH3B) contributes structural/assembly functions and influences allosteric regulation, and γ (IDH3G) has key allosteric roles (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Localization: IDH3 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Expression is enriched in mitochondria‑rich tissues (e.g., heart, skeletal muscle, brain, retina) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6).

3) Biochemical pathway context and regulation
- Pathway role: IDH3 is a central, rate‑influencing step of the TCA cycle, producing α‑KG and mitochondrial NADH that fuels oxidative phosphorylation. By managing α‑KG levels, IDH3 impacts α‑KG–dependent dioxygenase activities with downstream epigenetic effects noted in development and reprogramming contexts (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 9-10).
- Regulation/allostery: IDH3 activity is modulated by cellular energy and redox state. Reported activators include citrate/isocitrate, ADP, NAD+, and divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+), while inhibitors include NADH, α‑KG, and ATP; the β and γ subunits set effector sensitivity. Distinct activities have been measured for partial dimers vs. the heterotetramer (α–γ dimer ~36% of tetramer activity; α–β dimer ~16%), indicating subunit‑dependent regulation (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 11-13).

4) Structure–function, assembly, and quantitative data
- Subunit activities and assembly: Biochemical studies demonstrate differing specific activities of αγ and αβ dimers relative to the α2βγ tetramer, consistent with non‑catalytic subunits tuning activity and allosteric responses (α–γ ≈ 36%; α–β ≈ 16% of tetramer) (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 11-13).
- Tissue‑specific compensation: In Idh3b knockout mice, testes show coordinated subunit expression changes (e.g., ~75% reduction in IDH3A and ~35% increase in IDH3G), illustrating tissue‑specific assembly compensation and dependence (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).
- Mitochondrial reserve capacity: Photoreceptor mitochondria operate near their maximal respiratory rate (~70–80%), leaving low reserve; this helps explain retinal vulnerability to partial IDH3 dysfunction (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6).

5) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- 2023 review of mutant IDH and physiology: Comprehensive discussion of IDH family biology emphasizes IDH3’s role in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, subunit functions (α catalytic; β structural; γ allosteric), and lack of canonical tumor‑driver mutations in IDH3 subunits compared to IDH1/2 (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883, May 2023) (solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Developmental/epigenetic context: Emerging work summarized in recent reviews indicates that IDH enzymes (notably IDH3A) can transiently localize to the nucleus during early development/reprogramming, implicating mitochondrial‑nuclear metabolic coupling; although shown for IDH3A, this underscores systems‑level roles of the IDH3 complex composition that includes β (IDH3B) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883, May 2023) (solomou2023mutantidhin pages 9-10).
- 2022 functional genetics in mammals (near‑current and highly relevant): IDH3B is essential for spermiogenesis in mice, with loss causing male infertility but not retinal degeneration, refining tissue‑specific functional annotation of IDH3B (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387, Sep 2022) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).

6) Disease associations, genetics, and clinical relevance
- Inherited retinal disease (IRD): Biallelic IDH3B variants have been reported in families with nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa; experimental mouse Idh3a and human genetics highlight retinal susceptibility to IDH3 perturbation, consistent with high mitochondrial load in photoreceptors (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426, Dec 2018) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6).
- Species differences: Despite human reports, Idh3b−/− mice do not show retinal degeneration or impaired mitochondrial respiration in embryonic fibroblasts through P180, illustrating species and tissue‑specific differences and potential compensation (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426, Dec 2018) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 8-11).
- Spermatogenesis/male infertility: Genetic ablation of Idh3b in mice reveals a critical requirement for spermiogenesis; IDH3B deficiency impairs sperm development and is linked to reduced IDH3A protein and compensatory IDH3G increase in testes (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387, Sep 2022) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).
- Broader clinical context: IDH3 subunit defects (especially IDH3A/IDH3B) are increasingly recognized in IRD gene panels and reviews of metabolic contributions to disease, although IDH3 subunits are not the canonical IDH1/2 cancer drivers (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883, May 2023) (solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).

7) Current applications and implementations
- Diagnostics: Genetic testing for IRDs includes IDH3 subunits in gene panels; assignment of pathogenicity requires careful segregation, functional data, and attention to species‑specific phenotypic differences inferred from model systems (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Research models: Idh3a and Idh3b mouse models provide complementary tools for dissecting retinal bioenergetics and spermatogenesis; extracellular flux assays in mutant fibroblasts illustrate how reserve capacity and maximal respiration are used to profile mitochondrial consequences of subunit loss (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 8-11, zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).

8) Expert opinions/analysis from authoritative sources
- Consensus function: Primary biochemical role and mitochondrial localization of IDH3 (with IDH3B as the β subunit) are well‑established and consistently described in peer‑reviewed primary and review articles (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Regulatory architecture: Subunit architecture underlies nuanced allosteric regulation—γ and β modulate catalytic α activity and effector sensitivity—fitting the broader theme that energy/redox sensing is embedded in IDH3 quaternary structure (https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Disease interpretation: The divergence between human retinal phenotypes and mouse Idh3b retinal viability suggests that in humans, β‑subunit loss reduces functional tetramer abundance/efficacy sufficiently to cross a disease threshold in photoreceptors, whereas mice may compensate via subunit rebalancing or metabolic plasticity (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).

9) Quantitative statistics and data
- Partial dimer activity vs tetramer: αγ dimer ≈ 36% and αβ dimer ≈ 16% of heterotetramer specific activity in vitro, showing the importance of tetramer assembly for full catalytic throughput (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 11-13).
- Photoreceptor bioenergetics: Photoreceptor mitochondria reportedly function at ~70–80% of maximal capacity in vivo, rationalizing sensitivity to reduced IDH3 flux (https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426) (findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6).
- Testis subunit re‑balancing in IDH3B loss: In Idh3b−/− mice, IDH3A decreases by ~75% and IDH3G increases by ~35% in testes, aligning with defective spermiogenesis and suggesting assembly‑dependent stability (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2).

Mandatory verification and ambiguity check
- Gene symbol match and organism: The literature consistently uses IDH3B to denote the β subunit of mitochondrial NAD‑dependent IDH3 in mammals/humans, matching UniProt O43837 and Homo sapiens (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
- Domain/family concordance: Reported function, localization, and complex assembly are coherent with isocitrate dehydrogenase family/domain annotations provided, and no conflicting gene symbol usage was found in the curated sources cited (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102387; https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.036426; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15112883) (zhu2022isocitratedehydrogenase3b pages 1-2, findlay2018mouseidh3amutations pages 4-6, solomou2023mutantidhin pages 1-2).
