# RBFOX3 (NeuN) – Comprehensive Gene Function and GO Annotation Report

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
RBFOX3 (also known as NeuN or Fox-3) encodes an RNA-binding protein of the FOX family that is crucial for neuron-specific pre-mRNA splicing regulation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20member,been%20associated%20with%20numerous%20neurological)). Like its paralogs RBFOX1 and RBFOX2, RBFOX3 contains a central RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain that binds the consensus RNA sequence UGCAUG in target transcripts ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)). Through this sequence-specific binding, RBFOX3 modulates alternative exon inclusion or skipping – a mechanism exemplified by the Numb gene, where RBFOX3 binding to an intronic UGCAUG element represses inclusion of an alternative exon ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)). This splicing switch in Numb pre-mRNA produces an isoform that promotes neuronal differentiation, highlighting RBFOX3’s role as a positive regulator of neuron-specific alternative splicing ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)). In general, RBFOX3 and its family members act as splicing factors that enhance or silence exons in numerous neuronal transcripts, thereby diversifying the proteome of the nervous system and influencing neuronal gene expression programs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5049801/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20hippocampal%20phenotypes%2C%20we,density%2C%20which%20are%20related%20to)). 

Beyond splicing, RBFOX3 may participate in other post-transcriptional processes. Multiple isoforms of RBFOX3 exist, including nuclear and cytoplasmic variants, suggesting distinct functional roles ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=immunoreactivity%20have%20been%20reported%20between,of%20alternative%20splicing%20between%20family)). Indeed, studies have shown that nuclear RBFOX3 isoforms primarily regulate alternative splicing, whereas a cytoplasmic isoform can influence mRNA stability via nonsense-mediated decay (as seen for RBFOX2 mRNA targets) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=,mediated%20decay%20of%20Rbfox2)). RBFOX3 was initially identified by an immunological screen as the NeuN antigen; interestingly, early in vitro experiments indicated NeuN could bind DNA, though its physiological significance as a DNA-binding entity remains unclear ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=to%20the%20nervous%20system%20and,Rbfox3%2FNeuN%20subtypes%20in%20which%20the)). Overall, the key molecular function of RBFOX3 is as an RNA-binding splicing regulator, with the ability to shape neuronal gene expression by controlling the inclusion of specific exons in target mRNAs ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20member,been%20associated%20with%20numerous%20neurological)). This activity is critical for the maturation and function of neurons, as it ensures the production of neuron-specific protein isoforms needed for proper cellular differentiation and synaptic function.  

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
RBFOX3 is predominantly localized to the nucleus of neurons, consistent with its role in pre-mRNA splicing ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=between%20mouse%20,Differences%20in)). Immunostaining with the NeuN antibody (which recognizes an epitope at RBFOX3’s N-terminus) shows strong nuclear labeling in nearly all mature neurons throughout the central nervous system ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)). In these cells, RBFOX3 concentrates in the neuronal nucleus (often excluding the nucleolus) and can also be detected in perikarya – reflecting its presence in the neuronal cell body ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)). Notably, RBFOX3 is **not** expressed in glial cells or neural progenitors, but exclusively in post-mitotic neurons, which is why NeuN immunoreactivity is a definitive marker of neurons in tissue sections ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)). 

Although the bulk of RBFOX3 resides in the nucleus, alternative splicing of the RBFOX3 gene produces multiple protein isoforms with different subcellular distributions ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=immunoreactivity%20have%20been%20reported%20between,of%20alternative%20splicing%20between%20family)). Specifically, two major isoforms (~46 kDa and ~48 kDa) have been observed: the ~46 kDa form is largely nuclear, whereas the slightly larger ~48 kDa isoform is found predominantly in the cytoplasm ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=immunoreactivity%20have%20been%20reported%20between,of%20alternative%20splicing%20between%20family)). This suggests that RBFOX3 shuttling or retention may be modulated by the presence or absence of certain peptide segments. The N-terminus contains the NeuN epitope (amino acids 6–15) and likely a nuclear targeting signal, while the inclusion of an alternate exon in the larger isoform may affect nuclear import or export ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=which%20are%20involved%20in%20regulating,9)) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=immunoreactivity%20have%20been%20reported%20between,of%20alternative%20splicing%20between%20family)). Consequently, a fraction of RBFOX3 protein can localize to the cytoplasm of neurons, where it might engage cytosolic RNA targets or interact with the translation machinery. Indeed, RBFOX3’s cytoplasmic isoform has been implicated in regulating mRNA turnover pathways (e.g. nonsense-mediated decay) in addition to its nuclear splicing role ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=,mediated%20decay%20of%20Rbfox2)). Despite this, the dominant localization of RBFOX3 in most contexts is the neuronal nucleus, aligning with its function as a splicing regulator within the nuclear compartment ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=between%20mouse%20,Differences%20in)).

## Biological Processes Involvement  
RBFOX3 plays a prominent role in several neuronal biological processes. During development, RBFOX3 is essential for proper neuronal differentiation: loss-of-function studies in cell culture and in vivo have demonstrated that RBFOX3 activity drives the maturation of post-mitotic neurons ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=differentiation%20defects,an%20important%20role%20in%20the)). Knockdown of RBFOX3 impairs neuron differentiation (e.g., reduced neurite outgrowth and delayed expression of neuronal markers), whereas normal RBFOX3 promotes the transition of immature neurons into fully differentiated states ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=differentiation%20defects,an%20important%20role%20in%20the)). Mechanistically, this pro-differentiation effect is mediated through alternative splicing of key developmental regulators like Numb, as described above, as well as other targets that influence cell fate decisions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=differentiation%2C%20we%20sought%20to%20determine,selected%20based%20on%20their%20potential)). Thus, **RBFOX3 is a positive regulator of neuronal differentiation**, ensuring that newly generated neurons acquire the correct gene expression profile for maturation. Consistent with this, RBFOX3 expression is low or absent in neural progenitors but strongly upregulated as neurons exit the cell cycle and mature ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=Rbfox3%20is%20required%20for%20neuronal,differentiation%20of%20mouse%20P19%20cells)). 

In the adult brain, RBFOX3 continues to be important for neuronal maintenance, plasticity, and circuit function. RBFOX3 (NeuN) has been implicated in **adult neurogenesis**, particularly in the hippocampus. Mice lacking RBFOX3 show deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, evidenced by reduced proliferation or survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5049801/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20hippocampal%20phenotypes%2C%20we,density%2C%20which%20are%20related%20to)). These mice also exhibit abnormalities in **synaptogenesis** and synaptic plasticity: for example, RBFOX3 knockout leads to altered expression of synapse-related gene isoforms, a decrease in long-term synaptic plasticity, and an increase in dendritic spine density (indicative of aberrant synapse formation) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=anxiety,related%20human%20brain%20disorders)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5049801/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20hippocampal%20phenotypes%2C%20we,density%2C%20which%20are%20related%20to)). Electrophysiological studies in RBFOX3-null mice reveal defective synaptic transmission and an increased frequency of spontaneous excitatory events, associated with an elevated neurotransmitter release probability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=anxiety,related%20human%20brain%20disorders)). This suggests that RBFOX3 normally helps maintain excitatory/inhibitory balance in neural circuits, likely through splicing control of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or synaptic proteins that govern neurotransmission ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=anxiety,related%20human%20brain%20disorders)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142678/#:~:text=based%20on%20co,aminobutyric)). In support of this idea, co-expression network analyses in humans have linked RBFOX3 to genes involved in neurotransmitter release (including GABAergic pathways) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142678/#:~:text=based%20on%20co,aminobutyric)). 

Through its widespread effects on neuronal mRNA processing, RBFOX3 influences higher-order brain functions. RBFOX3-null mice display **cognitive impairments** (for instance, poor performance in memory tests) and behavioral changes such as reduced anxiety-like behavior ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=Our%20study%20in%20Rbfox3,that%20there%20is%20a%20causal)). They are also prone to **seizures**, due to hyperexcitability in hippocampal circuits when RBFOX3 is absent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=Our%20study%20in%20Rbfox3,that%20there%20is%20a%20causal)). These phenotypes underscore RBFOX3’s involvement in maintaining normal learning, memory, and network excitability. Additionally, RBFOX3 may contribute to **neuronal stress responses** or injury pathways, as NeuN immunoreactivity is known to diminish in certain pathological states (e.g. after axonal injury or ischemia) even if neurons are still present ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)). This variability suggests that RBFOX3 expression or epitope availability can change in diseased neurons, a factor to consider when using NeuN as a neuronal marker ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)). In summary, RBFOX3 is engaged in key biological processes including neuron differentiation, adult neurogenesis, synapse formation, and synaptic function/plasticity, all of which collectively support proper neural development and adult brain homeostasis.

## Protein Domains and Structural Features  
RBFOX3 is a relatively small, single-polypeptide protein characterized by a modular domain structure common to the Rbfox family. The human RBFOX3 protein is about 314 amino acids in length and consists of three main regions ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20member,been%20associated%20with%20numerous%20neurological)) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20protein%20is%20highly%20conserved,Differences%20in)): an N-terminal region rich in proline residues, a central RNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal region enriched in alanine residues. The N-terminal **proline-rich segment** (approximately amino acids 1–100) may facilitate protein–protein interactions or contribute to subcellular targeting. Importantly, within the extreme N-terminus (aa 6–15) lies the NeuN antigenic epitope recognized by the classic anti-NeuN antibody ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20%28also%20known%20as%20Fox,The)). This epitope’s location in a low-complexity region might explain why certain NeuN antibodies fail to detect some isoforms or certain physiological states of the protein ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)).  

The central **RNA Recognition Motif (RRM)** is the defining feature of RBFOX3, spanning roughly 90 amino acids (the core RRM domain is ~77 aa) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=as%20an%20epitope%2C%20NeuN%20is,9)). This RRM domain folds into the conserved βαββαβ structure that binds RNA, and it is highly conserved among RBFOX family members. In fact, the RRM amino acid sequence of RBFOX3 is almost identical to that of RBFOX1 and RBFOX2 – differing by only 4 residues – indicating strong evolutionary pressure to maintain its RNA-binding function ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=as%20an%20epitope%2C%20NeuN%20is,9)). The RRM directly recognizes the sequence UGCAUG in target RNAs, predominantly via its RNP1 and RNP2 submotifs that contact the guanosine and uridine bases ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)). Structural and biochemical studies of the RBFOX1 RRM bound to RNA have shown how this domain specifically latches onto the UGCAUG element ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=spinal%20cord%20revealed%20that%20Rbfox3,UGCAUG%20element%20in%20the%20upstream)), and RBFOX3 is expected to bind identically given the near-identical RRM sequence. Flanking the RRM, RBFOX3 has short linker regions that may contribute to RNA binding affinity and specificity, or mediate interactions with other splicing factors. 

The C-terminus of RBFOX3 contains an **alanine-rich region** (poly-Ala and Ala/Gly stretches) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=This%20gene%20encodes%20a%20member,been%20associated%20with%20numerous%20neurological)). This C-terminal tail is intrinsically disordered and may enable RBFOX3 to engage in multivalent interactions or phase-separated nuclear bodies. In RBFOX1 and RBFOX2, the equivalent region contains a **Tyrosine-rich motif** that mediates self-aggregation and assembly into a larger splicing regulatory complex (the LASR complex) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27104978/#:~:text=LASR%20pubmed,protein%20interactions.%20We%20find)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5553710/#:~:text=tyrosine,deletion%20mutants%20of%20Rbfox1%20tagged)). RBFOX3 likely shares this ability: its C-terminal low-complexity domain can facilitate incorporation into multi-protein complexes required for splicing regulation. Indeed, RBFOX proteins are known to function as part of a large spliceosomal assembly (the Large Assembly of Splicing Regulators) via their C-termini, interacting with other splicing co-factors to exert their effects on exon inclusion ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27104978/#:~:text=LASR%20pubmed,protein%20interactions.%20We%20find)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5553710/#:~:text=tyrosine,deletion%20mutants%20of%20Rbfox1%20tagged)). In summary, RBFOX3’s structure – comprising an RRM flanked by disordered regions – is well-suited for its role as a splicing factor, providing both sequence-specific RNA binding and flexible interaction interfaces to recruit or stabilize the splicing machinery at target pre-mRNAs.

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Given its neuron-specific expression and critical role in regulating neuronal gene networks, it is not surprising that RBFOX3 has been linked to several neurological conditions. **Mutations in RBFOX3 have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=gene%20has%20its%20highest%20expression,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20May%202017)).** Notably, rare loss-of-function variants in RBFOX3 have been identified in epilepsy patients. A study of Rolandic epilepsy (a common idiopathic focal epilepsy in children) found a de novo nonsense mutation in RBFOX3 (p.Tyr287*) and an exon 3 deletion, among other RBFOX-family mutations, in patients ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039908/#:~:text=3%20of%20RBFOX3,variants%20were%20inherited%20from%20unaffected)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039908/#:~:text=no%20deleterious%20mutations%20of%20RBFOX1,that%20exon%20deletions%20and%20truncating)). These RBFOX3 truncating variants were absent in large control cohorts, suggesting RBFOX3 dysfunction as a novel genetic risk factor for epilepsy ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039908/#:~:text=no%20deleterious%20mutations%20of%20RBFOX1,that%20exon%20deletions%20and%20truncating)). RBFOX3 haploinsufficiency or loss could lead to imbalanced splicing of neuronal excitability genes, predisposing individuals to seizures – consistent with the seizure phenotype observed in Rbfox3-knockout mice ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=Our%20study%20in%20Rbfox3,that%20there%20is%20a%20causal)). Indeed, RBFOX3-null mice show spontaneous epileptic activity and lowered seizure threshold, providing a mechanistic link between RBFOX3 disruption and epilepsy ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664964/#:~:text=Our%20study%20in%20Rbfox3,that%20there%20is%20a%20causal)). Beyond Rolandic epilepsy, truncating or copy number mutations in the related RBFOX1 gene have been implicated in generalized epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental syndromes, emphasizing that proper dosage of RBFOX-family proteins is crucial for neural circuit stability ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039908/#:~:text=no%20deleterious%20mutations%20of%20RBFOX1,that%20exon%20deletions%20and%20truncating)). 

RBFOX3 has also emerged in genetic studies of sleep and cognition. A large human genome-wide association study identified common polymorphisms in the RBFOX3 locus that are significantly associated with **sleep latency**, i.e. the time it takes to fall asleep ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142678/#:~:text=including%204242%20individuals,and%20the%20central%20nervous%20system)). Three highly correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in RBFOX3 showed genome-wide significance for longer sleep latency (P ~10^−8), and follow-up analysis across ~30,000 individuals confirmed this association ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142678/#:~:text=including%204242%20individuals,and%20the%20central%20nervous%20system)). While the precise mechanism is unknown, co-expression data suggest RBFOX3 might influence neuronal circuits that regulate sleep onset, possibly through modulation of neurotransmitter release (including GABAergic signaling) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142678/#:~:text=based%20on%20co,aminobutyric)). This finding points toward a role for RBFOX3 in sleep physiology and aligns with the protein’s involvement in synaptic function. Additionally, RBFOX3/NeuN levels or localization have been noted to change in certain neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric conditions. For example, in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, RBFOX3 (NeuN) mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been observed in affected neurons ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215932/#:~:text=Altered%20subcellular%20localization%20of%20the,contrast%20to%20its%20widely%20reported)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=%2A%20Chronic%20HIV,related%20effects)), which could disrupt normal splicing of neuron-specific transcripts. There is also interest in RBFOX3’s role in disorders like autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, given that RBFOX1/2 are known autism risk genes and all three RBFOX proteins regulate overlapping sets of neuronal transcripts ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34599184/#:~:text=Rett%20syndrome%20linked%20to%20defects,p%20%3C%200.01)). Some patients with neurodevelopmental delay have been reported with chromosomal anomalies affecting the RBFOX3 gene region ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766065/#:~:text=Intragenic%20deletion%20of%20RBFOX1%20associated,F8%20were%20identified%20in%20Patient)), though clear causal links for RBFOX3 in autism or intellectual disability remain to be fully established. 

In summary, RBFOX3 dysfunction – whether through rare mutations or altered expression – is linked to **neurological phenotypes** including epilepsy, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and possibly neurodevelopmental disorders ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=146713#:~:text=gene%20has%20its%20highest%20expression,provided%20by%20RefSeq%2C%20May%202017)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039908/#:~:text=no%20deleterious%20mutations%20of%20RBFOX1,that%20exon%20deletions%20and%20truncating)). These associations underscore the gene’s importance for normal neuronal function. Clinically, RBFOX3 (NeuN) is also used as a **neuronal injury marker**: loss of NeuN staining in neurons can indicate degeneration or severe stress (as seen in stroke or trauma models), reflecting either protein downregulation or epitope masking ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)). Thus, RBFOX3 serves as both a functional player in disease mechanisms and a practical marker in neuropathology.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
**Tissue specificity:** RBFOX3 is overwhelmingly specific to the nervous system. It is almost exclusively expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, with virtually no expression in non-neural tissues ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=between%20mouse%20,Differences%20in)). High RBFOX3 mRNA and protein levels are detected in brain regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum (caudate/putamen), cerebellum, and spinal cord – essentially, RBFOX3 marks mature neurons across the brain and spinal cord gray matter ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=between%20mouse%20,Differences%20in)). This neuron-specific expression is so consistent that NeuN immunostaining is routinely used to identify neurons in histological sections. In contrast, glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia) and neural progenitor/stem cells do not express RBFOX3/NeuN ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)). Hence, RBFOX3 serves as a binary marker distinguishing neurons from other cell types in the CNS.  

**Developmental expression:** RBFOX3 expression is tightly linked to neuronal differentiation. During embryonic development, Rbfox3 transcripts are low or absent in neural stem cells but are upregulated as neurons are born and undergo terminal differentiation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=Rbfox3%20is%20required%20for%20neuronal,differentiation%20of%20mouse%20P19%20cells)). For instance, in **mouse embryos**, Rbfox3 (NeuN) becomes detectable in post-mitotic neurons of the spinal cord and brain at the stage when they exit the cell cycle and start expressing pan-neuronal markers like β-III tubulin ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=Rbfox3%20is%20required%20for%20neuronal,differentiation%20of%20mouse%20P19%20cells)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=Impaired%20neuronal%20differentiation%20after%20Rbfox3,Sections)). In vitro, when pluripotent cells or neural precursors are induced to differentiate into neurons (e.g., via retinoic acid treatment in P19 cell models), Rbfox3 is one of the genes strongly induced during the transition from progenitor to neuron ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=Rbfox3%20is%20required%20for%20neuronal,differentiation%20of%20mouse%20P19%20cells)). This timing reinforces the concept that RBFOX3 is part of the gene expression program defining neuronal identity. Once expressed, RBFOX3 tends to remain stable in neurons throughout adulthood – it is considered a **constitutive marker of mature neurons** under normal conditions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=Neuronal%20nuclei%20,and%20even%20absent%20during%20certain)). The protein persists in aging neurons as well, indicating that its expression is maintained long-term in non-dividing neuronal cells. 

**Regulation of expression:** The transcriptional regulation of RBFOX3 is less well characterized than that of some other neuron-specific genes, but it likely involves neuron-specific transcription factors and chromatin states. Given the restricted expression, the RBFOX3 gene promoter may have binding sites for neuronal fate determinants (such as NEUROD, RCORs, or SOX family members) and could be epigenetically repressed in non-neural tissues. Alternative splicing of RBFOX3 pre-mRNA gives rise to its multiple isoforms; interestingly, there is evidence of **auto-regulation** within the RBFOX family whereby RBFOX proteins can bind to their own or each other’s transcripts to influence splicing. For example, RBFOX3 and RBFOX2 have been reported to cross-regulate splicing of each other’s mRNAs, forming a feedback loop in neurons ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=,mediated%20decay%20of%20Rbfox2)). Additionally, **post-translational modifications** might regulate RBFOX3’s stability or localization. Some observations suggest NeuN exists as two bands on SDS-PAGE (46–48 kDa) due not only to splicing isoforms but possibly phosphorylation differences ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=immunoreactivity%20have%20been%20reported%20between,of%20alternative%20splicing%20between%20family)). Phosphorylation state changes could alter RBFOX3’s interaction with RNA or other proteins, thereby modulating its splicing activity in response to signaling pathways. 

**Pathological changes:** Although RBFOX3 is generally stably expressed, certain conditions can alter its levels. Neuronal injury or stress can lead to a reduction or loss of NeuN immunoreactivity, as noted in ischemic brain damage and axotomy studies ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)). This loss might reflect proteolytic degradation of RBFOX3, transcriptional downregulation, or a conformational change that hides the NeuN epitope. For example, after severe axonal injury, affected neurons temporarily lose NeuN staining even if they survive, indicating a change in RBFOX3 expression or structure in response to trauma ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25680637/#:~:text=diseases%20and%20specific%20physiological%20states,in%20certain%20diseases%20and%20specific)). Also, neurodegenerative diseases may impact RBFOX3: some reports in Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease models note neurons with diminished NeuN despite being morphologically intact, possibly corresponding to functional silencing of those cells. In sum, RBFOX3 is a robust marker of neuronal identity under normal conditions, with tightly controlled expression from the point of neuron birth onward, though extreme stressors can downregulate this gene as part of a pathological response.

## Evolutionary Conservation  
RBFOX3 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, reflecting its fundamental role in neuron-specific RNA regulation. Orthologs of RBFOX3 are present in all mammals and show strong sequence similarity. Mouse Rbfox3, for instance, shares about **84% amino acid identity with human RBFOX3**, and nearly 99% identity with rat Rbfox3 ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20protein%20is%20highly%20conserved,Differences%20in)). This high degree of conservation is especially pronounced in functional domains: the RNA-recognition motif and flanking regions are almost identical between species, underscoring the importance of those sequences for RBFOX3’s splicing function. The RBFOX family as a whole is evolutionarily ancient – the “Fox-1” proteins were originally identified in **C. elegans** (the family name comes from a *Caenorhabditis elegans* gene, fox-1, which also binds the UGCAUG RNA motif) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20%28also%20known%20as%20Fox,The)). In vertebrates, this family expanded into three paralogous genes (RBFOX1, RBFOX2, RBFOX3), likely via gene duplications that allowed tissue specialization. RBFOX3 appears to have diverged to specialize in neuronal functions, whereas RBFOX1 and RBFOX2 have broader expression (RBFOX1 is abundant in brain, heart, and muscle; RBFOX2 is ubiquitous). Despite this divergence in expression patterns, all three proteins retain the core RRM domain and recognize the same RNA sequence element ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=as%20an%20epitope%2C%20NeuN%20is,9)). The few amino acid differences in RBFOX3’s RRM compared to RBFOX1/2 do not change its RNA-binding specificity, but they could fine-tune its protein interactions or regulation in neurons ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=as%20an%20epitope%2C%20NeuN%20is,9)). 

Outside of mammals, RBFOX3 counterparts can be found in other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, where they are expected to perform similar roles in neuronal gene splicing. For example, in **chicken**, an RBFOX3 homolog is expressed in differentiating neurons during development, analogous to the pattern seen in mammals ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575530/#:~:text=differentiation%2C%20we%20sought%20to%20determine,selected%20based%20on%20their%20potential)). In **Drosophila** and other invertebrates, there is generally a single Rbfox gene (often termed A2bp1 or Rbfox1) that combines functions equivalent to all three mammalian RBFOX proteins ([www.sdbonline.org](https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/FLY/genebrief/rbfox_a2bp1.htm#:~:text=RNA,shows%20that%20cytoplasmic%20Rbfox1%20is)). The fruit fly Rbfox1 (A2bp1) is expressed in neurons and muscle and has been shown to regulate splicing of transcripts involved in neuromuscular function ([www.sdbonline.org](https://www.sdbonline.org/sites/FLY/genebrief/rbfox_a2bp1.htm#:~:text=RNA,shows%20that%20cytoplasmic%20Rbfox1%20is)). Similarly, **zebrafish** possess fox1 and fox2 homologs that likely cover RBFOX3-like roles in neural tissues. The strong conservation of RBFOX3’s sequence and the phenotypes observed when it is disrupted (in mice or human patients) both indicate that this gene has been under **purifying selection** across evolution. Its neuron-specific expression and vital splicing regulatory function have been preserved from early vertebrates to humans. Evolution may have tuned RBFOX3’s non-core regions (like the proline- and alanine-rich ends) for specialized interactions in mammalian neurons, but the central RNA-binding function is a constant. Thus, RBFOX3 exemplifies a highly conserved neuronally expressed regulator, with homologous proteins performing analogous roles in managing RNA splicing in the nervous systems of diverse species ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20protein%20is%20highly%20conserved,Differences%20in)) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/t/rbfox3-neun/proteins-enzymes#:~:text=Rbfox3%20%28also%20known%20as%20Fox,The)).
