description: RBFOX3 (RNA Binding Protein Fox-1 Homolog 3) is a neuronal-specific RNA-binding
  protein (~314 amino acids) that regulates alternative splicing in the central nervous
  system. Also known as NeuN (Neuronal nuclei antigen), it serves as a definitive
  marker for post-mitotic neurons and is critical for neuronal differentiation, adult
  neurogenesis, and synaptic function. Contains a highly conserved RNA recognition  motif
  (RRM) that binds to UGCAUG sequences in pre-mRNA. Functions both as an activator
  and repressor of alternative  splicing in a position-dependent manner. Alternative
  splicing produces nuclear (~46 kDa) and cytoplasmic (~48 kDa)  isoforms with distinct
  functions. Essential for maintaining excitatory/inhibitory balance in neural circuits.
