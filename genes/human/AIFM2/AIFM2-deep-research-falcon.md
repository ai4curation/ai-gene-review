## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9BRQ8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:31634899, ECO:0000303|PubMed:31634900}; Short=FSP1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:31634899, ECO:0000303|PubMed:31634900}; EC=1.6.5.- {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31634899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31634900, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35922516}; AltName: Full=Apoptosis-inducing factor homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11980907}; Short=AMID {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11980907}; AltName: Full=p53-responsive gene 3 protein {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12135761};
- **Gene Information:** Name=AIFM2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:26689472, ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:21411}; Synonyms=AMID {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11980907}, PRG3 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12135761};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase family.
- **Key Domains:** FAD/NAD-bd_sf. (IPR036188); FAD/NAD-binding_dom. (IPR023753); Pyr_redox_2 (PF07992)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "AIFM2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'AIFM2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **AIFM2** (gene ID: AIFM2, UniProt: Q9BRQ8) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: AIFM2/FSP1 (Human; UniProt Q9BRQ8)

Identity and definitions
- Verification: AIFM2 (aliases AMID/PRG3) encodes a human FAD-dependent oxidoreductase renamed ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) for its role in suppressing ferroptosis independently of GPX4. Organism: Homo sapiens. Protein family/domains: FAD/NAD(P)H-binding oxidoreductase fold consistent with FAD/NAD-binding domains; structural studies confirm this architecture (Nature Communications, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41626-7) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9). The discovery paper established FSP1 as a glutathione-independent ferroptosis suppressor (Nature, Oct 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1707-0) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Ferroptosis: iron-dependent cell death driven by phospholipid peroxidation of PUFA-containing membranes. Cells deploy parallel antioxidant systems: GPX4/GSH and a GPX4-independent FSP1–CoQ system; expert reviews and guidelines position FSP1 as a principal non-GPX4 defense (Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, Feb 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00703-5; Nat Cell Biol guideline, Feb 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-024-01360-8) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).

Primary biochemical function (enzyme, substrates, products)
- Reaction: NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of membrane-embedded ubiquinone (CoQ10) to ubiquinol (CoQ10H2), which acts as a radical-trapping antioxidant to terminate lipid peroxyl radicals, thereby suppressing ferroptosis (Nature, 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9).
- Substrate specificity: FSP1 reduces ubiquinone analogs; dehydroascorbate, oxidized glutathione, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide are not substrates in tested assays (Nature, 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9).
- Vitamin K reduction: FSP1 can also reduce vitamin K to its hydroquinone (VKH2), establishing a non-canonical vitamin K redox cycle relevant to ferroptosis suppression; vitamin K species protect against GPX4-loss ferroptosis in cells and in vivo (summarized in 2022 review and 2023–2024 expert sources) (Molecular Biomedicine, Nov 2022, https://doi.org/10.1186/s43556-022-00105-z; Cell Metabolism, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2023.06.014; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 2024) (zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 1-3, deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).

Subcellular localization and determinants
- N-myristoylation at the N-terminus is essential for anti-ferroptotic function and membrane targeting; mutation (G2A) or N-myristoyltransferase inhibition (IMP-1088) abolishes protection (Nature, 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9, doll2019fsp1isa pages 14-18).
- Localization: enriched at the plasma membrane, periphery of lipid droplets, and partially overlapping ER/Golgi; membrane association is needed for suppressing lipid peroxidation at the cell boundary (2019 primary; 2022 review) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 1-3).

Structural and mechanistic insights (2023 update)
- Domain architecture: distinct FAD-binding and NAD(P)H-binding domains plus a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) unique to FSP1 (Nature Communications, Sep 2023) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2).
- Dimerization: CTD mediates functional homodimerization; dimer formation creates two active centers on opposite sides of FAD—one for ubiquinone reduction, the other for a unique FAD hydroxylation reaction (Nature Communications, Sep 2023) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9).
- 6‑hydroxy‑FAD: In vitro, FSP1 can generate H2O2 and convert bound FAD to 6‑hydroxy‑FAD under oxygen and NAD(P)H; 6‑hydroxy‑FAD acts as an active cofactor that directly inhibits ferroptosis in cells (Nature Communications, Sep 2023) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9).

Regulation of FSP1 abundance and activity
- Myristoylation: prerequisite for membrane localization and activity (Nature, 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9, doll2019fsp1isa pages 14-18).
- Ubiquitination: RNF126 is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates FSP1 at defined lysine clusters; RNF126 loss reduces FSP1 plasma-membrane localization and increases the CoQ/CoQH2 ratio, sensitizing to ferroptosis in medulloblastoma models (Oncogene, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-024-02949-x) (xie2024rnf126mediatedubiquitinationof pages 1-4).
- Cofactor/stability coupling: FSP1 is a FAD-binding oxidoreductase; FAD availability and binding promote stability, while FAD-free FSP1 is targeted for ubiquitin–proteasome degradation (bioRxiv, Aug 2025, https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.05.668752) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 13-17). (Note: preprint; mechanistic alignment with FAD-dependent oxidoreductase biology.)

Pathway context and related processes
- GPX4-independent ferroptosis suppression: FSP1/CoQ10/NAD(P)H axis forms a parallel membrane antioxidant system; COQ2 loss diminishes FSP1 protection, supporting CoQ dependence (Nature, 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9, doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5).
- Vitamin K axis in ferroptosis: p53–VKORC1L1 regulation links vitamin K metabolism to tumor suppression and ferroptosis responses; FSP1 provides vitamin K reduction to VKH2 as an anti-ferroptotic route (Cell Metabolism, Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2023.06.014; Nat Cell Biol guideline, 2024) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).
- ESCRT-III membrane repair: FSP1 promotes ESCRT-III–dependent membrane repair (CHMP5/CHMP6), constituting an additional anti-ferroptotic mechanism beyond CoQ reduction (Molecular Biomedicine, Nov 2022, https://doi.org/10.1186/s43556-022-00105-z) (zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 1-3).

Recent developments (prioritized 2023–2024)
- Structural mechanism (2023): dimerization-dependent dual active sites and 6‑hydroxy‑FAD formation; mechanistic promiscuity for CoQ and vitamin K reduction, clarifying catalytic basis for ferroptosis suppression (Nature Communications, Sep 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41626-7) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9).
- Ubiquitination control (2024): RNF126 directs FSP1 ubiquitination that maintains plasma membrane localization and anti-ferroptotic CoQH2 pools in pediatric brain tumors (Oncogene, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-024-02949-x) (xie2024rnf126mediatedubiquitinationof pages 1-4).
- Vitamin K/p53 axis (2023–2024): VKORC1L1 upregulation by p53 supports vitamin K metabolism for ferroptosis control; non-canonical vitamin K cycle including FSP1 highlighted by reviews/guidelines (Cell Metabolism, Aug 2023; Nat Cell Biol, 2024) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).
- Drug repurposing (2024): Temsirolimus directly inhibits FSP1 enzymatic activity to induce ferroptosis and synergizes with GPX4 inhibition in liver cancer models (J Mol Cell Biol, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjae036) (tian2024temsirolimusinhibitsfsp1 pages 2-5).
- Inhibitor landscape and species selectivity (2024): First-generation inhibitor iFSP1 shows species-selective engagement; mechanistic characterization provides guidance for second-generation inhibitor design and for interpreting murine efficacy studies (da Silva et al., 2024) (silva20242.4manuscriptiva pages 104-108).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology combinations: In vitro and in vivo data show that inhibiting FSP1 (genetically or pharmacologically) can convert GPX4-resistant contexts to ferroptosis-sensitive, including synergy of temsirolimus with RSL3 in liver cancer models (J Mol Cell Biol, 2024) (tian2024temsirolimusinhibitsfsp1 pages 2-5).
- Prognostic/biomarker potential: Clinical pathology study in lung adenocarcinoma links GPX4/FSP1/4‑HNE expression patterns to prognosis; low FSP1 associates with unfavorable relapse-free survival, motivating ferroptosis-based strategies (Cancers, Nov 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16223888) (zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 3-3).
- Non-ferroptosis function affecting therapy: In BRCA-proficient ovarian cancer, FSP1 inhibition (iFSP1) enhances olaparib sensitivity through a non-ferroptotic mechanism by disrupting Ku70 PARylation and DNA-PKcs recruitment at double-strand breaks; combination shows synergy in organoids and xenografts (Cell Death Differentiation, Feb 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-024-01263-z) (xie2024rnf126mediatedubiquitinationof pages 1-4).

Expert opinions and authoritative guidance
- Cell biology and therapeutic framing: 2024 reviews/guidelines emphasize FSP1 as a membrane oxidoreductase that regenerates CoQ and vitamin K hydroquinones to stop lipid peroxidation, operating alongside GPX4, and highlight the therapeutic promise of targeting FSP1 in cancer while considering systemic risks (Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, Feb 2024; Nat Cell Biol guideline, Feb 2024) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).

Relevant quantitative/statistical data and phenotypes
- Dependency and resistance correlations: Across large cancer cell panels, higher FSP1 expression correlates with resistance to ferroptosis inducers, whereas low FSP1 correlates with GPX4 dependency; FSP1 knockout sensitizes cells to RSL3; combined GPX4+FSP1 deletion slows xenograft growth, whereas GPX4 deletion alone may not, depending on context (Nature, Oct 2019) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 5-9, doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5).
- Clinical association: In lung adenocarcinoma cohorts, low FSP1 expression was associated with worse relapse-free survival, supporting biomarker development for ferroptosis-targeted strategies (Cancers, Nov 2024) (zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 3-3).
- Pharmacology: Temsirolimus-induced ferroptosis in GPX4-defective liver cancer cells is FSP1-dependent; combination with RSL3 robustly increases lipid peroxidation and suppresses tumor progression in xenograft models (J Mol Cell Biol, Sep 2024) (tian2024temsirolimusinhibitsfsp1 pages 2-5).

Notes on localization/biophysics and catalysis
- Membrane proximity is integral to function; N-myristoylation positions FSP1 for reduction of membrane CoQ pools at the plasma membrane and possibly lipid droplets; inhibition or mutation of the myristoylation site abolishes protection (Nature, 2019; Molecular Biomedicine, 2022) (doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 1-3).
- Structural catalysis supports two-electron transfer from NAD(P)H via FAD to quinone substrates (CoQ, vitamin K) and a coupled oxygen-reduction chemistry that can yield 6‑hydroxy‑FAD, proposed to contribute to ferroptosis suppression (Nature Communications, 2023) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 8-9).

Therapeutic targeting and tool compounds
- iFSP1/icFSP1: First-generation FSP1 inhibitors (e.g., iFSP1) sensitize to ferroptosis but show species-selective target engagement; use with caution in murine systems and prioritize human-targeted development (2024 mechanistic characterization) (silva20242.4manuscriptiva pages 104-108).
- Temsirolimus: FDA-approved mTOR inhibitor repurposed as a direct FSP1 enzyme inhibitor; demonstrates synergy with GPX4 inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy in liver cancer models (J Mol Cell Biol, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjae036) (tian2024temsirolimusinhibitsfsp1 pages 2-5).
- Strategic combinations: Reviews/guidelines recommend dual targeting of GPX4 and FSP1 systems to overcome redundancy in ferroptosis defenses, with attention to tissue risks (Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 2024; Nat Cell Biol guideline, 2024) (deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35).

Compliance with identification safeguards
- Symbol/organism verification: All cited mechanistic and structural work refers to human AIFM2/FSP1 or closely homologous orthologs; structural findings from Gallus gallus FSP1 are applied mechanistically to human AIFM2 given high conservation and validation in human cells (Nature Communications, 2023) (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2). The protein family and domain assignments (FAD/NAD-binding oxidoreductase) align with UniProt descriptors provided by the user (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5).

Conclusion
AIFM2/FSP1 is a human FAD-dependent, N-myristoylated membrane oxidoreductase that dimerizes to create dual active sites for quinone reduction and FAD hydroxylation. It suppresses ferroptosis by regenerating reduced CoQ and vitamin K hydroquinones at membranes, functioning in parallel to GPX4. Its activity and localization are governed by myristoylation and ubiquitination (e.g., RNF126), with structural data clarifying catalysis and emerging pharmacology (temsirolimus, iFSP1) enabling therapeutic strategies that combine FSP1 inhibition with GPX4 inhibitors or DNA repair modulators. Clinical-pathologic correlations support biomarker potential, and expert guidance underscores both promise and the need for careful risk management when translating ferroptosis therapies (lv2023structuralinsightsinto pages 1-2, doll2019fsp1isa pages 1-5, xie2024rnf126mediatedubiquitinationof pages 1-4, tian2024temsirolimusinhibitsfsp1 pages 2-5, deol2025vitaminb2metabolism pages 30-35, zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 3-3, zeng2022theantiferroptoticrole pages 1-3).
