description: FSP1 (Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1, formerly AMID/PRG3) is an FAD-dependent,
  N-myristoylated membrane oxidoreductase that functions as a major glutathione-independent
  suppressor of ferroptosis. FSP1 catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of ubiquinone
  (CoQ10) to ubiquinol and vitamin K to its hydroquinone form (VKH2), both of which
  act as potent radical-trapping antioxidants to prevent phospholipid peroxidation
  at cellular membranes. FSP1 operates in parallel to GPX4 as a second major defense
  against ferroptosis. N-myristoylation targets FSP1 to the plasma membrane and lipid
  droplets where it performs its anti-ferroptotic function. The original characterization
  as a pro-apoptotic factor (AMID) from early studies has been largely superseded
  by the discovery of its primary role in ferroptosis suppression.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: FSP1 is now recognized as the primary glutathione-independent ferroptosis
      suppressor, acting in parallel to GPX4 (PMID:31634899, PMID:31634900). This
      function was definitively established in 2019 and represents the core biological
      role of the protein. The IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference is consistent
      with extensive experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary biological function of FSP1. Multiple high-quality
      studies demonstrate that FSP1 suppresses ferroptosis by regenerating ubiquinol
      and vitamin K hydroquinone as radical-trapping antioxidants (PMID:31634899,
      PMID:31634900, PMID:35922516).

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation derives from the early characterization of AIFM2 as
      AMID in 2002 (PMID:11980907), before the discovery of ferroptosis and FSP1''s
      primary role. UniProt notes explicitly: "Conflicting data exist on the pro-apoptotic
      function of the protein. It was initially claimed that overexpression of FSP1
      induces caspase-independent apoptosis, but new evidence disputes this function."'
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While overexpression studies showed apoptotic phenotypes (PMID:11980907),
      this likely represents an artifact of overexpression or a minor function. The
      primary function of FSP1 is now firmly established as ferroptosis suppression.
      However, some literature suggests FSP1 may have context-dependent roles in cell
      death pathways, so complete removal is not warranted.

  review:
    summary: Early studies localized AMID to mitochondria (PMID:11980907), hence the
      name "mitochondrion-associated." However, the current understanding is that
      FSP1 primarily localizes to the plasma membrane and lipid droplets via N-myristoylation,
      where it performs its anti-ferroptotic function (PMID:31634899, PMID:31634900).
      The mitochondrial localization may represent a minor pool or overexpression
      artifact.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While some studies showed mitochondrial localization, the primary functional
      location of FSP1 is at the plasma membrane and lipid droplets. The N-myristoylation
      that targets FSP1 to membranes is essential for its anti-ferroptotic function.
      Mitochondrial association may be context-dependent or represent a minor pool.

  review:
    summary: This annotation from phylogenetic inference reflects the early AMID characterization
      (PMID:11980907, PMID:12135761). UniProt explicitly notes conflicting data on
      the pro-apoptotic function. The overexpression-based pro-apoptotic phenotype
      has not been validated as a physiological function, and FSP1's primary role
      is now established as ANTI-ferroptotic (which prevents a form of cell death).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The pro-apoptotic function was based on overexpression studies from 2002
      before ferroptosis was discovered. Current understanding is that FSP1 prevents
      cell death by suppressing ferroptosis. The apoptotic function is disputed in
      the literature and likely represents an overexpression artifact.

      transfer from electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) to ubiquinone in the

      K reductase that acts at the plasma membrane, not in mitochondrial respiration.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0004174 is the incorrect term for FSP1's activity. FSP1 reduces ubiquinone
      directly using NAD(P)H, not via ETF. The correct term is GO:0016655 "oxidoreductase

      functional dimerization and the formation of two active sites on either side

    reason: While correct, this general term is subsumed by the more specific GO:0016655

    summary: This annotation is INCORRECT. FSP1 is NOT part of the mitochondrial respiratory

      the electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase activity annotation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: FSP1 does not function in the respiratory electron transport chain. Its

suggested_experiments:
- description: Membrane fractionation with FSP1 activity assays to determine the relative
    contribution of plasma membrane vs lipid droplet pools to overall FSP1 function.
  hypothesis: Plasma membrane-localized FSP1 provides the majority of ferroptosis
    protection under normal conditions, while lipid droplet-localized FSP1 may be
    more important under lipotoxic stress.
- description: Kinetic comparison of FSP1 activity toward CoQ vs vitamin K substrates

  hypothesis: FSP1 preferentially reduces CoQ under normal conditions but may switch
    to vitamin K reduction when CoQ is limiting or under specific stress conditions.
