description: 'CRISP3 encodes a cysteine-rich secretory protein that is primarily localized
  to specific and tertiary granules in neutrophils and eosinophils. It is secreted
  into extracellular fluids including plasma, saliva, seminal plasma, and exocrine
  secretions. CRISP3 plays a role in innate immune response and is also expressed
  in reproductive tissues. The protein contains characteristic CAP and ion channel
  regulator domains.'

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for extracellular space is strongly supported by 
      multiple experimental studies showing CRISP3 in plasma, saliva, seminal 
      plasma, sweat, and as a secreted protein from neutrophil granules.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Multiple experimental studies confirm CRISP3 is secreted into 
      extracellular fluids. PMID:12009203 detected CRISP3 in human plasma (6.3 
      μg/ml), saliva (21.8 μg/ml), seminal plasma (11.2 μg/ml), and sweat (0.15 
      μg/ml). PMID:8601434 characterized it as a secretory protein. 
      PMID:12223513 demonstrated it is released from neutrophil granules. The 
      IBA annotation at the extracellular space level is appropriate and 
      specific.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for extracellular region is correct but less 
      specific than the more precise GO:0005615 (extracellular space) 
      annotation. This broader term is acceptable as an IEA annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The protein is indeed located in the extracellular region. However, 
      this term is less specific than GO:0005615 (extracellular space), which is
      supported by IBA and experimental evidence. Since this is an automated IEA
      annotation and the more specific term is already present, this broader 
      annotation is acceptable but redundant with better annotations.

  review:
    summary: NAS annotation for defense response is based on CRISP3 expression 
      pattern in chronic pancreatitis and its classification as a 
      defense-associated molecule. However, this is too broad - the more 
      specific GO:0045087 (innate immune response) is better supported.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: PMID:12647793 identifies CRISP3 as a "defense-associated molecule" 
      and shows upregulation in chronic pancreatitis, suggesting a defensive 
      role. However, this is a very broad term. The evidence from neutrophil and
      eosinophil granule localization, presence in exocrine secretions, and 
      similarity to pathogenesis-related proteins more specifically supports 
      GO:0045087 (innate immune response), which is already annotated. The

    reason: PMID:12223513 describes CRISP3 as a "matrix protein" but this refers
      to the protein matrix within the granule lumen, not the extracellular 
      matrix. The paper states "CRISP-3 was found to be a matrix protein, which 
      is stored in granules" - this is about intragranular localization. There 
      is no evidence that CRISP3 is a structural component of the extracellular
