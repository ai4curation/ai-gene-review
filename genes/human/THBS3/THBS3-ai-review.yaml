description: >-
  Thrombospondin-3 (THBS3/TSP3) is a pentameric matricellular glycoprotein
  that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. It binds to
  extracellular matrix proteins including fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin,
  and type V collagen. THBS3 contains calcium-binding type 3 repeats,
  EGF-like domains, and a unique EGD motif (instead of the canonical RGD
  integrin-binding motif found in other thrombospondins). The protein is
  involved in skeletal development, regulating bone maturation and epiphyseal
  ossification. THBS3 is also a developmentally regulated heparin-binding
  protein expressed in cartilage, lung, gut, and CNS during embryogenesis.

        supporting_text: >-
          Analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences showed the THBS3 gene to

        supporting_text: >-
          The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 956 amino acids that is highly
          acidic
      - statement: Contains seven type III (Ca2+-binding) repeats
        supporting_text: >-
          This region corresponds to seven type III (Ca(2+)-binding)

      Thrombospondin 3 is a developmentally regulated heparin binding
      protein.
    findings:
      - statement: THBS3 is an oligomeric heparin-binding protein
        supporting_text: >-
          Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analysis of cells
          transfected with a TSP3 expression vector revealed it to be an
          oligomeric heparin binding protein present in both the cell layer
          and medium

        supporting_text: >-
          Finally, a combination of in situ hybridization and
          immunocytochemistry demonstrated TSP3 to be expressed in a
          temporal and spatial manner during murine embryogenesis,
          especially in the gut, cartilage, lung, and central nervous system

        supporting_text: >-
          PDGF binds to various types of collagens, thrombospondin and
          osteopontin; however, the major component of the matrix involved
          in PDGF binding is likely to be haparan sulphate

      What is the precise molecular mechanism by which THBS3 affects integrin
      trafficking in cardiomyocytes, and how does the EGD motif contribute to
      this function?
  - question: >-
      Does THBS3 directly interact with TGF-beta or does it affect TGF-beta
      signaling through indirect mechanisms?

      Direct binding assays comparing THBS3 (EGD motif) vs THBS4 (RGD motif)
      for integrin binding affinity
    hypothesis: >-
      The EGD motif in THBS3 has reduced integrin binding affinity compared
      to the RGD motif in THBS4, explaining their differential effects on
      integrin trafficking.

      Structure determination of THBS3 type 3 repeats to understand calcium
      coordination and conformational changes
    hypothesis: >-
      Calcium binding induces conformational changes in THBS3 type 3 repeats
      that regulate accessibility of ligand-binding sites.
