description: 'SLC7A11 (xCT) is the light chain (catalytic subunit) of system xc-,
  a heterodimeric cystine/glutamate antiporter that forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer
  with SLC3A2 (4F2hc, the heavy chain). It mediates Na+-independent, electroneutral
  exchange of extracellular L-cystine for intracellular L-glutamate at ~1:1 stoichiometry
  (Km ~43-110 uM for cystine, ~48-224 uM for glutamate). The imported cystine is reduced
  intracellularly to cysteine, providing the rate-limiting substrate for glutathione
  (GSH) synthesis. This positions SLC7A11 as a critical regulator of cellular redox
  homeostasis and a suppressor of ferroptosis through the GSH/GPX4 axis. Recent studies
  have identified additional functions including L-kynurenine transport and novel
  lysosomal proton channel activity.
