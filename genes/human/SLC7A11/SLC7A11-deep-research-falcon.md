## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UPY5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Cystine/glutamate transporter {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Amino acid transport system xc-; AltName: Full=Calcium channel blocker resistance protein CCBR1; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 7 member 11; AltName: Full=xCT {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11213471};
- **Gene Information:** Name=SLC7A11 {ECO:0000312|HGNC:HGNC:11059};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)
- **Key Domains:** AA/rel_permease1. (IPR002293); AminoAcid_Transporter. (IPR050598); L_AA_transporter. (IPR004760); AA_permease_2 (PF13520)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SLC7A11" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SLC7A11' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SLC7A11** (gene ID: SLC7A11, UniProt: Q9UPY5) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Human SLC7A11 (UniProt Q9UPY5; xCT)

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: The target gene symbol SLC7A11 corresponds to the human cystine/glutamate antiporter light chain xCT, the catalytic subunit of system xc−, encoded in Homo sapiens. It forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer with the heavy chain SLC3A2 (4F2hc), consistent with the amino acid–polyamine–organocation (APC) transporter family and 12-transmembrane architecture, aligning with UniProt-provided family/domain expectations (AA/rel_permease1; L-amino acid transporter) (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 28-30). This matches the mandated identity and organism checks; no conflicting gene symbol literature was encountered.

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Molecular identity and complex: SLC7A11 (xCT) is the light-chain catalytic subunit of system xc−, a heterodimeric amino acid transporter with SLC3A2 (4F2hc) as the glycosylated heavy chain; the subunits are covalently linked and co-traffic to the plasma membrane (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, zhang2024theroleof pages 1-2). System xc− is Na+-independent and located predominantly at the cell surface (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).
- Primary biochemical function: System xc− exchanges extracellular L-cystine for intracellular L-glutamate at approximately 1:1 stoichiometry, enabling cystine import that is reduced intracellularly to cysteine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis; reported Km values are ~50 µM (cystine) and ~200 µM (glutamate) (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14). This transport is a central node for cellular redox control and antioxidant defense (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2).
- Pathway roles: By supporting GSH synthesis, SLC7A11 limits lipid peroxidation and opposes ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death; pharmacologic or genetic blockade of SLC7A11/system xc− induces ferroptosis (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14). Disulfidptosis, a distinct metabolic cell death observed under glucose deprivation with high SLC7A11 activity, is mechanistically linked to disulfide stress, further connecting SLC7A11 to redox-driven cell fates (qiu2025slc7a11asa pages 1-3).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Transporter pharmacology and oncology targeting: A 2024 review synthesizes inhibitor efforts against xCT (including erastin, sulfasalazine, sorafenib), emphasizes challenges in selectivity, and catalogs structure-guided discovery approaches; it also summarizes clinical context such as an early glioma trial of sulfasalazine that was terminated (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 30-31). Disease-focused 2024 reviews in HCC and ovarian cancer highlight SLC7A11 overexpression, therapy resistance, and the rationale for inducing ferroptosis via xCT inhibition (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2).
- Structural insight: Recent transporter reviews reference cryo-EM structures of the human SLC7A11–SLC3A2 complex that informed substrate path and small-molecule engagement models; these structural advances are shaping inhibitor hypotheses (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 28-30).
- Trafficking and post-translational regulation: New 2024 data identify a critical role for the xCT C-terminal Lys473 in secretory pathway progression; K473 substitutions alter glycosylation status, cause ER/Golgi retention, and abrogate plasma-membrane activity, pointing to acetylation/deacetylation as regulatory checkpoints for trafficking (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2). Together with the established need for SLC3A2 as a chaperone, this clarifies assembly and membrane delivery mechanisms (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oncology applications: 
  - Small-molecule inhibitors erastin and sulfasalazine are widely used to inhibit system xc− in preclinical models to induce ferroptosis; sorafenib is also discussed in the context of HCC and ferroptosis modulation (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2).
  - The clinical pathway has seen exploratory attempts such as sulfasalazine in glioma; while that trial was terminated, it established safety/feasibility considerations and informs ongoing translational efforts (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 30-31).
- Beyond oncology: 2024 translational reviews implicate SLC7A11 in diabetic wound healing via immune and oxidative-stress modulation, suggesting therapeutic potential in wound care strategies that target xCT/ferroptosis axes (zhang2024theroleof pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Transporter-targeted therapy analysis: Jakobsen and Nielsen (2024) provide a broad pharmacology perspective, integrating structural references, inhibitor classes, and cancer relevance; they underscore xCT’s centrality to GSH metabolism and ferroptosis and the need for selectivity and structural guidance in inhibitor design (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 30-31, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).
- Disease-focused perspectives: Reviews in HCC and ovarian cancer converge on SLC7A11 upregulation and chemoresistance, recommending ferroptosis-based strategies; these align with mechanistic understanding of GSH/GPX4 dependency (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic integration: The disulfidptosis review (2025) frames SLC7A11 as a nexus between ferroptosis resistance and disulfide-stress sensitivity under metabolic stress, offering a coherent conceptual model for context-dependent therapeutic exploitation (qiu2025slc7a11asa pages 1-3).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Transport kinetics: Approximate Km values summarized in 2024 synthesis: cystine ~50 µM, glutamate ~200 µM; antiporter stoichiometry ~1:1 (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14). 
- Expression patterns: 2024 transporter review and disease reviews compile tissue/cancer expression and associations with prognosis (e.g., upregulation in HCC and ovarian cancer correlating with therapy resistance), although specific cohort percentages vary by study; the reviews provide curated references and emphasize frequent overexpression in aggressive disease (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).
- Trafficking/PTM quantitative observations: Mutation at K473 reduces apparent molecular mass (by ~7.5 kDa for K473R and ~4 kDa for K473Q) and markedly lowers surface expression and transport activity in cell models (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2).

Biochemical function and localization (precise role and site of action)
- Substrates and specificity: SLC7A11 mediates L-cystine uptake in exchange for L-glutamate. The imported cystine is immediately reduced to cysteine intracellularly; the transporter’s specificity underpins cysteine supply for GSH synthesis (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).
- Mechanism: Obligate antiport of glutamate and cystine, Na+-independent, consistent with APC family transporters; this conserves redox balance by ensuring cysteine availability under oxidative and nutrient stress (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 28-30).
- Localization: Predominantly at the plasma membrane as a heterodimer with SLC3A2; trafficking is regulated by PTMs (e.g., K473 state) and requires proper glycosylation of the complex to reach the surface (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).

Regulation (expression and protein stability)
- Transcriptional control: SLC7A11 is stress-inducible via NRF2 and ATF4 pathways (e.g., electrophile/oxidative and amino-acid deprivation responses) and is repressed by p53, BAP1 and ATF3 in cancer contexts, as compiled by 2024 reviews (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 28-30, li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, zhang2024theroleof pages 1-2). 
- Post-translational/trafficking control: K473-dependent acetylation/deacetylation dynamics regulate ER–Golgi progression; lack of appropriate modification leads to ER retention and inactivity (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2). Proper assembly with glycosylated SLC3A2 is necessary for membrane stability and transporter function (koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).

Pathway context (glutathione, redox homeostasis, ferroptosis, disulfidptosis)
- GSH/GPX4 axis: SLC7A11-driven cystine import sustains GSH levels, enabling GPX4 to detoxify lipid hydroperoxides; blocking SLC7A11 reduces GSH and induces ferroptosis (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14). 
- Disulfidptosis: High SLC7A11 flux under glucose deprivation can deplete reducing equivalents (NADPH), promoting disulfide accumulation and actin cytoskeleton collapse, defining the disulfidptosis phenotype (qiu2025slc7a11asa pages 1-3).

Therapeutic strategies and inhibitors
- Small-molecule inhibitors: Erastin and sulfasalazine remain canonical system xc− inhibitors for ferroptosis induction; sorafenib is discussed in HCC contexts as modulating ferroptosis pathways (li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2). Reviews emphasize ongoing structure-guided discovery and the need for specificity (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 30-31, jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14).
- Translational considerations: While a sulfasalazine glioma trial was terminated, multiple disease reviews in 2024 advocate for patient stratification by SLC7A11 status and rational combinations (e.g., with therapies that increase oxidative stress) to harness ferroptosis therapeutically (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 30-31, li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2).

Conclusions
Human SLC7A11 (xCT; Q9UPY5) is a 12-TM APC-family transporter that forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer with SLC3A2 to mediate Na+-independent 1:1 L-cystine/L-glutamate exchange at the plasma membrane. This transport reaction supplies cysteine for GSH synthesis and underpins GPX4 activity, making SLC7A11 a gatekeeper of lipid-peroxidation control and ferroptosis resistance. Recent work refines our understanding of xCT trafficking and PTM regulation (e.g., K473-dependent ER–Golgi progression), while structural studies (cryo-EM) inform substrate/inhibitor interactions. 2024 disease reviews and pharmacology syntheses converge on SLC7A11 as a therapeutic target in cancer—particularly HCC and ovarian cancer—and in non-oncologic conditions such as diabetic wound healing. Real-world translation remains emergent; future efforts emphasize selective inhibitor design, rational combinations that elevate oxidative stress, biomarker-guided patient selection, and nuanced appreciation of context-dependent outcomes (including potential susceptibility to disulfidptosis under metabolic stress) (jakobsen2024exploringaminoacid pages 12-14, li2024slc7a11inhepatocellular pages 1-2, fantone2024roleofslc7a11xct pages 1-2, koppin2024lysine473regulates pages 1-2, qiu2025slc7a11asa pages 1-3).
