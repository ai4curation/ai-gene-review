description: >-
  RFXAP (Regulatory Factor X-Associated Protein) is a scaffolding subunit of the
  heterotrimeric RFX transcription regulatory complex that controls MHC class II
  gene expression. The RFX complex consists of RFX5 (two copies), RFXAP, and
  RFXANK/RFX-B. RFXAP does NOT bind DNA directly; rather, it assembles with
  RFXANK to form a scaffold that recruits RFX5. This scaffold-RFX5 interaction
  induces a conformational change in RFX5 that exposes its DNA-binding domain,
  enabling the complex to bind the X-box motif in MHC class II promoters. RFXAP
  mutations cause MHC class II deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome
  complementation group D), demonstrating its essential role in MHC class II
  gene regulation. RFXAP should be classified as a transcription coactivator,
  not a DNA-binding transcription factor.

      RFXAP localizes to the nucleus where it functions as part of the RFX
      complex. UniProt indicates nuclear localization (PMID:10938133), and
      the protein contains a nuclear localization signal at residues 163-178.
      IBA annotation is consistent with experimental evidence from multiple
      studies. Deep research confirms nuclear localization with NLS and acidic
      region essential for function (RFXAP-deep-research-falcon.md).

    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization is well-established for RFXAP. The protein must be

      RFXAP is an essential component of the RFX complex that regulates MHC
      class II gene transcription. The IBA annotation at this general level

# Proposed new annotation based on review

    label: transcription coactivator activity
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:9118943
  review:
    summary: >-
      NEW ANNOTATION. RFXAP should be annotated to transcription coactivator
      activity (GO:0003713) instead of DNA-binding transcription activator
      activity (GO:0001228). RFXAP functions as a non-DNA-binding component
      of the RFX complex that activates transcription through its interaction
      with the DNA-binding transcription factor RFX5.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      GO:0003713 (transcription coactivator activity) correctly describes
      RFXAP's function. The GO definition states this is "a transcription
      coregulator activity that activates or increases the transcription
      of specific gene sets via binding to a DNA-binding transcription
      factor." RFXAP binds to RFX5 (the DNA-binding transcription factor)
      and enables transcriptional activation of MHC class II genes. This
      is the appropriate molecular function annotation for RFXAP.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Should the 'contributes_to' qualifier be used to annotate scaffolding
      subunits to DNA-binding terms when they enable but do not perform DNA
      binding? The current annotation uses 'contributes_to' for GO:0001228 and
      GO:0000977, but this may be misleading as RFXAP does not bind DNA at all.
      The 'contributes_to' qualifier is typically used when a protein is part
      of a complex that has the function, not when the protein enables a
      different subunit to perform the function.
  - question: >-
      Should RFXANK also be reviewed for similar annotation issues as RFXAP?
      RFXANK is the other scaffolding subunit of the RFX complex and likely
      has similar incorrect annotations to DNA-binding terms.
