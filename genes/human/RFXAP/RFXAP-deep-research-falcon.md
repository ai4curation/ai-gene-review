## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O00287
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Regulatory factor X-associated protein; Short=RFX-associated protein; AltName: Full=RFX DNA-binding complex 36 kDa subunit;
- **Gene Information:** Name=RFXAP;
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** RFXAP_C_sf. (IPR038308); RFXAP_RFXANK-bd. (IPR029316); RFXA_RFXANK_bdg (PF15289)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "RFXAP" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'RFXAP' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **RFXAP** (gene ID: RFXAP, UniProt: O00287) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verify target identity and organism; ensure no gene symbol ambiguity. Define domains and complex membership.
- Synthesize current mechanistic understanding: RFX complex architecture, promoter recognition, CIITA co‑activation, subcellular localization.
- Summarize recent (2023–2024) developments and structural insights; extract URLs/dates.
- Detail clinical genetics and epidemiology of Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome II (BLS II) with statistics from recent cohorts.
- Discuss applications and expert analyses relevant to antigen presentation and immune regulation.

Gene/protein identity verification
- The target matches: RFXAP (Regulatory factor X‑associated protein) is a human protein that encodes a subunit of the regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factor complex required for MHC class II gene transcription. Human studies explicitly refer to RFXAP as a core RFX subunit mutated in MHC class II deficiency (BLS II), consistent with UniProt O00287 and the description “RFX‑associated protein.” No conflicting gene symbol was found in the cited human literature, and organism is Homo sapiens (Human) in the clinical and mechanistic sources used (Aug 2023 Iranian cohort; 2024 EMBO J mechanistic study) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).
- Domains/family consistency: Foundational summaries report RFXAP is a small acidic/nuclear protein with a nuclear localization signal (NLS), acidic (DE‑rich) region, and regions mediating interactions with other RFX subunits (RFX5/RFXANK). Multiple pathogenic mutations map to exon 1 and truncate or disrupt these features; cohort data emphasize the functional importance of the C‑terminal, glutamine‑rich portion for RFX complex formation. These are concordant with the domain annotations provided (RFXAP_C_sf; RFXAP_RFXANK‑binding) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, Jul 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 6-6, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular role: RFXAP is one of three core proteins (RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK) that assemble into the RFX complex recognizing the X‑box within MHC class II promoters. The RFX complex cooperates with NF‑Y and other factors to form the MHC‑II enhanceosome, which recruits the non‑DNA‑binding co‑activator CIITA, the master regulator of MHC‑II transcription. Disruption of any RFX subunit—including RFXAP—abolishes MHC‑II expression (HLA‑DR) on antigen‑presenting cells and causes BLS II (reviewed context, with explicit citation to RFXAP causality in MHC‑II deficiency) (asri2025beyondglutenthe pages 9-10, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).
- Interaction/assembly features: Structural and biochemical work has defined interaction domains among RFX subunits; in particular, interaction domains between RFX5 and RFXAP were mapped and structurally characterized (as cited by recent reviews on MHC‑II regulation), consistent with the UniProt domain annotations indicating an RFXANK‑binding region in RFXAP (asri2025beyondglutenthe pages 9-10, asri2025beyondglutenthea pages 9-10).
- Subcellular localization: RFXAP is nuclear; an internal NLS and acidic (DE) region were described, and pathogenic variants within exon 1 spanning nucleotides 116–540 can affect the NLS/acidic domain and impair nuclear function and/or complex assembly (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, Jul 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 6-6).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Cell type‑specific priming of CIITA and implication for RFXAP function: ZBTB48 was identified as a priming factor that opens chromatin and enables B‑cell‑specific activation of CIITA promoter III. While this study focuses on upstream CIITA control, it reinforces the canonical model where CIITA is recruited to the MHC‑II enhanceosome that includes RFXAP, placing RFXAP mechanistically downstream of newly defined chromatin priming steps (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00306-y, Nov 2024) (rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).
- Cohort genetics and clinical course (Iran, 2023): In 18 unrelated patients with MHC‑II deficiency, pathogenic variants were found in RFXANK (n=13), RFX5 (n=2), and RFXAP (n=3). All RFXAP variants were truncating and predicted to remove the C‑terminal region required for complex assembly; nearly all patients lacked HLA‑DR on B cells. Immunologically, 13/18 (72.2%) had low absolute CD4+ T‑cell counts, and 10/18 (55.5%) had CD4+ <500 cells/µL. Four underwent HSCT; three survived, underscoring both disease severity and variable transplant outcomes (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).
- Structural context for RFX family chromatin engagement: A cryo‑EM structure of the extended DNA‑binding domain of RFX5 bound to a nucleosome showed local DNA gyre distortion and partial DNA detachment at superhelical location +2, providing a physical basis for how RFX family factors engage and remodel chromatin at MHC loci. Although this structure was solved for RFX5, it informs enhanceosome assembly in which RFXAP participates by stabilizing RFX complex formation on DNA (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaf734, Jul 2025) (xue2025structuralbasisof pages 12-13).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Diagnostics and genetic counseling: The 2023 Iranian series demonstrates practical implementation of exome sequencing to identify causative variants across RFX complex genes, including RFXAP, enabling prognostication and HSCT decision‑making. The study also delineates population‑specific founder effects (for RFXANK) and documents outcomes, which are directly actionable in clinical immunology practice (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).
- Mechanistic frameworks for therapeutic modulation of antigen presentation: Recent mechanistic reviews integrate RFXAP within the MHC‑II enhanceosome and discuss epigenetic and transcriptional control of MHC‑II in disease contexts (e.g., inflammation and autoimmunity). These reviews synthesize how factors that prime CIITA and the enhanceosome (which includes RFXAP) could be targeted to restore or modulate MHC‑II in pathology, with oncology as a prominent application area (citing enhanceosome composition and regulatory mechanisms) (asri2025beyondglutenthe pages 9-10, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- EMBO Journal (2024) analysis: Rane et al. provide expert mechanistic insights into CIITA regulation and emphasize the enhanceosome model: RFXAP is a required factor within the CIITA‑recruited scaffold at MHC‑II promoters. This work updates the field by identifying ZBTB48 as a priming factor for CIITA pIII in B cells, complementing earlier knowledge of STAT1/IRF1 and other transcription factors in IFN‑γ inducibility (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44318-024-00306-y, Nov 2024) (rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).
- Clinical immunology cohort (2023) with expert context: Khorshidi et al. synthesize decades of RFX complex genetics with contemporary sequencing and clinical management, reinforcing the centrality of RFXAP/RFX complex integrity for human MHC‑II expression and adaptive immunity (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Mutation distribution in an Iranian cohort (Aug 2023): RFXANK (13/18, 72.2%), RFX5 (2/18, 11.1%), RFXAP (3/18, 16.7%). HLA‑DR absence on B cells in the vast majority; low CD4+ T‑cell counts in 13/18 (72.2%), with 10/18 (55.5%) <500 cells/µL. HSCT attempted in 4/18 (22.2%), with survival in 3/4 (75%) (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5).
- Domain‑pathogenicity relationships: Case‑based mutation compendia catalog RFXAP defects including frameshifts, splice‑site variants, and nonsense mutations, frequently in exon 1, affecting the NLS/acidic region or truncating the C‑terminus; these lesions segregate with abolished MHC‑II expression and BLS II (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, Jul 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 6-6, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).

Functional annotation summary for human RFXAP (UniProt O00287)
- Primary function: Non‑enzymatic transcriptional cofactor; a structural/organizational subunit of the RFX complex that binds the X‑box of MHC‑II promoters with RFX5 and RFXANK. RFXAP is essential for assembly/stability of the DNA‑bound RFX complex and subsequent recruitment of CIITA to activate MHC‑II transcription (asri2025beyondglutenthe pages 9-10, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8).
- Pathway: Antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II. Operates at the transcriptional control step, integrating with CIITA‑dependent activation of HLA‑DRA/DPA/DPB/DQA/DQB/DRB genes; cooperates with NF‑Y and other enhanceosome constituents at the MHC‑II promoter (asri2025beyondglutenthe pages 9-10, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).
- Subcellular localization: Nuclear; contains an NLS and acidic region; disease‑causing mutations in these regions or that truncate the C‑terminus disrupt nuclear function or complex formation (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa314, Jul 2020) (cai2020anovelrfxank pages 6-6).
- Disease association: Autosomal recessive Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome type II (MHC‑II deficiency). Truncating RFXAP mutations eliminate HLA‑DR surface expression, causing severe combined immunodeficiency with recurrent infections; cohort data from 2023 document RFXAP mutations in 3/18 patients and provide outcome statistics (URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-023-01562-z, Aug 2023) (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 9-11).

Limitations and open questions
- While upstream regulation of CIITA continues to be refined (e.g., ZBTB48 priming), high‑resolution structural detail of full human RFX complexes including RFXAP on native MHC‑II promoters remains to be visualized; current nucleosome‑level structures for RFX family (RFX5) provide a mechanistic basis for chromatin engagement but not yet a complete RFXAP‑containing assembly (URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaf734, Jul 2025) (xue2025structuralbasisof pages 12-13).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- Literature surveyed here consistently uses RFXAP to denote the human RFX‑associated protein subunit of the RFX complex. No conflicting usage for a different human gene/protein was found. The clinical genetics and mechanistic articles explicitly implicate human RFXAP in MHC‑II transcription biology and BLS II, in agreement with UniProt O00287 and the domain annotations provided (khorshidi2023clinicalimmunologicaland pages 3-5, cai2020anovelrfxank pages 7-8, rane2024zbtb48isa pages 17-18).
