description: >-
  SYVN1 (synoviolin/HRD1) encodes E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase synoviolin, a key
  component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. SYVN1 is an ER
  membrane-resident multi-pass transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic RING-type
  zinc finger domain that catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating
  enzymes to misfolded ER substrates, targeting them for proteasomal degradation.
  It functions as part of the HRD1 complex (with SEL1L, FAM8A1, HERPUD1, OS9,
  DERL1/2, and UBE2J1) in the quality control of ER proteins. SYVN1 also
  ubiquitinates non-ERAD substrates including p53/TP53, IRE1alpha, and misfolded
  Pael receptor (GPR37). It protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis and
  is upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation was made because HRD1 physically interacts with the Pael
      receptor (GPR37, UniProtKB:O15354), which is a misfolded protein substrate.
      However, GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is being obsoleted
      (go-ontology#30962) and is defined in the context of chaperone-like
      activity that assists in protein folding. SYVN1/HRD1 is an E3 ubiquitin
      ligase; its interaction with misfolded substrates serves the purpose of
      substrate recognition for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal
      degradation via ERAD, not to assist in protein folding. The paper
      (PMID:17059562) clearly demonstrates that HRD1 promotes ubiquitylation and
      degradation of Pael-R, functioning as an E3 ligase in the ERAD pathway.
      This is analogous to the case of yeast SAN1, discussed in go-ontology#30962,
      which recognizes misfolded proteins as a ubiquitin ligase rather than as a
      chaperone. The correct molecular function for SYVN1 is ubiquitin protein
      ligase activity (GO:0061630), which is already well-annotated with multiple
      lines of experimental evidence (IDA from PMID:14593114, PMID:17059562,
      PMID:12459480, and others).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      SYVN1/HRD1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, not a chaperone. Its
      physical interaction with the misfolded Pael receptor (PMID:17059562) is
      substrate recognition for ERAD-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation,
      not chaperone-mediated unfolded protein binding. The term GO:0051082 is
      being obsoleted (go-ontology#30962) because it conflates substrate
      recognition by ubiquitin ligases with chaperone-mediated binding. The
      correct annotation for SYVN1 is ubiquitin protein ligase activity
      (GO:0061630), which it already has from multiple experimental sources.

    SYVN1/HRD1 is the central E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the ERAD pathway.
    Its RING-H2 zinc finger domain catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of
    misfolded ER substrates (including TCR-alpha, CD3-delta, Pael-R, MHC class I
    heavy chains, and IRE1alpha), targeting them for VCP/p97-dependent
    retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. SYVN1 also forms the
    retrotranslocation channel and protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.
