## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q86TM6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase synoviolin; EC=2.3.2.27 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12646171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17059562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17141218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17170702}; AltName: Full=RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase synoviolin {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12975321}; AltName: Full=Synovial apoptosis inhibitor 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=SYVN1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15489334}; Synonyms=HRD1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12459480, ECO:0000303|PubMed:14593114, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15489334}, KIAA1810 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11347906, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15489334};
- **Organism (full):** Homo sapiens (Human).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the HRD1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** HRD1_E3_ubiq-ligases. (IPR050731); TPR_SYVN1_N. (IPR057992); Znf_RING. (IPR001841); Znf_RING/FYVE/PHD. (IPR013083); Znf_RING_synoviolin. (IPR058051)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "SYVN1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Homo sapiens (Human).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'SYVN1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **SYVN1** (gene ID: SYVN1, UniProt: Q86TM6) in human.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Human SYVN1 (HRD1/Synoviolin; UniProt Q86TM6)

Publication scope and target verification
This report addresses human SYVN1 (also known as HRD1 and synoviolin), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase central to ER-associated degradation (ERAD), consistent with the target identity specified for UniProt Q86TM6. In high-authority human genetics and mechanistic ERAD studies, “HRD1” is explicitly equated with SYVN1 and treated as the E3 ligase core of the conserved SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD complex. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2, wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts, definitions, and current understanding

1.1. What SYVN1/HRD1 is (molecular function)
SYVN1/HRD1 is an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (typically misfolded or regulated ER/membrane proteins), thereby targeting them for extraction and proteasomal degradation as part of ERAD. (wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 1-2, lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2)

In a conserved flavivirus-host proteostasis study, HRD1 is described as an ER-located E3 ligase whose “classical physiological role” is to ubiquitinate substrates and degrade them via the proteasome, and the protein is characterized as an integral ER membrane protein with a transmembrane (TM) domain and a cytosolic RING motif (the catalytic module typical of RING E3 ligases). (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 5-6)

1.2. SYVN1 in the SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD pathway (complex components and mechanism)
The SEL1L–HRD1 module is widely regarded as the most conserved branch of mammalian ERAD. In this model, misfolded ER proteins are recruited and presented to the HRD1 E3 ligase by accessory recognition/scaffold factors (including SEL1L and lectins such as OS9/ERLEC1), retrotranslocated across/through the ER membrane, polyubiquitinated, extracted by the p97/VCP machinery, and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2, wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 1-2)

A 2024 Nature Communications study provides in vivo and biochemical evidence that physical interaction between SEL1L and HRD1 is required to assemble a functional HRD1 ERAD complex. Proteomics-based interactome analyses show SEL1L is required for recruitment of the E2 enzyme UBE2J1 and DERLIN proteins to HRD1, supporting a mechanistic model in which SEL1L–HRD1 coupling is prerequisite for functional ubiquitination and retrotranslocation machinery assembly. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2)

1.3. Biological roles: proteostasis, ER stress, and inflammatory signaling
SYVN1/HRD1 is positioned at the interface of ER proteostasis and stress/inflammation, because ERAD capacity can mitigate unfolded/misfolded protein accumulation and thereby modulate ER stress signaling outcomes. A 2023 airway remodeling/asthma study explicitly frames SYVN1 as an ERAD-associated E3 ligase that promotes unfolded/misfolded protein degradation in the ER, and experimentally links SYVN1 activity to suppression of ER-stress markers (e.g., GRP78, CHOP) and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes. (dai2023roleofsyvn1 pages 6-11)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)

2.1. 2024: Human disease genetics links hypomorphic HRD1 (SYVN1) variants to neurodevelopmental phenotypes
A 2024 Journal of Clinical Investigation paper reports autosomal-recessive hypomorphic variants in SEL1L and HRD1/SYVN1 in six children across three families with neurodevelopmental disorder features (developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia/ataxia features). The variants impair ERAD at distinct steps, including HRD1 activity (HRD1 p.Pro398Leu). In engineered knock-in HEK293T models, known endogenous ERAD substrates (including IRE1α, OS9, and CD147) accumulated, consistent with impaired ERAD function. The study also reports that the extent of substrate accumulation differed among variants (highest for SEL1L p.M528R, lower for SEL1L p.G585D or HRD1 p.P398L), reinforcing genotype–functional severity relationships. (wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 1-2, wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 4-5)

2.2. 2024: Pathogenic SEL1L variants and ERAD complex-assembly requirement in vivo
A 2024 Nature Communications study identifies a pathogenic hypomorphic SEL1L variant (p.Ser658Pro) that weakens SEL1L–HRD1 interaction and causes partial embryonic lethality, developmental delay, and early-onset cerebellar ataxia in homozygous mice. Importantly for SYVN1 functional annotation, proteomic screens of HRD1/SEL1L interactomes show that SEL1L–HRD1 interaction is a prerequisite for formation of a functional HRD1 ERAD complex, because SEL1L is required for recruitment of UBE2J1 (E2 enzyme) and DERLIN proteins to HRD1. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2)

2.3. 2023–2024: Expansion of validated (non-canonical) SYVN1 substrates beyond classical ERAD clients
Multiple 2023–2024 disease-context studies identify regulated, non-canonical substrates and pathways, suggesting SYVN1 can affect signaling nodes beyond “generic misfolded-protein clearance.” Examples with direct experimental evidence in the retrieved corpus include:

• SIRT2 (airway remodeling/asthma; EMT/ER stress in bronchial epithelium): SYVN1 binds SIRT2 and promotes SIRT2 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation in BEAS-2B cells. (dai2023roleofsyvn1 pages 6-11)

• GSDMD (periodontitis; inflammasome/pyroptosis): Synoviolin (SYVN1/HRD1) interacts with GSDMD and is associated with altered GSDMD ubiquitination and inflammasome-driven cytokine release in human PBMCs and mouse macrophages, with effects on periodontitis severity in vivo. (pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 4-6, pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 2-4)

• GLUD1 (HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma): SYVN1 is identified as the E3 ligase that promotes GLUD1 ubiquitination and decreases GLUD1 protein stability, in a pathway facilitated by LASP1 and linked to HBX-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. (you2024inhibitionofglud1 pages 6-9, you2024inhibitionofglud1 pages 12-13)

• HMGB1 (papillary thyroid carcinoma): SYVN1 physically interacts with HMGB1 and promotes HMGB1 ubiquitination and degradation; MG132 rescue supports proteasome involvement, and SYVN1 overexpression suppresses malignant cell behaviors in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo in this model. (duan2024syvn1modulatespapillary pages 4-8, duan2024syvn1modulatespapillary pages 1-4)

• APOB (hepatic APOB/VLDL metabolism; ER quality control): In genome-engineered HepG2 and Huh-7 cells with endogenous APOB fluorescently tagged, an ERAD-focused sgRNA screen identifies SYVN1 as the E3 ligase responsible for degradation of poorly lipidated APOB (a key determinant of VLDL production). (meurs2024asuiteof pages 8-9)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations

3.1. Antiviral intervention and vector-control concepts: pharmacologic HRD1 inhibition (LS-102)
A 2024 PNAS study reports the HRD1 inhibitor LS-102 and uses it as a mechanistic and translational tool in dengue virus (DENV2) models. LS-102 is described as discovered by high-throughput screening; mechanistically, LS-102 “offset” NS4A ubiquitination mediated by mosquito HRD1 and human HRD1 (HsHRD1) and maintained NS4A stability in CHX chase assays, indicating functional inhibition of HRD1 E3 activity in both mosquito and mammalian contexts. (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 6-7)

Quantitative cellular potency: LS-102 EC50 values are reported as 2.757 µM in C6/36 cells and 1.391 µM in A549 cells. (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 6-7)

In vivo dosing/application examples:
• Mouse dengue model: AG6 (ifnagr−/−) mice infected with 5 × 10^4 f.f.u. DENV2 were dosed intraperitoneally with LS-102 at 15 mg/kg daily; treatment reduced viremia and viral burdens and improved survival, and prophylactic dosing produced an approximately 10-fold reduction in viremia and tissue viral burden with improved survival. (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 7-9)
• Mosquito infection/transmission: thoracic microinjection of LS-102 with DENV2 impaired infection in mosquitoes dose-dependently, and oral feeding of LS-102 in blood meals reduced DENV2 prevalence without affecting mosquito survival. (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 6-7, wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved media 0a2d5fec)

The in vivo outcomes are visually summarized in the paper’s Figure 5 (viral load and survival in mice; reduced viral loads/prevalence in mosquitoes). (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved media 0a2d5fec)

3.2. Cancer pharmacology (preclinical): targeting a SYVN1–EGFR axis with LS-102 to address EGFR-TKI resistance
A 2025 Cell Death & Disease study proposes SYVN1 as a therapeutic target in NSCLC. Mechanistically, SYVN1 is reported to interact with EGFR (SYVN1 N-terminus 1–290 aa binds the EGFR intracellular domain) and to stabilize EGFR by promoting Lys63-linked ubiquitination and inhibiting proteasome-mediated EGFR degradation, while also inhibiting EGFR endocytosis to increase membrane EGFR. (xie2025targetingthesyvn1egfr pages 1-2)

This study uses LS-102 (described as an enzyme activity inhibitor of SYVN1) and reports combination with the EGFR-TKI AZD9291 (osimertinib) as a strategy to reverse resistance.
• In vitro dosing: LS-102 at 5 µM combined with AZD9291 at 6 µM (A549) or 8 µM (H1299) in proliferation/colony assays; synergy assessed computationally (SynergyFinder). (xie2025targetingthesyvn1egfr pages 11-13)
• In vivo dosing: xenograft experiments used AZD9291 at 5 mg/kg (daily oral gavage) and LS-102 at 3 mg/kg (intraperitoneal; twice weekly for 3 weeks). (xie2025targetingthesyvn1egfr pages 3-4)

3.3. Hepatic lipid and lipoprotein biology: engineered cell systems for ERAD-linked APOB metabolism
A 2024 Cardiovascular Research paper provides a genome-engineered hepatic cell platform (HepG2 and Huh-7) with endogenous APOB tagged by mNeonGreen, enabling quantitative live-cell and secreted APOB monitoring and genetic perturbation screens. Using an sgRNA library targeting membrane-associated ER-resident E3 ligases, SYVN1 is identified as the E3 responsible for degradation of poorly lipidated APOB in HepG2 cells, highlighting an application in dissecting VLDL biology and ER quality control with a tractable system that can quantify APOB secretion over time. (meurs2024asuiteof pages 8-9)

4) Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)

4.1. SEL1L–HRD1 is a core, conserved ERAD branch essential for organismal viability and human health
Two high-authority 2024 papers (Nature Communications; JCI) converge on the conclusion that SEL1L–HRD1 coupling is necessary for functional ERAD complex formation and that hypomorphic disruption of this pathway has substantial organismal and human disease consequences.
• Nature Communications 2024: emphasizes that SEL1L–HRD1 interaction is required for recruitment of key ERAD components (E2 UBE2J1 and DERLINs) and formation of a functional HRD1 ERAD complex. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2)
• JCI 2024: explicitly frames HRD1/SYVN1 as the E3 ligase core of SEL1L–HRD1 ERAD and demonstrates that hypomorphic HRD1 variants impair ERAD substrate clearance and associate with neurodevelopmental disorders. (wang2024hypomorphicvariantsof pages 1-2)

4.2. Translational caution: systemic HRD1 inhibition may perturb proteostasis
The NSCLC-focused study explicitly notes potential safety concerns for systemic SYVN1 inhibition, warning that inhibiting SYVN1 may disrupt the ubiquitin–proteasome system and could increase ER stress and disturb protein homeostasis in organs such as liver and kidney, implying that delivery, dosing, and toxicity profiling are key barriers to clinical translation. (xie2025targetingthesyvn1egfr pages 13-14)

5) Relevant statistics and data highlights from recent studies

5.1. Quantitative and experimental parameters supporting substrate-specific functional annotation

SIRT2 (airway remodeling/asthma; 2023)
• SYVN1 upregulation in OVA-induced asthma model: 2.73-fold increase in lungs after OVA induction; ~7.76-fold upregulation after adenoviral SYVN1 overexpression. (dai2023roleofsyvn1 pages 6-11)
• Proteasome dependence of SIRT2 turnover: cycloheximide (CHX) chase (50 µg/mL) and MG132 (10 µM) restored SIRT2 protein levels, supporting ubiquitination → proteasomal degradation downstream of SYVN1. (dai2023roleofsyvn1 pages 6-11)
• Pathway link: SIRT2 overexpression reverses SYVN1-mediated suppression of ER stress markers GRP78/CHOP in TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL)-treated cells, supporting a causal substrate-to-phenotype link. (dai2023roleofsyvn1 pages 6-11)

GSDMD (periodontitis/pyroptosis; 2023)
• Human cohorts: serum and PBMCs collected from healthy (n=20), mild periodontitis (n=20), and severe periodontitis (n=20) groups; mean age 42.7; sex distribution reported. (pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 2-4)
• Systemic inflammatory readouts: serum IL-1β measured by ELISA (n=20/group) and PBMC mRNA analyses (RT-PCR; n=9) showed elevated inflammasome-related signals with decreased synoviolin expression in patients, with reduced GSDMD ubiquitination observed by IP/ubiquitination assays. (pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 4-6)
• Mouse model: Pg-induced periodontitis model used 2 × 10^9 CFU P. gingivalis applied by ligature for 4 weeks; micro-CT analyses used n=10/group and showed greater CEJ–ABC distance (bone loss) in myeloid-specific Synoviolin conditional KO mice. (pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 2-4, pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 6-8)
• Linkage ambiguity: the authors note they did not distinguish specific lysine linkage types on GSDMD in periodontitis, highlighting an open mechanistic question. (pang2023synoviolinalleviatesgsdmd‐mediated pages 8-9)

GLUD1 (HBV-related HCC; 2024)
• Proteasome dependence/stability assays: CHX 200 µg/mL and MG132 100 nM were used in protein stability assays; SYVN1 promoted GLUD1 ubiquitination and reduced GLUD1 stability, and LASP1-mediated GLUD1 destabilization required SYVN1. (you2024inhibitionofglud1 pages 6-9)
• Subcellular localization claim: both SYVN1 and GLUD1 were detected in mitochondria and cytosol, consistent with interaction in those compartments in HCC cells. (you2024inhibitionofglud1 pages 6-9)

HMGB1 (papillary thyroid carcinoma; 2024)
• Mechanism: Co-IP validates SYVN1–HMGB1 interaction and SYVN1 overexpression increases HMGB1 ubiquitination; MG132 restores HMGB1 protein after SYVN1 overexpression, implicating proteasome-dependent turnover. (duan2024syvn1modulatespapillary pages 4-8)
• Stability assay condition: CHX used at 100 µg/mL to assess HMGB1 half-life (and SYVN1 reduces HMGB1 half-life). (duan2024syvn1modulatespapillary pages 4-8)

APOB ERAD (hepatic lipoprotein biology; 2024)
• Quantification/engineering: in Huh-7 clones retaining one wild-type APOB allele, APOB-mNeon intensity was ~50% of that detected in a clone where both alleles were edited; APOB-mNeon secretion was quantifiable over time (reported linear increase, followed up to 7 days). (meurs2024asuiteof pages 6-8)
• Screen design: pooled sgRNA ERAD E3 screen (3 sgRNAs per E3) with puromycin selection (5 days), CP treatment (1 µM for 16 h), and FACS measurement; results from three independent experiments. (meurs2024asuiteof pages 8-9)

5.2. Quantitative outcomes for pharmacologic targeting: LS-102
• Cellular EC50: 2.757 µM (C6/36) and 1.391 µM (A549). (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 6-7)
• Mouse dosing: 15 mg/kg LS-102 intraperitoneal daily in AG6 mice infected with 5 × 10^4 f.f.u. DENV2; associated with reduced viremia/viral burdens and improved survival; prophylaxis yielded ~10-fold reduction in viremia/tissue burden. (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 7-9)
• Mosquito implementation: thoracic microinjection and oral feeding approaches reduced infection prevalence and loads dose-dependently (Figure 5). (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 6-7, wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved media 0a2d5fec)

Functional annotation summary (human-centric)

Primary biochemical role
SYVN1/HRD1 is an ER-associated, membrane-embedded RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates substrate proteins, coordinating with the SEL1L adaptor/scaffold and additional ERAD factors (including DERLINs and the E2 UBE2J1) to enable substrate retrotranslocation, extraction, and proteasomal degradation. (lin2024sel1lhrd1interactionis pages 1-2, wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 5-6)

Subcellular localization and topology
SYVN1/HRD1 is localized to the ER membrane and is an integral membrane protein with a TM domain and a cytosolic RING motif (catalytic E3 module). (wu2024anevolutionarilyconserved pages 5-6)

Key pathways

Limitations of this tool-based synthesis
Some mechanistic specifics requested for full functional annotation—particularly detailed ubiquitin linkage preferences across substrates in human cells, comprehensive E2 partner usage beyond UBE2J1 in the assembled ERAD complex, and kinetic enzymology parameters—were not consistently reported in the retrieved excerpts; where linkage types are specified (e.g., EGFR Lys63-linked ubiquitination), this is included with direct citation.
