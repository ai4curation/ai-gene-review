description: Cysteine-rich secretory protein 2 (CRISP2) is a testis-specific secretory protein that plays critical roles in male reproductive biology. It is incorporated into developing sperm during spermatogenesis and localizes primarily to the acrosome and flagellum. CRISP2 functions as an ion channel regulator, particularly modulating calcium flux during sperm capacitation, and is involved in the acrosome reaction and fertilization processes. The protein contains characteristic CAP and cysteine-rich (ShKT) domains that mediate protein-protein interactions and ion channel regulation.

    label: extracellular space
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CRISP2 is a secretory protein that is released into extracellular space. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference across the CRISP family, which are characterized as secreted proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is correct and well-supported. CRISP2 contains a signal peptide (residues 1-21) and is annotated as "Secreted" in UniProt. The deep research confirms CRISP2 "is predicted to be active in the extracellular space, consistent with its secretory nature" and localizes to the acrosome and flagellum of sperm cells, which are extracellular compartments. The IBA evidence provides strong phylogenetic support across orthologous CRISP family members.

  review:
    summary: This is a broad extracellular localization term assigned by automated evidence based on InterPro domain signatures and UniProt subcellular location annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is correct as CRISP2 is a secreted protein found in extracellular regions. While GO:0005615 (extracellular space) is more specific, GO:0005576 (extracellular region) is also accurate and represents a valid parent term. The IEA annotation is appropriately conservative, providing broad localization information based on sequence features and subcellular location keywords. Having both the specific term (GO:0005615) and broader term (GO:0005576) is acceptable and provides complete annotation coverage.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is supported by the foundational characterization paper for the human CRISP family by Kraetzschmar et al. 1996, which described CRISP2 tissue distribution and confirmed it as a secreted protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The TAS (Traceable Author Statement) annotation is well-founded. PMID:8665901 is the seminal paper characterizing CRISP2 (referred to as TPX1 in that work) as a secretory protein with testis and epididymis expression. The paper states "CRISP-2 cDNA corresponds to the previously described TPX1 form" and describes tissue distribution indicating secretory nature. While the abstract does not explicitly state "extracellular space," the characterization of CRISP proteins as secretory proteins with cysteine-rich domains supports extracellular localization. This represents core literature-based evidence for CRISP2 localization.
