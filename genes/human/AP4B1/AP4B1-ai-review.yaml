description: >-
  AP4B1 encodes the beta-1 subunit (beta4-adaptin) of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4),
  which consists of epsilon (AP4E1), beta4 (AP4B1), mu4 (AP4M1), and sigma4 (AP4S1) subunits.
  Unlike clathrin-associated AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 complexes, AP-4 forms a non-clathrin coat
  on vesicles departing from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). AP-4 mediates signal-dependent
  sorting and export of transmembrane cargo proteins from the TGN to endosomal compartments
  and pre-autophagosomal structures, recognizing YXXOE-type sorting signals. Key cargoes include
  ATG9A (autophagy machinery), APP (amyloid precursor protein), DAGLB (endocannabinoid synthesis),
  SERINC1/3 (lipid scramblases), Sortilin (lysosomal enzyme trafficking), and AMPA/delta-2
  glutamate receptors (neuronal polarity). The beta4 subunit contains an N-terminal trunk domain
  involved in complex assembly and a C-terminal ear (appendage) domain that recruits the accessory
  protein tepsin through a conserved hydrophobic binding site. AP-4 complex assembly requires the
  AAGAB chaperone, which stabilizes subunits and prevents proteasomal degradation. AP-4 plays
  critical roles in autophagosome biogenesis (via ATG9A trafficking), lysosome function (via
  Sortilin), neuronal polarity (via glutamate receptor sorting), and axonal endocannabinoid
  signaling (via DAGLB). Loss of AP-4 function results in cargo retention at the TGN and impaired
  autophagy, particularly affecting axonal compartments in neurons. Biallelic loss-of-function
  mutations in AP4B1 cause spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47), part of the AP-4 deficiency syndrome
  characterized by severe intellectual disability, progressive spasticity, and structural brain
  abnormalities including thin corpus callosum.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. AP-4 mediates vesicle-mediated transport
      from the TGN to endosomal compartments. This is well-supported by literature showing AP-4
      exports cargo (especially ATG9A) via non-clathrin-coated vesicles.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Vesicle-mediated transport is a core function of AP-4. The complex forms vesicle coats at
      the TGN and mediates cargo export to endosomes and peripheral sites. The IBA annotation
      appropriately captures this core function at the right level of specificity.

      This annotation represents the destination compartment of AP-4 cargo rather than
      where AP4B1 itself localizes. AP-4 sorts cargo like APP for delivery to endosomes,
      but the AP-4 complex itself localizes to TGN and cytoplasmic side of vesicle membranes.

      TAS annotation from Reactome showing AP-4 localization to TGN membrane where it
      initiates cargo sorting.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      TGN membrane is the site of AP-4 function. The Reactome pathway describes AP-4
      binding cargo at the TGN membrane for transport to endosomes. This is consistent
      with the IDA annotations for TGN localization from PMID:10066790.

      Duplicate of the previous annotation with different Reactome pathway reference.
      Both pathways describe AP-4 function at the TGN membrane. The annotation is valid
      and consistent with experimental evidence.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      AP4B1 is the beta-1 subunit (beta4-adaptin) of the heterotetrameric AP-4 adaptor
      complex. The complex forms a non-clathrin coat on vesicles at the trans-Golgi network
      to mediate cargo sorting and export to endosomal compartments. Key cargoes include
      ATG9A (autophagy), APP (Alzheimer disease), DAGLB (endocannabinoid signaling),
      SERINC proteins (lipid scramblases), Sortilin (lysosomal enzyme trafficking), and
      AMPA/delta-2 glutamate receptors (neuronal polarity). The beta4 subunit C-terminal
      ear domain specifically recruits the accessory protein tepsin.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What are all the cargo proteins sorted by AP-4? Beyond ATG9A, APP, DAGLB, and SERINCs,
      what other transmembrane proteins depend on AP-4 for proper trafficking?
  - question: >-
      What is the precise role of tepsin in AP-4 function? Does it regulate cargo selection,
      vesicle formation, or coat stability?
  - question: >-
      How does AP-4 vesicle formation occur without clathrin? What provides the mechanical
      force for membrane deformation?
  - question: >-
      What is the relationship between AP-4 deficiency and other neurodegenerative diseases

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Systematic cargo identification using proximity labeling (BioID/TurboID) of AP4B1
      to identify all proteins in proximity to AP-4 at the TGN. This would identify additional
      AP-4 cargo proteins and regulatory factors beyond the currently known ATG9A, APP,
      DAGLB, and SERINC proteins.
  - description: >-
      Cryo-EM structure determination of AP-4 bound to membrane and cargo to understand
      the mechanism of clathrin-independent vesicle formation. This would reveal how AP-4
      deforms membranes without clathrin and how cargo recognition is coupled to vesicle budding.
  - description: >-
      Evaluation of endocannabinoid pathway modulation (e.g., MGLL inhibitors like ABX-1431)
      as potential therapeutic intervention for AP-4 deficiency syndrome, given the discovery
      that DAGLB mislocalization contributes to axonal growth defects.
