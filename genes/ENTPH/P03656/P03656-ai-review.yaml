  label: Inovirus M13
description: Gene 1 protein (G1P) is an essential ATP-binding membrane protein required for M13 phage assembly and extrusion from host cells. The protein increases adhesion zones between inner and outer host membranes where phage assembly occurs, working in complex with G4P to create transmembrane channels for phage extrusion. Through alternative initiation, it also produces isoform G11P which plays a structural role in phage assembly site formation. This protein represents a paradigm for viral assembly mechanisms that do not lyse the host cell.
