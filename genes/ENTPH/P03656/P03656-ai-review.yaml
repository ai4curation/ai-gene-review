  label: Inovirus M13
description: Gene 1 protein (G1P) is an essential ATP-binding membrane protein required
  for M13 phage assembly and extrusion from host cells. The protein increases adhesion
  zones between inner and outer host membranes where phage assembly occurs, working
  in complex with G4P to create transmembrane channels for phage extrusion. Through
  alternative initiation, it also produces isoform G11P which plays a structural role
  in phage assembly site formation. This protein represents a paradigm for viral assembly
  mechanisms that do not lyse the host cell.
