  review:
    summary: 'This molecular function annotation is strongly supported by experimental evidence. Shc1 catalyzes the oxygen-independent cyclization of squalene to hopanoids (PMID:34353908, PMID:40195311), with enzyme activity directly validated through heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae and knockout studies.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The squalene-hopene cyclase activity is the core molecular function of Shc1, validated by multiple lines of evidence including functional expression studies, knockout phenotypes, and detection of hopanoid products. This is the primary and defining molecular function of the enzyme.'
