description: Squalene-hopene cyclase enzyme catalyzing oxygen-independent cyclization
  of squalene to hopanoids, enabling anaerobic growth in S. japonicus. Horizontally
  acquired from Acetobacter bacteria, this enzyme provides sterol surrogates when
  oxygen-dependent ergosterol biosynthesis is impaired.

    label: squalene-hopene cyclase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This molecular function annotation is strongly supported by experimental
      evidence. Shc1 catalyzes the oxygen-independent cyclization of squalene to hopanoids
      (PMID:34353908, PMID:40195311), with enzyme activity directly validated through
      heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae and knockout studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The squalene-hopene cyclase activity is the core molecular function of
      Shc1, validated by multiple lines of evidence including functional expression
      studies, knockout phenotypes, and detection of hopanoid products. This is the
      primary and defining molecular function of the enzyme.

    label: lipid droplet
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: No experimental evidence supports lipid droplet localization. Shc1-sfGFP
      localization studies show membrane association (ER, nuclear envelope, plasma
      membrane, vacuolar membrane) but not lipid droplets (PMID:40195311).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The IEA annotation likely derives from InterPro domain predictions, but
      experimental localization data clearly shows Shc1 at membrane sites involved
      in lipid biosynthesis, not lipid storage organelles. The enzyme functions in
      membrane lipid production, not storage.

  review:
    summary: Accurate but overly general. Shc1 specifically catalyzes hopanoid biosynthesis,
      a specialized form of triterpenoid lipid biosynthesis (PMID:34353908, PMID:40195311).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While technically correct, this term is too broad. The more specific term
      GO:0019746 (hopanoid biosynthetic process) precisely captures the enzyme function.
      Hopanoids are a specific class of pentacyclic triterpenoid lipids.

  review:
    summary: Correct general classification but could be more specific. Hopanoids
      are pentacyclic triterpenoids, and the specific process (hopanoid biosynthesis)
      is well-characterized (PMID:34353908, PMID:40195311).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While accurate, GO:0019746 (hopanoid biosynthetic process) is more specific
      and informative. Hopanoids are a distinct class of triterpenoids with specific
      biological functions as sterol surrogates.

  review:
    summary: Technically incorrect. Squalene-hopene cyclases are not lyases but transferases
      (intramolecular transferases). The reaction involves intramolecular rearrangement
      and cyclization, not cleavage (PMID:40195311).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Lyases catalyze cleavage reactions. Shc1 catalyzes cyclization through
      intramolecular rearrangement without bond cleavage. The proper molecular function
      is squalene-hopene cyclase activity (GO:0051007), which is a type of intramolecular
      transferase activity.

  review:
    summary: Partially correct but imprecise. While squalene-hopene cyclases do perform
      intramolecular rearrangements, they are specifically classified as intramolecular
      transferases that catalyze cyclization reactions (PMID:40195311).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Isomerase activity is too broad. The enzyme specifically performs intramolecular
      transferase activity (GO:0016866) during cyclization. The specific activity
      is already captured by GO:0051007 (squalene-hopene cyclase activity).

    action: ACCEPT

      cyclases. These enzymes catalyze intramolecular rearrangements to form cyclic
      structures. GO:0051007 (squalene-hopene cyclase activity) is a child term of

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While the authors note uncertainty between cortical ER versus plasma membrane
      signal, some plasma membrane localization is observed. This could represent
      ER-PM contact sites or direct PM localization for local hopanoid incorporation.
