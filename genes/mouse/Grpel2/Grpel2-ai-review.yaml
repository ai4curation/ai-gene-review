description: >-
  GrpE protein homolog 2 (mt-GrpE#2) is a mitochondrial nucleotide exchange
  factor (NEF) for mitochondrial Hsp70 (mortalin/HSPA9). It is a component
  of the PAM complex (presequence translocase-associated motor) required for
  ATP-dependent translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins into the
  mitochondrial matrix. Grpel2 stimulates ADP release from mt-Hsp70, thereby
  accelerating the Hsp70 ATPase cycle. It may also modulate the interconversion
  of oligomeric (inactive) and monomeric (active) forms of mt-Hsp70. A paralog
  of Grpel1 (mt-GrpE#1), both are ubiquitously expressed but may be subject
  to different post-transcriptional regulation (PMID:9694873).

    summary: >-
      Grpel2 is a GrpE-family nucleotide exchange factor for mitochondrial Hsp70.
      Naylor et al. (PMID:9694873) demonstrated that mt-GrpE#2 specifically
      interacts with and stimulates the ATPase activity of mt-Hsp70. The IBA
      annotation from phylogenetic inference (PANTHER/SGD) is well-supported
      by the conserved GrpE domain and experimental evidence for the mammalian
      protein. Adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity is the core molecular
      function of GrpE proteins.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of Grpel2. GrpE proteins catalyze
      nucleotide exchange on Hsp70 chaperones, which is the rate-limiting step
      in the Hsp70 ATPase cycle. The IBA inference is phylogenetically sound
      and consistent with direct experimental evidence (PMID:9694873).

  review:
    summary: >-
      Grpel2 is annotated as a component of the PAM complex by phylogenetic
      inference. UniProt states (by similarity) that it is a probable component
      of the PAM complex composed of mt-HSP70, GRPEL1 or GRPEL2, TIMM44,
      PAM16, and DNAJC19. The yeast ortholog (MGE1/YOR232W) is a well-established
      PAM complex component. This annotation is consistent with the known biology.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      GrpE proteins function as nucleotide exchange factors within the PAM
      import motor complex. The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference
      from the yeast ortholog is well-supported by structural and functional
      conservation of the PAM complex across eukaryotes. UniProt confirms
      this localization by similarity.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      As a component of the PAM complex, Grpel2 participates in protein import
      into the mitochondrial matrix. The nucleotide exchange activity of GrpE
      is essential for the mt-Hsp70 ATPase cycle that drives translocation of
      preproteins through the TIM23 channel. This is a core biological process
      for this protein, well-supported by IBA from phylogenetic inference.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Protein import into the mitochondrial matrix is the primary biological
      process function of the PAM complex. Grpel2 as a NEF for mt-Hsp70 plays
      an essential role in this process. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      sound and consistent with UniProt functional description.

  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. Grpel2 is a nucleotide exchange
      factor (NEF), not a chaperone that directly binds unfolded proteins.
      Its function is to accelerate nucleotide exchange on mt-Hsp70, thereby
      facilitating the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. While NEFs participate in the
      protein folding machinery, they are co-chaperones rather than direct
      unfolded protein binders.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is slated for obsoletion and is
      not the correct term for a nucleotide exchange factor. Grpel2 functions
      as a co-chaperone by stimulating nucleotide exchange on mt-Hsp70. The
      appropriate replacement is GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone), which
      captures the co-chaperone role in the protein folding machinery without
      implying direct unfolded substrate binding.

      This IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping is correct and

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation based on UniProt subcellular location mapping. UniProt
      states Grpel2 localizes to the mitochondrion matrix. The protein has
      a mitochondrial transit peptide (residues 1-31) and functions within
      the matrix as part of the PAM complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Mitochondrial matrix localization is well-supported by the presence
      of a mitochondrial transit peptide, the protein's function as a NEF
      for matrix-localized mt-Hsp70, and its role in the PAM complex. More
      specific than GO:0005739 (mitochondrion) and accurately reflects
      the sub-organellar localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro mapping. Grpel2 participates in protein
      folding indirectly as a co-chaperone for mt-Hsp70. However, its more
      specific biological process role is in protein import into the
      mitochondrial matrix (GO:0030150). Protein folding is a broader
      acceptable annotation but not the most informative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While protein import into the mitochondrial matrix is the more specific
      process, Grpel2 does participate in protein folding through its role
      in regulating mt-Hsp70. The IEA annotation is not incorrect and provides
      complementary biological context to GO:0030150. As an IEA it is
      acceptably general.

    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro mapping. Bacterial GrpE forms homodimers,
      and this is a conserved feature of GrpE-family proteins. However,
      homodimerization is a structural property rather than a functional
      molecular activity of interest, and it has not been directly
      demonstrated for mouse Grpel2.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While GrpE-family proteins are known to form homodimers, this
      annotation describes a structural feature rather than the functional
      molecular activity. Homodimerization is not experimentally verified
      for Grpel2 specifically, and this IEA may be an over-extension from
      bacterial GrpE structural data. The core molecular function is
      GO:0000774 (adenyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro mapping. Grpel2 does bind mt-Hsp70
      (a protein-folding chaperone) as part of its nucleotide exchange
      function. Naylor et al. (PMID:9694873) showed that the GrpE-like
      proteins bound to E. coli DnaK and to mammalian mt-Hsp70.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation correctly captures the binding interaction between
      Grpel2 and mt-Hsp70. As a nucleotide exchange factor, Grpel2 must
      physically bind to Hsp70 to catalyze ADP release. This is
      experimentally supported (PMID:9694873).

      HDA annotation from Da Cruz et al. (2003), a proteomic analysis of

      activity of mt-Hsp70. However, the paper does not demonstrate direct
