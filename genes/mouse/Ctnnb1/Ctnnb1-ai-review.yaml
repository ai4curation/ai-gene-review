description: Beta-catenin is a multifunctional protein with dual roles in cell adhesion
  and Wnt signaling. At adherens junctions, it links E-cadherin to alpha-catenin and
  the actin cytoskeleton, maintaining epithelial integrity. In the canonical Wnt pathway,
  stabilized beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional
  co-activator with TCF/LEF transcription factors, driving expression of genes controlling
  cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate specification. The protein contains
  12 Armadillo repeats that form a versatile protein interaction interface, an N-terminal
  regulatory domain with phosphorylation sites controlling stability, and a C-terminal
  transactivation domain required for gene regulation. Essential for embryonic development,
  beta-catenin is required for gastrulation, axis formation, and organogenesis. Loss-of-function
  mutations cause neurodevelopmental disorders while gain-of-function mutations drive
  oncogenesis.

  review:
    summary: Beta-catenin knockout mice show disrupted vasculature development, particularly
      in CNS angiogenesis. The referenced PMID:28463231 demonstrates that disruption
      of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling affects pulmonary mesenchymal progenitor cells
      and microvascular dysfunction. Beta-catenin's role in angiogenesis is mediated
      through canonical Wnt signaling which regulates endothelial cell differentiation
      and vessel formation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While beta-catenin does participate in angiogenesis through Wnt signaling
      in endothelial cells, this represents a downstream developmental consequence
      of its core signaling function rather than a direct molecular role. The protein's
      primary functions are cell adhesion and transcriptional co-activation; angiogenesis
      is a tissue-specific developmental process that utilizes these core functions.

      interacts with cytokine pathways, this represents crosstalk between signaling

      However, beta-catenin primarily acts as a transcriptional co-activator, not

      While Wnt/beta-catenin signaling can indirectly lead to repression of certain

    summary: Paper shows Wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls osteoblast vs chondrocyte
      fate decisions. Beta-catenin directly regulates cell fate through transcriptional
      control of lineage-specific genes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cell fate specification is a core function of beta-catenin through Wnt
      signaling. As a transcriptional co-activator, beta-catenin/TCF complexes directly
      control expression of cell fate determinants. This is one of its primary biological
      roles.

    summary: Beta-catenin null embryos show specific defects in embryonic ectoderm
      with cell detachment and dispersal. Beta-catenin is essential for ectodermal
      integrity through its adhesion function and for proper differentiation through
      Wnt signaling.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Ectoderm development is a fundamental germ layer formation process requiring
      both beta-catenin functions. Its adhesion role maintains ectodermal layer integrity

    reason: Cell differentiation is a fundamental process regulated by beta-catenin
      through Wnt signaling. As a transcriptional co-activator, beta-catenin controls
      expression of differentiation genes and cell fate determinants. This is a core
      biological function directly mediated by its signaling role.

      lung epithelial differentiation and branching morphogenesis.
