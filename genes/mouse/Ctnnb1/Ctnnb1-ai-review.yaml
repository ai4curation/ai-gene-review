description: Beta-catenin is a multifunctional protein with dual roles in cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. At adherens junctions, it links E-cadherin to alpha-catenin and the actin cytoskeleton, maintaining epithelial integrity. In the canonical Wnt pathway, stabilized beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator with TCF/LEF transcription factors, driving expression of genes controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate specification. The protein contains 12 Armadillo repeats that form a versatile protein interaction interface, an N-terminal regulatory domain with phosphorylation sites controlling stability, and a C-terminal transactivation domain required for gene regulation. Essential for embryonic development, beta-catenin is required for gastrulation, axis formation, and organogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations cause neurodevelopmental disorders while gain-of-function mutations drive oncogenesis.

  review:
    summary: Beta-catenin knockout mice show disrupted vasculature development, particularly in CNS angiogenesis. The referenced PMID:28463231 demonstrates that disruption of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling affects pulmonary mesenchymal progenitor cells and microvascular dysfunction. Beta-catenin's role in angiogenesis is mediated through canonical Wnt signaling which regulates endothelial cell differentiation and vessel formation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While beta-catenin does participate in angiogenesis through Wnt signaling in endothelial cells, this represents a downstream developmental consequence of its core signaling function rather than a direct molecular role. The protein's primary functions are cell adhesion and transcriptional co-activation; angiogenesis is a tissue-specific developmental process that utilizes these core functions.

    summary: Beta-catenin is essential for cell fate specification through its role as a transcriptional co-activator in canonical Wnt signaling. The protein partners with TCF/LEF transcription factors to drive expression of genes controlling cell differentiation and fate determination during development.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cell fate specification is a well-established core function of beta-catenin through Wnt signaling. This represents one of its primary biological roles, directly mediated by its transcriptional co-activator function with TCF/LEF. Multiple studies confirm beta-catenin's essential role in determining cell fates across various tissues.

  review:
    summary: The referenced study shows reciprocal requirements between EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hair follicle induction. While beta-catenin interacts with cytokine pathways, this represents crosstalk between signaling systems rather than beta-catenin directly mediating cytokine signals.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is too broad and misleading. Beta-catenin is not a direct mediator of cytokine signaling pathways. The cited paper describes crosstalk between Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB pathways in a specific developmental context, but this doesn't make beta-catenin a general cytokine signaling mediator. The core function is Wnt signaling, not cytokine signaling.

    summary: This overly broad term encompasses any process affecting gene expression. While beta-catenin does regulate transcription as a co-activator with TCF/LEF, this annotation lacks specificity about mechanism or targets.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term 'gene expression' is too vague and uninformative. Beta-catenin specifically functions as a transcriptional co-activator in the canonical Wnt pathway.

  review:
    summary: The cited paper shows beta-catenin regulates respiratory epithelial differentiation. However, beta-catenin primarily acts as a transcriptional co-activator, not repressor. Any negative regulation would be indirect through activation of repressor genes or competition for binding partners.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Beta-catenin is fundamentally a transcriptional co-activator, not a repressor. While Wnt/beta-catenin signaling can indirectly lead to repression of certain genes (e.g., by activating expression of transcriptional repressors), beta-catenin itself does not directly negatively regulate transcription. This annotation misrepresents its molecular function.

  review:
    summary: The cited paper shows Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates nephron induction during kidney development. Beta-catenin is required for proper kidney morphogenesis through its signaling function in nephron progenitors.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Kidney development is an organ-specific developmental process that utilizes beta-catenin's core Wnt signaling function. While essential for nephrogenesis, this represents a tissue-specific application rather than a primary molecular function of the protein.

    label: positive regulation of telomere maintenance via telomerase
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:22723415
  review:
    summary: Paper shows Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates telomerase in stem cells and cancer. Beta-catenin/TCF complexes directly activate TERT expression, linking Wnt signaling to telomerase activity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Telomerase regulation is a specialized function in stem cells and cancer cells. While beta-catenin can regulate TERT expression through Wnt signaling, this represents a specific transcriptional target rather than a core function of the protein.
