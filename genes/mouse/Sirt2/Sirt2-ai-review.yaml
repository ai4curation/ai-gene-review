description: NAD-dependent protein deacetylase and defatty-acylase (EC 2.3.1.286) that functions primarily
  in the cytoplasm but shuttles to the nucleus during G2/M transition and mitosis. Sirt2 deacetylates
  histones (preferentially H4K16, also H3K18), alpha-tubulin (K40), and numerous non-histone substrates
  including transcription factors (FOXO1, FOXO3), cell cycle regulators (CDC20, FZR1), and polarity proteins
  (Par-3). Also possesses efficient demyristoylase and depalmitoylase activities. Key roles include regulation
  of cell cycle progression through APC/C activity, chromatin condensation during mitosis, metabolic regulation,
  adipocyte differentiation, and peripheral nerve myelination in Schwann cells. Loss of Sirt2 leads to
  genomic instability and gender-specific tumorigenesis.
