# Comprehensive Research Report on Thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) in Mus musculus: Structure, Function, and Cellular Roles

This report provides a thorough examination of the thioredoxin 1 (Txn1) gene product in mouse (Mus musculus), focusing on its molecular structure, enzymatic mechanism, subcellular localization, target substrates, and diverse biological functions. Thioredoxin 1 represents a highly conserved redox-active protein that maintains cellular reducing environments and participates in critical signaling pathways controlling cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. The protein functions as both an antioxidant enzyme and a redox-dependent signaling molecule, interacting with numerous target proteins to regulate fundamental cellular processes. This analysis synthesizes current evidence regarding the biochemical catalysis of thioredoxin, its spatial organization within cells, its role in protecting against oxidative stress, and its participation in gene expression regulation through interaction with transcription factors.

## Protein Structure and Active Site Architecture

The thioredoxin 1 protein encoded by the Txn gene is a small, highly conserved oxidoreductase with a molecular weight of approximately 12 kilodaltons[11]. The protein possesses a characteristic tertiary structure termed the thioredoxin fold, which consists of five beta-strands forming the internal core of the protein, surrounded by four alpha-helices and a short stretch of helix encompassing the central beta-sheets[16]. This distinctive three-dimensional arrangement creates a stable protein scaffold that has been preserved throughout evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, demonstrating the fundamental importance of this structural organization for redox catalysis. The thioredoxin fold represents a minimal yet versatile structural element that supports oxidation, reduction, and isomerization of disulfide bonds, and this structural framework has proven sufficiently adaptable to accommodate diverse catalytic functions depending on the specific cellular environment in which thioredoxin operates[52].

At the heart of thioredoxin's catalytic capacity lies its active site, characterized by a highly conserved CXXC motif where X represents the amino acids glycine and proline in the mouse thioredoxin sequence[11]. The thioredoxin fold creates a distinctive structural environment around the active site cysteine residues, with the N-terminal cysteine (Cys32) of the CXXC motif positioned somewhat exposed to the solvent, while the C-terminal cysteine (Cys35) remains more deeply buried within the protein structure[10]. This differential positioning of the two active site cysteines proves critical for the catalytic mechanism, as it enables sequential nucleophilic attacks required for thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. The chemical environment surrounding the active site, including the pKa values of the cysteine thiolates, represents a crucial determinant of thioredoxin reactivity and distinguishes it from other thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases such as protein disulfide isomerase or DsbA[10]. The poor stabilization of both cysteine thiolates in thioredoxin renders it a potent reducing agent compared to oxidizing enzymes that stabilize their cysteine thiolates more extensively[10].

The active site architecture of thioredoxin demonstrates remarkable sophistication in its structural organization. The CXXC motif functions as a rheostat controlling the redox potential of the active-site disulfide bond through variations in the intervening amino acid residues and the local electrostatic environment[49]. The reduction potential of thioredoxin is determined by complex interactions between pH-dependent components related to thiol pKa values and pH-independent components arising from structural features that remain incompletely characterized[49]. Studies examining the CXXC motif across diverse thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases have revealed that the identity of the amino acids flanking the catalytic cysteines profoundly influences both the reduction potential and the substrate specificity of these enzymes[49]. In thioredoxin specifically, the reduction potential falls in the range characteristic of strong reducing agents, enabling it to function effectively in reducing disulfide bonds in diverse substrate proteins[10]. This chemical property positions thioredoxin as a general-purpose reductant capable of interacting with numerous target proteins bearing disulfide bonds requiring reduction.

## Catalytic Mechanism and Thiol-Disulfide Exchange Reactions

Thioredoxin catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions through a well-characterized bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism involving sequential cysteine residue attacks on target disulfide bonds[10]. The reaction proceeds in discrete steps beginning with binding of the substrate protein to thioredoxin, followed by nucleophilic attack of the N-terminal cysteine residue (Cys32-S⁻) on the disulfide bond of the target protein[10]. This initial nucleophilic attack generates an intermolecular mixed disulfide intermediate in which thioredoxin remains covalently linked to the partially reduced substrate protein through a disulfide bond. Subsequently, the C-terminal cysteine residue (Cys35-S⁻), which is buried within the protein structure, attacks the mixed disulfide intermediate, completing the transfer of reducing equivalents and resulting in release of the fully reduced substrate protein while thioredoxin itself becomes oxidized[10]. This sequential mechanism ensures directional electron transfer from thioredoxin to target substrates and enables thioredoxin to discriminate between productive and nonproductive reaction pathways[7].

The specificity of thioredoxin in its interactions with target proteins derives from multiple factors beyond simple chemical reactivity. Conformational changes occurring during the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction at the thioredoxin-substrate interface enable precise orientation of catalytic residues and control of reaction regioselectivity[7]. The pKa values of cysteine residues in both thioredoxin and its target proteins critically influence which cysteines undergo nucleophilic attack and in what sequence, thereby ensuring productive catalysis rather than futile side reactions[7]. Hydrogen bonding networks involving thioredoxin active site residues stabilize the thiolate form of cysteine, facilitating its nucleophilic reactivity while preventing unwanted side reactions[7]. These structural and chemical determinants collectively govern the exquisite specificity of thioredoxin in selecting among numerous potential targets within the cellular environment and ensuring that reducing equivalents flow in the intended direction.

## Relationship with Thioredoxin Reductase and NADPH Electron Transfer

The thioredoxin catalytic cycle depends critically upon regeneration of the reduced form of thioredoxin through the action of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), forming an integrated enzyme system that maintains cellular reducing power[3][8]. Thioredoxin reductase represents an essential homodimeric flavoprotein that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxidized thioredoxin, thereby completing the catalytic cycle and enabling continued thioredoxin function[3]. The electron transfer pathway proceeds through an intricate mechanism in which NADPH donates reducing equivalents to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor bound within thioredoxin reductase, ultimately leading to the reduction of an active-site disulfide bond within the enzyme[3]. In mammalian thioredoxin reductases, the catalytic cycle involves a large conformational change and transfer of reducing equivalents to a mobile C-terminal selenocysteine-containing tetrapeptide of the opposing subunit in the thioredoxin reductase dimer, which then reduces the disulfide bond within thioredoxin itself[3]. This multi-step electron transfer pathway utilizes thermal motion at physiological temperature to enable the thioredoxin shuttle to transiently access the active site of thioredoxin reductase[6].

The structural dynamics underlying thioredoxin reductase catalysis have been elucidated through a combination of crystallographic studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical kinetic analysis. The oxidized shuttle of thioredoxin reductase, bearing a disulfide between a cysteine and selenocysteine residue, must travel a distance exceeding twenty angstroms from its sequestered position deep within the protein interior to reach and interact with the bound thioredoxin substrate[6]. Computational molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that thermal motion at body temperature (37°C) enables this conformational change, allowing the oxidized shuttle to transiently access the active site, where reduction by the N-terminal active-site dithiol occurs[6]. Once the shuttle becomes reduced through interaction with the dithiol-containing center, its increased polarity drives the shuttle outward toward the solution interface through spontaneous motion, positioning it to transfer reducing equivalents to incoming thioredoxin molecules[6]. This elegant molecular mechanism represents an adaptation enabling a single enzyme to catalyze reduction of thioredoxin despite the internal active site being too small to accommodate the full thioredoxin substrate, necessitating an intermediary disulfide shuttle.

The separation of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase components within the cell into functionally distinct pools amplifies the diversity of cellular redox control. In mammals, distinct isozymes of thioredoxin reductase function in different subcellular compartments, with TrxR1 residing in the cytosol and TrxR2 localizing to mitochondria[3][9]. This compartmentalization enables independent regulation of redox homeostasis in distinct cellular environments with dramatically different oxidizing power and redox requirements. The cytosolic thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system maintains a highly reducing environment in the cytoplasm, supporting the numerous redox-dependent processes occurring in this compartment[12]. The mitochondrial thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system functions similarly within the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a crucial role in protecting mitochondrial proteins from oxidative damage and regulating mitochondrial apoptosis signaling[58].

## Subcellular Localization and Compartment-Specific Functions

The mouse thioredoxin 1 protein exhibits predominantly cytoplasmic localization, where it exerts primary control over cytosolic redox status[9]. Biochemical studies measuring thioredoxin reductase activity in subcellular fractions from rat liver tissue revealed that TrxR activity, primarily attributable to the TrxR1 isoform and hence associated with thioredoxin 1, appeared highest in cytoplasmic fractions at 1.26 U/mg ± 0.11, compared to mitochondrial fractions at 1.57 U/mg ± 0.19, indicating substantial cytosolic localization of this system[9]. The cytosolic thioredoxin 1 protein can translocate to the nucleus under certain conditions, where it participates in redox regulation of nuclear transcription factors and DNA repair processes[14]. Evidence demonstrates that phorbol esters efficiently translocate thioredoxin 1 into the HeLa cell nucleus where it interacts with Ref-1 to promote activation of the AP-1 transcription factor through redox modification of conserved cysteine residues[14]. This nuclear translocation ability enables thioredoxin to participate in transcriptional responses to cellular signals and oxidative stress.

The endoplasmic reticulum, despite being a site of intense oxidative activity required for disulfide bond formation during protein folding, demonstrates virtually undetectable thioredoxin reductase activity and minimal thioredoxin presence[9]. This striking compartmentalization reflects the specialized redox environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, which has evolved entirely distinct oxidoreductase systems including protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase to maintain its oxidizing conditions necessary for oxidative protein folding[9]. The absence of thioredoxin from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen represents an evolutionary adaptation preventing the potent reducing activity of thioredoxin from interfering with the controlled oxidation of nascent proteins required for proper disulfide bond formation[12]. Instead, the cytosolic thioredoxin system remains poised to provide reducing power to substrates emerging from the endoplasmic reticulum following their synthesis and initial folding.

Studies employing transgenic mouse models with inducible expression of thioredoxin 1 "substrate traps" to stabilize intermolecular disulfides with protein substrates have revealed tissue- and cell-specific Trx1-dependent interactions. Following immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis, researchers identified forty-one homeostatic Trx1 interactions in perinatal mouse lung tissue, including previously characterized substrates such as peroxiredoxin family members and collapsin response mediator protein 2[35]. Application of oxidative stress through perinatal hyperoxia as a model of oxidative injury revealed seventeen additional oxygen-induced Trx1 interactions including several cytoskeletal proteins potentially important for alveolar development[35]. This evidence demonstrates that thioredoxin 1 functions within dynamic networks of protein interactions that expand or contract in response to cellular redox perturbations, enabling responsive adaptation of the proteome to oxidative challenges.

## Substrates and Direct Target Proteins of Thioredoxin 1

The thioredoxin 1 system reduces an exceptionally diverse array of substrate proteins spanning multiple functional categories, reflecting the central role of thioredoxin in cellular redox regulation. One of the most important thioredoxin 1 substrates comprises the peroxiredoxin family, particularly the two-cysteine peroxiredoxins, which directly reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides[16]. Once peroxiredoxin reduces its target oxidant, thioredoxin 1 restores peroxiredoxin activity by recycling the oxidized form back to its reduced state, establishing a continuous antioxidant relay system[16]. Beyond peroxiredoxins, additional protein substrates of thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin include glutaredoxins, protein disulfide isomerases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and diverse other oxidoreductases[8]. Nonprotein substrates represent an additional category of thioredoxin 1 targets, including selenite, dehydroascorbate, lipoic acid, ubiquinone, cytochrome c, and certain cancer drugs such as motexafin gadolinium[8].

Among the most thoroughly characterized thioredoxin 1 target proteins are transcription factors requiring thiol-mediated redox modification for DNA binding activity. The transcription factor NF-κB exhibits markedly augmented DNA-binding activity following thioredoxin 1 treatment through direct reduction of Cys-62 within its DNA-binding loop[14]. Under normal conditions, thioredoxin 1 scavenges reactive oxygen species in the cytoplasm and inhibits the degradation of IκB, the inhibitor protein that prevents NF-κB nuclear translocation and gene expression[16]. However, increased reactive oxygen species mediate the degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, whereupon nuclear thioredoxin 1 directly reduces a cysteine residue of NF-κB and allows NF-κB-dependent gene expression[16]. This mechanism enables thioredoxin 1 to suppress oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by activating NF-κB-dependent transcription of anti-apoptotic genes.

The activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, composed of c-Jun and c-Fos subunits, represents another critical thioredoxin 1 target with profound consequences for gene expression. Thioredoxin 1 reduces AP-1 cysteines indirectly via the Ref-1 redox factor, thereby increasing the DNA-binding activity of AP-1 to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis[16]. Direct physical association between thioredoxin 1 and Ref-1 within the nucleus enables this redox relay, with the interaction requiring intact active-site cysteines of thioredoxin 1[14]. The C-terminal region of thioredoxin 1 appears indispensable for its interaction with Ref-1 and for its reducing activity, suggesting that the physical engagement between these two proteins and the redox catalysis they jointly perform constitute essential components of AP-1 regulation[14].

The hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) subunit undergoes redox modification catalyzed by thioredoxin 1 and Ref-1 during hypoxic conditions, essential for HIF-1 binding with CBP/p300 coactivators and initiation of hypoxic response element target gene expression[16]. The protein Nrf2, a master regulator of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven transcription, is activated by thioredoxin 1 through reduction of conserved cysteine residues in the DNA-binding domains of small Maf proteins, thereby enhancing Nrf2-ARE binding[16]. As a result of this feed-forward regulation, oxidative stress leads to increased thioredoxin 1 levels, which in turn activates the transcription factors responsible for inducing even higher levels of thioredoxin 1 and other antioxidant enzymes, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies antioxidant responses during oxidative stress.

## Direct Inhibition of Apoptotic Signaling through ASK1 Binding

Among the most thoroughly characterized non-enzymatic functions of thioredoxin 1 is its direct inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways required for tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis[33]. Through genetic screening approaches, researchers identified thioredoxin as a binding partner of ASK1, with thioredoxin associating with the N-terminal coiled coil domain of ASK1 both in vitro and in vivo[33]. Expression of thioredoxin 1 effectively inhibits ASK1 kinase activity and the subsequent ASK1-dependent apoptosis, while inhibition of thioredoxin 1 results in activation of endogenous ASK1 activity, establishing thioredoxin 1 as a physiological inhibitor of ASK1[33]. Treatment of cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a reducing agent that increases cellular thiols, also inhibits serum withdrawal-, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-, and hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of ASK1 as well as apoptosis, supporting a redox-dependent mechanism underlying thioredoxin 1 inhibition of ASK1[33].

The interaction between thioredoxin 1 and ASK1 demonstrates exquisite redox dependence, with reduced thioredoxin 1 capable of binding and inactivating ASK1, while oxidized thioredoxin 1 cannot effectively inhibit ASK1 activity[33]. This redox-sensitive interaction represents a sophisticated molecular mechanism enabling cells to integrate information about oxidative stress status with apoptotic signaling, such that under normal reducing conditions, thioredoxin 1 maintains ASK1 in an inactive state, but elevated reactive oxygen species oxidizing thioredoxin 1 permit ASK1 activation and induction of apoptosis. This regulatory network has profound implications for cellular responses to oxidative stress, as it enables differentiation between manageable oxidative challenges suppressed through thioredoxin 1 antioxidant activities and severe stress triggering apoptotic elimination of irreparably damaged cells[15].

## Regulation of Thioredoxin 1 Expression and Protein Levels

The expression of thioredoxin 1 undergoes substantial induction in response to diverse oxidative stimuli, including ultraviolet irradiation, cytokine treatment, and exposure to certain chemicals, reflecting the importance of thioredoxin 1 as a cellular stress response protein[18]. This rapid induction of thioredoxin 1 expression enables cells to rapidly augment their antioxidant defense capacity in response to oxidative challenges. Transcriptional regulation of the thioredoxin gene involves the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) and related regulatory sequences recognized by specific transcription factors. Evidence demonstrates that the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) binds to ARE sequences in the thioredoxin gene promoter region and activates transcription of thioredoxin in response to oxidative stress[43]. Hemin-induced activation of thioredoxin gene expression occurs through Nrf2 binding to the ARE, with insertion of mutations in the ARE consensus binding sequence abolishing the response to hemin[43]. Overexpression of Nrf2 augments the hemin-induced response to thioredoxin gene activation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Nrf2 suppresses hemin-induced activation, confirming the role of Nrf2 in thioredoxin regulation[43].

Regulation of thioredoxin 1 also involves metabolic integration through glucose-sensing pathways and insulin signaling. The thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an inhibitor of thioredoxin function, is upregulated in response to high glucose concentrations and oxidative stress, serving as a glucose and oxidative stress sensor[40]. Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 downregulate TXNIP expression in glucose-fed conditions, thereby permitting increased thioredoxin 1 activity and redox-dependent processes required for cell proliferation and metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability[40]. This coupling of thioredoxin 1 activity to metabolic state and glucose availability reflects the integration of redox regulation with cellular metabolism and nutrient sensing.

Thioredoxin 1 protein levels also undergo age-related decline in multiple tissues. Studies of transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing thioredoxin 1 revealed significantly higher Trx1 protein levels in all tissues examined in young mice (4-6 months old), with levels elevated 29-54% compared to wild-type littermates[19]. However, the levels of thioredoxin 1 overexpression decreased substantially in middle-aged (14-16 months old) and old (26-28 months old) mice, indicating age-related attenuation of transgene expression[19]. This age-dependent decline in thioredoxin 1 levels may contribute to increased oxidative stress and reduced resistance to oxidative damage characteristic of aging.

## Thioredoxin 1 as an Extracellular Signaling Molecule

Beyond its intracellular functions, thioredoxin 1 can be unconventionally secreted from cells to function as an extracellular signaling molecule with pleiotropic biological activities[24]. The human thioredoxin 1 was originally identified as the adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), a secreted protein implicated in a wide variety of cell-to-cell communication systems acting as a cytokine or chemokine[24]. The mechanism of secretion of thioredoxin 1 remains largely unconventional, lacking an N-terminal signal peptide that would target it through the classical secretory pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus[24]. Instead, thioredoxin 1 exits cells through alternative pathways involving direct transfer across the plasma membrane or packaging within plasma membrane-derived microvesicles[24]. Once released into extracellular spaces, thioredoxin 1 can interact with cell surface receptors and modulate cellular responses through redox-dependent and redox-independent mechanisms.

Extracellular thioredoxin 1 has been shown to selectively regulate cytokine receptor signaling through direct redox interaction with specific cell surface proteins[21]. Using mechanism-based kinetic trapping techniques to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, researchers discovered that thioredoxin 1 catalytically interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30), a receptor expressed on activated lymphocytes[21]. The redox interaction between extracellular thioredoxin 1 and CD30 proves highly specific for both the cytokine and receptor, and the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals[21]. This discovery reveals that receptor-ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by extracellular redox catalysts, adding a novel dimension to lymphocyte activation and immune regulation.

## Biological Roles in Cell Proliferation and Redox-Dependent Gene Expression

Thioredoxin 1 plays essential roles in promoting cell proliferation through both antioxidant and signaling functions. Transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells with complementary DNA for wild-type human thioredoxin 1 resulted in substantially increased saturation densities compared with vector-transfected cells, indicating enhanced proliferative capacity[57]. Similarly, thioredoxin 1-transfected human MCF-7 breast cancer cells exhibited severalfold increased colony formation in soft agarose, a hallmark assay of transformed phenotype[57]. In contrast, stable transfection of cells with a redox-inactive mutant thioredoxin 1 in which both active-site cysteines were replaced with serines (C32S/C35S) resulted in inhibition of monolayer growth on plastic surfaces and up to 73% inhibition of colony formation by MCF-7 cells in soft agarose[57]. These findings establish that the redox-active catalytic function of thioredoxin 1, rather than structural features of the protein alone, drives enhanced cell proliferation and transformation.

The thioredoxin 1 system operates as a key hub integrating nucleotide biosynthesis with cell proliferation through its role in reducing ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for synthesis of deoxynucleotides essential for DNA synthesis[42]. Upon immune cell activation, immune cells reprogram their metabolism toward increased glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway activity to generate NADPH and biosynthetic precursors required for DNA synthesis[42]. Simultaneously, upregulated thioredoxin 1 shuttles electrons from NADPH to ribonucleotide reductase to support deoxyribonucleotide production, creating a coordinated metabolic and redox response supporting proliferation[42]. Genetic deletion of thioredoxin reductase 1 in activated T cells results in impaired expansion during viral infections and other immune responses, with a recent in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screen identifying thioredoxin reductase 1 as a positive regulator of the antitumor response of CD8+ T cells[42]. These findings highlight the critical importance of thioredoxin 1 system function for lymphocyte proliferation and immune defense.

## Thioredoxin 1 in Cardiovascular Homeostasis and Protection Against Pressure Overload

The heart represents a tissue particularly sensitive to oxidative stress due to its high metabolic rate and continuous contractile activity, conditions that predispose to reactive oxygen species generation[22]. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a dominant-negative thioredoxin 1 mutant, in which the disulfide oxidoreductase activity was selectively diminished while other cellular antioxidant mechanisms remained intact, exhibited baseline cardiac hypertrophy[22]. At three months of age, the left ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio and left ventricular weight-to-tibial length ratio were significantly greater in dominant-negative thioredoxin 1 transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic littermates[22]. The left ventricular cardiac myocyte cross-sectional area demonstrated significant enlargement in these animals, with messenger RNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor and alpha-skeletal actin, markers of fetal-type gene expression characteristic of cardiac hypertrophy, substantially elevated[22]. Critically, histological analysis revealed no significant inflammatory cell infiltration or interstitial fibrosis in the hearts of dominant-negative thioredoxin 1 transgenic mice, indicating that the hypertrophy reflected genuine myocyte enlargement rather than pathological remodeling.

When subjected to pressure overload through transverse aortic banding, dominant-negative thioredoxin 1 transgenic mice exhibited exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy compared to non-transgenic controls, with the percentage increase in left ventricular mass significantly greater after one week of aortic banding[22]. This enhanced hypertrophic response persisted after four weeks of sustained pressure overload, establishing that endogenous thioredoxin 1 negatively regulates the extent of cardiac hypertrophy in response to mechanical stress[22]. The mechanisms underlying this protective effect involve thioredoxin 1 interactions with multiple signaling proteins controlling cardiac growth, including upregulation of nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 and stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α expression, transcriptional events that promote a healthy metabolic phenotype in cardiomyocytes[11]. Additionally, thioredoxin 1 reduces cysteine residues in histone deacetylase 4, facilitating its nuclear import where it downregulates the activity of transcription factors such as NFAT that mediate cardiac hypertrophy[11].

Thioredoxin 1 also controls microRNA expression patterns in the heart, with evidence indicating that thioredoxin 1 inhibits cardiac hypertrophy by upregulating miR-98/let-7, microRNAs that target hypertrophic signaling pathways[11]. Furthermore, thioredoxin 1 demonstrates the capacity to regulate the expression level of SMYD1, a lysine methyltransferase highly expressed in cardiac muscle tissue, potentially exerting indirect effects on protein methylation patterns that contribute to cardiac protection through mechanisms independent of its oxidoreductase activity[11]. This multi-faceted regulation of cardiac gene expression by thioredoxin 1 reflects the complexity of redox-dependent signaling in cardiac tissue.

## Thioredoxin 1 in Nervous System Protection and Neurodegenerative Disease Prevention

The nervous system exhibits particular vulnerability to oxidative stress due to its high lipid content, high metabolic rate, and limited capacity for regeneration of damaged neurons[44]. Numerous studies document altered expression of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin reductase in postmortem brain tissue from patients with various neurodegenerative diseases, with decreased thioredoxin 1 levels associated with accumulation of pathological protein aggregates characteristic of disease[44]. In Alzheimer's disease specifically, low levels of thioredoxin 1 occur in association with amyloid-beta peptide accumulation, suggesting that thioredoxin 1 deficiency represents a critical protective factor permitting disease progression[44]. The decreased expression of thioredoxin 1 documented in both the frontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 regions of Alzheimer's disease patients indicates that thioredoxin 1 loss occurs in brain regions most affected by this devastating disease[44]. Interestingly, while thioredoxin 1 levels decrease in Alzheimer's brain tissue, thioredoxin reductase activity may be increased, presumably representing a compensatory mechanism attempting to attenuate activated oxidative stress pathways despite diminished thioredoxin substrate availability[44].

The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 pathway plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, with thioredoxin 1 directly binding to the N-terminal region of ASK1 and maintaining its inactivation under normal conditions[44]. In the oxidative stress state characteristic of neurodegeneration, thioredoxin 1 dissociation from ASK1 permits ASK1 activation, potentially triggering the neuronal death characteristic of these diseases[44]. The thioredoxin-peroxiredoxin system, functioning together to scavenge hydrogen peroxide and protect mitochondrial DNA in the brain against damage caused by oxidative and nitrative stress, appears critical for neuronal survival[44]. Thus, preservation of thioredoxin 1 function through maintenance of adequate thioredoxin reductase activity and transcriptional expression of thioredoxin 1 itself represents a potentially crucial defense mechanism against neurodegeneration.

## Thioredoxin 1 Regulation of DNA Repair and Genomic Stability

Thioredoxin 1 participates in base excision repair, the primary DNA repair pathway removing oxidative lesions such as 8-oxoguanine and abasic sites generated by reactive oxygen species[45]. Investigation of thioredoxin 1 knockdown cells demonstrated that reduced thioredoxin 1 expression correlated with impaired base excision repair activity and increased cellular susceptibility to DNA damage induced by nitrosomethylurea, a compound generating lesions processed by base excision repair[45]. The mechanism involves thioredoxin 1 modulation of base excision repair through the p53 downstream gene growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45α, with thioredoxin 1 knockdown cells showing decreased expression and interaction of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45α with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1[45]. The reduced apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 activity observed in thioredoxin 1 knockdown cells suggests that thioredoxin 1 might cooperate in controlling apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 function through modulating the p53-mediated base excision repair pathway via the protein-protein interaction between growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45α and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1[45]. This role of thioredoxin 1 in promoting DNA repair activities protects genomic integrity and prevents accumulation of mutations that could otherwise contribute to cancer development or cellular senescence.

## Thioredoxin 1 in Immune Cell Activation and Inflammatory Responses

Thioredoxin 1 serves as an essential regulatory component of immune cell responses, with genetic deletion of thioredoxin reductase 1 resulting in impaired expansion of activated T cells during viral infections and other immune challenges[42]. T cell activation involves massive proliferation during thymic development and upon antigen encounter in secondary lymphoid organs, processes accompanied by upregulation of cellular redox regulators including thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin reductase 1[42]. Upon immune cell activation, immune cells reprogram their redox system and activate the thioredoxin pathway to promote proliferation through sustainment of nucleotide biosynthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway[39]. The thioredoxin 1-thioredoxin reductase 1 system proves largely dispensable for homeostatic maintenance of naive T cells, likely due to their modest requirement for deoxynucleotide biosynthesis through the pentose phosphate pathway[42]. However, the thioredoxin 1 system becomes critically important upon T cell activation, with the transcription factor c-Myc mediating thioredoxin-interacting protein repression and thereby contributing to activation of the thioredoxin 1 system upon T cell receptor triggering[42].

In addition to its role in promoting T cell proliferation, thioredoxin 1 regulates the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways critical for inflammatory responses in myeloid cells[39][42]. Thioredoxin 1 positively regulates the binding of NF-κB to target DNA, promoting transcriptional activity of target genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines including pro-interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha[42]. At the same time, low levels of reactive oxygen species that release thioredoxin 1 from thioredoxin-interacting protein-mediated inhibition lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1β secretion through both thioredoxin 1 scavenging of excessive reactive oxygen species that would otherwise prevent inflammasome formation and potentially through thioredoxin-interacting protein interacting with NLRP3 to enhance interleukin-1β production[42]. During the resolution phase of immune responses, thioredoxin 1 performs the critical function of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species, thereby preventing excessive tissue damage after pathogen clearance[42]. This dual role of thioredoxin 1 in promoting initial pro-inflammatory responses while subsequently limiting excessive inflammation reflects the nuanced involvement of redox regulation in controlling immune homeostasis.

## Thioredoxin 1 in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Function and Radiation Protection

Thioredoxin 1 has emerged as a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function, with studies employing thioredoxin 1 conditional knockout mouse models demonstrating that deletion of thioredoxin 1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells activates the p53 apoptosis signaling pathway and attenuates the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis[28]. Treatment of mice with recombinant thioredoxin 1 promotes proliferation and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, and administration of recombinant thioredoxin 1 within twenty-four hours following lethal total body irradiation rescues mice from radiation-induced lethality[28]. Ex vivo culture of murine hematopoietic stem cells with recombinant thioredoxin 1 enhances hematopoietic stem cell long-term repopulation capacity, suggesting that thioredoxin 1 directly supports hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and radioprotection[28]. These findings establish thioredoxin 1 as a potential therapeutic agent for enhancing hematopoietic recovery in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and protecting hematopoietic stem cells from radiation injury.

The mechanism underlying thioredoxin 1 protection of hematopoietic stem cells involves the thioredoxin 1-p53 tumor suppressor axis, with deletion of thioredoxin 1 causing activation of p53 signaling and increased hematopoietic stem cell sensitivity to radiation and other stresses[28]. This regulatory relationship reveals a sophisticated balance whereby thioredoxin 1 maintains hematopoietic stem cell fitness by suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis under normal conditions, while still permitting appropriate p53 responses to severe damage that warrants elimination of compromised cells[28]. The clinical potential of thioredoxin 1 for radiation protection and enhancement of hematopoietic recovery in hematopoietic stem cell transplant settings represents a promising application of understanding thioredoxin 1 biology in the context of stem cell medicine.

## Thioredoxin 1 Overexpression, Longevity, and Oxidative Stress Resistance

Transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing thioredoxin 1 demonstrated significantly higher thioredoxin 1 protein levels in all tissues examined, including brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney[19]. These mice showed significant correlation between increased thioredoxin 1 levels and increased resistance to endogenous oxidative stress, as evidenced by reduced oxidative damage to proteins and lipids measured through quantification of malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine[19]. Young thioredoxin 1 overexpressing mice maintained increased reduced thioredoxin 1 in liver tissue compared to wild-type littermates, correlating with increased thioredoxin reductase activity, without altering the redox state of glutathione, the other major antioxidant system[19]. The overexpression of thioredoxin 1 did not alter the redox state of free cysteine or glutathione in plasma, suggesting that thioredoxin 1 overexpression exerts compartment-specific effects on redox homeostasis rather than broadly affecting all cellular thiols[19].

Despite the substantial increase in oxidative stress resistance conferred by thioredoxin 1 overexpression, these animals did not demonstrate extended maximum life span[19]. However, the increased levels of thioredoxin 1 correlated with increased resistance to oxidative stress, which proved beneficial to survival during the earlier part of the life span in the C57BL/6 mice studied[19]. This finding suggests that while thioredoxin 1 overexpression can enhance resistance to oxidative damage and extend the healthspan of mice, other factors independent of thioredoxin 1 activity ultimately limit maximum life span. The mitochondrial thioredoxin system appeared dispensable for longevity in these experiments, as the overexpression of thioredoxin 1 did not alter mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 levels or function.

## Evolution and Conservation of Thioredoxin Structure and Function

The exceptional conservation of thioredoxin sequences throughout evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes testifies to the fundamental importance of this protein in cellular redox regulation. The thioredoxin fold represents one of the most abundantly distributed protein structures in all organisms, appearing in glutaredoxins, protein-disulfide isomerases, oxidoreductases, and other enzymes involved in disulfide bond catalysis[52]. This structural conservation reflects the ancient evolutionary origin of the thioredoxin-like scaffolding and its successful adaptation to accommodate diverse catalytic functions depending on the specific electrostatic and steric environment created by amino acids in the vicinity of the active site[52]. The extended active-site motif controlling reactivity of the thioredoxin fold depends critically on the electrostatic features imposed by residues flanking the CXXC catalytic center, enabling fine-tuning of reduction potential and substrate specificity[52].

In mammals, the presence of multiple thioredoxin isoforms with distinct subcellular localizations represents an evolutionary adaptation enabling sophisticated compartmentalization of redox control. The cytosolic thioredoxin 1 and the mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 evolved to serve the specific redox requirements of their respective compartments, with functional redundancy between the two systems in some contexts and specialized functions in others[12]. This evolutionary conservation of thioredoxin structure combined with diversification of function across multiple isoforms illustrates a fundamental principle of protein evolution whereby conserved molecular architectures become adapted to serve novel functions through subtle modifications in regulatory sequences and subcellular targeting.

## Conclusion and Integration of Thioredoxin 1 Multifunctional Biology

The thioredoxin 1 protein encoded by the mouse Txn1 gene represents a multifunctional redox regulator of exceptional importance for cellular homeostasis and responses to stress. Operating through highly conserved catalytic mechanisms involving sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, thioredoxin 1 reduces an extraordinary diversity of substrate proteins spanning enzymatic oxidoreductases, transcription factors, regulatory kinases, and other functional categories. The substrate versatility of thioredoxin 1 emerges from its potent reducing capacity, its favorable reduction potential, and its ability to form productive interactions with numerous target proteins bearing oxidized cysteines. Compartmentalization of the thioredoxin 1-thioredoxin reductase 1 system primarily to the cytoplasm and nucleus enables specialized redox control appropriate to these environments, while the mitochondrial thioredoxin 2 system provides analogous redox regulation in mitochondria.

The regulation of thioredoxin 1 expression through antioxidant response elements and its enhancement in response to oxidative stress creates a physiologically responsive system that amplifies antioxidant defenses during periods of elevated reactive oxygen species generation. The interaction between thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin-interacting protein integrates thioredoxin 1 function with metabolic state and nutrient availability, linking redox regulation to cellular metabolism. The multiple roles of thioredoxin 1 in controlling cell survival versus apoptosis through interactions with ASK1 and numerous transcription factors enable sophisticated integration of redox status with apoptotic signaling, permitting cells to survive manageable oxidative challenges while triggering apoptosis when damage becomes irreparable.

The therapeutic potential of thioredoxin 1 in protecting against ischemic injury, radiation damage, hematopoietic recovery, and neurodegenerative disease emerges from its central roles in antioxidant defense and cell survival signaling. Future investigations should focus on elucidating how the multiple catalytic and non-catalytic functions of thioredoxin 1 become dynamically regulated in response to specific cellular stresses, how thioredoxin 1 activity becomes integrated with other cellular signaling pathways, and how tissue-specific thioredoxin 1 expression patterns contribute to specialized redox requirements of different organs. Understanding the precise mechanisms whereby thioredoxin 1 maintains cellular reducing environments, prevents oxidative damage, and regulates stress-responsive gene expression will enable development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the thioredoxin system for treatment of oxidative stress-mediated disorders and enhancement of cellular regeneration and stress resistance.
