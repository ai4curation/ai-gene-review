description: Mouse thioredoxin-1 (Trx1/Txn1) is a small (~12 kDa) ubiquitous oxidoreductase
  that plays a central role in cellular redox homeostasis. The protein contains the conserved
  active site motif CGPC (Cys32-Gly-Pro-Cys35) within a canonical thioredoxin fold, enabling
  it to catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. The catalytic mechanism involves
  nucleophilic attack by Cys32 on substrate disulfide bonds, forming a mixed disulfide
  intermediate that is resolved by Cys35, releasing the reduced substrate while forming
  an intramolecular disulfide in Trx1. The oxidized Trx1 is regenerated by thioredoxin
  reductase using NADPH. Major physiological substrates include peroxiredoxins (for H2O2
  detoxification), ribonucleotide reductase (for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis), and oxidized
  proteins. Mouse Txn1 interacts with TXNIP through its redox-active site, and also interacts
  with MAP3K5 (ASK1) and CASP3. Trx1 regulates transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kB via
  interaction with APEX1/Ref-1 and modulates apoptosis. The protein is predominantly
  cytosolic but translocates to the nucleus upon cellular stress, and is also secreted
  via a leaderless pathway.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping. Trx1 does not directly
      participate in transcription but regulates transcription factor DNA-binding activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This term is too direct - Trx1 does not function as a transcription factor
      or directly in the transcription machinery. Instead, it regulates transcription
      factor activity through redox mechanisms via interaction with APEX1/Ref-1.

      redox homeostasis.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While Trx1 does contribute to cellular homeostasis, the more specific and
      accurate term is GO:0045454 (cell redox homeostasis), which precisely describes
      the function of the thioredoxin system.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000107
  review:
    summary: Annotation transferred from human ortholog.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This GO term describes an enzyme that directly uses NAD(P)H to reduce
      protein disulfides. However, Trx1 itself does not directly use NADPH - it is
      reduced by thioredoxin reductase which uses NADPH. The correct term is GO:0015035
      (protein-disulfide reductase activity).
