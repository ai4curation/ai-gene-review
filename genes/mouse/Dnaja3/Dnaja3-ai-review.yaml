description: >-
  Dnaja3 (also known as Tid1 or mTid-1) is a mitochondrial DnaJ/HSP40 family co-chaperone
  (subfamily A, member 3) that functions as a J-domain co-chaperone for mitochondrial HSP70
  (HSPA9/mortalin/GRP75). It is the mouse homolog of Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56.
  Through its conserved J domain, Dnaja3 activates the ATPase activity of HSPA9 and delivers
  substrate proteins, including DNA polymerase gamma (Polg), which is critical for
  mitochondrial DNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis. Dnaja3 knockout is embryonic
  lethal (PMID:14993262), and cardiac-specific deletion causes dilated cardiomyopathy with
  progressive respiratory chain deficiency and decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number
  (PMID:16327803). Dnaja3 also plays roles in T cell development (PMID:15879105), cellular
  senescence via NF-kappaB signaling (PMID:15572682), neuromuscular junction development
  via interaction with MuSK (PMID:19038220), and modulation of apoptosis in an
  isoform-dependent manner. Three alternatively spliced isoforms exist with opposing effects
  on apoptosis: isoform 1 (Tid-1L) is pro-apoptotic while isoform 2 (Tid-1S) is anti-apoptotic.
  The protein also interacts with Ras GTPase-activating protein (RASA1/GAP) (PMID:11116152).

      activity of HSP70 partner proteins (HSPA9/mortalin in this case), but Dnaja3 itself is
      not an ATPase or ATP-binding protein. This is a systematic over-annotation from the

      IDA annotation for GTPase regulator activity from PMID:11116152. Dnaja3 binds
      RasGAP, but the evidence suggests Dnaja3 may influence GAP activity rather than

      The paper (PMID:11116152) describes Dnaja3 as a novel GAP-binding protein that may

      demonstrate direct GTPase regulator activity by Dnaja3 itself. The interaction with
      GAP could influence Ras signaling indirectly through co-chaperone-mediated effects
      on GAP, but annotating Dnaja3 as having GTPase regulator activity overstates the
