description: Cftr (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is an ATP-gated anion channel that conducts chloride
  and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell membranes. Unlike most ABC transporters, CFTR functions as an ion channel rather
  than an active pump. Essential for fluid secretion in airways, pancreas, and intestine. Mouse Cftr is used as a model for
  cystic fibrosis disease mechanisms and therapeutic development.
