description: Hspa8 (also known as Hsc70 or Hsc73) is the constitutively expressed member of the HSP70 family
  of molecular chaperones in mouse. It functions as an ATP-dependent foldase chaperone that uses
  nucleotide-driven conformational changes to bind and release unfolded or misfolded substrate proteins,
  promoting their correct folding. Hspa8 plays central roles in protein quality control, chaperone-mediated
  autophagy (CMA) where it recognizes KFERQ motifs on substrate proteins for lysosomal degradation,
  clathrin coat disassembly via its interaction with auxilin (DNAJC6), protein disaggregation (with HSPH1),
  and as a component of the spliceosomal PRP19-CDC5L complex. It is also involved in SNARE complex
  assembly at presynaptic terminals through the CSPalpha-Hsc70-SGT chaperone complex, and in late
  endosomal microautophagy. Mouse Hspa8 protein sequence is nearly identical to human HSPA8 (P11142).
