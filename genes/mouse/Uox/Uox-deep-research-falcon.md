## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P25688
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Uricase; EC=1.7.3.3; AltName: Full=Urate oxidase;
- **Gene Information:** Name=Uox;
- **Organism (full):** Mus musculus (Mouse).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the uricase family. .
- **Key Domains:** Uricase. (IPR002042); Uricase_CS. (IPR019842); Uricase (PF01014)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Uox" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Mus musculus (Mouse).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Uox' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Uox** (gene ID: Uox, UniProt: P25688) in mouse.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Mouse Uox (Uricase; EC 1.7.3.3) — function, localization, pathways, phenotypes, and translational relevance

Identity verification and core definitions
- Gene/protein identity and organism: The mouse Uox gene encodes urate oxidase (uricase; EC 1.7.3.3), a tetrameric enzyme in terrestrial vertebrates that oxidizes uric acid in purine catabolism; apes/humans have lost uricase activity by pseudogenization, but rodents, including mouse (Mus musculus), retain functional Uox (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111). In terrestrial vertebrates, uricase is a peroxisomal matrix protein that can form an insoluble crystalloid core in hepatic peroxisomes, consistent with peroxisomal localization of mammalian Uox (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1).

- Enzymatic reaction and mechanism: Uox catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to 5‑hydroxyisourate (5‑HIU) using molecular oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide as the reduced product of O2; the reaction is cofactor independent (no metal or organic redox cofactor) in canonical fungal/mammalian-type uricases (PLoS ONE, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086651; Acta Cryst D, 2010; https://doi.org/10.1107/S090744491001142X) (oksanen2014theneutronstructure pages 1-2, gabison2010nearatomicresolutionstructures pages 1-2). High-resolution neutron and X‑ray structures resolve the active-site protonation and show urate binds as the N3-monoanion, tautomerizes to 8‑hydroxyxanthine, undergoes deprotonation/electron transfer to O2 to yield a peroxide/dehydrourate intermediate, and then forms 5‑HIU via a proton-relay network involving a conserved K10–T57–H256 triad and structured waters (PLoS ONE, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086651) (oksanen2014theneutronstructure pages 8-9). Near-atomic structures from Aspergillus uricase corroborate tetrameric architecture and cofactor-independence (Acta Cryst D, 2010; https://doi.org/10.1107/S090744491001142X) (gabison2010nearatomicresolutionstructures pages 1-2). Evolutionary/biochemical context further supports 5‑HIU as the primary product that is subsequently converted (enzymatically or non‑enzymatically) to allantoin (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1).

Subcellular localization and tissue context
- Subcellular localization: In terrestrial vertebrates, including rodents, uricase resides in peroxisomes and forms a core peroxisomal crystalloid in hepatocytes, consistent with peroxisomal matrix localization (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1).
- Tissue expression: Mouse liver is the dominant site examined for Uox expression and functional knockout studies; liver tissue was used to verify absence of Uox transcripts and protein in CRISPR Uox−/− mice, consistent with liver-predominant expression (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12265-024-10526-6) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 3-5, zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3). Peroxisomal hepatic localization is also supported by classic localization literature cited in evolutionary analyses (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 6-6). 

Biochemical pathway context
- Pathway position: In mammalian purine catabolism, xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH/XO; XOR) generates uric acid from hypoxanthine/xanthine; peroxisomal Uox oxidizes urate to 5‑HIU, which is converted to allantoin. Rodents thus catabolize urate further, unlike humans. Structural/evolution/evidence syntheses place uricase downstream of XOR and within peroxisomal uricolysis (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111; PLoS ONE, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086651) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1, oksanen2014theneutronstructure pages 1-2, oksanen2014theneutronstructure pages 8-9).

Mouse phenotypes and in vivo function (recent evidence prioritized)
- Whole-body knockout (Uox−/−): A 2024 CRISPR/Cas9 mouse deleting Uox exons 2–4 on C57BL/6J produced severe hyperuricemia (3‑week SUA 1351.04 ± 276.58 μmol/L; ~5.5‑fold above WT) and early lethality by ~4 weeks; post‑genotyping allopurinol rescue (3 μg/g daily) reduced SUA to 612.55 ± 146.98 μmol/L at 8 weeks and enabled phenotyping (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12265-024-10526-6) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 3-5, zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3). Rescued Uox−/− mice displayed: 
  - Renal: marked renal insufficiency (blood urea 21.35 ± 1.50 vs 13.54 ± 0.57 mmol/L; creatinine 24.20 ± 1.45 vs 10.68 ± 0.72 mmol/L), tubular necrosis/casts, interstitial hemorrhage, glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis, and birefringent urate crystals with immune infiltrates (CD3+, CD68+) (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 5-7).
  - Cardiometabolic/vascular: systolic hypertension (~155 vs ~110 mmHg), LV remodeling with systolic dysfunction (reduced EF/FS), aortic endothelial dysfunction (reduced ZO‑1/VE‑cadherin), and dysmetabolism (hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia) (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 5-7, zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 3-5).
  - Hepatic: elevated AST/ALT, hepatocyte ballooning, and steatosis (Oil‑Red‑O) (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 5-7).
  These results reinforce Uox’s essential role in controlling systemic urate and preventing urate nephropathy and multisystem sequelae.
- Comparative/evolutionary evidence: Evolutionary analyses confirm hominoid UOX loss with resulting higher circulating urate, whereas rodents retain peroxisomal uricase; ancestral reconstructions show progressive activity decline along primate lineages and document peroxisomal localization in vertebrate liver (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1, kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 6-6). Contemporary reviews also note typical mammalian urate levels lower than humans due to active uricase (J Pers Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13091409) (roman2023theroleof pages 1-2).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and translational applications
- Therapeutic uricases and immunogenicity management:
  - Expert review (2023): Nature Reviews Rheumatology synthesizes the rationale for uricase use in refractory gout, highlighting immunogenicity to both the uricase protein and PEG carrier as a key limitation of pegloticase and discussing strategies (co‑therapy, immunomodulation) to improve persistence (Nat Rev Rheumatol, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-023-01006-3) (oh2018diatomallantoinsynthase pages 19-21).
  - Real-world and registry outcomes after discontinuation: In a large US registry analysis (RISE, 2016–2022) of 375 gout patients discontinuing pegloticase, 86% used oral ULTs post‑discontinuation; only ~51% of those reached SUA < 6 mg/dL after ≥30 days of ULT, whereas 58.3% of those who restarted pegloticase again achieved SUA < 6 mg/dL (median SUA 0.9 mg/dL) (Arthritis Res Ther, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-024-03318-5) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3).
  - Engineered albumin‑conjugated uricase: PAT101 (site‑specific recombinant human albumin–conjugated Aspergillus flavus Uox) showed >2× longer half‑life than pegloticase in transgenic mice, higher retained activity on repeat dosing in rats (86% vs 24% for rasburicase), comparable survival to pegloticase in Uox‑KO model, and reduced in vitro T‑cell activation vs rasburicase (Arthritis Res Ther, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-023-03231-3) (roman2023theroleof pages 1-2).
  - mRNA uricase replacement: An ionizable lipid nanoparticle mRNA approach (mUox@iLAND) delivered hepatic Uox expression and, with a single dose, lowered serum urate for weeks in two murine hyperuricemia models, with supportive metabolomics and favorable safety profiles (Nat Commun, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50752-9) ().
  - Catalysis-mimicking nanozymes: A 2024 Nature Communications report engineered a metal–ligand dual‑site single‑atom nanozyme (Ni‑DAB) to mimic urate oxidase’s dual binding of urate and O2, achieving high substrate specificity and demonstrating a urine‑powered biofuel cell as a potential application (Nat Commun, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50123-4) ().

- Clinical use cases and safety:
  - Mechanistic expert synthesis notes pegloticase’s efficacy in refractory gout tempered by immunogenicity to uricase and PEG; strategies include co‑therapy and tolerogenic approaches (Nat Rev Rheumatol, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-023-01006-3) (oh2018diatomallantoinsynthase pages 19-21).
  - Post‑pegloticase management data (registry) quantify treatment gaps and the proportion re‑achieving target urate on restarting pegloticase (Arthritis Res Ther, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-024-03318-5) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023) emphasizes that immunogenicity (anti‑uricase and anti‑PEG) is the principal limiter of pegloticase, motivating adjunct immunomodulation and new formulations to sustain urate‑lowering (Nat Rev Rheumatol, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-023-01006-3) (oh2018diatomallantoinsynthase pages 19-21).
- Evolutionary/structural work (PNAS, 2014) frames uricase as a peroxisomal hepatic enzyme whose loss in hominoids reshaped urate homeostasis; ancestral reconstructions and functional assays inform bioengineering of uricases with potentially favorable properties (PNAS, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320393111) (kratzer2014evolutionaryhistoryand pages 1-1).
- Personalized medicine–focused review (2023) reiterates the double‑edged role of urate (antioxidant vs risk factor), the consequences of UOX loss in humans, and therapeutic use of exogenous uricases (J Pers Med, 2023; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13091409) (roman2023theroleof pages 1-2).

Key quantitative data and statistics (recent where available)
- Uox−/− mouse (CRISPR 2024):
  - SUA 3‑week Uox−/−: 1351.04 ± 276.58 μmol/L (~5.5× WT); post‑allopurinol at 8 weeks: 612.55 ± 146.98 μmol/L (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12265-024-10526-6) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 3-5, zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3).
  - Renal indices (allopurinol‑rescued Uox−/− vs WT): blood urea 21.35 ± 1.50 vs 13.54 ± 0.57 mmol/L; creatinine 24.20 ± 1.45 vs 10.68 ± 0.72 mmol/L; systolic BP ~155 vs ~110 mmHg; multiple histopathologic lesions including urate crystals (J Cardiovasc Transl Res, 2024) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 5-7).
- Post‑pegloticase registry outcomes (2016–2022): Among 375 discontinuers, 86% initiated oral ULTs; only ~51% achieved SUA < 6 mg/dL ≥30 days after ULT initiation; 58.3% restarting pegloticase reached SUA < 6 mg/dL (median SUA 0.9 mg/dL; IQR 0.2–9.7) (Arthritis Res Ther, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-024-03318-5) (zeng2024crisprcas9mediateddeletion pages 1-3).
- Engineered albumin–uricase (PAT101): >2× half‑life vs pegloticase in TG mice; 86% vs 24% retained activity after repeat dosing vs rasburicase in rats; lower T‑cell activation than rasburicase in human PBMC assays (Arthritis Res Ther, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-023-03231-3) (roman2023theroleof pages 1-2).

Conclusions
Mouse Uox encodes a peroxisomal hepatic urate oxidase that catalyzes cofactor‑independent oxidation of urate to 5‑hydroxyisourate with O2 reduction to H2O2, using a well‑resolved catalytic triad and water‑mediated proton relay. In vivo, Uox is essential for preventing systemic urate accumulation; Uox−/− mice develop profound hyperuricemia with early lethality unless rescued, and they manifest renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, and metabolic injuries that model human hyperuricemia sequelae. Recent advances focus on overcoming immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic limits of therapeutic uricases (albumin conjugation, tolerogenic co‑therapies) and on novel delivery modalities (mRNA Uox), while mechanistic/structural insights continue to guide rational enzyme and nanozyme design. The evolutionary loss of UOX in hominoids underpins the higher human urate setpoint, highlighting the translational relevance of mouse Uox for therapy development.
