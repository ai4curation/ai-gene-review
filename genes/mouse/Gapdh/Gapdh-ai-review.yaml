description: Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a classic moonlighting
  protein that functions primarily as a key glycolytic enzyme while also participating
  in diverse non-metabolic processes. As a glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH catalyzes the
  reversible conversion of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) to 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl
  phosphate using NAD+ as cofactor (EC 1.2.1.12). The protein forms a homotetramer
  and is abundantly expressed in all tissues. Beyond glycolysis, GAPDH has moonlighting
  functions in translation regulation as a component of the GAIT complex, in innate
  immunity through interaction with TRAF2/TRAF3 to promote NF-kappaB activation and
  type I interferon production, and in nuclear events including transcription, RNA
  transport, DNA replication, and apoptosis. The nuclear functions are mediated by
  S-nitrosylase activity that transfers NO groups to nuclear targets SIRT1, HDAC2,
  and PRKDC. S-nitrosylation at Cys-150 promotes interaction with SIAH1 and nuclear
  translocation. GAPDH also associates with microtubules via CHP1 and modulates
  cytoskeletal organization. Sulfhydration at Cys-150 increases catalytic activity.
