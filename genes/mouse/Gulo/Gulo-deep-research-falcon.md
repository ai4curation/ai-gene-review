## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P58710
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=L-gulonolactone oxidase; Short=LGO; EC=1.1.3.8; AltName: Full=L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase; Short=GLO;
- **Gene Information:** Name=Gulo;
- **Organism (full):** Mus musculus (Mouse).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the oxygen-dependent FAD-linked oxidoreductase
- **Key Domains:** ALO_C. (IPR007173); FAD-bd_PCMH. (IPR016166); FAD-bd_PCMH-like_sf. (IPR036318); FAD-bd_PCMH_sub1. (IPR016167); FAD-bd_PCMH_sub2. (IPR016169)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Gulo" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Mus musculus (Mouse).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Gulo' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Gulo** (gene ID: Gulo, UniProt: P58710) in mouse.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: The target matches UniProt P58710: mouse Gulo encodes L‑gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), EC 1.1.3.8, a microsomal/endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) flavoenzyme of the aldonolactone oxidoreductase family with N‑terminal FAD-binding and C‑terminal HWXK motifs, catalyzing the terminal step of vitamin C biosynthesis; this aligns with recent mechanistic reviews and primary work in mammals (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).

Comprehensive research report: Mouse Gulo (UniProt P58710)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Protein/gene and enzyme class: Gulo encodes L‑gulono‑γ‑lactone oxidase (GULO), a VAO/aldonolactone oxidoreductase (AlOR) family FAD enzyme that converts L‑gulono‑1,4‑lactone (GUL) to L‑ascorbate (vitamin C) using O2 as electron acceptor, generating H2O2; catalytic activity corresponds to EC 1.1.3.8 (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).
- Reaction and substrate specificity: Terminal step of the mammalian ascorbate pathway: L‑gulono‑1,4‑lactone + O2 → L‑ascorbate + H2O2; preference for L‑gulono‑1,4‑lactone, with in‑vitro oxidase/dehydrogenase activity also reported for related aldonolactones in the AlOR family (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657; Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/life15020238) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gradinaru2025vitamincfrom pages 16-17, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).
- Cofactor and domains: Mammalian GULOs are FAD‑dependent, typically with covalently bound 8α‑N1‑histidyl‑FAD; conserved architecture includes an N‑terminal FAD‑binding region and a C‑terminal ALO catalytic domain harboring a hallmark HWXK motif implicated in flavin binding and catalysis (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).
- Subcellular localization: GULO is localized to microsomes/ER and functions as an integral membrane protein with its active site oriented to the ER lumen, where products are discharged; historical purifications detected activity in liver microsomes of mammals (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9).
- Tissue/organ expression: In mammals, Gulo expression and enzymatic activity are centered in liver (contrast: kidney in birds/reptiles); mouse and rat Gulo transgenes restore vitamin C biosynthesis in deficient systems, underscoring hepatic locus of function in rodents (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 1-2).
- Pathway placement: GULO catalyzes the terminal oxidation step of the UDP‑glucuronate → D‑glucuronate → L‑gulonate → L‑gulono‑1,4‑lactone → L‑ascorbate pathway, coupling O2 reduction to H2O2 formation. The H2O2 byproduct links GULO activity to ER redox/oxidative folding processes (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Liver omics (2024): Integrated transcriptomics/proteomics in Gulo−/− mice supplied with sub‑optimal vs optimal ascorbate revealed sex‑dependent effects. Hepatic ascorbate positively correlates with lipid/xenobiotic/organic acid/acetyl‑CoA/steroid metabolism proteins (primarily transcriptional, especially in females), while multiple mitochondrial complex III subunits (Uqcrh, Uqcrb, Uqcrc1/2, Uqcr10, Uqcrq, Uqcrfs1, Cyc1) correlate with ascorbate at the protein but not mRNA level, indicating post‑transcriptional regulation; polysome profiling showed no differential ribosome loading of these mRNAs (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 1-2, aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 12-14).
- Multi‑organ proteomics and sex specificity (2024): A proteomic atlas of brain, heart, liver, spleen in Gulo−/− mice mapped organ‑ and sex‑specific protein abundance correlations with serum vitamin C. Findings include: ferritin complex subunits positively correlated with serum vitamin C across organs, whereas mitochondrial complex III–vitamin C correlations were liver‑specific; one‑month vitamin C rescue largely normalized organ proteomes; strong sexual dimorphism was observed by PCA across all tissues (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 7-10, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 21-23, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 23-24, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 24-25, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 1-2).
- Mitochondrial and ER stress context: Prior and referenced work within these 2024 studies report that ascorbate deficiency in Gulo−/− males induces hepatic mitochondrial morphological abnormalities and ER stress markers, consistent with impaired complex III activity, reduced ATP output, and increased oxidative stress under deficiency (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 1-2, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Disease‑relevant modeling: Gulo−/− mice enable a human‑like dependence on dietary vitamin C to interrogate deficiency and repletion in controlled settings. 2024 liver and multi‑organ studies implemented stepwise withdrawal and graded repletion in drinking water, enabling quantitative mapping of ascorbate‑responsive pathways with sex resolution, informing non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)–related biology (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 1-2, aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 12-14, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 1-2).
- Translational utility: Proteomic and transcriptomic signatures under sub‑optimal vs optimal ascorbate identify mitochondrial complex III proteins and lipid/sterol/xenobiotic metabolic pathways as vitamin C–responsive nodes in liver, offering biomarkers and mechanistic targets for dietary or pharmacologic interventions that manipulate systemic or hepatic ascorbate status (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 1-2, aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 12-14, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 7-10, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 23-24).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Enzymology and localization consensus: Reviews emphasize that mammalian GULO is a microsomal/ER‑associated, membrane‑embedded, FAD‑dependent aldonolactone oxidoreductase with a conserved C‑terminal HWXK motif, catalyzing GUL→ascorbate with H2O2 generation and with the active site facing the ER lumen. These properties are conserved across vertebrate GULO orthologs and underlie the enzyme’s integration into ER redox metabolism (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).
- Evolutionary and physiological framing: Authoritative perspectives summarize that mammalian vitamin C biosynthesis localizes predominantly to liver, with species‑specific losses of Gulo (e.g., primates, guinea pigs) conferring dietary dependence; mechanistically, the H2O2 byproduct situates GULO at the interface of antioxidant demand and ER oxidative folding/ROS homeostasis (Feb 2025; https://doi.org/10.3390/life15020238) (gradinaru2025vitamincfrom pages 16-17).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (2024)
- Liver integrated omics: Among proteins with matched transcripts (n=2,607 females; n=2,496 males), Spearman correlation analyses (|rho| ≥ 0.46876 threshold used) revealed more ascorbate‑correlated functional modules in females (13) than males (3). Shared positive protein correlations across sexes included eight complex III subunits (Uqcrh, Uqcrb, Uqcrc1, Uqcrc2, Uqcr10, Uqcrq, Uqcrfs1, Cyc1). NAFLD pathway enrichment among positively correlated proteins showed very low FDR; inversely correlated shared proteins included complement components (C4b, Mbl2; FDR = 0.0194) (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 12-14).
- Multi‑organ atlas and sex specificity: Proteomic responses to declining serum vitamin C were both organ‑ and sex‑specific. In brain, male‑specific positive correlations with lipid metabolism/glycolysis and negative correlations with complex I proteins suggested altered bioenergetics in males; in liver, complex III proteins correlated positively with serum vitamin C in both sexes, consistent with post‑transcriptional regulation; ferritin subunits were among the few complexes with positive correlations across all four organs. Vitamin C rescue for one month re‑clustered proteomes toward replete states. Analyses used LFQ intensities with Spearman correlations (p<0.05) and applied ≥1.5‑fold thresholds for group contrasts; select serum markers (e.g., Ftl1, S100a9) differed by Welch’s t‑test (N=3/sex/group; p<0.05) (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 7-10, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 21-23, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 23-24, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 24-25, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 1-2).

Mechanistic and localization summary for Gulo (mouse)
- Enzyme: L‑gulonolactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.8), terminal ascorbate biosynthesis step: L‑gulono‑1,4‑lactone + O2 → L‑ascorbate + H2O2; FAD‑dependent AlOR enzyme with N‑terminal FAD‑binding region and C‑terminal HWXK motif; integral ER/microsomal membrane protein with luminally oriented active site; predominant tissue locus in mammalian liver (Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657) (gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11).

Notes on evidence base and limitations
- The 2024 primary studies provide organ‑ and sex‑resolved quantitative maps of ascorbate‑responsive proteomes/transcriptomes in Gulo−/− mice under controlled deficiency and repletion, but most mechanistic enzymology/localization details derive from reviews and historical biochemical studies consolidated in 2024–2025 reviews; mouse‑specific kinetic constants and high‑resolution structures remain limited in these sources (May 2024; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40659-024-00509-x; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb46100657; Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311857) (aumailley2024combinedtranscriptomicsand pages 1-2, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 5-7, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 7-9, gad2024lgulonoγlactoneoxidasethe pages 9-11, aumailley2024sexandorgan pages 7-10).
