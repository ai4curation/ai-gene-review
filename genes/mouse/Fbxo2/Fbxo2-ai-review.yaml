description: >-
  Fbxo2 (also known as Fbs1, Fbx2, NFB42) is the substrate-recognition component of the
  SCF(Fbxo2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (SKP1-CUL1-FBXO2-RBX1). It functions
  primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it
  recognizes and binds N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides on misfolded glycoproteins
  that have been retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol. The sugar-binding domain
  (FBA domain) recognizes Man3GlcNAc2 (the innermost chitobiose core of N-glycans), and
  binding is enhanced when glycoproteins are denatured because denaturation exposes the
  normally buried chitobiose structure (PMID:15723043, PMID:14990996). Fbxo2 is NOT a
  chaperone; it is a glycoprotein sensor that targets substrates for ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation. It also prevents cytosolic aggregation of retrotranslocated
  glycoproteins (PMID:17215248). In neurons, Fbxo2 mediates activity-dependent degradation
  of NMDA receptor NR1 subunits at glutamatergic synapses (PMID:15809437). Expression is
  enriched in brain and cochlea; Fbxo2 knockout mice develop progressive hearing loss due
  to cochlear cell degeneration (PMID:17494702). Fbxo2 also associates with p97/VCP AAA
  ATPase for substrate extraction from the ER membrane (PMID:15723043).

      IBA annotation for involvement in the ERAD pathway. This is a core function of Fbxo2,
      well-established by multiple experimental papers. Fbxo2 recognizes N-glycans on

      IBA annotation for ubiquitin protein ligase activity with qualifier "contributes_to".
      Fbxo2 is the substrate recognition component of the SCF(Fbxo2) E3 ligase complex; it
      does not itself possess catalytic E3 ligase activity but contributes to the complex's
      activity by conferring substrate specificity (PMID:12140560, PMID:17389369).

      While "contributes_to" ubiquitin protein ligase activity is technically defensible as
      Fbxo2 is a subunit of an active E3 ligase complex, the more precise molecular function
      of Fbxo2 is as a ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor. GO:1990756 "ubiquitin-like
      ligase-substrate adaptor activity" better captures Fbxo2's actual role: bringing
      together the E3 ligase and its substrate through glycan recognition.

      IDA annotation for denatured protein binding. GO:0031249 is being obsoleted. Yoshida
      et al. (PMID:15723043) showed that Fbs1 and Fbs2 "interacted with denatured
      glycoproteins...more efficiently than native proteins" and proposed that "Fbs proteins
      distinguish native from unfolded glycoproteins by sensing the exposed chitobiose
      structure." Critically, this is NOT general denatured protein binding. Fbxo2 recognizes
      the N-glycan (chitobiose core) that becomes exposed upon glycoprotein denaturation.
      It does not bind non-glycosylated denatured proteins and is not a chaperone.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0031249 is being obsoleted and is inaccurate for Fbxo2 regardless. Fbxo2 does not
      bind denatured proteins in general -- it binds the N-glycan moiety on denatured
      glycoproteins. The enhanced binding to denatured vs native glycoproteins is because
      denaturation exposes the normally protein-buried chitobiose core of N-glycans. The
      actual molecular function is carbohydrate/oligosaccharide binding (already annotated
      as GO:0030246) and ubiquitin-like ligase-substrate adaptor activity (GO:1990756).
      Alternatively, GO:0051787 "misfolded protein binding" could apply in a loose sense,
      but this also misrepresents the mechanism since Fbxo2 recognizes the glycan, not the
      protein moiety. The best replacement is the oligosaccharide binding term combined with
      the substrate adaptor activity.

      This paper screened a lambdagt11 mouse brain cDNA library using a PrP-alkaline
      phosphatase fusion probe to find candidate prion protein binding partners. Six
      clones were isolated, four of which were novel. The paper identified Fbxo2 as a
      candidate prion protein binding partner, not specifically as an amyloid-beta binder.
      The annotation appears to be a misinterpretation of the screening result. The binding
      was to prion protein (PrP), not to amyloid-beta peptide.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      PMID:9173930 was a candidate screen for PrP binding partners using a PrP-AP probe,

      proteins binding to prion protein," not amyloid-beta. Given what is now known about
      Fbxo2's glycan-binding specificity, any interaction with PrP would most likely be
      mediated through PrP's N-glycans rather than specific amyloid-beta recognition. The
      annotation of "amyloid-beta binding" appears to be an overinterpretation. It is
      plausible that Fbxo2 could bind glycosylated forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP)
      family members through their N-glycans, but this would be glycan binding, not
      amyloid-beta peptide binding.

  findings:
    - statement: >-
        Fbs1/Fbs2 interact preferentially with denatured glycoproteins by sensing exposed
        chitobiose. SCF(Fbs1) associates with p97/VCP AAA ATPase.

        Both Fbs1 and Fbs2 proteins interacted with denatured glycoproteins, which were
        modified with not only high-mannose but also complex-type oligosaccharides, more
        efficiently than native proteins. Given that Fbs proteins interact with innermost
        chitobiose in N-glycans, we propose that Fbs proteins distinguish native from
        unfolded glycoproteins by sensing the exposed chitobiose structure

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: misfolded glycoprotein sensor activity
    proposed_definition: >-
      Recognition of N-glycans on misfolded glycoproteins to target them for
      ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Distinct from chaperone activity (no protein
      refolding) and from general misfolded protein binding (recognition is glycan-mediated
      rather than via exposed hydrophobic patches). Examples include Fbxo2 (Fbs1) and
      Fbxo6 (Fbs2) in the ERAD pathway.
    justification: >-
      No existing GO term precisely captures the mechanism of Fbxo2. "Denatured protein
      binding" (GO:0031249, being obsoleted) is inaccurate because Fbxo2 binds glycans
      not the protein moiety. "Misfolded protein binding" (GO:0051787) implies direct
      recognition of misfolded protein conformation. "Carbohydrate binding" is correct
      but does not capture the quality-control context. A term for glycan-based misfolded
      glycoprotein recognition would fill this gap. See also the UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_BINDING
      project discussion of "misfolded protein sensor activity."

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      Is Fbxo2's anti-aggregation function (suppressing aggregation of retrotranslocated
      glycoproteins in the cytosol, PMID:17215248) independent of its ubiquitin ligase
      activity, and does it warrant a separate GO annotation?
  - question: >-
      Should the amyloid-beta binding annotation (GO:0001540, PMID:9173930) be removed
      entirely? The original paper identified Fbxo2 as a candidate PrP-binding protein,
      not an amyloid-beta binder. Any binding to PrP or APP family members is likely
      glycan-mediated.
  - question: >-
      Would a more specific MF term like "N-glycan binding" or "high-mannose oligosaccharide
      binding" be appropriate for Fbxo2, rather than the general "carbohydrate binding"?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Test whether Fbxo2 binds non-glycosylated misfolded proteins to definitively
      distinguish glycan-dependent vs protein-conformation-dependent recognition. This
      would clarify whether GO:0051787 (misfolded protein binding) is ever appropriate
      for Fbxo2.
    hypothesis: >-
      Fbxo2 does not bind non-glycosylated misfolded proteins because its binding mechanism
      is entirely glycan-dependent via the FBA domain.
  - description: >-
      In Fbxo2 knockout cochlea, identify accumulated glycoprotein substrates by
      proteomics to better understand the ERAD substrates relevant to hearing loss
      pathogenesis (building on PMID:17494702).
    hypothesis: >-
      Specific cochlear glycoproteins accumulate in Fbxo2 knockout mice, revealing the
      ERAD substrates whose failed degradation causes cochlear degeneration.
