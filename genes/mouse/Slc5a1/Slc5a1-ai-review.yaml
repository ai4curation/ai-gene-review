description: >-
  Mouse SGLT1 (Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1) is a high-affinity electrogenic Na+-coupled
  symporter that actively transports D-glucose or D-galactose across the plasma membrane
  with a 2:1 Na+:sugar stoichiometry. It is pivotal for intestinal mass absorption of
  D-glucose and D-galactose across the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes.
  SGLT1 knockout mice develop glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) syndrome and die
  within 2 days after weaning on standard diet. SGLT1 also triggers glucose-induced
  secretion of incretins GIP and GLP-1 in enteroendocrine cells, and reabsorbs approximately
  3% of filtered glucose in the S3 segment of renal proximal tubules. The transporter also
  functions as a water channel enabling passive water transport.

    summary: >-
      Core molecular function directly demonstrated in mouse SGLT1 knockout studies.
      PMID:22124465 showed that passage of D-glucose across the intestinal BBM was
      predominantly mediated by SGLT1 (>80% of uptake), with 2:1 Na+:glucose stoichiometry.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of SGLT1 and was directly demonstrated
      using Sglt1-/- mice. The publication states "d-glucose uptake via the luminal
      membrane of small intestinal enterocytes is predominantly (>80%) mediated via SGLT1"
      (PMID:22124465). UniProt confirms catalytic activity: "D-glucose(out) + 2 Na+(out) =

      The transporter functions at the apical brush border membrane of polarized epithelial
      cells, not at lateral cell-cell junctions. This annotation may reflect proximity to
      junctional regions rather than true junctional localization.
