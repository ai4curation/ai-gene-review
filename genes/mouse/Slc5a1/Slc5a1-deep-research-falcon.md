## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8C3K6
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13866}; Short=Na(+)/glucose cotransporter 1; AltName: Full=High affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter; AltName: Full=Solute carrier family 5 member 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=Slc5a1; Synonyms=Nagt, Sglt1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P13866};
- **Organism (full):** Mus musculus (Mouse).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sodium:solute symporter (SSF) (TC 2.A.21)
- **Key Domains:** Na/Glc_symporter_sf. (IPR038377); Na/solute_symporter. (IPR001734); Na/solute_symporter_CS. (IPR018212); SSF (PF00474)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Slc5a1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Mus musculus (Mouse).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Slc5a1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Slc5a1** (gene ID: Slc5a1, UniProt: Q8C3K6) in MOUSE.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: Mouse Slc5a1 (SGLT1; UniProt Q8C3K6)

Verification of Target Identity and Family Context
- Identity and organism: Slc5a1 encodes sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), consistent with the UniProt description for Mus musculus (Q8C3K6). SGLT1 is a member of the SLC5 (sodium:solute symporter) family with the characteristic 14–transmembrane-helix fold shared by SSS/SSF transporters (PF00474). This places Slc5a1 squarely in the Na/solute symporter superfamily described for intestinal Na+-coupled hexose transport (Koepsell 2020; Gyimesi 2020) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary function and substrates: SGLT1 mediates electrogenic, Na+-coupled uptake of D-glucose and D-galactose across the apical (brush-border) membrane of absorptive epithelia, driven by the inward Na+ electrochemical gradient established by basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. SGLT1 does not transport fructose but recognizes it at the binding site (see binding data below) (Gyimesi 2020; Watabe 2024) (gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4, watabe2024sugarbindingof pages 1-2). 
- Stoichiometry: Transport is classically 2 Na+ per 1 hexose for SGLT1, which underlies its high affinity and electrogenicity (Gyimesi 2020) (gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4). 
- Cellular localization: In small intestine, SGLT1 is constitutively localized to the brush-border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes; GLUT2 mediates basolateral efflux. BBM SGLT1 abundance increases with high luminal glucose (Koepsell 2020) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2). 
- Tissue distribution and physiological roles: Highest expression is in small intestine, with renal expression in the late proximal tubule (S3) where SGLT1 reclaims the fraction of filtered glucose that escapes SGLT2. SGLT1 participates in coupling nutrient uptake to water absorption and contributes to incretin secretion from enteroendocrine cells (Koepsell 2020; Gyimesi 2020; Kaijage 2025 review) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Structural mechanism by cryo-EM: High-resolution structures now clarify SGLT conformational states and inhibitor binding. A cryo-EM structure of human SGLT1 bound to the high-affinity inhibitor LX2761 shows the inhibitor wedging in the substrate site and extracellular vestibule, locking an outward-open conformation and blocking a putative water pathway. These structures (with complementary SGLT2-MAP17 data) explain how ligands modulate SGLT gating and Na+ coupling (Niu 2022; Nature Communications, 2022-10-03; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33421-7) (niu2022structuralmechanismof pages 1-2). 
- Binding versus transport resolved by voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF): VCF studies on human SGLT1 show high-affinity binding to D-glucose and D-galactose and reveal that non-transported D-fructose can bind and elicit conformational signals without being transported, dissecting the binding and translocation steps (Watabe 2024; J Biol Chem, 2024-05; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107215) (watabe2024sugarbindingof pages 1-2). 
- Renal division of labor and unmasking of SGLT1 capacity: Contemporary reviews summarizing human and animal data indicate that under euglycemia, SGLT2 reabsorbs the majority of filtered glucose (approximately 80–90%), with SGLT1 reclaiming the remainder in S3. Upon SGLT2 inhibition or hyperglycemia, SGLT1’s reabsorptive capacity is unmasked and can account for roughly 40–50% of reabsorption in normoglycemia, underscoring its physiological reserve (Elian 2024; Kaijage 2025 review) (elian2024risksandbenefits pages 3-5, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Oral rehydration therapy (ORT): ORT exploits SGLT1’s cotransport of Na+ and glucose on the intestinal brush border to drive water absorption and correct dehydration during diarrheal illness. This mechanistic principle remains foundational to modern ORS formulations and clinical success (Koepsell 2020; Pflügers Arch, 2020-08; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-020-02439-5) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2). 
- Dual SGLT1/2 inhibition (sotagliflozin): Dual inhibition reduces intestinal glucose absorption (via SGLT1) and renal reabsorption (via SGLT2). Reviews and meta-analyses indicate sotagliflozin’s beneficial cardiovascular and heart-failure outcomes led to regulatory actions in 2023, reflecting the therapeutic value of modulating SGLT1 alongside SGLT2 (Kaijage 2025 review; Frontiers in Mol Biosci, 2025-10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2025.1668400) (kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Intestinal transport physiology and regulation: Authoritative reviews integrate SGLT1’s role with GLUT2/GLUT5 and diurnal/nutrient regulation, plus contributions to enteroendocrine signaling. The BBM localization, regulation by luminal glucose, and disease associations (e.g., GGM) are emphasized (Koepsell 2020; Gyimesi 2020) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4). 
- Mechanistic underpinnings of inhibition: Cryo-EM and mechanistic work now provide a structural rationale for isoform selectivity and inhibitory mechanisms (Niu 2022) (niu2022structuralmechanismof pages 1-2). 
- System-level renal physiology: Contemporary summaries quantify SGLT1’s latent capacity during SGLT2 inhibition, shaping therapeutic strategies (Elian 2024; Kaijage 2025 review) (elian2024risksandbenefits pages 3-5, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Stoichiometry and substrates: SGLT1 transports 1 hexose with 2 Na+; primary transported sugars are D-glucose and D-galactose (Gyimesi 2020) (gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4). 
- Tissue-level contributions in kidney: During euglycemia, SGLT2 reabsorbs about 80–90% of filtered glucose (with SGLT1 handling the remainder); under SGLT2 inhibition SGLT1 can reach ~40–50% of reabsorption (Elian 2024; Kaijage 2025 review) (elian2024risksandbenefits pages 3-5, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 
- Structural mechanism of inhibition: LX2761 binding locks SGLT1 in an outward-open state and blocks a water pathway, providing a direct structural mechanism for high-affinity inhibition (Niu 2022) (niu2022structuralmechanismof pages 1-2). 
- Binding recognition breadth: VCF reveals binding/conformational responses to glucose, galactose, and nontransported fructose, dissecting substrate recognition from translocation (Watabe 2024) (watabe2024sugarbindingof pages 1-2). 

Functional annotation summary for mouse Slc5a1 (SGLT1)
- Molecular function: High-affinity Na+-coupled cotransporter for D-glucose and D-galactose; 2 Na+ : 1 sugar stoichiometry; electrogenic; driven by Na+ gradient and membrane potential (Gyimesi 2020) (gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4). 
- Cellular localization: Apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes; basolateral monosaccharide exit via GLUT2. In kidney, SGLT1 is apical in S3 segment (Koepsell 2020; Kaijage 2025 review) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, kaijage2025molecularmechanismsand pages 1-2). 
- Biological processes: Dietary carbohydrate absorption, coupling to water absorption (basis for ORT); enteroendocrine incretin secretion; renal reclamation of residual filtered glucose (Koepsell 2020; Gyimesi 2020) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4). 
- Pathophysiology: Biallelic loss-of-function in SLC5A1 causes congenital glucose–galactose malabsorption, characterized by neonatal osmotic diarrhea requiring lifelong restriction of glucose/galactose; mild renal glucosuria may occur (Koepsell 2020; Gyimesi 2020) (koepsell2020glucosetransportersin pages 1-2, gyimesi2020sodiumcoupledglucosetransport pages 2-4).
