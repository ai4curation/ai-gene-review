description: SURF1 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial inner membrane protein that
  functions as an essential assembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV).
  It acts as a non-enzymatic scaffolding protein within COX assembly intermediates,
  particularly the MITRAC complex, where it facilitates the maturation of the COX1
  subunit and promotes heme a3 incorporation. Loss of SURF1 results in severe COX
  deficiency, with mouse knockouts showing ~50% reduction in COX activity across tissues.
