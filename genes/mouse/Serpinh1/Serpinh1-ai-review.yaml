description: >-
  Serpinh1 (also known as HSP47/Colligin/CBP1) is an ER-resident, collagen-specific
  molecular chaperone belonging to the serpin superfamily. Despite its serpin domain,
  HSP47 lacks protease inhibitor activity and instead functions exclusively as a
  substrate-specific chaperone for procollagens. It binds the triple-helical
  conformation of procollagen Gly-X-Y repeats in the ER, stabilizes the nascent
  triple helix to prevent premature denaturation and aggregation, and releases
  procollagen in a pH-dependent manner during ER-to-cis-Golgi transport. Hsp47
  knockout mice die before E11.5 with severe defects in collagen biosynthesis,
  fibril formation, and basement membrane integrity (PMID:10995453). HSP47 interacts
  with types I through V collagens in vitro, making it a broad collagen chaperone
  rather than a type-specific one. It is the first substrate-specific molecular
  chaperone identified in mammals.

    summary: >-
      HSP47/Serpinh1 is a member of the serpin superfamily by sequence homology
      and structural classification. The IBA annotation reflects the ancestral
      serpin function inferred phylogenetically. However, HSP47 has evolved to
      function exclusively as a collagen-specific chaperone and does not
      demonstrate serine protease inhibitor activity. The reactive center loop
      (RCL) of HSP47 is non-canonical and does not function as an inhibitory
      serpin. UniProt annotates the reactive bond homolog at residues 376-377
      but classifies this protein as a chaperone (KW: Chaperone), not as a
      protease inhibitor.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Although HSP47 belongs to the serpin family by sequence and structure, it
      has lost protease inhibitor activity through evolution. Its function is
      exclusively as a collagen-specific chaperone. The IBA inference from the
      broader serpin family is incorrect for this particular member, which has
      neofunctionalized. The UniProt entry lists the KW 'Chaperone' but not

    summary: >-
      Hsp47 knockout mice showed defective processing of procollagen to mature
      collagen. Immature procollagen and intermediately processed forms
      accumulated in knockout embryos (PMID:10995453). This demonstrates
      HSP47's role in protein maturation, specifically procollagen maturation.
      While the annotation is correct, it is somewhat general given that HSP47
      specifically assists procollagen maturation, not protein maturation
      broadly.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      HSP47 is essential for procollagen maturation, which is a form of
      protein maturation. The knockout data clearly shows accumulation of
      immature procollagen forms. While the term is broader than the actual
      function (which is collagen-specific), it correctly captures the
      biological process.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Koide et al. (PMID:10862616) demonstrated that HSP47 preferentially
      recognizes collagenous Gly-X-Y repeats in triple-helical conformation,
      not unfolded collagen chains. This is a critical distinction: HSP47
      binds the FOLDED (triple-helical) form of procollagen, not the unfolded
      form. This is unlike classical unfolded protein binding chaperones such
      as BiP/GRP78 which bind hydrophobic stretches of unfolded proteins.
      HSP47 stabilizes the triple helix to prevent its unwinding/denaturation,
      acting as a holdase for the folded conformation. The annotation
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is therefore misleading. A more
      appropriate MF term would be GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone),
      which is defined as 'Binding to a protein or a protein-containing
      complex to assist the protein folding process', or GO:0005518 (collagen
      binding) which directly describes the molecular interaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The PMID:10862616 study explicitly shows that HSP47 recognizes the
      TRIPLE-HELICAL conformation of collagen, not unfolded protein. The
      abstract states HSP47 'preferentially recognizes collagenous Gly-X-Y
      repeats in triple-helical conformation'. The importance of substrate
      conformation was demonstrated by temperature-dependent binding (binding
      at 24C but not 30C, correlating with triple helix stability). HSP47 is
      therefore not an unfolded protein binder; it is a collagen-specific
      chaperone that binds the folded triple helix. GO:0044183 (protein
      folding chaperone) better captures the holdase/chaperone function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IPI annotation for generic protein binding derives from the same
      study (PMID:10862616) showing HSP47 interacts with collagenous peptides.
      The term 'protein binding' is uninformative -- the specific interaction
      is collagen binding (GO:0005518) which is already annotated. Per
      curation guidelines, 'protein binding' should be avoided in favor of
      more specific molecular function terms.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      'Protein binding' is an uninformative term that does not convey the
      specific collagen-binding function of HSP47. The more informative
      GO:0005518 (collagen binding) is already annotated and better captures
      the molecular function. Per GO curation best practices, generic
      'protein binding' should be replaced with specific binding terms.

      HSP47 functions as a protein folding chaperone specific for collagen.
      The Hsp47 knockout study (PMID:10995453) demonstrated that without
      HSP47, type I collagen cannot form a rigid triple-helical structure.
      Procollagen secreted from Hsp47-/- cells showed the same protease
      sensitivity as heat-denatured collagen, and transfection of Hsp47 cDNA
      restored protease resistance. HSP47 binds the triple-helical form of
      procollagen to prevent its unwinding and ensures correct triple helix
      formation. GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) accurately describes
      this function.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This term is not currently in the GO annotations for mouse Serpinh1
      but accurately describes its core molecular function. HSP47 is
      explicitly described as 'the first substrate-specific molecular
      chaperone to be identified in mammals' (PMID:10995453). The protein
      folding chaperone term captures its holdase/chaperone activity better
      than the current 'unfolded protein binding' annotation.
