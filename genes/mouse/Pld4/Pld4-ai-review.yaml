description: PLD4 is a multifunctional transmembrane enzyme that, despite its misleading name, lacks phospholipase D activity and instead functions as a 5'-3' exonuclease and transphosphatidylase. The protein degrades single-stranded DNA and RNA in endolysosomes to prevent inappropriate activation of TLR9 by self-derived mitochondrial DNA while enabling TLR7 activation by processing viral RNA. Additionally, PLD4 synthesizes bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a critical lipid component of lysosomal intralumenal vesicles essential for lipid degradation and autophagy. Predominantly localized to the ER membrane with dynamic trafficking to Golgi and endolysosomes, PLD4 plays crucial roles in immune regulation, preventing autoimmune responses, and maintaining endolysosomal homeostasis. In microglia, it participates in phagocytosis with characteristic redistribution from nucleus to phagosomes upon activation.
