description: PLD4 is a multifunctional transmembrane enzyme that, despite its misleading
  name, lacks phospholipase D activity and instead functions as a 5'-3' exonuclease
  and transphosphatidylase. The protein degrades single-stranded DNA and RNA in endolysosomes
  to prevent inappropriate activation of TLR9 by self-derived mitochondrial DNA while
  enabling TLR7 activation by processing viral RNA. Additionally, PLD4 synthesizes
  bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a critical lipid component of lysosomal intralumenal
  vesicles essential for lipid degradation and autophagy. Predominantly localized
  to the ER membrane with dynamic trafficking to Golgi and endolysosomes, PLD4 plays
  crucial roles in immune regulation, preventing autoimmune responses, and maintaining
  endolysosomal homeostasis. In microglia, it participates in phagocytosis with characteristic
  redistribution from nucleus to phagosomes upon activation.

    summary: PLD4 is indeed localized to the endomembrane system, particularly the
      ER membrane and Golgi apparatus as confirmed by multiple studies (PMID:21085684,
      PMID:22102906). The IBA annotation correctly captures this broad cellular localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The endomembrane system annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence
      showing PLD4 localization to ER membrane, Golgi apparatus, and endolysosomes.
      This IBA annotation represents an appropriate level of specificity.

  review:
    summary: PLD4 is indeed involved in phagocytosis, particularly in microglia. Studies
      show PLD4 colocalizes with phagosomes and siRNA knockdown reduces phagocytic
      cell numbers (PMID:22102906). This represents a core function in immune cells.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The phagocytosis annotation is supported by experimental evidence showing
      PLD4 involvement in microglial phagocytosis. The IBA annotation correctly identifies
      this as a conserved function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: PLD4 is indeed involved in immune system processes, but this term is
      very general. More specific annotations exist for its roles in innate immunity,
      TLR signaling, and prevention of autoimmunity. Based on Falcon research, PLD4
      prevents inappropriate TLR9 activation and modulates TLR7 responses.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this IEA annotation is correct, it is very broad. The protein does
      participate in immune system processes through its exonuclease activity that
      regulates innate immune responses. However, more specific terms would be more
      informative.

  review:
    summary: PLD4 does have catalytic activity, but not as a phospholipase D. It functions
      as a 5'-3' exonuclease and as a transphosphatidylase that synthesizes BMP. This
      overly general term should be replaced with more specific molecular function
      terms.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While PLD4 does have catalytic activity, this term is far too general.
      The protein has specific 5'-3' exonuclease activity and transphosphatidylase
      activity for BMP synthesis, which should be annotated instead.

      (2',3'-cGMP), a potent stimulatory ligand for TLR7

    supporting_text: PLD4 was co-localized with phagosomes that contained BioParticles.
      Inhibition of PLD4 expression using PLD4 specific small interfering RNA (siRNA)
      in MG6 cells significantly reduced the ratio of phagocytotic cell numbers
