=== UNIPROT METADATA ===
UniProt ID: Q8BG07
Entry Name: PLD4_MOUSE
Gene Name: Pld4
Protein Name: 5'-3' exonuclease PLD4
EC Number: 3.1.4.-
Organism: Mus musculus (Mouse)
NCBI Taxonomy ID: 10090
Function: 5'->3' exonuclease that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA molecules to form nucleoside 3'- monophosphates and 5'-end 5'-hydroxy deoxyribonucleotide/ribonucleotide fragments. Partially redundant with PLD4, can cleave all four nucleotides displaying higher efficiency for ssDNA and RNA fragments initiated with uridine and guanosine residues and lower efficiency for cytidine-initiated substrates. As a result, it does not always degrade polynucleotides to the single nucleotide level, it can stall at specific sites sparing certain fragments from exonucleolytic degradation (PubMed:30111894, PubMed:34620855, PubMed:38537643). Processes self and pathogenic ssDNA and RNA molecules that reach the endolysosomal compartment via phagocytosis or autophagy and may serve as 'danger' signals for recognition by innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). Degrades mitochondrial CpG-rich ssDNA fragments to prevent TLR9 activation and autoinflammatory response, but it can cleave viral RNA to generate ligands for TLR7 activation and initiate antiviral immune responses. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, it cooperates with endonuclease RNASET2 to release 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (2',3'-cGMP), a potent stimulatory ligand for TLR7 (PubMed:34620855). Produces 2',3'-cGMPs and cytidine-rich RNA fragments that occupy TLR7 ligand-binding pockets and trigger a signaling-competent state. Can exert polynucleotide phosphatase activity toward 5'-phosphorylated ssDNA substrates although at a slow rate (PubMed:38537643). Transphosphatidylase that catalyzes the exchange with R to S stereo-inversion of the glycerol moiety between (S,R)-lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) substrates to yield (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) (PubMed:39423811). Can synthesize a variety of (S,S)-BMPs representing the main phospholipid constituent of lysosomal intralumenal vesicle (ILV) membranes that bind acid hydrolases for lipid degradation (PubMed:39423811). Regulates the homeostasis and interorganellar communication of the endolysosomal system with an overall impact on cellular removal of dysfunctional organelles via autophagy as well as proper protein and lipid turnover. May play a role in myotube formation in response to ER stress (By similarity).

Abstract—The Mus musculus gene Pld4 (UniProt Q8BG07) encodes the 5′–3′ exonuclease PLD4, a multifunctional enzyme involved in both nucleic acid metabolism and lipid remodeling that plays critical roles in the regulation of immune responses, cellular clearance mechanisms, and endolysosomal homeostasis. PLD4 exerts its functions by degrading single‐stranded DNA and RNA substrates to produce nucleoside 3′-monophosphates, modulating innate immune receptor activation, and catalyzing the synthesis of (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) from lysophosphatidylglycerol and monoacylglycerol substrates. The protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, although its dynamic distribution in various immune cell subtypes including microglia and plasmacytoid dendritic cells suggests a broader subcellular repertoire. Here, we review the gene function and molecular mechanisms, cellular localization, biological process involvement, disease associations, protein domains and structural features, expression patterns and regulation, evolutionary conservation, and key experimental evidence supporting the annotation of Pld4 for Gene Ontology (GO) curation (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2).

I. Introduction  
The Pld4 gene in Mus musculus is emerging as a pivotal regulator of both nucleic acid processing and lipid metabolism within the immune system. Through its dual enzymatic activities, Pld4 plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, modulating endolysosomal function, and preventing the aberrant activation of innate immune pathways. Recent studies utilizing Pld4 mutant mice have established a clear link between the loss or dysregulation of PLD4 function and the onset of autoimmune phenotypes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–like symptoms, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 16-19). This report outlines the current state of knowledge on PLD4, synthesizing evidence from biochemical, cellular, structural, and genetic studies that collectively contribute to our understanding of its biological significance and relevance for GO annotation (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8).

II. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
PLD4 functions as a 5′–3′ exonuclease that hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds within single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA molecules to yield nucleoside 3′-monophosphates and 5′-hydroxy fragments (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2021cleavageofdna pages 1-2). The enzymatic activity of PLD4 is finely tuned toward substrates that initiate with uridine and guanosine residues, displaying higher catalytic efficiency for these nucleotides compared to cytidine-initiated fragments (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 17-20, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 20-23). This substrate-specific degradation allows PLD4 to process self-derived mitochondrial CpG-rich ssDNA fragments that might otherwise trigger TLR9-mediated autoinflammatory responses (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31). Concurrently, the enzyme is capable of cleaving viral RNA to generate ligands for TLR7 activation, thereby contributing to the initiation of antiviral immune responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2021cleavageofdna pages 1-2). In addition to its exonuclease activity, PLD4 exerts a polynucleotide phosphatase function with slow kinetics on 5′-phosphorylated ssDNA substrates (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 17-20, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 20-23). A further intriguing aspect of PLD4’s functionality is its transphosphatidylase activity, which catalyzes the stereoinversion of the glycerol moiety in lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) substrates, resulting in the production of (S,S)-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 5-7). The synthesis of (S,S)-BMP is crucial for the formation of intralumenal vesicles in lysosomes, thereby impacting lipid degradation and organellar turnover (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 5-7, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 34-40). Collectively, these molecular mechanisms underscore the multifaceted role of PLD4 in processing nucleic acids and lipids, which is central to its function in modulating innate immune responses and maintaining endolysosomal integrity (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 1-5).

III. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
PLD4 is characterized as a transmembrane glycoprotein, and its predominant subcellular localization is within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as indicated by UniProt metadata and corroborated through immunolocalization studies (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5). Detailed expression analyses have revealed that, in addition to the ER, PLD4 is present in the Golgi apparatus, and its dynamic trafficking is observed in endolysosomal compartments, particularly in immune cells engaged in nucleic acid sensing (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 1-5, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 8-10). In microglial cells, PLD4’s localization shifts from a predominantly nuclear association to a position on phagosomes upon cellular activation, serving as an indicator of microglial activation status (otani2011pld4isinvolved pages 8-10, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 2-3). Moreover, high expression levels in the splenic marginal zone and red pulp align with PLD4’s involvement in immune cell signaling and antigen processing (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16). This broad distribution across multiple organelles within immune cells further emphasizes its importance in coordinating endolysosomal function and nucleic acid degradation, thereby preventing inappropriate activation of inflammatory signaling pathways (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 12-13).

IV. Biological Processes Involvement  
The combined enzymatic and lipid remodeling activities of PLD4 integrate the regulation of several key biological processes. First, by functioning as a 5′–3′ exonuclease, PLD4 modulates endosomal nucleic acid sensing by degrading self and pathogen-derived nucleic acid species that accumulate within the endolysosomal pathway (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2021cleavageofdna pages 1-2). This activity is critical to maintaining immune tolerance and preventing excessive toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, which can lead to chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12). Second, the synthesis of (S,S)-BMP through its transphosphatidylase activity is indispensable for lysosomal lipid degradation, as BMP comprises the major phospholipid component of intralumenal vesicle membranes that bind acid hydrolases (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 5-7). The production of BMP not only supports lipid catabolism but also ensures proper interorganellar communication within the endolysosomal system, thereby influencing protein turnover and autophagy (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 34-40). Furthermore, by cooperating with endonucleases such as RNASET2, PLD4 facilitates the generation of cyclic nucleotide derivatives like 2′,3′-cGMP, which play a role in activating TLR7 and potentiating antiviral responses (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 17-20, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 20-23). These interconnected processes position PLD4 at a critical nexus between nucleic acid clearance, lipid metabolism, and immune signal modulation, making it integral to cellular homeostasis and host defense mechanisms (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12).

V. Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
A growing body of experimental evidence links PLD4 function to several autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions. In mutant mouse models, disruptions in Pld4 have been associated with lupus-like phenotypes, including low body weight, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and heightened B cell activity accompanied by increased BAFF secretion and autoantibody production (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 1-5). These phenotypes strongly implicate PLD4 in the prevention of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and underscore its protective role in immune regulation (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 16-19, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12). Moreover, genetic studies have linked PLD4 with other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis, suggesting that aberrations in nucleic acid processing and TLR signaling may serve as common pathological mechanisms underlying these conditions (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2). Mixed inflammatory dysregulation has also been observed in PLD4-deficient mice, where the loss of enzyme activity exacerbates liver inflammation and disrupts cytokine balance, further emphasizing its role in mitigating autoinflammatory responses (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12). In addition to autoimmune phenotypes, alterations in PLD4 function may influence myotube formation in response to ER stress, thus hinting at broader implications in tissue remodeling and repair (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8). Collectively, these findings support a multifactorial contribution of PLD4 to disease pathology, where its loss or mutation triggers a cascade of immune dysregulation and metabolic defects (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31).

VI. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The structural architecture of PLD4 is defined by several unique features that distinguish it from classical phospholipase D family members. Although PLD4 contains two highly conserved HKD motifs—typically found in phospholipase enzymes—it conspicuously lacks the canonical PX (Phox homology) and PH (Pleckstrin homology) domains present in PLD1 and PLD2, accounting for its absence of traditional phospholipase D activity (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 8-10). Structural analyses have revealed that PLD4 functions as a type II transmembrane protein with multiple N-linked glycosylation sites; studies indicate the presence of as many as eight consensus glycosylation motifs that likely contribute to protein folding, stability, and subcellular trafficking (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8). Recent crystallographic investigations have provided insights into its active site topology, indicating that the catalytic center is formed via an intrachain dimer interface that may incorporate a hydrophobic clamp to enhance substrate binding and confer specificity, particularly toward nucleotides with specific 5′-end modifications (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 14-17, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 20-23). These structural characteristics not only elucidate the basis for its exonuclease and transphosphatidylase activities but also suggest evolutionary adaptations that allow PLD4 to participate in diverse biochemical pathways, setting it apart from other members of the phospholipase D superfamily (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 1-5, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 11-12).

VII. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Gene expression studies have consistently demonstrated that Pld4 is expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Quantitative analyses reveal that PLD4 mRNA exhibits its highest expression in immune-related tissues, most notably in the spleen, where it localizes to the red pulp and marginal zone macrophages (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16). Additionally, expression in myeloid cells and dendritic cells indicates a specialized role in the immune system’s nucleic acid processing machinery (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12). In the central nervous system, PLD4 is notably present in early postnatal microglia, with studies showing a marked increase in mRNA expression during the early developmental stages followed by a reduction in later life stages (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 2-3). Moreover, the dynamic regulation of PLD4 expression in microglia is correlated with cellular activation states; activated microglia undergo a spatial redistribution of PLD4 from the nucleus to phagosomal membranes, a process that potentially aids in the clearance of nucleic acid debris during immune responses (otani2011pld4isinvolved pages 8-10, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5). In addition to developmental cues, inflammatory stimuli and ER stress conditions appear to modulate PLD4 transcription, suggesting that its expression is responsive to cellular stress and immune activation (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8, OpenTargets Search: -Pld4). These spatiotemporal expression patterns underpin the enzyme’s role in orchestrating a rapid and localized response to pathogenic challenges, while also maintaining basal endolysosomal function in healthy tissues (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 1-5, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31).

VIII. Evolutionary Conservation  
Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses underscore that PLD4 is evolutionarily conserved across multiple species, particularly among mammals, which suggests that its specialized functions in nucleic acid degradation and lipid metabolism are critical for survival (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8). The conservation of HKD motifs—in spite of the atypical domain architecture—further supports that the underlying catalytic mechanism of PLD4 has been maintained throughout evolution (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 8-10, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 11-12). In parallel, the functional redundancy observed between PLD4 and its paralog PLD3 reinforces the concept of evolutionary pressure to preserve exonuclease activity in the context of immune regulation, as both proteins share overlapping roles in processing nucleic acid ligands for TLRs (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 14-17, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2). Moreover, evolutionary conservation extends to its role in lysosomal BMP synthesis, as the production of (S,S)-BMP is a conserved pathway for lipid degradation and is critical for maintaining endolysosomal dynamics across various species (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 5-7). This evolutionary perspective not only highlights the fundamental nature of PLD4’s functions but also provides a rationale for its inclusion in GO annotations related to nucleic acid metabolic processes, immune signaling, and lipid homeostasis (singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 34-40, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 16-19).

IX. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
A wide spectrum of experimental approaches has been employed to elucidate the function, localization, and regulation of PLD4. Gene knockout studies in mice have been particularly illuminating; Pld4 mutant mice exhibit autoimmune phenotypes that feature clinical signs analogous to SLE, such as reduced birth weight, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and an overactive B cell compartment producing high levels of BAFF and autoantibodies (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, akizuki2019pld4isa pages 1-5). These in vivo observations provide direct evidence linking PLD4 dysfunction to systemic inflammation and autoimmune disease susceptibility (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 16-19, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12). In vitro biochemical assays using purified recombinant PLD4 have delineated its substrate specificity, revealing robust 5′–3′ exonuclease activity preferentially against ssDNA and RNA substrates with distinct 5′ modifications (gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, gavin2021cleavageofdna pages 1-2). Complementary studies employing deglycosylation assays in cell lines such as HEK293T have confirmed the presence of extensive N-linked glycosylation—a modification that is critical for proper folding and subcellular targeting of the protein (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 12-13). Furthermore, crystallographic analyses have provided high-resolution insights into PLD4’s active site architecture, including the identification of a hydrophobic clamp that may be responsible for substrate binding and specificity (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 20-23, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8). These structural studies, in conjunction with mutagenesis experiments that target key catalytic residues within the HKD motifs, have offered a detailed picture of the biochemical mechanism underlying PLD4’s dual roles in nucleic acid cleavage and BMP synthesis (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 1-5, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 14-17). Additionally, transcriptomic and RT-qPCR analyses across different tissues and developmental stages have validated the tissue-specific and activation-dependent expression patterns of Pld4, further underscoring its physiological relevance in the immune system and CNS (yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 2-3). Collectively, these diverse experimental strategies, ranging from genetic animal models to structural biology and molecular biochemistry, have substantially advanced our understanding of PLD4’s functional repertoire and have provided critical empirical support for GO annotation (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31).

X. Conclusion  
In summary, the Mus musculus gene Pld4 encodes a multifunctional transmembrane enzyme that exerts significant regulatory control over both nucleic acid metabolism and lysosomal lipid homeostasis. Its 5′–3′ exonuclease activity is essential for the degradation of self and pathogenic single-stranded nucleic acids, a process that prevents aberrant TLR activation and subsequent autoimmune responses. Concurrently, the enzyme’s transphosphatidylase function facilitates the synthesis of (S,S)-BMP, a critical component of endolysosomal membranes necessary for lipid degradation and proper autophagic clearance. Localization studies have demonstrated that although PLD4 is predominantly situated in the endoplasmic reticulum, it dynamically traffics to compartments such as the Golgi apparatus and endolysosomes, particularly in immune effector cells like microglia and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Expression analyses reveal that Pld4 is highly expressed in immune-related tissues including the spleen, with developmental regulation observed in the CNS. The evolutionary conservation of key structural features, including the HKD motifs and associated glycosylation sites, further underscores the fundamental nature of PLD4’s biochemical activities across species. Moreover, extensive experimental evidence—from animal knockout studies that reveal lupus-like phenotypes to detailed in vitro assays and crystallographic studies—collectively supports PLD4’s central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune regulation. Given its involvement in critical biological processes and disease pathways, PLD4 represents an important target for therapeutic intervention and a valuable candidate for comprehensive GO annotation efforts (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, singh2024pld3andpld4 pages 7-8, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 1-2, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 3-5, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31).

Future investigations should focus on refining our understanding of the substrate specificity determinants within the active site of PLD4, elucidating the regulatory networks that control its expression under both physiological and pathological conditions, and exploring the therapeutic potential of modulating its activity in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Improved high-resolution structural data, coupled with advanced genomic and proteomic approaches, will continue to shed light on the precise molecular interactions that underlie PLD4’s function in endolysosomal pathways, paving the way for novel strategies to manipulate its activity for clinical benefit (yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 14-17, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8, yoshikawa2010phospholipasedfamily pages 11-12). The integration of these multidisciplinary studies will ultimately enhance our capacity to annotate PLD4 within the Gene Ontology framework, ensuring that its contributions to nucleic acid metabolism, immune response modulation, and lipid homeostasis are accurately captured and integrated into broader biological knowledge bases (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 1-5, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2).

In conclusion, the comprehensive body of literature on Pld4 in Mus musculus provides robust experimental support for its roles as a 5′–3′ exonuclease and transphosphatidylase. These dual functions are pivotal not only for the regulation of innate immunity—by preventing the inappropriate activation of TLRs through the clearance of self nucleic acids—but also for the maintenance of lysosomal lipid integrity essential for proper organellar function. The detailed characterization of its subcellular localization, domain architecture, and expression dynamics further underscores the complexity and biological significance of PLD4. As research advances, continued efforts to resolve the nuances of PLD4’s enzymatic mechanisms and regulatory pathways will be essential for elucidating its full contribution to cellular physiology and disease etiology. Such insights promise to inform the development of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating its activity in the context of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, making PLD4 a prominent focus for future biomedical research and GO annotation curation (akizuki2019pld4isa pages 12-16, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 1-2, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 29-31, gavin2018pld3andpld4 pages 11-12, yuan2024structuralandmechanistic pages 5-8).
