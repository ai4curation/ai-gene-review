# Syk Gene Review Notes

## 2025-01-14 - Missing Annotation Fix

**Issue**: Validation failure due to 25 annotations present in the current GOA file but missing from the YAML file.

**Root Cause**: The GOA file has been updated with new annotations since the original review was completed. These include:
- GO:0032991 (protein-containing complex) with multiple evidence types
- GO:0005829 (cytosol) with multiple Reactome references
- GO:0019815 (B cell receptor complex) with IDA evidence

**Action Taken**:
1. Used the GOA validator's `seed_missing_annotations` function to automatically add the 25 missing annotations
2. Fixed PMID:22451653 title to match the correct publication title
3. Added 15 new references from the GOA file

**Annotations Added**: All missing annotations were seeded as PENDING for future review, including:
- Multiple cytosol localizations from different Reactome pathways
- Protein complex memberships
- B cell receptor complex association

**Validation Status**: After seeding missing annotations and fixing the title, the gene now passes validation with only warnings about PENDING annotations.

**Note**: The newly seeded annotations represent legitimate additions to the GOA database and should be reviewed in future curation cycles.
