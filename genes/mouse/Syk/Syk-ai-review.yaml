description: Non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase essential for immune signaling
  downstream of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Contains
  tandem SH2 domains that bind phosphorylated ITAMs and a C-terminal kinase domain.
  Critical for B cell development through pre-BCR and BCR signaling, myeloid cell
  activation via Fc and C-type lectin receptors, platelet activation through GPVI-FcRγ,
  and osteoclast differentiation. Syk-deficient mice show perinatal lethality with
  hemorrhaging and complete block in B cell development at the pro-B to pre-B transition.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: Core molecular function of Syk supported by extensive experimental evidence.
      Multiple publications demonstrate Syk phosphorylates tyrosine residues on target
      proteins including BLNK, PLCγ, Vav1, and BTK. The IBA annotation is appropriate
      as this function is conserved across species.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Protein tyrosine kinase activity is the fundamental enzymatic function
      of Syk, well-established through biochemical and genetic studies. The deep research
      confirms Syk phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates on tyrosine residues.

  review:
    summary: Overly general annotation. While Syk does bind nucleotides, the more
      specific term GO:0005524 (ATP binding) better describes this function as Syk
      specifically binds ATP in its kinase domain for catalytic activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: This term is too general. Syk specifically binds ATP as the phosphate
      donor for its kinase activity, not nucleotides in general. The ATP binding annotation

  review:
    summary: Accurate and specific annotation. Syk is indeed a cytoplasmic (non-membrane
      spanning) tyrosine kinase, distinguishing it from receptor tyrosine kinases.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This correctly specifies that Syk is a non-receptor, cytoplasmic tyrosine
      kinase. The deep research confirms Syk lacks transmembrane domains and functions
      as a cytosolic kinase that transiently associates with membrane complexes via
      SH2 domain interactions.

    summary: General term for receptor tyrosine kinase-like signaling. Syk functions
      downstream of non-catalytic receptors with ITAMs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While Syk signals downstream of non-enzymatic receptors, the signaling
      paradigm is similar to RTK signaling with tyrosine phosphorylation cascades.

    summary: Syk may have crosstalk with GPCR pathways but is not a direct GPCR signaling
      component.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While there may be crosstalk between Syk and GPCR signaling in some contexts,
      this is not a primary function. Syk primarily signals through ITAM-containing
      immune receptors.
