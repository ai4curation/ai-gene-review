description: >
  Ced-12 (also known as ELMO/dELMO) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptor protein that partners with
  DOCK family GEFs (primarily Mbc/Myoblast city in Drosophila) to form a Rac-specific GEF module.
  The protein contains a PH domain, ARM-like repeats, and a proline-rich SH3-binding motif.
  Ced-12 enhances the guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity of its DOCK partners toward Rac GTPases,
  leading to localized Rac activation that drives WAVE/SCAR-mediated actin polymerization via Arp2/3.
  This signaling axis is critical for multiple actin-dependent cellular processes including myoblast fusion,
  border cell migration, thorax closure, CNS development, and muscle attachment site formation.
  While direct experimental evidence in Drosophila focuses on cell migration and fusion processes,
  the conserved role of ELMO/CED-12 proteins in apoptotic corpse engulfment (efferocytosis) is well-established
  across metazoa and is expected to be conserved in D. melanogaster based on orthology.

      ELMO/CED-12 proteins function at the plasma membrane where they partner with DOCK-family GEFs
      to activate Rac signaling. The deep research confirms that DOCK-ELMO complexes localize to
      membrane-proximal sites including phagocytic cups and leading edges (Venkatachalam et al. 2024,
      PLOS Genetics). Plasma membrane localization is consistent with the PH domain-mediated membrane
      targeting of ELMO proteins (PMID:18163987, PMID:21283588). IBA is appropriate and well-supported.

      While direct experimental evidence for Ced-12 in Drosophila phagocytosis is limited in the

      function. CED-12 was originally identified in C. elegans for its role in apoptotic cell engulfment
      (PMID:11703939). The deep research confirms that DOCK-ELMO complexes act as Rac GEFs that activate
      the WAVE/SCAR-Arp2/3 pathway to generate branched F-actin at membrane-proximal sites for engulfment
      (Venkatachalam et al. 2024). The SPKW annotation captures legitimate biology that experimental work
      in Drosophila has not yet specifically addressed - the focus has been on migration and fusion,
      but phagocytic function is expected based on conservation.

      The deep research clearly states that ELMO functions in "Efferocytosis/apoptotic corpse clearance"
      where "Ced-12-Mbc is predicted to localize to phagocytic cups and corpse contacts". The UniProt

      While the annotation is technically correct (ELMO does bind proteins), "protein binding" is

      binds to DOCK-family GEFs via its proline-rich domain interacting with the SH3 domain of
      Mbc, enhancing the GEF activity. A more informative term would be "guanyl-nucleotide exchange
      factor adaptor activity" (GO:0005091), which accurately describes ELMO's role as an adaptor
      that brings together GEF and substrate proteins. The existing annotation to GO:0017124

      This annotation is partially problematic. Ced-12/ELMO itself does not possess GEF catalytic
      activity - it lacks the DHR2 domain required for nucleotide exchange. Rather, ELMO enhances
      the GEF activity of its DOCK partner (Mbc). The more accurate term would be "guanyl-nucleotide
      exchange factor adaptor activity" (GO:0005091) or "guanyl nucleotide exchange factor activator
      activity" (GO:0160124). However, the DOCK-ELMO complex as a whole does function as a GEF,
      so the annotation is not entirely incorrect. The evidence in PMID:18163987 shows that MBC
      and ELMO cooperate to activate Rac but the GEF activity is provided by MBC, with ELMO enhancing it.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Cell migration is a core function of CED-12/ELMO proteins across metazoa. PMID:11703939
      demonstrates that ced-12 functions in cell migration, acting in a signaling pathway with
      ced-2/Crk, ced-5/DOCK180, and ced-10/Rac. While the primary experiments were in C. elegans,
      the conserved nature of this pathway and identification of Drosophila counterpart supports
      this annotation. Multiple other Drosophila publications confirm this function.

# NEW ANNOTATION - engulfment of apoptotic cell
- term:

  review:
    summary: >
      Proposed new annotation based on the conserved role of ELMO/CED-12 proteins in
      apoptotic corpse engulfment (efferocytosis).
    action: NEW
    reason: >
      While GO:0006909 (phagocytosis) and GO:0006915 (apoptotic process) are already annotated,
      a more specific term "engulfment of apoptotic cell" (GO:0043652) better captures the
      precise biological role of ELMO. CED-12 was originally named for its role in cell death
      abnormal phenotype in C. elegans, specifically defects in engulfment of apoptotic corpses.
      The deep research confirms this is a conserved function. While direct experimental
      evidence in Drosophila is limited, this function is expected based on strong phylogenetic
      conservation and could be annotated via IBA.

# NEW ANNOTATION - guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor adaptor activity
- term:
    id: GO:0005091
    label: guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor adaptor activity
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18163987
  review:
    summary: >
      Proposed new annotation to capture ELMO's precise molecular function as a GEF adaptor.
    action: NEW
    reason: >
      This term precisely describes ELMO's molecular function - it binds to DOCK-family GEFs
      (Mbc in Drosophila) and enhances their guanyl-nucleotide exchange activity toward Rac.
      ELMO does not possess GEF catalytic activity itself but acts as an adaptor that brings
      together the GEF (Mbc) and its substrate (Rac), enhancing the exchange reaction.
      PMID:18163987 demonstrates the physical interaction between ELMO and Mbc and shows
      that they cooperate to activate Rac. This is more specific than GO:0005085 (GEF activity)
      and accurately reflects ELMO's adapter role in the DOCK-ELMO-Rac signaling module.

# NEW ANNOTATION - positive regulation of Rac protein signal transduction

    label: positive regulation of Rac protein signal transduction
  evidence_type: IGI
  original_reference_id: PMID:18163987
  review:
    summary: >
      Proposed new annotation to capture ELMO's role in positively regulating Rac signaling.
    action: NEW
    reason: >
      ELMO enhances Rac activation through the DOCK-ELMO complex. PMID:18163987 demonstrates
      genetically that MBC and ELMO cooperate to activate Rac GTPases in Drosophila and that
      the overexpression phenotype is suppressed by mutations in Rac1 and Rac2. This directly
      supports positive regulation of Rac signaling. This term is more specific than general
      GTPase regulation and accurately captures the downstream effect of ELMO function.
