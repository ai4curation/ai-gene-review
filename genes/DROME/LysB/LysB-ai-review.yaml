description: >
  LysB encodes Lysozyme B, a secreted c-type lysozyme (glycosyl hydrolase family 22)
  that hydrolyzes the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and
  N-acetylglucosamine in bacterial peptidoglycan. Unlike classical immune lysozymes
  that function in the hemolymph, LysB is primarily expressed in the digestive tract
  (midgut of larvae and adults) where it functions in the digestion of bacteria from
  food and in shaping gut microbiota composition. LysB is not expressed in fat body
  or hemocytes and is actually repressed, not induced, upon systemic bacterial infection,
  supporting its role as a digestive rather than immune enzyme (PMID:8159165, Marra et al. 2021).

  review:
    summary: >
      LysB is a bona fide c-type lysozyme belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 22,
      with conserved catalytic residues and characteristic domain structure. The IBA
      annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from well-characterized lysozymes
      including chicken lysozyme (UniProtKB:P00698). The enzymatic activity is supported
      by the conserved catalytic Glu/Asp residues (positions 50 and 68 in LysB) and
      demonstrated ex vivo lysozyme activity in gut extracts from Drosophila (Marra et al. 2021).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Core molecular function of LysB. The GH22 family assignment, conserved catalytic
      residues, and functional validation through gut lysozyme activity assays all
      support this annotation. IBA provides strong phylogenetic evidence.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is derived from the UniProtKB Antimicrobial keyword (KW-0081).
      While lysozymes can technically kill bacteria by degrading their cell walls,
      this annotation requires careful evaluation for LysB specifically. The primary
      literature (PMID:8159165) explicitly states that LysB is "unlikely to play an
      active role in the humoral immune defense" and is adapted for "digestion of
      bacteria in the food." The deep research shows LysB functions in gut microbiota
      regulation rather than bactericidal immunity. However, lysozyme-mediated
      peptidoglycan hydrolysis does result in bacterial cell death, making this
      annotation technically accurate even for digestive lysozymes. This represents
      a legitimate SPKW annotation for lysozymes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      This is a LEGITIMATE SPKW annotation for lysozymes. While the primary biological
      role of LysB is digestive/microbiota regulation rather than immune defense,
      the enzymatic action of lysozyme (peptidoglycan hydrolysis) does result in
      bacterial cell killing. The annotation captures the molecular outcome of
      lysozyme activity. The UniProt Antimicrobial keyword is appropriately applied
      to bacteriolytic enzymes. This is an example of correct SPKW contribution where
      the keyword accurately reflects the biochemical consequence of enzyme activity.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is derived from the Antimicrobial keyword. However, the
      primary literature strongly suggests LysB does NOT function in classical
      immune defense. PMID:8159165 states LysB is "unlikely to play an active role
      in the humoral immune defense" and is not expressed in immune tissues (fat body,
      hemocytes). Furthermore, LysB and related gut lysozymes are REPRESSED, not
      induced, after systemic bacterial infection. The Marra et al. 2021 study shows
      gut lysozymes function in microbiota regulation and homeostasis rather than
      pathogen defense. While lysozymes can contribute to defense by killing bacteria,
      the specific biological context of LysB is digestive/homeostatic rather than
      defensive.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      This annotation may overstate the immune defense role of LysB. The literature
      explicitly indicates LysB is adapted for digestive function and is not part of
      the humoral immune response. Consider whether a more accurate process annotation
      would capture the microbiota regulation function. However, there is no ideal
      GO term for "digestion of bacteria" or "gut microbiota regulation by enzyme."
      The term could be retained with the understanding that it represents a broader
      interpretation, but marking as potentially over-annotated.

  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: >
      ISS annotation based on similarity to vertebrate lysozymes. This is problematic
      for several reasons. First, LysB is unlikely to function in immune defense as
      stated explicitly in PMID:8159165. Second, classical c-type lysozymes are
      typically more effective against Gram-positive bacteria (which have exposed
      peptidoglycan) than Gram-negative bacteria (which have an outer membrane
      protecting the peptidoglycan layer). The annotation may be transferred from
      a vertebrate lysozyme in a different functional context.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      This annotation is likely inappropriate for LysB. The literature indicates LysB
      is not an immune defense protein. Additionally, classical lysozymes require
      outer membrane permeabilization to act on Gram-negative bacteria. If a defense
      annotation is retained, it should be at the more general "defense response to
      bacterium" level, though even that is questionable given the explicit statements
      in the primary literature that LysB does not function in immune defense.
