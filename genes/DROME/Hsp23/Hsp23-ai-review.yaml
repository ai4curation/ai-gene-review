description: >-
  Hsp23 is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) of Drosophila melanogaster that localizes to the
  cytoplasm/cytosol (PMID:32437379). It is one of four classical Drosophila sHSPs (Hsp22, Hsp23,
  Hsp26, Hsp27) encoded in a gene cluster at chromosomal locus 67B. All four sHSPs share a conserved
  alpha-crystallin domain and possess ATP-independent chaperone-like (holdase) activity, preventing
  heat-induced protein aggregation and maintaining substrates in a refoldable state (PMID:16572729).
  Hsp23 requires a 5-fold molar excess over substrate (citrate synthase or luciferase) for equivalent
  anti-aggregation activity compared to Hsp22 and Hsp27 (PMID:16572729). Approximately 30% of
  luciferase activity is recovered in in vitro refolding assays with Hsp23 (PMID:16572729). Hsp23
  interacts physically with Hsp26, and both proteins colocalize in CNS neurons, playing a role in
  synaptogenesis during development (PMID:32437379). Hsp23 also interacts with the SUMO-conjugating
  enzyme DmUbc9 (PMID:9514881). Hsp23 is upregulated during cold hardening (PMID:16313561) and
  constant hypoxia, where it plays an important role in hypoxia tolerance (PMID:19401761).
  GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is proposed for obsoletion; as a classic holdase, the closest
  replacement is GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity), though the carrier semantics
  (escorting between cellular components) do not perfectly describe in-situ holdase activity.

    than Hsp22 or Hsp27, requiring a 5-fold molar excess for equivalent anti-aggregation
    activity (PMID:16572729). Refolding of substrates held by Hsp23 requires the HSP70
    machine (PMID:26705243). Hsp23 physically interacts with Hsp26, and both proteins
    colocalize in the cytoplasm of CNS cells (PMID:32437379). Note - GO:0140309 is the
    closest available term for holdases, though the carrier semantics do not perfectly
    describe in-situ holdase activity.
