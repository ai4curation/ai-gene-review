    summary: Nprl3 restrains TORC1-dependent cell growth, consistent with 
      negative regulation of cell size.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: GATOR1 inhibition of TORC1-dependent growth supports reduced cell 
      size/growth phenotypes.

  review:
    summary: GATOR1 provides RagA/B GAP activity that inhibits TORC1 signaling.
    action: NEW
    reason: GATOR1 is the Nprl2/Nprl3/Iml1 complex and is reported to have 
      GTPase-activating protein activity for RagA/B, supporting a GTPase 
      activator activity annotation for its subunits.
