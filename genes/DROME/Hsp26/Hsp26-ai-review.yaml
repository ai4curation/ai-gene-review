description: >-
  Drosophila melanogaster Heat shock protein 26 (Hsp26) is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) of the
  HSP20/alpha-crystallin family. It functions primarily as a holdase chaperone, binding denaturing
  proteins to prevent their aggregation under stress conditions. Unlike ATP-dependent foldases
  (e.g., HSP70, GroEL), Hsp26 does not actively refold substrates but maintains them in a
  refoldable state for subsequent processing by HSP70 machinery (PMID:16572729). Hsp26 is one of
  four classical Drosophila sHSPs (Hsp22, Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp27) and is highly heat-inducible
  (PMID:26705243). It forms oligomeric complexes and co-immunoprecipitates with Hsp23
  (PMID:32437379). Overexpression extends adult lifespan by approximately 30% (PMID:15308776).
  Hsp26 also plays a developmental role in synaptogenesis, where it cooperates with Hsp23 to
  modulate synapse number at the neuromuscular junction (PMID:32437379).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding. While sHSPs do facilitate eventual protein refolding,
      this is misleading because Hsp26 itself does not refold proteins. Rather, it maintains
      denatured proteins in a refoldable state for subsequent processing by HSP70 (PMID:16572729,
      PMID:26705243). The refolding step is performed by the HSP70 machine. However, in the
      context of cellular assays, overexpression of Hsp26 does increase luciferase refolding
      because the endogenous HSP70 machinery completes the refolding (PMID:26705243).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although Hsp26 does not directly catalyze protein refolding, its holdase activity
      maintains substrates in a refoldable state, which is a prerequisite for refolding by
      the HSP70 machine. In cellular assays, Hsp26 overexpression enhances refolding of
      heat-denatured luciferase (PMID:16572729, PMID:26705243). The GO annotation captures
      the biological outcome (refolding is achieved) even though the molecular mechanism is
      indirect (holdase feeding into HSP70-dependent refolding). IBA inference is
      phylogenetically sound across sHSP family members.

      The interaction with Sisyphus (myosin XV) was identified in a study focused on myosin
      cargo identification, not on Hsp26 function. While the physical interaction may be real,
      myosin binding does not represent a core function of Hsp26 as a holdase chaperone. It
      may reflect Hsp26 being transported as cargo or an incidental interaction in the
      cytoplasm.

    summary: >-
      IEP annotation for cold acclimation based on Qin et al. (2005). The study used microarray
      analysis to examine transcriptional changes during cold hardening (0 degrees C for 2 h)
      and found Hsp26 among genes with increased transcript abundance. The evidence is
      expression-based (IEP) and suggests Hsp26 participates in the cold hardening response,
      but does not demonstrate a direct functional role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The evidence is only expression-based (IEP). Cold acclimation is not a core function of
      Hsp26 but rather reflects the broader stress response role of sHSPs. The transcriptional
      induction during cold hardening is plausible given that protein misfolding can occur
      during cold stress, but this is a secondary/pleiotropic function.

          these assays suggest that stress proteins, including Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Frost

  original_reference_id: PMID:15308776
  review:
    summary: >-
      IMP annotation for determination of adult lifespan based on Wang et al. (2004). The study
      showed that overexpression of Hsp26 using the UAS/GAL4 system extended mean lifespan by
      30% in Drosophila and increased stress resistance. This is a real biological phenotype
      but likely reflects the downstream consequence of improved protein homeostasis rather
      than a core molecular function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The lifespan extension phenotype is well-supported by IMP evidence. However, determination
      of adult lifespan is a downstream consequence of the core holdase chaperone function
      maintaining protein homeostasis during aging, not a direct molecular activity. Vos et al.
      (2016) showed that diverse sHSP activities (both refolding-promoting and
      anti-aggregation) can support longevity, indicating the lifespan effect is a pleiotropic
      outcome of improved proteostasis.

          overexpression of both CG14207 and HSP67BC in Drosophila leads to a mild increase in

      used as interim until a holdase chaperone activity NTR is created. GO:0044183 (protein
      folding chaperone) is not appropriate because Hsp26 is not a foldase. GO:0140309
