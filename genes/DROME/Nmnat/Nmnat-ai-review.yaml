description: >-
  Drosophila Nmnat (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase) is an essential bifunctional
  protein with dual enzymatic and chaperone activities. Its primary catalytic function is the synthesis
  of NAD+ from nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and ATP (EC 2.7.7.1), as well as the synthesis of
  deamido-NAD+ from nicotinate ribonucleotide and ATP (EC 2.7.7.18). As a moonlighting protein,
  Nmnat also functions as a stress-response chaperone with holdase activity, preventing toxic aggregation
  of misfolded proteins and promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of aggregation-prone substrates.
  The chaperone function is independent of the NAD+ synthesis activity and resides in the C-terminal
  domain. Nmnat is essential for viability and required for the maintenance of neuronal integrity,
  including photoreceptor cells, axons, and dendrites. The gene produces four isoforms via alternative
  splicing and alternative initiation, with distinct subcellular localizations and neuroprotective
  capacities: isoform D (cytoplasmic, strong holdase and refoldase, neuroprotective) and isoform C
  (nuclear, holdase only, pro-apoptotic under stress). Neurons preferentially upregulate the
  neuroprotective cytoplasmic isoform under stress conditions.

    summary: >-
      Nmnat catalyzes the formation of NAD+ from NMN and ATP, the penultimate step
      in the NAD+ salvage pathway. This is its primary enzymatic function, confirmed by
      multiple experimental studies (PMID:17132048, PMID:19403820, PMID:26616331, PMID:36476387).
      The IBA annotation is well supported by phylogenetic inference across eukaryotic NMNATs.

      The NAD+ salvage pathway role is the core enzymatic function of Nmnat. Phylogenetic

  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation from Russo et al. 2019. The study shows that excess dNmnat impairs
      evoked neurotransmitter release at the NMJ and that this requires catalytically active
      dNmnat. However, this effect appears to be a consequence of Nmnat overabundance when
      Highwire-mediated degradation is disrupted, rather than a normal physiological role.
      The negative regulation of synaptic transmission is an artifact of disrupted homeostatic
      regulation rather than a core function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While experimentally demonstrated, the negative regulation of neuromuscular synaptic
      transmission is a consequence of dNmnat overaccumulation when normal Highwire-mediated
      turnover is disrupted. This is not a core evolved function of Nmnat but rather reflects
      the need for tight regulation of its levels at the synapse.

      cytoplasmic and that the cytoplasmic localization is associated with the neuroprotective

      nuclear to cytoplasmic. This study also confirmed earlier findings of cytoplasmic

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:18344983
  review:
    summary: >-
      IDA annotation from Zhai et al. 2008 (Nature). This landmark study demonstrated that
      NMNAT acts as a chaperone to protect against neurodegeneration. The study showed that
      NMNAT displays chaperone function in biochemical assays and cultured cells, shares
      structural similarity with known chaperones, is upregulated by proteotoxic stress, and
      is recruited with Hsp70 into protein aggregates. The chaperone function is independent
      of NAD+ synthesis activity (the H61A catalytic mutant retains chaperone activity).
      The follow-up study (PMID:26616331) further characterized the chaperone activity as
      holdase activity (preventing aggregation) rather than refoldase activity for isoform C,
      while isoform D shows both holdase and refoldase activity.
      GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is proposed for obsoletion. The experimentally
      demonstrated activity is better described as misfolded protein binding (GO:0051787)
      since the studies show NMNAT preventing aggregation of misfolded proteins and being
      recruited to protein aggregates.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. The underlying experimental evidence is strong
      and well-characterized: Nmnat acts as a holdase chaperone that prevents toxic aggregation
      of misfolded proteins. The best replacement term is GO:0051787 (misfolded protein binding),
      which accurately captures NMNAT's demonstrated ability to bind to and prevent aggregation
      of misfolded/aggregation-prone proteins. The term GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier
      activity) is not appropriate because there is no evidence that NMNAT escorts proteins
      between cellular compartments. Note that the chaperone holdase activity is a secondary
      moonlighting function; the primary function is NAD+ synthesis.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IMP annotation from Zhai et al. 2006. The study used the Drosophila visual system as a
      model to demonstrate that loss of nmnat causes rapid and severe neurodegeneration in
      photoreceptor cells. The degeneration could be attenuated by blocking neuronal activity.
      Photoreceptor maintenance was rescued by enzymatically inactive NMNAT, indicating the
      neuroprotective function is NAD-independent.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While experimentally well-supported, photoreceptor cell maintenance is a tissue-specific
      manifestation of the broader neuroprotective function of Nmnat. The core function is
      neuronal maintenance in general, and photoreceptor cells are one of many cell types
      where this is observed. This is a non-core annotation reflecting the specific experimental
      model used rather than a unique photoreceptor-specific function.
