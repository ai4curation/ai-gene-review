description: >-
  Hsp22 is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) of Drosophila melanogaster that localizes to the
  mitochondrial matrix (PMID:10896659). It is one of four classical Drosophila sHSPs (Hsp22, Hsp23,
  Hsp26, Hsp27) encoded in a gene cluster at chromosomal locus 67B. All four sHSPs share a conserved
  alpha-crystallin domain and possess ATP-independent chaperone-like (holdase) activity, preventing
  heat-induced protein aggregation and maintaining substrates in a refoldable state (PMID:16572729).
  Hsp22 is unique among the four in its mitochondrial localization and forms oligomeric complexes
  (PMID:10896659). In vitro, Hsp22 is the most efficient of the four sHSPs at preventing citrate
  synthase aggregation at equimolar ratios and at maintaining luciferase in a refoldable state
  (PMID:16572729). Overexpression of Hsp22 extends adult lifespan and confers resistance to
  oxidative stress and heat stress (PMID:14734639, PMID:15331597). Its expression increases
  dramatically during aging. GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) is proposed for obsoletion;
  as a classic holdase, the closest replacement is GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity),
  though a caveat exists regarding carrier semantics (the GO:0140309 definition requires escorting
  between cellular components, which does not perfectly describe in-situ holdase activity).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for cytoplasm localization. Most sHSP family members across species localize
      to the cytoplasm. However, Hsp22 is specifically a mitochondrial matrix protein
      (PMID:10896659). The IBA propagation from cytoplasmic orthologs is phylogenetically
      reasonable at the family level but does not accurately reflect the specific localization of
      Hsp22. Since mitochondrial matrix is part of the cytoplasm in the broadest sense, this is
      not wrong but is misleadingly non-specific for this particular protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although Hsp22 is specifically mitochondrial, cytoplasm is a broad parent term and the IBA
      annotation is not incorrect. The more specific mitochondrial matrix annotation (IDA) exists
      separately. Accepting this as consistent with IBA methodology.

      localize to the nucleus. However, Hsp22 is specifically a mitochondrial matrix protein
      (PMID:10896659) and there is no direct evidence for nuclear localization.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Hsp22 has been experimentally shown to localize to the mitochondrial matrix (PMID:10896659).
      While many sHSP orthologs are nuclear, the IBA propagation does not account for the
      derived mitochondrial targeting of Hsp22. No direct experimental evidence supports nuclear
      localization.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding. sHSPs do not themselves refold proteins; they are
      holdases that maintain substrates in a refoldable state for subsequent HSP70-dependent
      refolding (PMID:16572729, PMID:26705243). The IBA is propagated from orthologs with
      similar activity. While sHSPs participate in the refolding pathway, the term
      protein refolding could be considered an over-annotation for a holdase that merely
      prevents aggregation rather than actively refolding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although Hsp22 is primarily a holdase rather than a foldase, it plays a documented
      role in the protein refolding pathway by maintaining substrates in a refoldable state.
      In the in vitro refolding assay with reticulocyte lysate, more than 50% of luciferase
      activity was recovered when heat denaturation was performed in the presence of Hsp22
      (PMID:16572729). The IBA annotation captures the involvement of sHSPs in the
      refolding process, even though the mechanism is holdase-mediated.
