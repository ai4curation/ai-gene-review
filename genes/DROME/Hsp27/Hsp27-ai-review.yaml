  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. Hsp27 is an sHSP holdase that binds unfolded proteins to prevent aggregation. GO:0140309 is not appropriate (carrier-specific). Retain until holdase NTR is created.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. Hsp27 is an sHSP holdase. GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity) is not appropriate because it is carrier-specific (per go-ontology#30552). Retain until a holdase chaperone activity NTR is created.
