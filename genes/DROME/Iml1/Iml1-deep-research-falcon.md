## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9W0E3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=GATOR complex protein Iml1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:25512509}; AltName: Full=Increased minichromosome loss 1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:25512509};
- **Gene Information:** Name=Iml1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:25512509, ECO:0000312|FlyBase:FBgn0035227}; Synonyms=DEPDC5 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:23723238}, SEA1 {ECO:0000312|FlyBase:FBgn0035227}; ORFNames=CG12090 {ECO:0000312|FlyBase:FBgn0035227};
- **Organism (full):** Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the IML1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** DEPDC5_CTD. (IPR045838); IML1. (IPR027244); IML1_double_psi_beta_barrel. (IPR055213); IML1_N. (IPR048255); DEPDC5_CTD (PF19418)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Iml1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Iml1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Iml1** (gene ID: Iml1, UniProt: Q9W0E3) in DROME.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status
- Objective 1 (verify identity): Completed. Evidence in a 2024 Drosophila-focused review maps Drosophila Iml1 to yeast Sea1 and human DEPDC5 and places it as a GATOR1 subunit alongside Nprl2 and Nprl3 (Iml1/Sea1/DEPDC5), consistent with the UniProt target context (Q9W0E3). The organism is Drosophila melanogaster. Domain annotations (IML1 family; DEPDC5_CTD) are consistent with UniProt but not detailed in the retrieved 2024 review; thus, domain verification is based on the UniProt record provided by the user and cross-species naming in the review (Sea1/Iml1/DEPDC5) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2).
- Objective 2 (search literature): Completed for 2023–2024 developments via the 2024 review synthesizing recent fly studies on GATOR regulation, lysosome/autophagy functions, and species-specific nutrient sensing (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Objective 3 (gather evidence): Completed. Extracted mechanistic claims, localization, and recent developments from the 2024 review (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 9-10).
- Objective 4 (citation chaining): Partially completed via the 2024 review’s synthesis; specific 2023–2024 primary papers are referenced within that review, but direct retrieval was insufficient; therefore, citations below primarily reference the review as a secondary, integrative source (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6).
- Objective 5 (artifact): Completed. A concise table summarizing key aspects is embedded below.
- Objective 6 (write and submit): Completed in this response.

Comprehensive research report: Drosophila Iml1 (UniProt Q9W0E3)

Executive summary
Iml1 encodes the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of yeast Sea1 and human DEPDC5, forming the catalytic/scaffold subunit of the GATOR1 complex with Nprl2 and Nprl3. GATOR1 acts as a GAP toward RagA/B to suppress TORC1 signaling at the lysosomal surface in response to amino acid limitation. Recent Drosophila studies, synthesized in a 2024 review, refine how the opposing GATOR2 complex regulates GATOR1 and reveal TORC1-independent roles for GATOR2 in lysosome-autophagy control, as well as the emergence of a species-restricted methionine/SAM sensor that signals through GATOR2. These findings contextualize Iml1’s function in a conserved nutrient-sensing hub that governs development and metabolism in flies (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and aliases: Iml1 is the Drosophila GATOR1 subunit orthologous to yeast Sea1 and human DEPDC5. Cross-species component tables in an authoritative 2024 review align Sea1 (yeast), Iml1 (fly), and DEPDC5 (human), supporting the alias relationships and confirming the D. melanogaster context (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Complex membership and function: GATOR is divided into GATOR1 (Iml1/DEPDC5 with Nprl2/Nprl3) and GATOR2. GATOR1 serves as a negative regulator of TORC1 by acting as a GTPase-activating protein for RagA/B, thereby blocking Rag-dependent TORC1 recruitment to lysosomes under amino acid limitation (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Cellular localization context: Rag GTPases localize to lysosomes and recruit TORC1 to the lysosomal surface where Rheb activates it; GATOR complexes (including GATOR2 and by context GATOR1) are found on lysosomes and autolysosomes, positioning Iml1 at this signaling hub (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Domain/family context: Iml1 belongs to the IML1 family and corresponds to DEPDC5 orthology; specific domain names (e.g., IML1, DEPDC5_CTD) come from the UniProt Q9W0E3 record provided in the prompt. The 2024 review supports the orthology and complex mapping (Sea1/Iml1/DEPDC5), consistent with those domain/family assignments (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasizing 2023–2024)
- Refined GATOR2 regulation and its impact on GATOR1/TORC1: Whole-animal Drosophila studies summarized in 2023–2024 identify WDR59 as an upstream inhibitor of GATOR2; loss of WDR59 increases GATOR1–GATOR2 interaction while decreasing GATOR1–Rag interaction, altering TORC1 output and phenocopying GATOR1 mutants in specific tissues. These findings reshape how the field views GATOR2’s control of GATOR1 in vivo (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- TORC1-independent GATOR2 role in lysosome/autophagy: Drosophila genetic analyses reveal that GATOR2 components (Wdr24, Mio, Seh1) support lysosomal acidification and autophagic flux independently of TORC1, consistent with mammalian studies that link GATOR2 to stabilization of MiT/TFE transcription factors. This reframes GATOR2 as a dual-function module and helps interpret phenotypes where TORC1 status alone does not explain defects (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6).
- Species-restricted nutrient sensor for methionine/SAM: A newly characterized Drosophila methionine sensor that binds GATOR2 and is antagonized by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) illustrates how the TORC1 pathway assimilates species-specific nutrient inputs via the GATOR hub. This discovery underscores evolutionary plasticity around a conserved core in which Iml1/GATOR1 acts as the Rag GAP arm (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 9-10).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Drosophila as a system to dissect GATOR-based nutrient sensing in whole animals: The 2024 synthesis emphasizes that fly genetics and tissue-specific studies can reveal context-dependent GATOR2→GATOR1 regulation and lysosome-centric roles that are challenging to resolve in proliferative cell lines, guiding experimental design for nutrient signaling and reproductive biology. This provides a translational framework to study conserved mTORC1 control logic with organismal physiology readouts (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Synthesis from a Drosophila-focused review: The authors conclude that the modularity of the GATOR hub allows integration of species-specific nutrient sensors while preserving core regulation by GATOR1/Iml1 as a Rag GAP. They argue that in vivo fly work has been essential to separate TORC1-dependent versus TORC1-independent roles of GATOR2, and to illuminate tissue-specific regulation that informs how Iml1/GATOR1 function is deployed during development and stress (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Genetic and phenotypic directionality: The review reports that GATOR1 component loss leads to elevated TORC1 signaling and defective response to amino acid starvation, while GATOR2 loss typically reduces TORC1 but also disrupts lysosome/autophagy in ways not rescued by TORC1 restoration. Although detailed quantitative effect sizes are study-specific, the directionality and tissue dependencies are consistently summarized across fly studies in 2023–2024 (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

Functional annotation for Iml1 (Drosophila melanogaster; UniProt Q9W0E3)
- Primary function: Iml1 is the DEPDC5/Sea1 orthologic subunit of GATOR1, which acts as a GAP toward RagA/B to inhibit TORC1 under amino acid limitation. This positions Iml1 as a negative regulator of nutrient-induced TORC1 activation via the Rag GTPase axis (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Substrates/partners: The immediate biochemical “substrate” of GATOR1 is RagA/B (Rag GTPases); in flies, GATOR1 antagonizes Rag-mediated TORC1 recruitment/activation at lysosomes. Iml1 functions with Nprl2 and Nprl3 in this trimeric complex (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 1-2, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Localization/site of action: The GATOR hub and Rag–TORC1 interaction occur on lysosomal/autolysosomal membranes—the site of TORC1 activation by Rheb—placing Iml1 where Rag recruitment and GAP regulation are spatially integrated (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).
- Pathway context: Iml1/GATOR1 integrates amino acid availability upstream of TORC1 via Rag GTPases. GATOR2 acts upstream/parallel to modulate GATOR1 and also exerts TORC1-independent control of lysosome-autophagy programs, shaping the net metabolic output in a tissue- and context-specific manner (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

Verification of identity and addressing symbol ambiguity
- The symbol Iml1 in Drosophila melanogaster matches the GATOR1 subunit orthologous to yeast Sea1 and human DEPDC5. The organism is D. melanogaster, and the complex mapping Sea1–Iml1–DEPDC5 is explicitly presented in the 2024 review. Domain/family annotations (IML1 family; DEPDC5_CTD) are provided in the UniProt record Q9W0E3 supplied by the user and are consistent with cross-species component naming in the review (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 2-4).

Practical implications and open questions
- The fly literature indicates that interpreting Iml1/GATOR1 phenotypes often requires considering GATOR2’s TORC1-independent lysosomal role and emerging species-specific nutrient sensors. This raises testable hypotheses about how Iml1-linked regulation of Rag/TORC1 is modulated by tissue-specific GATOR2 states, and how lysosome-autophagy programs crosstalk to impact development (Bettedi et al., Cells, 30 Oct 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells13211795) (bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 7-9, bettedi2024unveilinggator2function pages 4-6).
