description: >-
  dSin1 (Stress-activated MAP kinase-interacting protein 1) is an essential, conserved subunit of
  the TOR complex 2 (TORC2) in Drosophila melanogaster. It functions as a scaffold/adapter protein
  required for TORC2 complex assembly, stability, and kinase activity. The primary molecular function
  of dSin1 within TORC2 is to facilitate the phosphorylation of AGC family kinases, particularly
  Akt/PKB at its hydrophobic motif site (S505 in Drosophila), thereby enabling downstream signaling
  for cell growth, metabolism, and survival. dSin1 contains a CRIM domain that recruits AGC kinase
  substrates and a PH-like domain that mediates membrane localization via phosphoinositide binding.
  Loss of dSin1 reduces body and organ size primarily through decreased cell number, and this
  phenotype is rescued by FoxO reduction, establishing the dSin1-TORC2-Akt-FoxO growth axis.
  Unlike mammalian Sin1, Drosophila dSin1 does not appear to mediate stress-induced JNK activation.

      dSin1 is a core structural component of the TORC2 complex in Drosophila. This is strongly
      supported by phylogenetic analysis (IBA) and confirmed by experimental evidence showing
      that Sin1 is required for TORC2 complex formation and integrity (PMID:17043309).

    reason: >-
      The annotation is well-supported. Sin1/Avo1 is an evolutionarily conserved essential
      component of TORC2 across eukaryotes. In Drosophila, knockdown of Sin1 disrupts the
      interaction between Rictor and mTOR (PMID:17043309). This represents a core function

      dSin1 contains a PH-like domain that mediates membrane association via phosphoinositide

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping (Apoptosis keyword). However,
      this represents a significant SIGNALING OVER-EXTENSION. Sin1 functions in TORC2
      signaling, which activates Akt, which can phosphorylate pro-apoptotic proteins like
      Bad. This creates an indirect, multi-step connection to apoptosis regulation.
      dSin1 is NOT directly involved in apoptotic machinery - it is a TORC2 signaling
      component that is many steps removed from actual apoptosis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a classic case of pathway over-extension annotation. The chain is:
      Sin1 -> TORC2 assembly -> Akt phosphorylation -> Akt activation -> (many downstream
      targets including) -> Bad phosphorylation -> (potential) apoptosis inhibition.
      Sin1 does not directly participate in apoptotic processes. Its actual function is
      as a TORC2 subunit enabling Akt phosphorylation. The apoptosis connection is an
      indirect downstream consequence that could be 4-5 enzymatic steps removed.
      Drosophila-specific studies on dSin1 (Charette 2008 dissertation, cited in deep research)
      demonstrate that its primary phenotype is reduced growth via decreased cell number
      (Akt-FoxO axis), not altered apoptosis. Annotating Sin1 to apoptosis would be like
      annotating every upstream signaling component to every downstream phenotypic outcome.
      The TORC2 signaling annotation (GO:0038203) appropriately captures Sin1's actual
      biological role.

      In a Drosophila tuberous sclerosis model, Rheb overexpression causes synapse

      that Sin1 reduction rescues Rheb-mediated synapse overgrowth, indicating
      TORC2 is required for this phenotype. However, synapse assembly regulation
      is a secondary outcome of TORC2-Akt signaling, not a direct molecular function

  - description: >-
      dSin1 is an essential structural subunit of the TOR complex 2 (TORC2). It is required
      for complex assembly, stability, and integrity. Without Sin1, the Rictor-mTOR interaction
      is disrupted and TORC2 cannot form properly.

      Within TORC2, dSin1 functions as a substrate adapter that recognizes and binds AGC
      family kinases (particularly Akt/PKB) for phosphorylation by the TOR kinase catalytic
      subunit. The CRIM domain mediates substrate recruitment while the PH domain contributes
      to membrane localization where substrates are accessed.

suggested_questions:
  - question: Does dSin1 regulate any TORC2 substrates beyond Akt in Drosophila? In mammals, TORC2 phosphorylates multiple AGC kinases including PKC and SGK family members. The extent to which dSin1/TORC2 regulates these substrates in Drosophila has not been systematically characterized.
  - question: What is the mechanism by which TORC2/Sin1 promotes stress granule assembly? PMID:26054799 shows Sin1 mutants fail to form stress granules under heat stress, but the molecular mechanism connecting TORC2-Akt signaling to stress granule formation is not fully elucidated.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: Phosphoproteomics to identify dSin1-dependent TORC2 substrates. This would systematically identify AGC kinases and other substrates regulated by dSin1-containing TORC2 in Drosophila tissues.
  - description: Structure-function analysis of dSin1 CRIM and PH domains to determine the specific contributions of each domain to substrate recognition and membrane localization in Drosophila.
