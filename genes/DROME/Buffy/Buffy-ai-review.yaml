description: >-
  Buffy is a Drosophila melanogaster Bcl-2 family protein that functions primarily as an
  anti-apoptotic regulator. Unlike its paralog Debcl (the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member),
  Buffy predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum via a C-terminal membrane anchor
  and antagonizes Debcl-driven mitochondrial apoptosis. Buffy modulates the Debcl-Drp1 axis
  that regulates mitochondrial fission, ROS generation, and JNK-mediated caspase activation.
  While primarily pro-survival in vivo, Buffy exhibits context-dependent activity and can
  promote cell death in specific contexts such as microchaete glial cell death. Buffy also
  participates in autophagy regulation during starvation responses.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference. While Bcl-2 family proteins typically localize
      to mitochondrial outer membrane, experimental evidence in Drosophila shows Buffy predominantly
      localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), not mitochondria, in contrast to its paralog
      Debcl which targets mitochondria (PMID:17205077).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Experimental localization studies demonstrate that "these two proteins localize to distinct
      intracellular membranes, DEBCL predominantly to mitochondria and BUFFY to endoplasmic
      reticula (ER)" (PMID:17205077). The C-terminal positively charged residues present in
      Debcl that target it to mitochondria are absent in Buffy. While an IDA annotation to
      GO:0005739 (mitochondrion) exists, the primary localization is ER. The IBA annotation
      likely reflects ancestral Bcl-2 family localization that was lost in the Buffy lineage.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-2 family
      proteins can form channels in membranes. However, no direct experimental evidence
      demonstrates channel activity for Drosophila Buffy specifically.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While direct channel activity has not been demonstrated for Buffy specifically, this
      is a conserved molecular function of Bcl-2 family proteins. The IBA annotation is
      reasonable given the evolutionary conservation of channel-forming capability in this
      protein family. Buffy contains the conserved Bcl-2 domain architecture required for
      channel formation.

      IEA annotation based on logical inference from channel activity. Since Buffy has
      channel activity annotation (GO:0015267), transmembrane transport follows logically
      as channels mediate transport.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is a logical consequence of the channel activity annotation. If Buffy
      has channel activity (as annotated via IBA), then it participates in transmembrane
      transport by definition. This is an appropriate transitive closure annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping (Apoptosis keyword). This annotation
      conflates regulation of apoptosis with participation in the apoptotic process itself.
      Buffy is a REGULATOR of apoptosis (primarily anti-apoptotic), not a core apoptotic
      machinery component (PMID:12853472).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      This is a classic case of conflating regulation with participation. Buffy does not
      execute apoptosis - it REGULATES the apoptotic process. The literature is clear:
      "Buffy, the second Drosophila Bcl-2-like protein, is a pro-survival protein" and
      "overexpression of buffy results in the inhibition of developmental programmed cell
      death and gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis" (PMID:12853472). Buffy acts upstream
      to modulate whether apoptosis occurs, not as part of the apoptotic execution machinery.
      The appropriate term is GO:0043066 (negative regulation of apoptotic process) for the
      primary anti-apoptotic function.

      This is a valid but very general annotation. Buffy is a single-pass membrane protein

      IEA annotation from InterPro record association. This is accurate - Buffy does regulate

    action: MODIFY

      While technically correct, experimental evidence strongly supports Buffy's primary
      role as an ANTI-apoptotic regulator (negative regulation). "Buffy, the second Drosophila
      Bcl-2-like protein, is a pro-survival protein" (PMID:12853472). The term GO:0043066
      (negative regulation of apoptotic process) is more specific and better reflects the
      core function. The generic "regulation" term obscures Buffy's actual role.
