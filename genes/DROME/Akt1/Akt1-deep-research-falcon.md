## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):

- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:7876156}; Short=DAkt {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8302573}; Short=DRAC-PK {ECO:0000303|PubMed:7876156}; Short=Dakt1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9601646}; EC=2.7.11.1 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7876156}; AltName: Full=Protein kinase B {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9601646}; Short=PKB {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9601646};
- **Gene Information:** Name=Akt {ECO:0000303|PubMed:11740943, ECO:0000312|FlyBase:FBgn0010379}; Synonyms=Akt1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9601646}; ORFNames=CG4006 {ECO:0000312|FlyBase:FBgn0010379};
- **Organism (full):** Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. AGC Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** AGC-kinase_C. (IPR000961); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); PH-like_dom_sf. (IPR011993); PH_domain. (IPR001849); PH_PKB. (IPR039026)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Akt" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Akt' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Akt** (gene ID: Akt1, UniProt: Q8INB9) in DROME.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: We verified the Drosophila Akt identity, gathered core mechanistic evidence (domain architecture, activation sites, pathway placement), extracted quantitative data (e.g., TORC2 dependence of Ser505 phosphorylation and effects on FOXO), and synthesized these into a compact artifact for reference. Despite targeted searches, recent 2023–2024 Drosophila-specific primary studies directly on Akt (CG4006) were limited in the accessible evidence set; therefore, the report emphasizes foundational Drosophila papers with clear mechanistic data and indicates where recency is lacking.

Comprehensive research report: Drosophila melanogaster Akt (dAkt/PKB; CG4006; UniProt Q8INB9)

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and domains: Drosophila Akt (also dAkt/PKB; gene CG4006, synonyms Akt/Akt1) is an AGC-family serine/threonine kinase composed of an N‑terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a central kinase domain, and a C‑terminal AGC regulatory tail that contains a hydrophobic motif (HM). These features and placement in the insulin/PI3K pathway are established in Drosophila and conserved with mammals (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3). Mammalian overviews further support the conserved PH→PIP3 recruitment, dual-site phosphorylation requirement, and AGC family architecture (publication: Jul 2009; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.002) (elghazi2009aktandpten pages 11-15).
- Catalytic activity: Akt is a protein-serine/threonine kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) that phosphorylates downstream substrates to control growth, metabolism, and survival. In Drosophila, Akt lies downstream of insulin receptor and PI3K, and upstream of TSC/TOR, S6K, and 4E‑BP (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 11-11, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9).

2) Activation mechanism and localization
- Membrane recruitment: Insulin/PI3K elevates PIP3 at the plasma membrane. The dAkt PH domain binds PIP3, recruiting dAkt to the membrane where activating kinases access it (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 11-11).
- Phosphorylation sites and kinases: Full activation requires phosphorylation at two conserved regulatory sites: the activation-loop threonine by PDK1 (Thr342 in Drosophila) and the C‑terminal hydrophobic-motif serine by TOR complex 2 (Ser505 in Drosophila). TORC2 (rictor/Sin1) is required for S505 HM phosphorylation and for maximal Akt activity in response to strong insulin signals (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 5-6).
- Subcellular localization dynamics: dAkt is predominantly cytosolic in basal conditions and translocates to the plasma membrane upon PI3K-produced PIP3 accumulation, a prerequisite step for PDK1 and TORC2 phosphorylation and activation (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10).

3) Pathways, substrates, and precise roles
- Insulin/PI3K/Akt/TOR axis: Genetic and biochemical analyses in Drosophila place dAkt as the key effector linking PI3K/PTEN-regulated PIP3 signals to TSC/Rheb/TORC1. Akt phosphorylation of Tsc2 stimulates TORC1, leading to phosphorylation of S6K and 4E‑BP, which increases protein synthesis and growth (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9).
- FOXO regulation: Akt phosphorylates FOXO, reducing its activity and nuclear localization. TORC2 loss (rictor mutants) reduces Akt S505 phosphorylation and decreases FOXO phosphorylation, increasing FOXO activity; epistasis shows TORC2 limits growth primarily when signaling is activated at or above Akt (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 4-5, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3).
- Direct outputs to translation: Insulin-induced phosphorylation of d4E‑BP and dS6K depends on the Akt–TSC–TOR pathway. dPDK1 depletion abolishes dS6K Thr398 phosphorylation, while dAkt knockdown reduces insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both d4E‑BP and dS6K, underscoring Akt’s upstream role (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10).

4) Recent developments (2023–2024) and real-world implementations
- Within the accessible evidence, directly Akt-focused Drosophila primary papers from 2023–2024 were not retrieved. However, the conserved placement of Akt in insulin signaling and TOR regulation remains the conceptual framework used across recent immunometabolic and aging literature; the Drosophila pathway logic summarized above continues to be cited as canonical (e.g., recent immuno-metabolic reviews referencing Drosophila and conserved Akt/FOXO axes; publication: Mar 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1128622) — note: while located during search, this specific item was not available in the sanctioned evidence set for formal citation. Consequently, our report emphasizes rigorously established Drosophila mechanistic studies with explicit residue-level and genetic data (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 4-5, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 11-11, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9). Where needed, conserved mammalian reviews are used to support general Akt biochemistry (elghazi2009aktandpten pages 11-15).

5) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- TORC2’s role in Akt regulation and tissue growth: Hietakangas & Cohen (Genes & Development, 2007) re-evaluated Akt regulation and concluded that HM phosphorylation by TORC2 (S505) is dispensable for viability but required for maximal Akt activation and for repressing FOXO under strong insulin inputs; they propose that targeting TORC2 can modulate Akt hyperactivation phenotypes (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 5-6, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 4-5).
- Insulin→Akt→TOR growth control: Miron, Lasko & Sonenberg (Molecular and Cellular Biology, 2003) provide experimental RNAi evidence for the pathway from PI3K/PTEN/Akt to TSC/TOR and to 4E‑BP/S6K in Drosophila, defining Akt as a central growth-control node (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 11-11).
- Conserved activation logic: Elghazi & Bernal‑Mizrachi (Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2009) provide a mechanistic overview of Akt activation steps, PH‑domain PIP3 binding, and dual‑site phosphorylation as a general AGC‑kinase principle, aligning with Drosophila dAkt biochemistry (publication: Jul 2009; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.002) (elghazi2009aktandpten pages 11-15).

6) Relevant statistics and quantitative data from Drosophila studies
- TORC2 dependence of Akt HM phosphorylation: In rictor mutants, Ser505 phosphorylation of dAkt is nearly abolished (>95% reduction), demonstrating TORC2’s essential role for this site in vivo (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3).
- FOXO phosphorylation and HM site: Under rescue conditions, wild-type Akt yields ~33% FOXO in a phosphorylated (slower-migrating) form versus ~19% with Akt S505A, indicating diminished FOXO repression when the HM site is not phosphorylated (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 4-5).
- Phenotypic scope of TORC2 loss: rictor/sin1 mutants (loss of TORC2) are homozygous viable with modest growth delay; HM phosphorylation is necessary for maximal Akt activity in strong insulin signaling, but Akt retains sufficient activity for development without HM phosphorylation (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 5-6).
- Pathway epistasis: Removing rictor suppresses PI3K-hyperactivation overgrowth (e.g., PTEN loss) but not TORC1-driven overgrowth (e.g., TSC1 loss), mapping TORC2’s function to the level of Akt and above (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 4-5, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2).
- Translational outputs: Insulin-induced phosphorylation of d4E‑BP and dS6K requires the Akt→TSC→TOR pathway; PDK1 knockdown abolishes dS6K Thr398 phosphorylation, while Akt RNAi reduces both d4E‑BP and dS6K phosphorylation, quantitatively linking Akt to growth control via TOR substrates (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10).

Primary function and pathway role summary (concise)
- Biochemical function: dAkt is a serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1) that is activated by PIP3-dependent membrane recruitment and dual phosphorylation (activation loop Thr342 by PDK1; hydrophobic motif Ser505 by TORC2). Activated dAkt phosphorylates substrates including FOXO (inhibiting its transcriptional activity) and promotes TORC1 signaling via TSC2, leading to phosphorylation of S6K and 4E‑BP and increased translation and growth (publication URLs and dates: Dec 2003, https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003; Mar 2007, https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 8-9, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3).
- Cellular localization of function: Cytosolic-to-plasma membrane translocation via the PH domain upon PIP3 generation is essential for activation; downstream actions occur in the cytosol and nucleus (via FOXO regulation) and via cytosolic signaling to TORC1 at lysosomal/mTOR compartments to control translation (publication: Dec 2003; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.23.24.9117-9126.2003; Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2).

Verification and symbol ambiguity
- The gene symbol “Akt” is used for Drosophila Akt/PKB encoded by CG4006 and matches UniProt Q8INB9. The organism is Drosophila melanogaster. Domain composition (PH domain, kinase domain, AGC tail) aligns with literature-corroborated features of dAkt/PKB in Drosophila (publication: Mar 2007; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.416307) (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3). No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered in the cited Drosophila literature.

Limitations and open needs
- While we prioritized 2023–2024 literature in searches, the accessible evidence set returned foundational Drosophila primary studies (2003–2007) and conserved mammalian analysis (2009). Recent Drosophila Akt-specific primary updates (2023–2024) were not retrievable in the sanctioned dataset; thus, claims herein are grounded in classical, high-quality Drosophila experiments and conserved mechanistic logic. Future updates should integrate newly published Drosophila Akt studies (e.g., system-specific roles in immunity or organ physiology) as they become available in accessible repositories (hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 1-2, hietakangas2007reevaluatingaktregulation pages 2-3, miron2003signalingfromakt pages 9-10).
