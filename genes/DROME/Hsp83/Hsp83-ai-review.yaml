description: >-
  Hsp83 is the sole Drosophila melanogaster member of the HSP90 family of
  ATP-dependent molecular chaperones. It promotes the maturation, structural
  maintenance, and proper regulation of specific client proteins involved in
  cell cycle control, signal transduction, piRNA biogenesis, and centrosome
  function. Hsp83 undergoes a functional ATPase cycle that induces
  conformational changes in client proteins, thereby causing their activation.
  It interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones (Hop, Shu, Dpit47,
  Morgana) that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle, and chaperone
  function. In addition to its canonical chaperone role, Hsp83 has a
  non-chaperone membrane-deforming function mediated by an amphipathic helix
  that promotes exosome release. Hsp83 is constitutively expressed and further
  induced by heat stress; it is also expressed during oogenesis and plays
  roles in developmental processes including centrosome cycle, cell cycle exit,
  mRNA localization, and sleep regulation.

      Centrosome cycle involvement is a downstream consequence of Hsp83
      chaperone function on centrosome client proteins. Hsp90 is required
      for proper centrosome function, but this is a pleiotropic effect
      of its core chaperone activity.

      IMP annotation from PMID:12015603. Flies carrying a mutation for
      Hsp83 showed exaggerated homeostatic sleep response and died after
      sleep deprivation, demonstrating that Hsp83 plays a protective role
      in sleep homeostasis.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Sleep regulation is a pleiotropic downstream effect. Hsp83 mutants
      show exaggerated homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, but
      this likely reflects a general stress-protective role rather than
      a direct sleep-regulatory function.

    The primary molecular function of Hsp83. As a member of the HSP90 family,
    Hsp83 binds near-native client proteins and uses its intrinsic ATPase
    activity to drive conformational changes that promote client maturation,
    activation, and stabilization. Known clients include kinases (insulin
    receptor, LKB1), transcription factors, Argonaute, APC/C components
    (Cdh1/Fzr), and centrosomal proteins.
