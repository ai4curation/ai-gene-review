core_functions:
- description: Nprl2 is a GATOR1 subunit that contributes to Rag 
    GTPase-activating activity to inhibit TORC1 during amino acid starvation.
  supported_by:
  - reference_id: file:genes/DROME/Nprl2/Nprl2-deep-research-falcon.md
    supporting_text: Nprl2 is one of three core subunits of GATOR1 (with 
      Iml1/DEPDC5 and Nprl3).
  - reference_id: PMID:24786828
    supporting_text: Nprl2 and Nprl3 inhibit TORC1 signaling in the female 
      germline in response to amino-acid starvation.
