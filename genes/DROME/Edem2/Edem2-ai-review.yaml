description: >-
  Drosophila EDEM2 (CG5682) is an ER-resident alpha-mannosidase-like protein that functions in
  ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded glycoproteins. Despite sequence similarity to
  glycosyl hydrolase family 47 mannosidases, EDEM2 primarily functions as an ERAD substrate
  recognition factor (lectin/sensor) that recognizes misfolded glycoproteins via their mannose-
  trimmed N-glycans and targets them for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.
  Drosophila EDEM2 is most similar to mammalian EDEM3 (PMID:25716426). The protein is
  transcriptionally upregulated by ER stress and plays a protective role by promoting degradation
  of misfolded proteins such as mutant alpha-1-antitrypsin variants NHK and ATZ (PMID:25716426).
  EDEM2 co-localizes with Hsc3 (Drosophila BiP ortholog) in the ER (PMID:25716426). The
  GO:0051082 unfolded protein binding annotation reflects its recognition of misfolded
  glycoprotein substrates for ERAD, but this is a quality control sensor function, not
  chaperone activity. Per UPB project guidelines, ER quality control sensors should have
  GO:0051082 removed or marked as over-annotated.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase activity. Drosophila
      EDEM2 belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 47 and contains the catalytic domain and
      active site residues characteristic of alpha-1,2-mannosidases (UniProt features show
      four active site residues). While EDEMs were initially considered lectins, recent studies
      have revealed that some EDEMs can function as mannosidases (PMID:25716426: "recent studies
      have revealed that EDEMs can function as mannosidases"). The IBA annotation is
      phylogenetically appropriate given the conserved catalytic residues. However, whether
      Drosophila EDEM2 has actual catalytic mannosidase activity versus acting primarily as
      a lectin/sensor has not been directly demonstrated.

      EDEM2 belongs to GH47 family with conserved active site residues. The IBA annotation
