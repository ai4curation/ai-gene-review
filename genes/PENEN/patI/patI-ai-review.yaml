description: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of 
  m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol in the patulin biosynthetic 
  pathway. This enzyme is an essential component of the patulin gene cluster in 
  Penicillium expansum, operating in the endoplasmic reticulum as part of the 
  mycotoxin production pathway.

      summary: Supported by experimental evidence showing patI encodes a 
        cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes hydroxylation reactions in 
        patulin biosynthesis. The IEA annotation is consistent with experimental
        IDA evidence from PMID:30680886.

    review:
      summary: Correct but overly general. PatI has monooxygenase activity 
        (GO:0004497), which is a more specific subclass of oxidoreductase 
        activity. The more specific term better captures the enzyme function.

    proposed_definition: 'Catalysis of the reaction: 3-hydroxybenzyl alcohol + reduced
      [NADPH--hemoprotein reductase] + O2 = gentisyl alcohol + oxidized [NADPH--hemoprotein
      reductase] + H2O + H(+). This reaction is involved in patulin biosynthesis.'
    justification: This specific hydroxylase activity is characterized for patI 
      and documented in Rhea (RHEA:62212). The current general term 
      "monooxygenase activity" does not capture the substrate specificity of 
      this enzyme, which converts m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol as
      a key step in patulin biosynthesis.
