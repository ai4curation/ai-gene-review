  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'Correct but overly general. PatI has monooxygenase activity (GO:0004497), which is a more specific subclass of oxidoreductase activity. The more specific term better captures the enzyme function.'

  review:
    summary: 'Correct and more specific than general oxidoreductase activity. This accurately describes the mechanism of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which incorporate one oxygen atom into the substrate while reducing the other to water.'

    summary: 'Correct - essential cofactor for cytochrome P450 function. UniProt shows heme binding at residue 446 with experimental evidence. Heme is required for the monooxygenase catalytic activity.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'Correct but less specific than patulin biosynthetic process (GO:0140723). Patulin is indeed a mycotoxin, but the more specific term better captures the precise pathway involvement.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'Correct but overly general. The more specific iron ion binding (GO:0005506) is more informative as it specifies the actual metal ion bound through the heme cofactor.'

  justification: 'This specific hydroxylase activity is characterized for patI and documented in Rhea (RHEA:62212). The current general term "monooxygenase activity" does not capture the substrate specificity of this enzyme, which converts m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol as a key step in patulin biosynthesis.'
