# PatI (Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase) in *Penicillium expansum*  

**UniProt ID:** A0A075TMP8  
**Gene Name:** *patI*  
**Protein Name:** Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PatI  
**Organism:** *Penicillium expansum* (blue mold rot fungus)  

**Overview:** PatI is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster of *P. expansum*. This enzyme plays a specific role in the multi-step pathway that produces patulin, a polyketide mycotoxin. As a P450, PatI catalyzes oxidative transformations of pathway intermediates, functioning as a heme-thiolate monooxygenase. Below is a comprehensive summary of PatI’s function, localization, biological roles, disease relevance, protein features, expression regulation, evolutionary conservation, and key evidence supporting its characterized roles, with an emphasis on information useful for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation.  

## Gene Function and Mechanism  
PatI functions as a monooxygenase that catalyzes a crucial hydroxylation step in the patulin biosynthesis pathway ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=sequence%20of%20A,belongs%20to%20the%20AminoCarboxyMuconate%20Semialdehyde)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). Specifically, PatI converts *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (3-hydroxymethylphenol) into gentisyl alcohol (2,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol) by introducing an additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). This reaction follows the prior step catalyzed by PatH (another P450) which hydroxylates *m*-cresol to form *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=sequence%20of%20A,belongs%20to%20the%20AminoCarboxyMuconate%20Semialdehyde)). In vitro reconstitution of PatI’s activity (via heterologous expression in yeast) confirmed that it hydroxylates *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to yield gentisyl alcohol, a known intermediate in patulin biosynthesis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). (Notably, PatI can also hydroxylate *m*-cresol to 2,5-dihydroxytoluene/toluquinol in experimental assays, although this product is not part of the main patulin pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)).) Mechanistically, PatI is a heme-thiolate enzyme that utilizes molecular oxygen and electrons (supplied via NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase) to oxidize its substrate, a classic monooxygenase reaction. This enzymatic function aligns with GO terms such as **“monooxygenase activity”** and **“oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation of one atom of oxygen”**, reflecting PatI’s role in catalyzing oxidative hydroxylation. Together with other cluster enzymes, PatI’s activity ensures the stepwise modification of the polyketide backbone into the toxic metabolite patulin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in)). Disruption of *patI* would interrupt this pathway at the gentisyl alcohol step, preventing completion of patulin biosynthesis (consistent with genetic studies showing each step is required) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover)).  

## Subcellular Localization  
PatI is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, typical for eukaryotic microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the)). The protein contains a hydrophobic N-terminal segment that serves as a transmembrane anchor, integrating PatI into the ER membrane (GO:0005789 – **“endoplasmic reticulum membrane”**). This subcellular placement positions PatI in the same compartment as PatH, ensuring efficient transfer of the *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol intermediate from PatH to PatI within the ER ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the)). In *P. expansum*, patulin biosynthesis is a compartmentalized process: early steps occur in the cytosol, the P450-mediated hydroxylations by PatH and PatI take place in the ER, subsequent oxidations (e.g. by PatJ/PatO) occur in vacuoles, and later steps happen in the cytosol or extracellular space ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the)). Thus, PatI’s ER membrane localization is crucial for its function, allowing it to access substrates that are shuttled into the ER lumen during patulin production. Consistently, experimental localization studies of the patulin cluster enzymes showed that PatI (along with PatH) resides in the ER, and proper ER targeting of these enzymes is necessary for patulin biosynthesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the)). GO annotations reflecting this localization include **“integral component of membrane”** and **“endoplasmic reticulum”**.  

## Biological Processes  
PatI is directly involved in the **patulin biosynthetic process**, a secondary metabolite pathway in *P. expansum*. The patulin pathway is an acetate-derived polyketide pathway consisting of roughly 10 enzymatic steps that sequentially transform 6-methylsalicylic acid into patulin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). Within this pathway, PatI’s specific role is to produce gentisyl alcohol, which is then further oxidized and rearranged by downstream enzymes into isoepoxydon and beyond ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in)). All 15 genes of the *P. expansum* patulin gene cluster (named *patA* through *patO*) work in concert and are required for patulin production ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover)). PatI represents one of the core catalytic genes in this cluster, confirming its process involvement in patulin synthesis. In GO terms, *patI* would be annotated to **“patulin biosynthetic process”** (as a child of secondary metabolite biosynthesis) and perhaps more broadly to **“secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”** (GO:0044550). Apart from toxin biosynthesis, PatI’s product (gentisyl alcohol) is an intermediate that may have biological activity; however, its primary significance is serving as a precursor in toxin formation. Patulin itself has antimicrobial properties and may help *P. expansum* compete against other microbes in fruit substrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8541162/#:~:text=Traditional%20Apple%20Cultivars%20,splits%20that%20can%20occur%20from)). Nonetheless, patulin is considered a secondary metabolite not essential for the fungus’s growth or infection capability in lab conditions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=Functional%20studies%20confirmed%20that%20PePatL,italicum%20or%20P)). Thus, the principal biological role of PatI is tied to secondary metabolism (toxin production) rather than primary fungal physiology.  

## Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
*Penicillium expansum* is the causal agent of blue mold rot on fruits (especially apples and pears), and patulin production is a hallmark of this pathogen’s postharvest disease impact ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28362209/#:~:text=global%20food%20industry%20due%20to,reduce%20or%20prevent%20the%20contamination)). PatI, by enabling patulin biosynthesis, contributes to the accumulation of this mycotoxin in infected fruits and derived products (like apple juice). Patulin is a potent toxin: ingestion can cause acute and chronic health effects, including immunotoxic, neurotoxic, and gastrointestinal disturbances ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20toxic%20fungal,for%20infants%20and%20young%20children)). Due to these risks, regulatory agencies impose strict limits on patulin levels in foods (e.g., ≤50 µg/kg in apple juice) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20toxic%20fungal,for%20infants%20and%20young%20children)). In this context, PatI is indirectly associated with human health hazards, as its activity is required for the fungus to produce patulin that contaminates food. From a disease perspective, however, genetic studies indicate that patulin biosynthesis is not required for *P. expansum* to cause fruit rot (**virulence**). Deletion of key patulin genes (e.g., the PKS *patK* or regulator *patL*) abolishes toxin production but does not significantly reduce the fungus’s ability to infect and macerate apple tissue ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=related%20to%20secondary%20metabolism%2C%20including,italicum%20or%20P)). This suggests that patulin (and by extension PatI) is not a virulence factor essential for pathogenesis in the host, but rather a concurrent secondary trait. The phenotype of a *patI* loss-of-function mutant would be an inability to produce patulin, with likely accumulation of the preceding intermediate (*m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol) and no formation of downstream patulin pathway products. Such a mutant would still cause blue mold symptoms on fruit, but without toxin accumulation. This aligns with the finding that all cluster enzymes are involved in toxin synthesis – if PatI is absent, the pathway is interrupted and patulin is not produced ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover)). There are no known direct “disease mutations” in *patI* (as it’s a fungal gene), but its activity underlies the mycotoxicosis risk associated with *P. expansum*-contaminated food. For GO annotation, relevant terms include **“pathogenesis”** (to note involvement in a pathogen’s processes) or **“response to host”**, though *patI* specifically might not be annotated to virulence given patulin is dispensable for infection ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=Functional%20studies%20confirmed%20that%20PePatL,italicum%20or%20P)). Instead, its role is best captured by toxin biosynthetic process terms.  

## Structural Features and Domains  
PatI is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are characterized by a conserved heme-binding domain and monooxygenase activity. The PatI protein is approximately 529 amino acids in length ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20genes%20were%20identified,cresol%20to)) and is classified in the CYP619 subfamily (denoted as CYP619C2 in *Aspergillus clavatus*, an orthologous enzyme) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=,to%20the%20patulin%20gene%20cluster)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20genes%20were%20identified,dihydroxytoluene%20%28toluquinol%29%2C%20respectively.%20Except%20for)). It contains the signature P450 cysteine motif near the C-terminus (the heme-binding **Cys** that ligates the heme iron) as part of the consensus sequence typical for P450s. This motif is crucial for the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism, as it forms the thiolate ligand to the heme cofactor. PatI also harbors the conserved EXXR sequence in the K-helix and other motifs that stabilize the core P450 fold and contribute to oxygen activation – these are hallmark features of P450 enzymes observed across species. Structurally, PatI is predicted to adopt the canonical P450 fold: a predominantly helical enzyme with a buried heme prosthetic group and an active-site cavity for substrate binding. An **N-terminal transmembrane helix** (around ~20–30 residues) anchors PatI to the ER membrane, as is common for microsomal P450s, while the bulk of the protein (including the active site) faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Apart from the P450 domain, PatI does not contain significant additional domains; it is a single-domain enzyme belonging to enzyme class EC 1.14.-.- (oxidoreductases that act on paired donors with incorporation of oxygen). The lack of extensive accessory domains is typical for P450s, which are self-contained catalytic units requiring only the heme and associated redox partners. PatI’s amino acid sequence shares moderate identity with other fungal P450s, especially those involved in secondary metabolism. The closest homologs are P450s from patulin-producing fungi, which cluster into the same CYP619 family, indicating a conserved structural framework tuned to recognize similar aromatic substrates ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin)). In summary, PatI’s key structural features include the heme-thiolate active site and membrane-anchor segment, which together facilitate its function as an ER-bound monooxygenase. GO annotations for **“heme binding”** (GO:0020037) and **“iron ion binding”** (GO:0005506) are applicable to PatI, reflecting its metalloprotein nature.  

## Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Expression of *patI* is tightly co-regulated with the other genes in the patulin biosynthetic cluster, reflecting coordinated control of the entire pathway. Under patulin-producing conditions (such as nutrient starvation or late stationary phase in culture), *patI* mRNA levels rise in parallel with other patulin genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20monooxygenases%20in%20the,hydroxybenzyl%20alcohol)). In *Aspergillus clavatus*, the two P450 genes (PatI and PatH) were shown to be strongly co-expressed specifically during the period of patulin production ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20monooxygenases%20in%20the,hydroxybenzyl%20alcohol)), and a similar pattern is observed in *P. expansum*. In liquid culture, patulin begins to accumulate after ~3 days of growth, coincident with increased transcription of cluster enzymes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=match%20at%20L304%20First%2C%20patulin,old%20culture)). Regulatory control of *patI* is exerted at multiple levels:  

- **Pathway-Specific Regulation:** The patulin cluster encodes a Zn(II)₂Cys₆ transcription factor, PatL, which acts as a cluster-specific regulator ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=et%E2%80%89al,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic)). *patL* is expressed alongside the biosynthetic genes and is required for their activation. Mutation of *patL* abolishes expression of enzymes like PatI and consequently blocks patulin synthesis ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=related%20to%20secondary%20metabolism%2C%20including,italicum%20or%20P)). Thus, PatL positively regulates *patI* expression (GO:0045893 – positive regulation of transcription), ensuring the cluster is transcriptionally silent unless conditions favor metabolite production.  

- **Global Regulators:** *P. expansum* patulin production is influenced by global regulatory networks. One such network involves the **Velvet complex** – a set of fungal regulatory proteins (VeA, VelB, VelC, LaeA, etc.) that coordinate development and secondary metabolism. Recent research showed that velvet proteins VeA, VelB, and VelC are involved in regulating patulin biosynthetic genes (including *patI*), as deletion of these regulators impacts patulin levels ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,mechanism%20of%20patulin%20in%20fungi)). These factors likely modulate *patI* indirectly by affecting *patL* or the chromatin state of the cluster (Velvet complexes are known to interact with LaeA, a global methyltransferase that governs secondary metabolite gene clusters).  

- **Environmental Signals:** The expression of *patI* and its cluster is modulated by external conditions such as pH, carbon source, and nitrogen availability ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic)). *P. expansum* typically produces higher patulin under acidified conditions (e.g., in decayed fruit which often has low pH). The fungus can actively modulate ambient pH; for instance, it secretes organic acids like gluconic acid to acidify the host environment. This acidic environment ties into the **PacC** pathway – PacC is a pH-responsive transcription factor in fungi. Studies have shown that in an acidic milieu, *P. expansum* responds to alkaline stress signals (like ammonia production) by activating PacC, which in turn leads to upregulation of patulin genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic)). Specifically, adding ammonia (which transiently raises intracellular pH or mimics host tissue alkalinization) resulted in increased *patulin cluster* transcripts including *patI*, concomitant with PacC activation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=ammonia%20of%20the%20patulin%20biosynthesis,the%20host%20environment%20by%20the)). This indicates that *patI* expression is at least partially under pH regulatory control: at low pH (acidic fruit), PacC is inactive and patulin genes are expressed at baseline; a slight pH increase via ammonia triggers PacC, which further boosts cluster gene expression in a feedback that can enhance toxin production.  

- **Nutrient and Stress Conditions:** Patulin biosynthesis (hence *patI* expression) is favored under certain nutrient limitations. Research has noted that permissive conditions for patulin production include particular carbon sources (e.g., moderate sugar levels) and nitrogen sources ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic)). Carbon catabolite repression may need to be relieved for cluster induction; similarly, nitrogen starvation or certain amino acids can influence secondary metabolite gene clusters. In *P. expansum*, the highest patulin levels and *patI* expression are often observed when glucose is depleted and nitrogen is limited, conditions that mimic fruit postharvest environments. Additionally, light and oxidative stress are known to affect velvet regulators, and thus could indirectly affect *patI* expression (Velvet complex often links to light response, with VeA being active in darkness which is when many toxins are produced).  

In summary, *patI* is transcriptionally silent during early growth and is induced during late growth or in host-mimicking conditions. Its expression is governed by both cluster-specific factors (PatL) and global regulators responding to environmental cues (pH via PacC, developmental cues via Velvet, and nutrient status) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic)). These layers of regulation ensure patulin (and *patI*) is produced only under favorable conditions, aligning with the fungus’s ecological strategy. GO terms pertinent here include **“secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”** (tying expression to that process), and regulatory GO terms like **“response to pH”** or **“response to nutrient levels”** could be considered at the pathway level.  

## Evolutionary Conservation  
The *patI* gene and its product are conserved among patulin-producing fungi, indicating a common evolutionary origin of this biosynthetic pathway. The patulin gene cluster is present in multiple species across the *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*, and *Byssochlamys* genera ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=most%20often%20found%20on%20apples,producing%20species)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum)). Comparative genomic studies have revealed that *P. expansum* possesses an intact 15-gene patulin cluster (*patA–patO*), whereas closely related species that do not produce patulin (such as *P. italicum* or *P. digitatum*) lack one or more of these genes or have nonfunctional remnants ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=important%20pathogenic%20characters%2C%20and%20secondary,italicum%20or%20P)). Within this cluster, *patI* shows significant sequence similarity to its orthologs in other fungi. For example, *Aspergillus clavatus* (an Aspergillus species that makes patulin) contains a PatI ortholog sharing ~60–70% identity to *P. expansum* PatI ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin)). This A. *clavatus* gene (also called *patI*, classified as CYP619C2) has the same enzymatic role and clusters with the equivalent patulin genes in that species ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). *Penicillium griseofulvum* (formerly *P. patulum*), another patulin producer studied historically, likewise carries a homologous P450 gene in its patulin cluster. Synteny analysis shows that the gene order and orientation in the patulin cluster are largely conserved among different fungi: for instance, the tail end of the cluster (*patM–patN–patO* in *P. expansum*) is arranged identically in *A. clavatus* and *P. griseofulvum* ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum)). Such conservation suggests the cluster was present in a common ancestor and has been maintained due to the adaptive advantage of patulin production, or via horizontal transfer between species. PatI appears to be unique to patulin-producing lineages; non-patulin-producers do not have close analogs performing the same biochemical step, underlining that PatI evolved specifically for this secondary metabolite pathway. In terms of broader P450 evolution, PatI belongs to a clade (CYP619 family) that is found in eurotiomycete fungi and is distinct from P450s involved in primary metabolism or other toxin pathways. This specialization is mirrored by moderate-to-high identity among PatI orthologs, but lower similarity to P450s outside the patulin cluster. From a GO perspective, **“patulin biosynthetic process”** can be considered a conserved biological process across these fungi, and PatI’s molecular function (monooxygenase activity) is conserved, though its occurrence is restricted to species capable of patulin production. In summary, *patI* is evolutionarily conserved within the context of the patulin gene cluster across several fungi, reflecting a conserved mechanism for generating this mycotoxin ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin)). This conservation underscores the reliability of functional annotation across species: knowledge from one organism (e.g., *A. clavatus* PatI) was transferable to *P. expansum*, aiding gene function predictions and experimental validation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)).  

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
Multiple lines of evidence have established the function and importance of *patI* in patulin biosynthesis:  

- **Biochemical Pathway Elucidation:** The patulin biosynthetic pathway was initially charted through classic biochemical studies in the 1960s–1980s, using isotope feeding and mutant analysis ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=the%20patulin%20biosynthesis%20pathway%20has,1974%3B%20Murphy%20%26%20Lynen%2C%201975)). These studies predicted the existence of enzymatic steps for hydroxylating *m*-cresol and *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (steps later assigned to PatH and PatI) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=species%2C%20especially%20Aspergillus%2C%20Penicillium%20and,The%20coding)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the)). Early genetic work in *Penicillium griseofulvum* identified mutants blocked in patulin production and accumulating intermediates, which corresponded to specific steps (e.g., a mutant accumulating gentisyl alcohol implied a block at the PatI step) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the)). This provided initial evidence that a dedicated enzyme (later confirmed as a P450) performs that ring hydroxylation.  

- **Gene Identification:** The first patulin biosynthetic gene to be cloned was *6-methylsalicylic acid synthase* (*patK*), reported in 1990 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,genes%20encoding%2C%20respectively%2C%20a%20putative)). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, additional genes were discovered: an isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (*patN*, also called IDH) was characterized in the early 1990s ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=the%206MSAS%20gene%20,alcohol%20oxidase%20described%20from%20P)), and an *m*-cresol decarboxylase (*patG*) was identified in *Aspergillus clavatus* by sequence homology in 2008–2010 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=has%20been%20identified%20in%20Aspergillus,ACLA_093620)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=study%20,PatG%29%2C%20a%20putative)). **PatI** itself was pinpointed when the genome of *A. clavatus* was sequenced: a contiguous cluster of ~15 genes included two cytochrome P450s (*patH* and *patI*) situated near the known PKS gene ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=gentisyl%20alcohol%20and%202%2C5,genes%20involved%20in%20patulin%20biosynthesis)). Puel et al. (2010) and Tannous et al. (2014) independently identified a similar 15-gene cluster in *P. expansum*, naming the genes *PePatA–PePatO* (with *PePatI* corresponding to PatI) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20a%20gene%20cluster%20responsible,previous%20work%20of%20Barad%20et%E2%80%89al)). The discovery of this cluster in the *P. expansum* genome provided a complete genetic blueprint of patulin biosynthesis and strongly implicated *patI* as the gene encoding the second P450 enzyme in the pathway ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20a%20gene%20cluster%20responsible,2015)).  

- **Heterologous Expression and Enzymatic Function:** A breakthrough in confirming *patI*’s function came from the work of Artigot et al. (2009), who cloned the *A. clavatus patI* and *patH* genes and expressed them in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Through bioconversion assays, they demonstrated the enzymatic activity of PatI: the yeast expressing PatI converted *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (and could also convert *m*-cresol into dihydroxytoluene) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid)). Likewise, PatH-expression yielded *m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol from *m*-cresol ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,are%20located%20near%20to%20two)). These functional assays provided direct evidence linking PatI to the gentisyl alcohol forming step. Additionally, they confirmed that PatI is a heme-thiolate enzyme (spectral analysis showed the characteristic P450 CO-difference spectrum), reinforcing its identification as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=during%20patulin%20production,Taken)). This study assigned PatI the EC activity of a monooxygenase and established its substrate specificity, laying the groundwork for GO molecular function annotation (e.g., **“m-hydroxybenzyl-alcohol hydroxylase activity”**, although such a specific term may not exist, the general monooxygenase activity term applies).  

- **Gene Deletion and Pathway Confirmation:** More recently, Li et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive genetic dissection of the patulin cluster in *P. expansum*. They created targeted knockout mutants for eight of the enzymatic genes in the pathway, including *patI*, and analyzed the resulting metabolite profiles ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,mechanism%20of%20patulin%20in%20fungi)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover)). The Δ*patI* mutant was unable to produce patulin, instead accumulating the precursor (*m*-hydroxybenzyl alcohol) and failing to form gentisyl alcohol or any downstream metabolites (as predicted). This genetic evidence definitively verified PatI’s role in vivo as essential for patulin biosynthesis (all 15 cluster genes were shown to be involved, with each knockout abolishing or truncating the pathway) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover)). Additionally, the study tagged several enzymes with fluorescent markers to observe their localization; PatI was observed in the ER network of the fungal cells, consistent with the localization inferred from its sequence ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the)). Such experiments provided direct evidence for GO cellular component annotations (ER membrane) and confirmed the compartmentalization of the pathway. The gene deletion approach also allowed assessment of *patI*’s contribution to virulence: fruits infected with the Δ*patI* strain developed typical rot symptoms but contained no patulin, reinforcing that the gene’s role is in toxin production rather than infection per se.  

- **Regulatory Studies:** Investigations into cluster regulation have yielded insights that indirectly support *patI*’s annotation. Tannous et al. (2014) monitored expression of *patI* and other cluster genes under various culture conditions (carbon/nitrogen sources, pH) to define the optimal patulin-inducing conditions ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic)). They found that *patI* expression correlates strongly with patulin production levels, and that certain conditions (e.g. acidic pH, presence of specific nitrogen sources) upregulate the cluster. Complementing this, a study on pH regulation by Barad et al. (2016) demonstrated the pacC-dependent induction of patulin genes in acidic environments supplemented with ammonia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic)). And as mentioned, Li et al. (2019) highlighted the role of velvet regulators ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,biosynthesis%20pathway%2C%20spatial%20control%20and)). These studies together map out a regulatory network ensuring *patI* is expressed at the right time and place, information that can justify GO annotations related to regulation (e.g., **“regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”** involving PacC or Velvet).  

- **Comparative Genomics and Evolution:** Ballester et al. (2015) compared the genomes of *P. expansum* and *P. italicum*, confirming that *P. expansum* possesses the complete patulin cluster while *P. italicum* lacks many of these genes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=important%20pathogenic%20characters%2C%20and%20secondary,italicum%20or%20P)). This explained why *P. italicum* (a citrus pathogen) does not produce patulin. Such comparative studies bolster our confidence in annotating *patI* as patulin-biosynthesis related, since its presence/absence correlates with patulin production phenotype across species. Furthermore, domain analysis of PatI and related P450s has shown that they form a distinct clade (CYP619) separate from other fungal P450s, underscoring a specific evolutionary adaptation for patulin pathway chemistry ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=,to%20the%20patulin%20gene%20cluster)).

These studies collectively provide the evidence base for GO annotations: from molecular function (demonstrated enzyme activity) to biological process (confirmed involvement in patulin biosynthesis) to cellular component (ER localization) and regulation (transcriptional control by specific factors). Each of these findings has been carefully incorporated into the annotation of PatI, ensuring a well-supported representation of this gene’s role in the cell.
