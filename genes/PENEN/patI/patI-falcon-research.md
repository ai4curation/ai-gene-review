Research the Penicillium expansum gene patI.

=== UNIPROT METADATA ===
UniProt ID: A0A075TMP8
Entry Name: PATI_PENEN
Gene Name: patI
Protein Name: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patI
EC Number: 1.-.-.-
Organism: Penicillium expansum (Blue mold rot fungus)
NCBI Taxonomy ID: 27334
Function: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of patulin, an acetate-derived tetraketide mycotoxin produced by several fungal species that shows antimicrobial properties against several bacteria (PubMed:25625822, PubMed:30100914, PubMed:30680886). PatI catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (PubMed:30680886). The pathway begins with the synthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid by the polyketide synthase (PKS) patK via condensation of acetate and malonate units. The 6- methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase patG then catalyzes the decarboxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid to yield m-cresol (also known as 3-methylphenol). These first reactions occur in the cytosol. The intermediate m-cresol is then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum where the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patH converts it to m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, which is further converted to gentisyl alcohol by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patI. The oxidoreductases patJ and patO further convert gentisyl alcohol to isoepoxydon in the vacuole. PatN catalyzes then the transformation of isoepoxydon into phyllostine. The cluster protein patF is responsible for the conversion from phyllostine to neopatulin whereas the alcohol dehydrogenase patD converts neopatulin to E-ascladiol. The steps between isoepoxydon and E-ascladiol occur in the cytosol, and E-ascladiol is probably secreted to the extracellular space by one of the cluster-specific transporters patC or patM. Finally, the secreted patulin synthase patE catalyzes the conversion of E-ascladiol to patulin (Probable) (PubMed:30680886).

Abstract—The patI gene from Penicillium expansum (UniProt ID A0A075TMP8) encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that plays an essential catalytic role within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster. This report presents a comprehensive characterization of patI with respect to its gene function, molecular mechanism, subcellular localization, involvement in biological processes, disease associations, protein domains, expression patterns, evolutionary conservation, and experimental validation. The gene is integral to the conversion of m‐hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol, a critically important step in the orchestrated sequence of reactions ultimately producing the mycotoxin patulin. The findings summarized here provide a solid foundation for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and curation, offering insights into the molecular details and regulatory framework underlying patulin biosynthesis in this economically important postharvest pathogen (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9).

I. Introduction—Penicillium expansum, widely recognized as the causal agent of blue mold rot in pome fruits, is notorious for its production of patulin, an acetate‐derived tetraketide mycotoxin with antimicrobial properties against various bacteria. Recent genomic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed that patulin biosynthesis is mediated by a tightly co‐regulated gene cluster, the historical and functional conservation of which significantly impacts secondary metabolism and pathogenicity in P. expansum (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Among the cluster genes, patI has emerged as a critical factor, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol in the endoplasmic reticulum (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This report delineates multiple facets of patI—including its molecular function, subcellular localization, regulatory dynamics, and evolutionary conservation—to inform accurate and detailed GO annotation.

II. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms—The patI gene product functions as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase central to patulin biosynthesis. In the biosynthetic pathway, patI catalyzes the final oxidative step within the endoplasmic reticulum, converting m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This reaction is pivotal because it bridges the intermediate steps initiated by upstream enzymes such as the polyketide synthase patK, which synthesizes 6-methylsalicylic acid, and the decarboxylase patG, which produces m-cresol from said acid (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). In subsequent steps, the monoxygenase patH converts m-cresol into m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, thereby positioning patI to effect the further oxidation of this intermediate (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Structurally, cytochrome P450 enzymes are characterized by a heme cofactor that is indispensable for oxygen activation and substrate oxidation, implying that patI likely possesses the conserved tertiary structure common among P450 family members, although detailed structural studies remain limited (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Together, these observations underscore the importance of patI in fine-tuning the enzymatic cascade that culminates in the production of patulin, suggesting that any disruption in its activity may lead to altered levels of toxin production (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6).

III. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components—Subcellular localization is a key determinant of protein function, and the patI-encoded cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is predicted to reside in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). The patulin biosynthetic pathway involves spatially distinct reactions, with early steps such as the synthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid and its decarboxylation occurring in the cytosol, and later hydroxylation reactions taking place in the ER (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). The localization of patI to the ER membrane is consistent with the compartmentalization observed for many cytochrome P450 enzymes in fungi, where the ER provides an optimal lipid environment for the insertion and functional performance of membrane-bound oxidoreductases (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This ER localization not only facilitates the interaction of patI with its substrate—m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol—but also potentially coordinates with other enzyme components of the patulin cluster to ensure efficient substrate channeling and intermediate transfer, a feature that has been postulated based on comparative genomics and biochemical assays (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6).

IV. Biological Processes Involvement—The patI gene is integrated into multiple biological processes, primarily those involving secondary metabolism and mycotoxin biosynthesis. Within the context of the patulin biosynthetic pathway, patI’s activity contributes directly to the oxidative transformations that shape the final structure of patulin, a compound with notable antimicrobial activities (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9, tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20). The production of patulin is intricately linked to the overall secondary metabolism in P. expansum, a process that also influences the organism’s pathogenic potential and adaptation to ecological niches (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Moreover, the enzymatic reactions mediated by patI are part of a larger metabolic network that involves coordinated action among multiple gene products in the cluster—suggesting that patI is functionally embedded in a regulated biosynthetic system where its activity may impact both the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites and the virulence of the pathogen (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 9-11). This multifaceted involvement underscores its potential annotation under GO terms such as “patulin biosynthetic process” and “secondary metabolic process.”

V. Disease Associations and Phenotypes—Although patulin itself is primarily recognized as a mycotoxin with adverse health effects in animals and humans, its role in fungal pathogenicity is complex and multifactorial. Studies indicate that while patulin production is not strictly essential for the infection process by P. expansum, variations in patulin levels—potentially driven by differential expression or activity of genes like patI—may influence the virulence observed among various apple cultivars and other host plants (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Disruption of patI, as demonstrated by gene knockout experiments, leads to significant alterations in patulin accumulation, which in turn can modify the fungus’s interaction with host defense mechanisms and alter its ability to colonize fruit tissues (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). While patulin is associated with cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and genotoxic effects in mammals, its role in disease manifestation in plant hosts is mediated through complex interactions involving multiple secondary metabolites and regulatory networks within the pathogen (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7). Consequently, patI has potential annotations relating to both toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity-associated phenotypes, warranting its inclusion in GO categories such as “response to stress” and “pathogenesis.”

VI. Protein Domains and Structural Features—As a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, patI exhibits the hallmark structural characteristics of this enzyme class. Typical P450 proteins contain a conserved core with a heme-binding domain that is indispensable for catalytic activity via oxygen activation and electron transfer (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Although direct experimental evidence regarding the three-dimensional structure of patI is currently sparse, in silico analyses suggest that it likely shares the conserved α-helical and β-sheet arrangements common to P450 monooxygenases (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Functional domains critical for substrate binding, oxygen activation, and electron transfer appear to be preserved, as indicated by the conservation of key motifs and predicted secondary structure elements (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Structural predictions further imply that variations in the amino acid sequence of the patI protein among different P. expansum strains may contribute to differences in enzyme activity or regulation, potentially explaining observed phenotypic variability in patulin production (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). These data collectively point to the importance of patI’s conserved domains in facilitating its role in the oxidative biotransformation of aromatic substrates within the patulin pathway.

VII. Expression Patterns and Regulation—Transcriptional regulation of the patulin gene cluster appears to be a critical determinant of patulin production in P. expansum. Although mutations in the coding regions of patI and other cluster genes are rare, differential gene expression has been implicated in the variations of patulin accumulation observed among distinct strains (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). In this context, patI is likely subject to complex regulatory controls that involve both cluster-specific transcription factors and broader environmental signals such as substrate availability and stress conditions (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Experimental evidence, including gene deletion and expression knockdown studies, has demonstrated that altering the regulation of cluster genes can significantly impact the efficiency of patulin biosynthesis (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7). Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses have suggested that while upstream genes such as patK and patL may exhibit strain-specific expression profiles, patI’s regulation must be tightly coordinated with these enzymes to ensure optimal conversion of intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). This coordinated expression is essential for maintaining metabolite flux and ensuring that the biosynthetic machinery operates in a synchronized manner to produce patulin effectively.

VIII. Evolutionary Conservation—Comparative genomics across Penicillium species reveals that the patulin gene cluster, including patI, has an ancestral origin that predates the diversification of species within the genus (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Although many sequenced lineages have lost the genetic capacity for patulin synthesis, P. expansum retains a complete and functionally active gene cluster, highlighting the evolutionary pressures that have maintained these biosynthetic genes in specific pathogenic strains (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). The conservation of patI across patulin-producing strains suggests that its sequence and, by extension, its function as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, are under strong purifying selection (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Moreover, evolutionary studies underscore the role of horizontal gene transfer and subsequent adaptive evolution in shaping the secondary metabolism of fungal species, with patI representing one of the critical nodes subject to alterations that may influence enzyme efficiency and substrate specificity (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 1-2, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 9-11). These analyses contribute to a broader understanding of how the conservation and divergence of biosynthetic gene clusters can impact fungal ecology, pathogenicity, and mycotoxin production.

IX. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature—The functional role of patI has been substantiated by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Gene knockout experiments targeting patI within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster have demonstrated significant alterations in toxin production, thereby confirming its essential role in catalyzing the oxidation of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Chromatographic techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been employed to validate the presence and structural integrity of patulin in various P. expansum strains, further implicating patI as a key determinant of metabolic flux through the pathway (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Comparative transcriptomic analyses have revealed differential expression patterns among cluster genes, with patI’s expression correlating with variations in patulin production levels among strains (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Although direct structural studies such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy have not yet been reported for patI, bioinformatic predictions based on related cytochrome P450 enzymes support the proposed domain architecture and functional motifs (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Collectively, these experimental approaches have reinforced the view that patI is not only a key catalytic component of the patulin biosynthetic pathway but also a potential target for interventions aimed at modulating mycotoxin production in postharvest pathogens.

X. Gene Ontology Annotation and Putative GO Terms—Based on the accumulated data, several GO terms are proposed for patI. In the domain of molecular function, “cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity” is an appropriate annotation, reflecting its role in oxygen-dependent substrate oxidation (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20). In terms of biological process, patI should be annotated under “patulin biosynthetic process” as well as “secondary metabolic process,” given its central role in producing patulin (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14). For the cellular component, “endoplasmic reticulum membrane” is the most suitable term, aligning with its predicted subcellular localization (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). These annotations will serve as a critical foundation for further research and data integration in fungal secondary metabolism databases and may assist in tracking the roles of similar enzymes in other mycotoxin biosynthetic pathways.

XI. Future Directions and Outstanding Questions—Despite significant progress in our understanding of the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster, several questions concerning patI remain. Detailed structural studies, such as crystallography or cryo-EM, are needed to elucidate the fine details of the active site architecture and the precise positioning of substrates during the oxidation reaction (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Additionally, further investigations into the regulatory networks governing patI expression—including promoter analysis and the identification of specific transcription factors—will enhance our comprehension of how environmental cues and metabolic feedback regulate mycotoxin biosynthesis (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). A comparative study of patI orthologs across different Penicillium species could provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics that have shaped the retention or loss of patulin production capability, thereby elucidating the selective pressures that drive mycotoxin biosynthesis (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Finally, integrating proteomics and metabolomics with genetic manipulation will be essential to determine how alterations in patI function impact both patulin levels and overall pathogenic behavior. Such investigations will not only refine GO annotations but also facilitate the development of novel strategies to mitigate patulin contamination in food products.

XII. Conclusion—In summary, the patI gene from Penicillium expansum encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that is indispensable for the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin patulin. Functionally, patI catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol within the endoplasmic reticulum, representing a critical enzymatic step in a complex secondary metabolic pathway (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Its subcellular localization, regulation within a gene cluster, and evolutionary conservation underscore the sophisticated mechanisms that govern secondary metabolite production in pathogenic fungi (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14). Although experimental evidence supports the central role of patI in patulin biosynthesis, further studies are warranted to elucidate its detailed structural features, regulatory controls, and contributions to pathogenicity. The insights presented herein provide a robust framework for GO annotation and set the stage for future research aimed at combating the detrimental impacts of patulin in agricultural and food safety contexts (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7).

In closing, the comprehensive characterization of patI lends crucial support to the annotation of its molecular function (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity), biological process (patulin biosynthetic process), and cellular component (endoplasmic reticulum membrane) within the GO framework (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). These annotations not only enhance our understanding of the genetic and biochemical determinants underlying patulin production but also offer valuable targets for future intervention strategies aimed at mitigating the risks associated with mycotoxin contamination.
