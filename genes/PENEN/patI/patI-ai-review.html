            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Catalysis of the reaction: 3-hydroxybenzyl alcohol + reduced [NADPH--hemoprotein reductase] + O2 = gentisyl alcohol + oxidized [NADPH--hemoprotein reductase] + H2O + H(+). This reaction is involved in patulin biosynthesis.</p>
            

            
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This specific hydroxylase activity is characterized for patI and documented in Rhea (RHEA:62212). The current general term &#34;monooxygenase activity&#34; does not capture the substrate specificity of this enzyme, which converts m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol as a key step in patulin biosynthesis.</p>

<p><strong>UniProt ID:</strong> A0A075TMP8<br />
<strong>Gene Name:</strong> <em>patI</em><br />
<strong>Protein Name:</strong> Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PatI<br />
<strong>Organism:</strong> <em>Penicillium expansum</em> (blue mold rot fungus)  </p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> PatI is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase encoded within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster of <em>P. expansum</em>. This enzyme plays a specific role in the multi-step pathway that produces patulin, a polyketide mycotoxin. As a P450, PatI catalyzes oxidative transformations of pathway intermediates, functioning as a heme-thiolate monooxygenase. Below is a comprehensive summary of PatI’s function, localization, biological roles, disease relevance, protein features, expression regulation, evolutionary conservation, and key evidence supporting its characterized roles, with an emphasis on information useful for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation.  </p>
<h2 id="gene-function-and-mechanism">Gene Function and Mechanism</h2>
<p>PatI functions as a monooxygenase that catalyzes a crucial hydroxylation step in the patulin biosynthesis pathway (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=sequence%20of%20A,belongs%20to%20the%20AminoCarboxyMuconate%20Semialdehyde">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Specifically, PatI converts <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (3-hydroxymethylphenol) into gentisyl alcohol (2,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol) by introducing an additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This reaction follows the prior step catalyzed by PatH (another P450) which hydroxylates <em>m</em>-cresol to form <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=sequence%20of%20A,belongs%20to%20the%20AminoCarboxyMuconate%20Semialdehyde">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). In vitro reconstitution of PatI’s activity (via heterologous expression in yeast) confirmed that it hydroxylates <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to yield gentisyl alcohol, a known intermediate in patulin biosynthesis (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). (Notably, PatI can also hydroxylate <em>m</em>-cresol to 2,5-dihydroxytoluene/toluquinol in experimental assays, although this product is not part of the main patulin pathway (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).) Mechanistically, PatI is a heme-thiolate enzyme that utilizes molecular oxygen and electrons (supplied via NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase) to oxidize its substrate, a classic monooxygenase reaction. This enzymatic function aligns with GO terms such as <strong>“monooxygenase activity”</strong> and <strong>“oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation of one atom of oxygen”</strong>, reflecting PatI’s role in catalyzing oxidative hydroxylation. Together with other cluster enzymes, PatI’s activity ensures the stepwise modification of the polyketide backbone into the toxic metabolite patulin (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Disruption of <em>patI</em> would interrupt this pathway at the gentisyl alcohol step, preventing completion of patulin biosynthesis (consistent with genetic studies showing each step is required) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).  </p>
<h2 id="subcellular-localization">Subcellular Localization</h2>
<p>PatI is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, typical for eukaryotic microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). The protein contains a hydrophobic N-terminal segment that serves as a transmembrane anchor, integrating PatI into the ER membrane (GO:0005789 – <strong>“endoplasmic reticulum membrane”</strong>). This subcellular placement positions PatI in the same compartment as PatH, ensuring efficient transfer of the <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol intermediate from PatH to PatI within the ER (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). In <em>P. expansum</em>, patulin biosynthesis is a compartmentalized process: early steps occur in the cytosol, the P450-mediated hydroxylations by PatH and PatI take place in the ER, subsequent oxidations (e.g. by PatJ/PatO) occur in vacuoles, and later steps happen in the cytosol or extracellular space (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Thus, PatI’s ER membrane localization is crucial for its function, allowing it to access substrates that are shuttled into the ER lumen during patulin production. Consistently, experimental localization studies of the patulin cluster enzymes showed that PatI (along with PatH) resides in the ER, and proper ER targeting of these enzymes is necessary for patulin biosynthesis (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). GO annotations reflecting this localization include <strong>“integral component of membrane”</strong> and <strong>“endoplasmic reticulum”</strong>.  </p>
<h2 id="biological-processes">Biological Processes</h2>
<p>PatI is directly involved in the <strong>patulin biosynthetic process</strong>, a secondary metabolite pathway in <em>P. expansum</em>. The patulin pathway is an acetate-derived polyketide pathway consisting of roughly 10 enzymatic steps that sequentially transform 6-methylsalicylic acid into patulin (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Within this pathway, PatI’s specific role is to produce gentisyl alcohol, which is then further oxidized and rearranged by downstream enzymes into isoepoxydon and beyond (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). All 15 genes of the <em>P. expansum</em> patulin gene cluster (named <em>patA</em> through <em>patO</em>) work in concert and are required for patulin production (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). PatI represents one of the core catalytic genes in this cluster, confirming its process involvement in patulin synthesis. In GO terms, <em>patI</em> would be annotated to <strong>“patulin biosynthetic process”</strong> (as a child of secondary metabolite biosynthesis) and perhaps more broadly to <strong>“secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”</strong> (GO:0044550). Apart from toxin biosynthesis, PatI’s product (gentisyl alcohol) is an intermediate that may have biological activity; however, its primary significance is serving as a precursor in toxin formation. Patulin itself has antimicrobial properties and may help <em>P. expansum</em> compete against other microbes in fruit substrates (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8541162/#:~:text=Traditional%20Apple%20Cultivars%20,splits%20that%20can%20occur%20from">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Nonetheless, patulin is considered a secondary metabolite not essential for the fungus’s growth or infection capability in lab conditions (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=Functional%20studies%20confirmed%20that%20PePatL,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Thus, the principal biological role of PatI is tied to secondary metabolism (toxin production) rather than primary fungal physiology.  </p>
<h2 id="disease-associations-and-phenotypes">Disease Associations and Phenotypes</h2>
<p><em>Penicillium expansum</em> is the causal agent of blue mold rot on fruits (especially apples and pears), and patulin production is a hallmark of this pathogen’s postharvest disease impact (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28362209/#:~:text=global%20food%20industry%20due%20to,reduce%20or%20prevent%20the%20contamination">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). PatI, by enabling patulin biosynthesis, contributes to the accumulation of this mycotoxin in infected fruits and derived products (like apple juice). Patulin is a potent toxin: ingestion can cause acute and chronic health effects, including immunotoxic, neurotoxic, and gastrointestinal disturbances (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20toxic%20fungal,for%20infants%20and%20young%20children">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Due to these risks, regulatory agencies impose strict limits on patulin levels in foods (e.g., ≤50 µg/kg in apple juice) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20toxic%20fungal,for%20infants%20and%20young%20children">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). In this context, PatI is indirectly associated with human health hazards, as its activity is required for the fungus to produce patulin that contaminates food. From a disease perspective, however, genetic studies indicate that patulin biosynthesis is not required for <em>P. expansum</em> to cause fruit rot (<strong>virulence</strong>). Deletion of key patulin genes (e.g., the PKS <em>patK</em> or regulator <em>patL</em>) abolishes toxin production but does not significantly reduce the fungus’s ability to infect and macerate apple tissue (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=related%20to%20secondary%20metabolism%2C%20including,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This suggests that patulin (and by extension PatI) is not a virulence factor essential for pathogenesis in the host, but rather a concurrent secondary trait. The phenotype of a <em>patI</em> loss-of-function mutant would be an inability to produce patulin, with likely accumulation of the preceding intermediate (<em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol) and no formation of downstream patulin pathway products. Such a mutant would still cause blue mold symptoms on fruit, but without toxin accumulation. This aligns with the finding that all cluster enzymes are involved in toxin synthesis – if PatI is absent, the pathway is interrupted and patulin is not produced (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). There are no known direct “disease mutations” in <em>patI</em> (as it’s a fungal gene), but its activity underlies the mycotoxicosis risk associated with <em>P. expansum</em>-contaminated food. For GO annotation, relevant terms include <strong>“pathogenesis”</strong> (to note involvement in a pathogen’s processes) or <strong>“response to host”</strong>, though <em>patI</em> specifically might not be annotated to virulence given patulin is dispensable for infection (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=Functional%20studies%20confirmed%20that%20PePatL,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Instead, its role is best captured by toxin biosynthetic process terms.  </p>
<h2 id="structural-features-and-domains">Structural Features and Domains</h2>
<p>PatI is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which are characterized by a conserved heme-binding domain and monooxygenase activity. The PatI protein is approximately 529 amino acids in length (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20genes%20were%20identified,cresol%20to">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) and is classified in the CYP619 subfamily (denoted as CYP619C2 in <em>Aspergillus clavatus</em>, an orthologous enzyme) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=,to%20the%20patulin%20gene%20cluster">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20genes%20were%20identified,dihydroxytoluene%20%28toluquinol%29%2C%20respectively.%20Except%20for">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). It contains the signature P450 cysteine motif near the C-terminus (the heme-binding <strong>Cys</strong> that ligates the heme iron) as part of the consensus sequence typical for P450s. This motif is crucial for the enzyme’s catalytic mechanism, as it forms the thiolate ligand to the heme cofactor. PatI also harbors the conserved EXXR sequence in the K-helix and other motifs that stabilize the core P450 fold and contribute to oxygen activation – these are hallmark features of P450 enzymes observed across species. Structurally, PatI is predicted to adopt the canonical P450 fold: a predominantly helical enzyme with a buried heme prosthetic group and an active-site cavity for substrate binding. An <strong>N-terminal transmembrane helix</strong> (around ~20–30 residues) anchors PatI to the ER membrane, as is common for microsomal P450s, while the bulk of the protein (including the active site) faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Apart from the P450 domain, PatI does not contain significant additional domains; it is a single-domain enzyme belonging to enzyme class EC 1.14.-.- (oxidoreductases that act on paired donors with incorporation of oxygen). The lack of extensive accessory domains is typical for P450s, which are self-contained catalytic units requiring only the heme and associated redox partners. PatI’s amino acid sequence shares moderate identity with other fungal P450s, especially those involved in secondary metabolism. The closest homologs are P450s from patulin-producing fungi, which cluster into the same CYP619 family, indicating a conserved structural framework tuned to recognize similar aromatic substrates (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). In summary, PatI’s key structural features include the heme-thiolate active site and membrane-anchor segment, which together facilitate its function as an ER-bound monooxygenase. GO annotations for <strong>“heme binding”</strong> (GO:0020037) and <strong>“iron ion binding”</strong> (GO:0005506) are applicable to PatI, reflecting its metalloprotein nature.  </p>
<h2 id="expression-patterns-and-regulation">Expression Patterns and Regulation</h2>
<p>Expression of <em>patI</em> is tightly co-regulated with the other genes in the patulin biosynthetic cluster, reflecting coordinated control of the entire pathway. Under patulin-producing conditions (such as nutrient starvation or late stationary phase in culture), <em>patI</em> mRNA levels rise in parallel with other patulin genes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20monooxygenases%20in%20the,hydroxybenzyl%20alcohol">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). In <em>Aspergillus clavatus</em>, the two P450 genes (PatI and PatH) were shown to be strongly co-expressed specifically during the period of patulin production (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=cytochrome%20P450%20monooxygenases%20in%20the,hydroxybenzyl%20alcohol">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>), and a similar pattern is observed in <em>P. expansum</em>. In liquid culture, patulin begins to accumulate after ~3 days of growth, coincident with increased transcription of cluster enzymes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=match%20at%20L304%20First%2C%20patulin,old%20culture">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Regulatory control of <em>patI</em> is exerted at multiple levels:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pathway-Specific Regulation:</strong> The patulin cluster encodes a Zn(II)₂Cys₆ transcription factor, PatL, which acts as a cluster-specific regulator (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=et%E2%80%89al,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). <em>patL</em> is expressed alongside the biosynthetic genes and is required for their activation. Mutation of <em>patL</em> abolishes expression of enzymes like PatI and consequently blocks patulin synthesis (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=related%20to%20secondary%20metabolism%2C%20including,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Thus, PatL positively regulates <em>patI</em> expression (GO:0045893 – positive regulation of transcription), ensuring the cluster is transcriptionally silent unless conditions favor metabolite production.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Regulators:</strong> <em>P. expansum</em> patulin production is influenced by global regulatory networks. One such network involves the <strong>Velvet complex</strong> – a set of fungal regulatory proteins (VeA, VelB, VelC, LaeA, etc.) that coordinate development and secondary metabolism. Recent research showed that velvet proteins VeA, VelB, and VelC are involved in regulating patulin biosynthetic genes (including <em>patI</em>), as deletion of these regulators impacts patulin levels (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,mechanism%20of%20patulin%20in%20fungi">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). These factors likely modulate <em>patI</em> indirectly by affecting <em>patL</em> or the chromatin state of the cluster (Velvet complexes are known to interact with LaeA, a global methyltransferase that governs secondary metabolite gene clusters).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Signals:</strong> The expression of <em>patI</em> and its cluster is modulated by external conditions such as pH, carbon source, and nitrogen availability (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). <em>P. expansum</em> typically produces higher patulin under acidified conditions (e.g., in decayed fruit which often has low pH). The fungus can actively modulate ambient pH; for instance, it secretes organic acids like gluconic acid to acidify the host environment. This acidic environment ties into the <strong>PacC</strong> pathway – PacC is a pH-responsive transcription factor in fungi. Studies have shown that in an acidic milieu, <em>P. expansum</em> responds to alkaline stress signals (like ammonia production) by activating PacC, which in turn leads to upregulation of patulin genes (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Specifically, adding ammonia (which transiently raises intracellular pH or mimics host tissue alkalinization) resulted in increased <em>patulin cluster</em> transcripts including <em>patI</em>, concomitant with PacC activation (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=ammonia%20of%20the%20patulin%20biosynthesis,the%20host%20environment%20by%20the">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This indicates that <em>patI</em> expression is at least partially under pH regulatory control: at low pH (acidic fruit), PacC is inactive and patulin genes are expressed at baseline; a slight pH increase via ammonia triggers PacC, which further boosts cluster gene expression in a feedback that can enhance toxin production.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nutrient and Stress Conditions:</strong> Patulin biosynthesis (hence <em>patI</em> expression) is favored under certain nutrient limitations. Research has noted that permissive conditions for patulin production include particular carbon sources (e.g., moderate sugar levels) and nitrogen sources (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Carbon catabolite repression may need to be relieved for cluster induction; similarly, nitrogen starvation or certain amino acids can influence secondary metabolite gene clusters. In <em>P. expansum</em>, the highest patulin levels and <em>patI</em> expression are often observed when glucose is depleted and nitrogen is limited, conditions that mimic fruit postharvest environments. Additionally, light and oxidative stress are known to affect velvet regulators, and thus could indirectly affect <em>patI</em> expression (Velvet complex often links to light response, with VeA being active in darkness which is when many toxins are produced).  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <em>patI</em> is transcriptionally silent during early growth and is induced during late growth or in host-mimicking conditions. Its expression is governed by both cluster-specific factors (PatL) and global regulators responding to environmental cues (pH via PacC, developmental cues via Velvet, and nutrient status) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). These layers of regulation ensure patulin (and <em>patI</em>) is produced only under favorable conditions, aligning with the fungus’s ecological strategy. GO terms pertinent here include <strong>“secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”</strong> (tying expression to that process), and regulatory GO terms like <strong>“response to pH”</strong> or <strong>“response to nutrient levels”</strong> could be considered at the pathway level.  </p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-conservation">Evolutionary Conservation</h2>
<p>The <em>patI</em> gene and its product are conserved among patulin-producing fungi, indicating a common evolutionary origin of this biosynthetic pathway. The patulin gene cluster is present in multiple species across the <em>Penicillium</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, and <em>Byssochlamys</em> genera (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=most%20often%20found%20on%20apples,producing%20species">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Comparative genomic studies have revealed that <em>P. expansum</em> possesses an intact 15-gene patulin cluster (<em>patA–patO</em>), whereas closely related species that do not produce patulin (such as <em>P. italicum</em> or <em>P. digitatum</em>) lack one or more of these genes or have nonfunctional remnants (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=important%20pathogenic%20characters%2C%20and%20secondary,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Within this cluster, <em>patI</em> shows significant sequence similarity to its orthologs in other fungi. For example, <em>Aspergillus clavatus</em> (an Aspergillus species that makes patulin) contains a PatI ortholog sharing ~60–70% identity to <em>P. expansum</em> PatI (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This A. <em>clavatus</em> gene (also called <em>patI</em>, classified as CYP619C2) has the same enzymatic role and clusters with the equivalent patulin genes in that species (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,known%20to%20be%20involved%20in">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). <em>Penicillium griseofulvum</em> (formerly <em>P. patulum</em>), another patulin producer studied historically, likewise carries a homologous P450 gene in its patulin cluster. Synteny analysis shows that the gene order and orientation in the patulin cluster are largely conserved among different fungi: for instance, the tail end of the cluster (<em>patM–patN–patO</em> in <em>P. expansum</em>) is arranged identically in <em>A. clavatus</em> and <em>P. griseofulvum</em> (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Such conservation suggests the cluster was present in a common ancestor and has been maintained due to the adaptive advantage of patulin production, or via horizontal transfer between species. PatI appears to be unique to patulin-producing lineages; non-patulin-producers do not have close analogs performing the same biochemical step, underlining that PatI evolved specifically for this secondary metabolite pathway. In terms of broader P450 evolution, PatI belongs to a clade (CYP619 family) that is found in eurotiomycete fungi and is distinct from P450s involved in primary metabolism or other toxin pathways. This specialization is mirrored by moderate-to-high identity among PatI orthologs, but lower similarity to P450s outside the patulin cluster. From a GO perspective, <strong>“patulin biosynthetic process”</strong> can be considered a conserved biological process across these fungi, and PatI’s molecular function (monooxygenase activity) is conserved, though its occurrence is restricted to species capable of patulin production. In summary, <em>patI</em> is evolutionarily conserved within the context of the patulin gene cluster across several fungi, reflecting a conserved mechanism for generating this mycotoxin (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=follows%20the%20general%20fungal%20law,expansum">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25120234/#:~:text=patB%2C%20patA%2C%20patM%2C%20patN%2C%20patO%2C,expression%20was%20studied%20under%20patulin">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This conservation underscores the reliability of functional annotation across species: knowledge from one organism (e.g., <em>A. clavatus</em> PatI) was transferable to <em>P. expansum</em>, aiding gene function predictions and experimental validation (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).  </p>
<h2 id="key-experimental-evidence-and-literature">Key Experimental Evidence and Literature</h2>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence have established the function and importance of <em>patI</em> in patulin biosynthesis:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Biochemical Pathway Elucidation:</strong> The patulin biosynthetic pathway was initially charted through classic biochemical studies in the 1960s–1980s, using isotope feeding and mutant analysis (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=the%20patulin%20biosynthesis%20pathway%20has,1974%3B%20Murphy%20%26%20Lynen%2C%201975">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). These studies predicted the existence of enzymatic steps for hydroxylating <em>m</em>-cresol and <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (steps later assigned to PatH and PatI) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=species%2C%20especially%20Aspergillus%2C%20Penicillium%20and,The%20coding">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Early genetic work in <em>Penicillium griseofulvum</em> identified mutants blocked in patulin production and accumulating intermediates, which corresponded to specific steps (e.g., a mutant accumulating gentisyl alcohol implied a block at the PatI step) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=Patulin%20is%20a%20polyketide%20metabolite%2C,at%20various%20steps%20in%20the">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This provided initial evidence that a dedicated enzyme (later confirmed as a P450) performs that ring hydroxylation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene Identification:</strong> The first patulin biosynthetic gene to be cloned was <em>6-methylsalicylic acid synthase</em> (<em>patK</em>), reported in 1990 (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=genes%20with%20unknown%20function%20,genes%20encoding%2C%20respectively%2C%20a%20putative">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, additional genes were discovered: an isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (<em>patN</em>, also called IDH) was characterized in the early 1990s (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=the%206MSAS%20gene%20,alcohol%20oxidase%20described%20from%20P">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>), and an <em>m</em>-cresol decarboxylase (<em>patG</em>) was identified in <em>Aspergillus clavatus</em> by sequence homology in 2008–2010 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24334092/#:~:text=has%20been%20identified%20in%20Aspergillus,ACLA_093620">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=study%20,PatG%29%2C%20a%20putative">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). <strong>PatI</strong> itself was pinpointed when the genome of <em>A. clavatus</em> was sequenced: a contiguous cluster of ~15 genes included two cytochrome P450s (<em>patH</em> and <em>patI</em>) situated near the known PKS gene (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=gentisyl%20alcohol%20and%202%2C5,genes%20involved%20in%20patulin%20biosynthesis">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Puel et al. (2010) and Tannous et al. (2014) independently identified a similar 15-gene cluster in <em>P. expansum</em>, naming the genes <em>PePatA–PePatO</em> (with <em>PePatI</em> corresponding to PatI) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20a%20gene%20cluster%20responsible,previous%20work%20of%20Barad%20et%E2%80%89al">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). The discovery of this cluster in the <em>P. expansum</em> genome provided a complete genetic blueprint of patulin biosynthesis and strongly implicated <em>patI</em> as the gene encoding the second P450 enzyme in the pathway (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20a%20gene%20cluster%20responsible,2015">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heterologous Expression and Enzymatic Function:</strong> A breakthrough in confirming <em>patI</em>’s function came from the work of Artigot et al. (2009), who cloned the <em>A. clavatus patI</em> and <em>patH</em> genes and expressed them in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. Through bioconversion assays, they demonstrated the enzymatic activity of PatI: the yeast expressing PatI converted <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (and could also convert <em>m</em>-cresol into dihydroxytoluene) (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,methylsalicylic%20acid">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Likewise, PatH-expression yielded <em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol from <em>m</em>-cresol (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=sequences%20were%20used%20to%20perform,are%20located%20near%20to%20two">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). These functional assays provided direct evidence linking PatI to the gentisyl alcohol forming step. Additionally, they confirmed that PatI is a heme-thiolate enzyme (spectral analysis showed the characteristic P450 CO-difference spectrum), reinforcing its identification as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=during%20patulin%20production,Taken">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This study assigned PatI the EC activity of a monooxygenase and established its substrate specificity, laying the groundwork for GO molecular function annotation (e.g., <strong>“m-hydroxybenzyl-alcohol hydroxylase activity”</strong>, although such a specific term may not exist, the general monooxygenase activity term applies).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gene Deletion and Pathway Confirmation:</strong> More recently, Li et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive genetic dissection of the patulin cluster in <em>P. expansum</em>. They created targeted knockout mutants for eight of the enzymatic genes in the pathway, including <em>patI</em>, and analyzed the resulting metabolite profiles (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,mechanism%20of%20patulin%20in%20fungi">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). The Δ<em>patI</em> mutant was unable to produce patulin, instead accumulating the precursor (<em>m</em>-hydroxybenzyl alcohol) and failing to form gentisyl alcohol or any downstream metabolites (as predicted). This genetic evidence definitively verified PatI’s role in vivo as essential for patulin biosynthesis (all 15 cluster genes were shown to be involved, with each knockout abolishing or truncating the pathway) (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=of%20patulin%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20were,Moreover">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Additionally, the study tagged several enzymes with fluorescent markers to observe their localization; PatI was observed in the ER network of the fungal cells, consistent with the localization inferred from its sequence (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=harvested%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,to%20be%20involved%20in%20the">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). Such experiments provided direct evidence for GO cellular component annotations (ER membrane) and confirmed the compartmentalization of the pathway. The gene deletion approach also allowed assessment of <em>patI</em>’s contribution to virulence: fruits infected with the Δ<em>patI</em> strain developed typical rot symptoms but contained no patulin, reinforcing that the gene’s role is in toxin production rather than infection per se.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Studies:</strong> Investigations into cluster regulation have yielded insights that indirectly support <em>patI</em>’s annotation. Tannous et al. (2014) monitored expression of <em>patI</em> and other cluster genes under various culture conditions (carbon/nitrogen sources, pH) to define the optimal patulin-inducing conditions (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=positive%20associations%20of%20the%2015,GLA%20as%20a%20possible%20opportunistic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). They found that <em>patI</em> expression correlates strongly with patulin production levels, and that certain conditions (e.g. acidic pH, presence of specific nitrogen sources) upregulate the cluster. Complementing this, a study on pH regulation by Barad et al. (2016) demonstrated the pacC-dependent induction of patulin genes in acidic environments supplemented with ammonia (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6638319/#:~:text=colonized%20apple%20tissue%3B%20,not%20further%20enhance%20its%20proteolytic">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). And as mentioned, Li et al. (2019) highlighted the role of velvet regulators (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30680886/#:~:text=subcellular%20localizations%20of%20some%20proteins%2C,biosynthesis%20pathway%2C%20spatial%20control%20and">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). These studies together map out a regulatory network ensuring <em>patI</em> is expressed at the right time and place, information that can justify GO annotations related to regulation (e.g., <strong>“regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthetic process”</strong> involving PacC or Velvet).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparative Genomics and Evolution:</strong> Ballester et al. (2015) compared the genomes of <em>P. expansum</em> and <em>P. italicum</em>, confirming that <em>P. expansum</em> possesses the complete patulin cluster while <em>P. italicum</em> lacks many of these genes (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625822/#:~:text=important%20pathogenic%20characters%2C%20and%20secondary,italicum%20or%20P">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>). This explained why <em>P. italicum</em> (a citrus pathogen) does not produce patulin. Such comparative studies bolster our confidence in annotating <em>patI</em> as patulin-biosynthesis related, since its presence/absence correlates with patulin production phenotype across species. Furthermore, domain analysis of PatI and related P450s has shown that they form a distinct clade (CYP619) separate from other fungal P450s, underscoring a specific evolutionary adaptation for patulin pathway chemistry (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889413/#:~:text=,to%20the%20patulin%20gene%20cluster">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).  </p>

These studies collectively provide the evidence base for GO annotations: from molecular function (demonstrated enzyme activity) to biological process (confirmed involvement in patulin biosynthesis) to cellular component (ER localization) and regulation (transcriptional control by specific factors). Each of these findings has been carefully incorporated into the annotation of PatI, ensuring a well-supported representation of this gene’s role in the cell.  </p>

Entry Name: PATI_PENEN<br />
Gene Name: patI<br />
Protein Name: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patI<br />
EC Number: 1.-.-.-<br />
Organism: Penicillium expansum (Blue mold rot fungus)<br />
NCBI Taxonomy ID: 27334<br />
Function: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase; part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of patulin, an acetate-derived tetraketide mycotoxin produced by several fungal species that shows antimicrobial properties against several bacteria (PubMed:25625822, PubMed:30100914, PubMed:30680886). PatI catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (PubMed:30680886). The pathway begins with the synthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid by the polyketide synthase (PKS) patK via condensation of acetate and malonate units. The 6- methylsalicylic acid decarboxylase patG then catalyzes the decarboxylation of 6-methylsalicylic acid to yield m-cresol (also known as 3-methylphenol). These first reactions occur in the cytosol. The intermediate m-cresol is then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum where the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patH converts it to m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, which is further converted to gentisyl alcohol by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase patI. The oxidoreductases patJ and patO further convert gentisyl alcohol to isoepoxydon in the vacuole. PatN catalyzes then the transformation of isoepoxydon into phyllostine. The cluster protein patF is responsible for the conversion from phyllostine to neopatulin whereas the alcohol dehydrogenase patD converts neopatulin to E-ascladiol. The steps between isoepoxydon and E-ascladiol occur in the cytosol, and E-ascladiol is probably secreted to the extracellular space by one of the cluster-specific transporters patC or patM. Finally, the secreted patulin synthase patE catalyzes the conversion of E-ascladiol to patulin (Probable) (PubMed:30680886).<br />

<p>Abstract—The patI gene from Penicillium expansum (UniProt ID A0A075TMP8) encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that plays an essential catalytic role within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster. This report presents a comprehensive characterization of patI with respect to its gene function, molecular mechanism, subcellular localization, involvement in biological processes, disease associations, protein domains, expression patterns, evolutionary conservation, and experimental validation. The gene is integral to the conversion of m‐hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol, a critically important step in the orchestrated sequence of reactions ultimately producing the mycotoxin patulin. The findings summarized here provide a solid foundation for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and curation, offering insights into the molecular details and regulatory framework underlying patulin biosynthesis in this economically important postharvest pathogen (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9).</p>
<p>I. Introduction—Penicillium expansum, widely recognized as the causal agent of blue mold rot in pome fruits, is notorious for its production of patulin, an acetate‐derived tetraketide mycotoxin with antimicrobial properties against various bacteria. Recent genomic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed that patulin biosynthesis is mediated by a tightly co‐regulated gene cluster, the historical and functional conservation of which significantly impacts secondary metabolism and pathogenicity in P. expansum (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Among the cluster genes, patI has emerged as a critical factor, encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol in the endoplasmic reticulum (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This report delineates multiple facets of patI—including its molecular function, subcellular localization, regulatory dynamics, and evolutionary conservation—to inform accurate and detailed GO annotation.</p>
<p>II. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms—The patI gene product functions as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase central to patulin biosynthesis. In the biosynthetic pathway, patI catalyzes the final oxidative step within the endoplasmic reticulum, converting m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This reaction is pivotal because it bridges the intermediate steps initiated by upstream enzymes such as the polyketide synthase patK, which synthesizes 6-methylsalicylic acid, and the decarboxylase patG, which produces m-cresol from said acid (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). In subsequent steps, the monoxygenase patH converts m-cresol into m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, thereby positioning patI to effect the further oxidation of this intermediate (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Structurally, cytochrome P450 enzymes are characterized by a heme cofactor that is indispensable for oxygen activation and substrate oxidation, implying that patI likely possesses the conserved tertiary structure common among P450 family members, although detailed structural studies remain limited (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Together, these observations underscore the importance of patI in fine-tuning the enzymatic cascade that culminates in the production of patulin, suggesting that any disruption in its activity may lead to altered levels of toxin production (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6).</p>
<p>III. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components—Subcellular localization is a key determinant of protein function, and the patI-encoded cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is predicted to reside in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). The patulin biosynthetic pathway involves spatially distinct reactions, with early steps such as the synthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid and its decarboxylation occurring in the cytosol, and later hydroxylation reactions taking place in the ER (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). The localization of patI to the ER membrane is consistent with the compartmentalization observed for many cytochrome P450 enzymes in fungi, where the ER provides an optimal lipid environment for the insertion and functional performance of membrane-bound oxidoreductases (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). This ER localization not only facilitates the interaction of patI with its substrate—m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol—but also potentially coordinates with other enzyme components of the patulin cluster to ensure efficient substrate channeling and intermediate transfer, a feature that has been postulated based on comparative genomics and biochemical assays (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6).</p>
<p>IV. Biological Processes Involvement—The patI gene is integrated into multiple biological processes, primarily those involving secondary metabolism and mycotoxin biosynthesis. Within the context of the patulin biosynthetic pathway, patI’s activity contributes directly to the oxidative transformations that shape the final structure of patulin, a compound with notable antimicrobial activities (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9, tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20). The production of patulin is intricately linked to the overall secondary metabolism in P. expansum, a process that also influences the organism’s pathogenic potential and adaptation to ecological niches (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Moreover, the enzymatic reactions mediated by patI are part of a larger metabolic network that involves coordinated action among multiple gene products in the cluster—suggesting that patI is functionally embedded in a regulated biosynthetic system where its activity may impact both the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites and the virulence of the pathogen (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 9-11). This multifaceted involvement underscores its potential annotation under GO terms such as “patulin biosynthetic process” and “secondary metabolic process.”</p>
<p>V. Disease Associations and Phenotypes—Although patulin itself is primarily recognized as a mycotoxin with adverse health effects in animals and humans, its role in fungal pathogenicity is complex and multifactorial. Studies indicate that while patulin production is not strictly essential for the infection process by P. expansum, variations in patulin levels—potentially driven by differential expression or activity of genes like patI—may influence the virulence observed among various apple cultivars and other host plants (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Disruption of patI, as demonstrated by gene knockout experiments, leads to significant alterations in patulin accumulation, which in turn can modify the fungus’s interaction with host defense mechanisms and alter its ability to colonize fruit tissues (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). While patulin is associated with cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, and genotoxic effects in mammals, its role in disease manifestation in plant hosts is mediated through complex interactions involving multiple secondary metabolites and regulatory networks within the pathogen (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7). Consequently, patI has potential annotations relating to both toxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity-associated phenotypes, warranting its inclusion in GO categories such as “response to stress” and “pathogenesis.”</p>
<p>VI. Protein Domains and Structural Features—As a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, patI exhibits the hallmark structural characteristics of this enzyme class. Typical P450 proteins contain a conserved core with a heme-binding domain that is indispensable for catalytic activity via oxygen activation and electron transfer (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Although direct experimental evidence regarding the three-dimensional structure of patI is currently sparse, in silico analyses suggest that it likely shares the conserved α-helical and β-sheet arrangements common to P450 monooxygenases (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Functional domains critical for substrate binding, oxygen activation, and electron transfer appear to be preserved, as indicated by the conservation of key motifs and predicted secondary structure elements (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Structural predictions further imply that variations in the amino acid sequence of the patI protein among different P. expansum strains may contribute to differences in enzyme activity or regulation, potentially explaining observed phenotypic variability in patulin production (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). These data collectively point to the importance of patI’s conserved domains in facilitating its role in the oxidative biotransformation of aromatic substrates within the patulin pathway.</p>
<p>VII. Expression Patterns and Regulation—Transcriptional regulation of the patulin gene cluster appears to be a critical determinant of patulin production in P. expansum. Although mutations in the coding regions of patI and other cluster genes are rare, differential gene expression has been implicated in the variations of patulin accumulation observed among distinct strains (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). In this context, patI is likely subject to complex regulatory controls that involve both cluster-specific transcription factors and broader environmental signals such as substrate availability and stress conditions (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Experimental evidence, including gene deletion and expression knockdown studies, has demonstrated that altering the regulation of cluster genes can significantly impact the efficiency of patulin biosynthesis (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7). Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses have suggested that while upstream genes such as patK and patL may exhibit strain-specific expression profiles, patI’s regulation must be tightly coordinated with these enzymes to ensure optimal conversion of intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). This coordinated expression is essential for maintaining metabolite flux and ensuring that the biosynthetic machinery operates in a synchronized manner to produce patulin effectively.</p>
<p>VIII. Evolutionary Conservation—Comparative genomics across Penicillium species reveals that the patulin gene cluster, including patI, has an ancestral origin that predates the diversification of species within the genus (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Although many sequenced lineages have lost the genetic capacity for patulin synthesis, P. expansum retains a complete and functionally active gene cluster, highlighting the evolutionary pressures that have maintained these biosynthetic genes in specific pathogenic strains (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). The conservation of patI across patulin-producing strains suggests that its sequence and, by extension, its function as a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, are under strong purifying selection (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Moreover, evolutionary studies underscore the role of horizontal gene transfer and subsequent adaptive evolution in shaping the secondary metabolism of fungal species, with patI representing one of the critical nodes subject to alterations that may influence enzyme efficiency and substrate specificity (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 1-2, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 9-11). These analyses contribute to a broader understanding of how the conservation and divergence of biosynthetic gene clusters can impact fungal ecology, pathogenicity, and mycotoxin production.</p>
<p>IX. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature—The functional role of patI has been substantiated by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Gene knockout experiments targeting patI within the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster have demonstrated significant alterations in toxin production, thereby confirming its essential role in catalyzing the oxidation of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to gentisyl alcohol (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Chromatographic techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been employed to validate the presence and structural integrity of patulin in various P. expansum strains, further implicating patI as a key determinant of metabolic flux through the pathway (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Comparative transcriptomic analyses have revealed differential expression patterns among cluster genes, with patI’s expression correlating with variations in patulin production levels among strains (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). Although direct structural studies such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy have not yet been reported for patI, bioinformatic predictions based on related cytochrome P450 enzymes support the proposed domain architecture and functional motifs (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Collectively, these experimental approaches have reinforced the view that patI is not only a key catalytic component of the patulin biosynthetic pathway but also a potential target for interventions aimed at modulating mycotoxin production in postharvest pathogens.</p>
<p>X. Gene Ontology Annotation and Putative GO Terms—Based on the accumulated data, several GO terms are proposed for patI. In the domain of molecular function, “cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity” is an appropriate annotation, reflecting its role in oxygen-dependent substrate oxidation (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20). In terms of biological process, patI should be annotated under “patulin biosynthetic process” as well as “secondary metabolic process,” given its central role in producing patulin (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14). For the cellular component, “endoplasmic reticulum membrane” is the most suitable term, aligning with its predicted subcellular localization (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). These annotations will serve as a critical foundation for further research and data integration in fungal secondary metabolism databases and may assist in tracking the roles of similar enzymes in other mycotoxin biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<p>XI. Future Directions and Outstanding Questions—Despite significant progress in our understanding of the patulin biosynthetic gene cluster, several questions concerning patI remain. Detailed structural studies, such as crystallography or cryo-EM, are needed to elucidate the fine details of the active site architecture and the precise positioning of substrates during the oxidation reaction (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 12-14). Additionally, further investigations into the regulatory networks governing patI expression—including promoter analysis and the identification of specific transcription factors—will enhance our comprehension of how environmental cues and metabolic feedback regulate mycotoxin biosynthesis (ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6). A comparative study of patI orthologs across different Penicillium species could provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics that have shaped the retention or loss of patulin production capability, thereby elucidating the selective pressures that drive mycotoxin biosynthesis (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 11-12). Finally, integrating proteomics and metabolomics with genetic manipulation will be essential to determine how alterations in patI function impact both patulin levels and overall pathogenic behavior. Such investigations will not only refine GO annotations but also facilitate the development of novel strategies to mitigate patulin contamination in food products.</p>
<p>XII. Conclusion—In summary, the patI gene from Penicillium expansum encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that is indispensable for the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin patulin. Functionally, patI catalyzes the conversion of m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol into gentisyl alcohol within the endoplasmic reticulum, representing a critical enzymatic step in a complex secondary metabolic pathway (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). Its subcellular localization, regulation within a gene cluster, and evolutionary conservation underscore the sophisticated mechanisms that govern secondary metabolite production in pathogenic fungi (luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 11-14). Although experimental evidence supports the central role of patI in patulin biosynthesis, further studies are warranted to elucidate its detailed structural features, regulatory controls, and contributions to pathogenicity. The insights presented herein provide a robust framework for GO annotation and set the stage for future research aimed at combating the detrimental impacts of patulin in agricultural and food safety contexts (yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9, ballester2015genometranscriptomeand pages 5-7).</p>
<p>Index Terms—PatI gene, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, patulin biosynthesis, secondary metabolism, Penicillium expansum, gene ontology annotation.</p>
<p>In closing, the comprehensive characterization of patI lends crucial support to the annotation of its molecular function (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity), biological process (patulin biosynthetic process), and cellular component (endoplasmic reticulum membrane) within the GO framework (tannous2018secondarymetabolismin pages 15-20, luciano‐rosario2020penicilliumexpansumbiology pages 5-6, yin2021genomicanalysesof pages 5-9). These annotations not only enhance our understanding of the genetic and biochemical determinants underlying patulin production but also offer valuable targets for future intervention strategies aimed at mitigating the risks associated with mycotoxin contamination.</p>
