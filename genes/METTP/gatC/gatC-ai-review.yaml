description: Encodes the C subunit of the heterotrimeric glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase
  complex (GatCAB). GATC is a small protein (~100 amino acids) that functions as a
  critical structural scaffold and catalytic cofactor, enabling proper assembly and
  stabilization of the GatA glutaminase domain and its binding to GatB. The GatCAB
  complex catalyzes the transamidation of misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln) to correctly charged
  Gln-tRNA(Gln), a process essential for accurate protein synthesis in organisms lacking
  glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. In M. thermautotrophicus, the GatCAB complex shows unusual
  flexibility in amide donor specificity, utilizing both asparagine and glutamine
  efficiently.

  review:
    summary: This is too general. GATC participates in ATP binding as part of the
      GatCAB complex, but this term does not capture the specificity. The more specific
      term GO:0005524 (ATP binding) is already present and should be used instead.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: GATC itself does not bind ATP - the ATP binding site is in the GatB subunit.
      GATC stabilizes GatB and maintains the structural integrity of the nucleotide
      binding pocket, but this is a supporting role, not direct ATP binding activity.
      This annotation should be removed.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This is too general and doesn't capture the specific role of GATC. GATC
      is involved in translation, but more specifically in ensuring accurate tRNA
      aminoacylation for translation. The more specific BP term GO:0070681 (glutaminyl-tRNAGln
      biosynthesis via transamidation) better captures the core function.

    label: regulation of translational fidelity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is supported by recent evidence from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      showing that GatCAB functions as a modulator of translational fidelity, with
      reduced GatCAB activity leading to increased mistranslation. The GatCAB complex
      ensures accurate incorporation of glutamine at glutamine codons, directly contributing
      to translational fidelity.

    label: ligase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is too general. The GatCAB complex catalyzes a carbon-nitrogen ligase
      reaction (formation of the amide bond in glutamine), but GATC itself is primarily
      a scaffolding subunit. The more specific term would be carbon-nitrogen ligase
      activity with glutamine as amido-N-donor, but even that may be overly specific
      for GATC's scaffolding role.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000116
  review:
    summary: This enzymatic activity belongs to the GatCAB complex as a whole, not
      to GATC specifically. The catalytic activity is performed by GatA (glutaminase)
      and GatB (kinase/transamidase). GATC is a structural scaffold that enables the
      complex to function, but does not itself have synthase activity. Suggested replacement
      terms for GATC's actual function are GO:0060090 (molecular adaptor activity)
      and GO:0005515 (protein binding).

  review:
    summary: This describes the activity of the GatCAB complex, not GATC itself. The
      catalytic activities (glutaminase in GatA, kinase/transamidase in GatB) are
      performed by other subunits. GATC is essential for enabling this activity through
      its scaffolding role, but does not itself possess synthase activity. Suggested
      replacement terms are GO:0060090 (molecular adaptor activity) and GO:0005515
      (protein binding).

  review:
    summary: This perfectly captures the core biological process in which GATC participates.
      The transamidation pathway is the only mechanism for generating Gln-tRNA(Gln)
      in M. thermautotrophicus and all archaea, as they lack glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.
      This process is essential for accurate protein synthesis. This is the core biological
      process function.

  review:
    summary: GATC functions as a molecular adaptor that brings together GatA and GatB
      subunits to form the functional heterotrimer. Structural studies show GATC is
      positioned at the interface between the larger catalytic subunits, and mutations
      disrupting these interfaces destabilize the entire complex. This is GATC's core
      molecular function.

  review:
    summary: GATC directly binds to both GatA and GatB subunits through specific interaction
      surfaces. The protein presents multiple contact points that enable it to serve
      as a bridge between the two larger catalytic subunits. This is a fundamental
      molecular function of GATC.
