### Environmental Impact

HgcA/HgcB represents one of the most environmentally significant gene pairs:
- **Mercury toxicity**: Converts relatively harmless Hg2+ to highly toxic methylmercury
- **Bioaccumulation**: Methylmercury biomagnifies through food webs
- **Global distribution**: Found in diverse anaerobic environments worldwide
- **Public health**: Major source of human mercury exposure through fish consumption

### Next Steps for HgcA
