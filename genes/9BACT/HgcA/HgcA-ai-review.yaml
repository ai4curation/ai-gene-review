  label: Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii
description: Corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase subunit of the mercury methylation
  system. Forms a functional complex with HgcB to catalyze the methylation of inorganic
  mercury (Hg2+) to methylmercury, a highly toxic and bioaccumulating organomercurial
  compound.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is too general and does not capture the specific function.
      While HgcA has transmembrane domains, the membrane localization alone does not
      represent its core methyltransferase activity.
