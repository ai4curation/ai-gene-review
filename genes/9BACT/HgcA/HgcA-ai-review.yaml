  label: Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii
description: Selenoprotein corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase that catalyzes the
  conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg2+) to methylmercury (CH3Hg+), representing one
  of the most environmentally significant enzymatic processes. Contains previously
  overlooked selenocysteine residues in CU motifs that provide exceptional mercury-binding
  capability. Forms an essential functional complex with HgcB ferredoxin to enable
  electron transfer for cofactor regeneration. This enzyme is the primary biological
  source of methylmercury in anaerobic environments and plays a central role in mercury
  biogeochemical cycling with profound implications for ecosystem and human health
  through bioaccumulation in food webs.

    label: membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct but overly general. HgcA does localize to
      membranes through its C-terminal transmembrane domain containing multiple transmembrane
      helices, which is essential for its function. However, membrane localization
      alone does not capture the protein's core mercury methyltransferase activity
      or its environmental significance.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While general, the annotation is accurate based on the protein's transmembrane
      domain structure. The UniProt entry shows multiple transmembrane helices (residues
      195-213, 225-244, 256-273, 319-337), confirming membrane localization. This
      cellular component annotation should be retained as it reflects genuine structural
      features, but should be supplemented with more specific molecular function annotations.
