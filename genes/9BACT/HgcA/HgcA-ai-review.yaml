taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:641491
  label: Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii
description: Corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase subunit of the mercury methylation
  system. Forms a functional complex with HgcB to catalyze the methylation of inorganic
  mercury (Hg2+) to methylmercury, a highly toxic and bioaccumulating organomercurial
  compound.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is too general and does not capture the specific function.
      While HgcA has transmembrane domains, the membrane localization alone does not
      represent its core methyltransferase activity.

  review:
    summary: HgcA binds mercury ions as substrate for methylation reaction
    action: NEW
    reason: HgcA must bind Hg(II) ions to catalyze their methylation to methylmercury. This metal binding activity is essential for the enzyme's function.

  review:
    summary: HgcA requires anaerobic conditions for mercury methylation
    action: NEW
    reason: Mercury methylation by HgcA only occurs in anaerobic environments; the enzyme is found exclusively in anaerobic bacteria and archaea.

  review:
    summary: HgcA contains a cobalamin (vitamin B12) binding domain essential for methyltransferase activity
    action: NEW
    reason: HgcA is a corrinoid-binding protein that requires methylated B12 cofactor for its methyltransferase function.

  review:
    summary: HgcA mediates bacterial response to mercury by converting it to methylmercury
    action: NEW
    reason: The primary function of HgcA is to respond to environmental mercury by methylating it, representing a specific mercury response mechanism.
