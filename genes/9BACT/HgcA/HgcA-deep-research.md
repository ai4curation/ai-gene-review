## **Overview of Microbial Mercury Transformations**

Microorganisms play a key role in the mercury cycle, transforming mercury between its various forms (elemental Hg(0), ionic Hg(II), and organic forms) in the environment. Two major microbial processes are known:

* Mercury Methylation: Certain anaerobic microbes enzymatically convert inorganic Hg(II) into methylmercury (CH₃Hg⁺), a toxic organomercury that bioaccumulates  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=Anaerobic%20bacteria%20and%20archaea%20possessing,Chrysiogenetes%2C%20Nitrospirae%2C%20and%20others)  
* . In some cases, methylmercury can be further converted (non-enzymatically) to dimethylmercury ((CH₃)₂Hg), a volatile and extremely toxic compound, under the right conditions (e.g. in the presence of sulfides)

* .  
* Mercury Demethylation & Reduction: Many bacteria possess the mer (mercury resistance) operon, which encodes enzymes that demethylate organomercurials and reduce ionic mercury to elemental form. In mercury-resistant strains, organomercurial lyase (MerB) cleaves the carbon–Hg bond of methylmercury, and mercuric reductase (MerA) then reduces Hg(II) to volatile Hg(0), effectively detoxifying mercury  
* [jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=Bacteria%20resistant%20to%20methylmercury%20utilize,helix%20that%20is%20not)

* . This allows bacteria to survive in mercury-contaminated environments by eliminating toxic methylmercury and expelling mercury as a less toxic gas.

## **Enzymes That Produce Methylmercury (and Dimethylmercury)**

Methylmercury production in microbes requires a recently discovered pair of genes, hgcA and hgcB, found in a subset of anaerobic bacteria and archaea

* Dimethylmercury Formation: Unlike methylmercury, there is no known dedicated enzyme that deliberately produces dimethylmercury ((CH₃)₂Hg).

## **Why Do Microbes Methylate Mercury? Possible Roles and Hypotheses**

The biological role of mercury methylation is a subject of debate. Unlike the mer-operon detox system, the evolutionary purpose of HgcA/HgcB-mediated methylation is not clearly understood. Current knowledge and hypotheses include:

* Detoxification Hypothesis – Unlikely: It might be intuitive to think microbes methylate Hg to detoxify it, but evidence does not support this. Microorganisms possessing *hgcAB* are *not* more mercury-resistant than non-methylators  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=extreme%20environments,toxicity%20than%20those%20lacking%20them6)  
* . In fact, methylmercury remains highly reactive (it readily binds to thiol groups in proteins) and is still toxic to the cell. Also, these organisms typically lack the mer operon, so they cannot further detoxify methylmercury once produced. Thus, methylation doesn’t provide the clear protective benefit that mer-mediated reduction does. Researchers generally do not consider Hg methylation a dedicated detox mechanism  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=extreme%20environments,toxicity%20than%20those%20lacking%20them6)  
* . Any removal of mercury via methylation would be indirect (e.g. if some CH₃Hg⁺ is eventually converted to volatile (CH₃)₂Hg and lost from the cell’s environment), but this is likely a side-effect rather than an evolved strategy.  
* Chemical Defense Hypothesis – Unproven: Another idea is that microbes might produce methylmercury to poison competitors or predators in their environment. Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin for higher organisms, but in microbial communities its impact as a “chemical weapon” is dubious. All surrounding microbes (including the producer itself) would be broadly susceptible to mercury’s toxicity. There is no clear evidence of a methylating microbe being *less* affected by methylmercury than its neighbors; in fact, without a detox mechanism, the producer is at equal risk  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=extreme%20environments,toxicity%20than%20those%20lacking%20them6)  
* . Moreover, methylation usually occurs in nutrient-poor anaerobic niches where chemical warfare against competitors is less relevant than simply coping with the environment. Thus, intentional poisoning of competitors via methylmercury is not supported by current data.  
* Co-metabolism (Accidental Byproduct) Hypothesis – Favored: The prevailing view is that mercury methylation is a fortuitous side reaction stemming from the microbe’s normal metabolism  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=Protein%20sequence%20analysis%20revealed%20that,TMD%29%20with%20five%20TM)  
* . HgcA belongs to a family of methyltransferases involved in core metabolic pathways (notably the Acetyl-CoA/Wood–Ljungdahl pathway)  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=Protein%20sequence%20analysis%20revealed%20that,TMD%29%20with%20five%20TM)  
* . In those pathways, a corrinoid enzyme normally transfers a methyl group to a central metabolite (e.g. to coenzyme A or to a methyl carrier in methanogenesis). If Hg(II) ions are present inside the cell, HgcA’s corrinoid cofactor can inadvertently methylate Hg(II) as an alternative acceptor, due to a relatively broad substrate specificity. In essence, HgcA/B “mistakes” mercury for its usual substrate. Studies tracing the source of the methyl group in microbial methylation support this co-metabolism model – for example, in methanogens the methyl group attached to Hg was shown to originate from the one-carbon pool of normal metabolism (such as methyl-tetrahydrofolate or related Wolfe cycle intermediates) rather than from a unique mercury-specific pathway  
* [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416519300121#:~:text=Methylmercury%27s%20chemistry%3A%20From%20the%20environment,catalyzed%20by%20the%20serine)  
* . This suggests HgcA is borrowing a methyl from routine cellular processes and accidentally delivering it to Hg. Because mercury is a rare element biologically, there may have been little evolutionary pressure to refine the enzyme’s specificity against Hg. Thus, many researchers suspect mercury methylation persists simply because it hasn’t been strongly selected against, and the low frequency of hgcAB in genomes (\~1% or less) indicates it’s not a universally essential function  
* [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=The%20hgcAB%20gene%20pair%20is,than%20those%20lacking%20them%2040)  
* .  
* Other Ecological Role – Uncertain: While co-metabolism is the leading explanation, scientists remain open to subtle benefits that are not yet understood. For instance, if a microbe lives in a mercury-rich niche (e.g. near geothermal vents or mining sediments), even an “accidental” methylation could slightly improve its survival if methylmercury diffuses away or partitions differently than Hg²⁺. It’s also possible the HgcA/B system could act on other metallic or organometallic substrates in nature (with Hg methylation being a side activity). So far, however, no alternative natural function has been confirmed – methylating Hg appears to be an odd quirk of certain anaerobes, rather than a deliberate biochemical goal.

## **Microbial Mercury Detoxification: The Mer Operon**

In contrast to the ambiguous role of methylation, mercury detoxification systems in bacteria are well characterized and clearly adaptive. The classic example is the mer operon, a cluster of genes first discovered on plasmids of bacteria isolated from mercury-contaminated sites

[jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=expensive%20and%20environmentally%20disruptive,mercury%20bond%20of)  
. Key features of this system include:

* Enzymes and Function: The mer operon typically encodes at least MerA and MerB, along with regulatory proteins (MerR, etc.) and sometimes transporters (MerT/P for Hg²⁺ uptake). MerB (organomercurial lyase) breaks the bond between mercury and carbon in organic mercury compounds, effectively demethylating methylmercury (or breaking down other organomercurials like phenylmercury)  
* [jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=Bacteria%20resistant%20to%20methylmercury%20utilize,helix%20that%20is%20not)  
* [jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=expensive%20and%20environmentally%20disruptive,mercury%20bond%20of)  
* . This reaction releases the organic moiety as a relatively harmless molecule (e.g. methane from methylmercury) and yields Hg²⁺. MerA (mercuric reductase) then reduces Hg²⁺ to elemental mercury (Hg⁰), which is a gas that can diffuse out of the cell  
* [jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=Bacteria%20resistant%20to%20methylmercury%20utilize,helix%20that%20is%20not)  
* . Together, MerA and MerB convert the extremely toxic methylmercury into a form that the cell can expel, rendering it far less dangerous. This two-step detoxification (organomercury cleavage followed by reduction) is NADPH-dependent and is highly specific for mercury compounds.  
* Regulation and Benefit: The mer operon is often under control of a metal-sensing repressor/activator (MerR). In the absence of mercury, MerR represses the operon; when Hg²⁺ is present, MerR binds Hg and undergoes a conformational change to activate transcription of the mer genes  
* [parts.igem.org](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1420004#:~:text=Part%3ABBa_K1420004%20,preventing%20any%20transcription%20from)  
* . This tight regulation ensures the detox enzymes are produced only when needed (since maintaining them has a metabolic cost). Bacteria carrying mer genes gain a significant survival advantage in mercury-rich environments – they can grow in otherwise toxic conditions by neutralizing mercury toxicity. The widespread presence of merA and merB in bacteria (even found in deep ocean microbes  
* [pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c00663#:~:text=Microorganisms%20Involved%20in%20Methylmercury%20Demethylation,%E2%88%BC4000%20m%20depth)  
* ) attests to the strong selective pressure mercury pollution has imposed, and the effectiveness of this system in hypertolerance to mercury  
* [bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-024-03391-5#:~:text=Horizontal%20gene%20transfer%20of%20the,fixing%20rhizobia)  
* .  
* Contrast with Methylation: It’s worth noting that microbes with the mer operon generally do not methylate mercury – they prefer to eliminate Hg, not transform it into methylmercury. In fact, mer-equipped bacteria could help *reduce* net methylmercury levels by scavenging and degrading organomercurials. Some environmental isolates capable of both methylation and demethylation have been identified in sediments, but typically the traits are found in different organisms or contexts. The clear detox function of MerA/MerB underscores how different it is from HgcA/HgcB methylation, which, as discussed, confers no obvious benefit to the organism itself

## **Determining Enzyme Specificity and Ecological Role**

To discern whether mercury methylation is a targeted adaptation or a “loose specificity” accident, scientists employ both in silico analyses and in vivo experiments:

* In Silico Approaches:  
  * *Protein Structure and Modeling:* Researchers have modeled the HgcA–HgcB complex using computational methods (e.g. co-evolution analysis and Rosetta modeling)  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=modeled%20the%20HgcAB%20complex%20by,and%20expand%20the%20known%20repertoire)  
  * . These models reveal an active site architecture suited for binding metal and methyl groups. Notably, HgcA has a corrinoid-binding domain and HgcB has conserved cysteine residues that likely coordinate Hg²⁺ or CH₃Hg⁺  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=that%20they%20bind%20cobalamin%20and,of%20corrinoid%20methyltransferases%20in%20nature)  
  * . By comparing HgcA’s structure to related methyltransferases, scientists can infer how specific it is for mercury. For instance, HgcA is homologous to an acetyl-CoA synthase subunit  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=Protein%20sequence%20analysis%20revealed%20that,TMD%29%20with%20five%20TM)  
  * , suggesting its *original* function was transferring methyl groups to C₁/C₂ metabolites, not mercury. If docking simulations show that the enzyme’s active site could similarly accommodate other metals (Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, etc.), it supports the idea that Hg is just one of several substrates that fit, rather than the enzyme evolving a unique pocket for Hg.  
  * *Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis:* Examining the conservation of amino acids in HgcA/B across many species can highlight what the enzyme “cares” about. For example, the presence of a cysteine–selenocysteine motif in many HgcA proteins  
  * [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_methylation#:~:text=)  
  *  hints at a strong ability to bind soft metals like Hg (selenocysteine is known to bind mercury tightly). Is this motif there *because* of mercury, or was it for another reason (selenoproteins often have redox roles)? By building phylogenetic trees, we can see if *hgcA* clusters with other methyltransferases that act on internal metabolites. If so, Hg methylation likely piggybacks on that ancestral activity. Furthermore, bioinformatic searches for hgcAB in genomes and metagenomes help identify the environmental contexts of these genes  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=The%20hgcAB%20gene%20pair%20is,than%20those%20lacking%20them%2040)  
  * . If hgcAB frequently co-occur with certain metabolic pathways (e.g. methanogenesis genes) and lack dedicated regulatory elements for mercury, it suggests they are embedded in normal metabolism.  
  * *Metabolic Modeling:* Using genome-scale metabolic models, one could simulate a bacterium’s metabolism with and without a mercury-methylating reaction. Does including HgcA’s reaction confer any predicted growth advantage (such as alleviating a buildup of methyl donors or regenerating a cofactor)? If no benefit appears in silico except in the presence of mercury, it leans towards no primary metabolic role. Such modeling might also explore if mercury methylation could serve as a sink for excess reducing equivalents or a way to dispose of a methyl group under specific conditions.  
* In Vivo Experiments:  
  * *Gene Knockout and Complementation:* Creating an hgcA or hgcB deletion mutant in a known methylating microbe (several studies have done this) definitively shows the role of these genes. As expected, knockouts lose the ability to produce methylmercury  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=Anaerobic%20bacteria%20and%20archaea%20possessing,Chrysiogenetes%2C%20Nitrospirae%2C%20and%20others)  
  * . Researchers then examine if the mutant has any other growth defects or metabolic changes in mercury-free conditions. If the mutant grows just as well as wild-type in the absence of mercury, it indicates HgcA/B are *non-essential* for core metabolism – consistent with an accidental function. (So far, Δhgc strains show no obvious handicap except inability to methylate Hg.) Conversely, if a knockout had a hidden phenotype (say, slower growth on certain substrates), that might hint at a native role for HgcA/B aside from mercury. Complementation (adding back hgc genes) restores methylation ability, confirming the specificity of the effect.  
  * *Regulation and Expression Studies:* Scientists examine when and why the hgcAB genes are expressed. If HgcA/B were part of a mercury-specific response, one might expect their expression to be induced by Hg²⁺ (similar to mer operon induction). Some studies (and a Wikipedia summary) suggest that hgcAB transcription can be *sensitive to mercury presence*  
  * [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_methylation#:~:text=through%20its%20own%20version%20of,4)  
  *  – but this area is still being explored. Overall, HgcA/B expression tends to correlate with anaerobic conditions and the growth phase rather than being a sharply regulated mercury-responsive system. Lack of a dedicated mercury regulator for hgc indicates that methylation is not a tightly controlled defense mechanism. Future RNA-seq or promoter-fusion experiments could clarify if any subtle regulatory cues tie hgcAB to environmental signals (e.g. redox state, presence of alternative substrates, etc.).  
  * *Substrate Specificity Assays:* Researchers can test the HgcA/HgcB enzyme system in vitro by purifying the proteins or expressing them in a model organism (*E. coli* has been used for overexpression  
  * [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=modeled%20the%20HgcAB%20complex%20by,and%20expand%20the%20known%20repertoire)  
  * ). By providing different potential substrates, one can measure methyl transfer activity. For instance: Does HgcA only methylate Hg²⁺, or can it methylate other heavy metals or even small molecules? If one finds measurable methylation of, say, arsenic or tin compounds, that would indicate a broader specificity. If Hg is by far the preferred or only target, that would suggest a more dedicated adaptation. However, performing such assays is technically challenging due to the need for anaerobic conditions and cofactors (corrinoid, etc.).  
  * *Mercury Uptake and Localization:* An interesting in vivo angle is to see where mercury goes in the cell. If HgcA/B simply methylate whatever Hg happens to diffuse in, the cell might not invest in any transport. But if the microbe had a purpose for Hg, it might actively uptake Hg or sequester it at certain sites. By using radiolabeled mercury or X-ray fluorescence imaging, scientists can check if methylating bacteria concentrate mercury differently than non-methylators. So far, methylators do not seem to have special mercury import systems (unlike mer-operon bacteria, which have MerP and MerT to grab Hg²⁺), reinforcing that Hg methylation is opportunistic.  
  * *Ecological Experiments:* To probe ecological role, one can compare microbial communities or strains in controlled ecosystems. For example, in sediment microcosms with mercury, do *hgcAB*\-carrying microbes outcompete others or alter the community structure? If not, it suggests no competitive advantage. Alternatively, do methylators perhaps benefit partners in a syntrophic way (e.g. by converting Hg into a form that another microbe can then volatilize via merA)? Testing co-cultures of methylators with mercury-reducers could reveal if there’s a synergistic “two-step detox” (one microbe methylates, another demethylates and volatilizes). If such synergy exists, it might indicate a group-level benefit in communities.

In summary, a combination of genetic experiments (knockouts, expression analyses) and biochemical/structural studies has largely supported the view that mercury methylation is an incidental activity rather than a dedicated physiological process. However, continuing research (enabled by genomics and new isolates of methylators) is still examining this question from all angles to fully resolve why these microbes carry such a costly trait.

## **Industrial and Environmental Implications**

Understanding microbial mercury metabolism is not only academically interesting but also important for environmental management and potential applications:

* Bioremediation: The mer operon enzymes have been harnessed for mercury clean-up efforts. Mercury-resistant bacteria (or engineered microbes/plants expressing MerA and MerB) can detoxify methylmercury in polluted soil or water by converting it to elemental mercury  
* [jbc.org](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258\(20\)71109-9/fulltext#:~:text=expensive%20and%20environmentally%20disruptive,mercury%20bond%20of)  
* . Field trials and laboratory tests show that introducing mer-operon microbes can reduce mercury levels and toxicity in contaminated sites. While releasing Hg⁰ to the atmosphere is not ideal, it disperses the pollution and prevents local bioaccumulation. Ongoing research aims to contain and capture the volatilized mercury (e.g. using filters) after bioremediation.  
* Preventing Methylmercury Formation: From an environmental protection standpoint, it’s useful to limit methylmercury production in ecosystems (since MeHg is the form that enters the food chain). By studying HgcA/HgcB and the conditions that favor microbial methylation (e.g. stagnant, low-sulfate environments with organic matter), scientists can recommend strategies to mitigate MeHg generation. For instance, managing sulfate levels in wetlands or controlling organic loading in sediments can make conditions less favorable for sulfate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria, thereby reducing methylmercury output. There is also interest in identifying natural inhibitors of the HgcA enzyme or pathways to block methylation in situ as a form of biogeochemical control.  
* Biosensors and Monitoring: The regulatory protein MerR (from the mer operon) has been used in biosensors that detect mercury. By coupling the mer promoter to a reporter gene, one can create microbial or cell-based devices that light up in the presence of bioavailable Hg²⁺. These tools help monitor mercury pollution in water. While HgcA/B themselves are not used in biosensors, the presence of hgcAB genes in environmental DNA is a molecular marker indicating a community’s potential to produce methylmercury

* . Environmental surveys now often include screening for hgcA genes to predict hotspots of methylmercury generation.

*  urges caution in industrial settings – e.g. sludge from anaerobic digesters or sewage plants containing mercury could release dimethylmercury gas under certain conditions. Industrial wastewater management must account for both methylmercury and potential volatile derivatives.

## **Conclusion**

Microbial metabolism of mercury encompasses a dual nature: on one hand, a seemingly accidental methylation pathway carried out by specialized anaerobes (producing toxic methylmercury as a byproduct of their one-carbon metabolism), and on the other hand, a clear detoxification system evolved by bacteria under mercury stress (the mer operon). The enzymes HgcA and HgcB are responsible for mercury methylation, but their biological role remains enigmatic – likely a quirk of loose specificity rather than a goal-oriented function

[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-1047-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a9cb1044-e8f9-4c14-ae97-9d9421deeccc#:~:text=extreme%20environments,toxicity%20than%20those%20lacking%20them6)

. In contrast, enzymes MerA and MerB provide obvious benefits by detoxifying mercury

. Distinguishing purposeful adaptation from chemical coincidence involves a mix of bioinformatic, biochemical, and ecological experiments, as described above. Ongoing research continues to probe these enzymes – not only to satisfy curiosity about microbial evolution, but also to inform environmental strategies and biotechnological applications in dealing with one of the world’s most notorious pollutants.

Selenoprotein-Linked Organomercurial Biosynthesis in Anaerobic Microbes

## **Mercury Methylation as a Detoxification Strategy**

Microbial methylation of mercury has long been observed and is thought to serve as a detoxification mechanism for certain bacteria. Early studies showed that some bacteria resistant to Hg(II) will enzymatically convert Hg^2+ into methylmercury (MeHg) and secrete it, presumably because inorganic Hg^2+ is more inhibitory to growth than the organomercurial product

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC187198/#:~:text=decreased%20if%20DL,and%20secreted%20into%20the%20environment)

. In other words, producing methylmercury may help the microbe neutralize or export mercury. This contrasts with the classic bacterial *mer* operon strategy (found in many mercury-resistant bacteria) where organomercurials are broken down (via MerB lyase) and Hg^2+ is reduced to volatile Hg^0 (via MerA reductase) for detoxification. In certain anaerobes, however, the formation of an organomercury compound (MeHg) is the key protective step

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC187198/#:~:text=decreased%20if%20DL,and%20secreted%20into%20the%20environment)  
.

## **Mercury’s Affinity for Sulfur and Selenium**

Mercury is highly toxic because of its strong affinity for sulfur, particularly thiol (-SH) groups in cysteine residues. Hg^2+ readily binds to cysteine in enzyme active sites, inactivating proteins by disrupting their structure and function

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=indicating%20that%20SeP%20is%20capable,30%20cysteinyl%20residues%2C%20its%20Hg)

. Notably, mercury’s affinity for selenol groups (the \-SeH in selenocysteine) is even greater than for thiols

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=toxicity%20of%20Hg%20is%20associated,30%20cysteinyl%20residues%2C%20its%20Hg)

. Selenocysteine (Sec) has a lower pK\_a and a more nucleophilic reactive center than cysteine, making it a prime target for Hg binding

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=toxicity%20of%20Hg%20is%20associated,30%20cysteinyl%20residues%2C%20its%20Hg)

. In mammals, this property underlies the protective role of selenoproteins against mercury toxicity: for example, human selenoprotein P contains multiple selenocysteines (about 10 Sec residues in its sequence) and can sequester mercury atoms, preventing them from attacking more critical proteins

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=The%20cDNA%20sequence%20of%20SeP,the%20possibilty%20and%20capability%20of)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=small%20molecules%20such%20as%20Cys,containing)

. Selenoprotein P and other Sec-containing enzymes effectively buffer mercury by binding it via their Sec residues, which helps mitigate mercury’s damage (in addition to their antioxidant functions)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=small%20molecules%20such%20as%20Cys,containing)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=in%20serum%20of%20the%20Hg,induced%20by%20Hg%20in%20vivo)  
. This extreme Hg-Se affinity is relevant to mercury-methylating bacteria as well, since many of them utilize selenocysteine in their proteins (see below).

## **The HgcAB Gene Pair and Methylmercury Biosynthesis**

A breakthrough in understanding bacterial mercury methylation came with the discovery of the hgcA and hgcB genes. This tightly linked gene pair is both necessary and sufficient for methylmercury production in known methylating microbes

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=proteins%20involved%20have%20remained%20unidentified,mercury%20methylation%20pathway%20in%20all)

. Deletion or mutation of either *hgcA* or *hgcB* abolishes a bacterium’s ability to methylate mercury

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=proteins%20involved%20have%20remained%20unidentified,mercury%20methylation%20pathway%20in%20all)

, demonstrating that *HgcA* and *HgcB* are the key players in the methylation pathway. HgcA is a corrinoid-binding protein (related to methyltransferases), and HgcB is a small ferredoxin-like protein with cysteine motifs for iron–sulfur clusters

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=desulfuricans%20ND132%20and%20Geobacter%20sulfurreducens,and%20archaea%20sequenced%20to%20date)

. This arrangement is strikingly similar to the enzymology of one-carbon metabolism: HgcA’s corrinoid cofactor can carry a methyl group, and HgcB likely regenerates the cob(I)alamin state by electron transfer (analogous to how certain reductive acetyl-CoA pathway enzymes operate)

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=desulfuricans%20ND132%20and%20Geobacter%20sulfurreducens,mercury%20methylation%20pathway%20in%20all)

. In fact, evidence indicates that the methyl group added to Hg(II) by HgcA originates from the cell’s existing C1 pool – for instance, via the acetyl-CoA “Wood–Ljungdahl” pathway or the methanogenic *Wolfe cycle* methyl carriers

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494345/#:~:text=Microbial%20methylation%20of%20inorganic%20mercury,biosynthesis%20mechanism%20of%20MeHg%2C%20thereby)

. In sulfate-reducing and acetogenic bacteria, the methyl donor is thought to be a derivative of the acetogenesis pathway (e.g. a methylated corrinoid intermediate)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494345/#:~:text=Microbial%20methylation%20of%20inorganic%20mercury,biosynthesis%20mechanism%20of%20MeHg%2C%20thereby)

, whereas in methanogens recent research suggests the methanogenesis cycle (Wolfe cycle) can directly feed methyl groups to HgcA

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494345/#:~:text=group%20is%20of%20significant%20importance,strategies%20for%20remediating%20MeHg%20contamination)

. In summary, HgcA/B appear to piggyback on central one-carbon metabolic pathways to funnel a methyl group to Hg^2+, yielding CH\_3-Hg^+ (methylmercury)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11494345/#:~:text=Microbial%20methylation%20of%20inorganic%20mercury,biosynthesis%20mechanism%20of%20MeHg%2C%20thereby)

. No other physiological role for HgcA and HgcB has been identified – they are found exclusively in organisms that methylate mercury and are absent from non-methylators

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=encode%20a%20putative%20corrinoid%20protein%2C,and%20archaea%20sequenced%20to%20date)  
 – strongly implying that methylmercury biosynthesis *is* their dedicated biological function.

## **Selenoproteins Associated with HgcAB and Mercury Methylation**

One of the most intriguing insights from recent comparative genomics is that nearly all mercury-methylating bacteria have multiple selenoproteins in their genome. These are typically strict anaerobes (e.g. certain Firmicutes and methanogenic archaea) that use selenoproteins in their core metabolism – for example, in the Stickland fermentation of amino acids, where glycine reductase and D-proline reductase complexes require selenocysteine-containing subunits. Indeed, it appears that every known *hgcAB*\-encoding bacterium also encodes the machinery for selenocysteine insertion and several other selenoproteins (such as GrdA/GrdB in glycine reduction, ProR in proline reduction, or formate dehydrogenases), tying mercury methylation to a selenium-rich metabolic context. The reason may be that selenoproteins help these organisms cope with heavy metals: as noted, Sec residues can lock down Hg ions and may shield critical processes from mercury’s disruptive binding. HgcA and HgcB themselves were recently found to be selenoproteins in many cases. A 2023 analysis discovered that a *majority* of HgcA sequences harbor a UGA-encoded selenocysteine at what was originally annotated as an N-terminal region of the protein

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=intermediates%2C%20we%20investigated%20the%20known,That)

. In other words, most HgcA proteins have a previously unrecognized N-terminal extension containing a Cys–Sec motif (CU) dipeptide

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=intermediates%2C%20we%20investigated%20the%20known,rare%20CU%20motif%20recurs%20throughout)

. (Such Cys–Sec sequences are very rare in selenoproteins generally, but they recur in heavy-metal-related enzymes

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=homologous%20to%20MerB%20organomercurial%20lyases,is%20possible%2C%20but%20SAO%20instead)

.) HgcB, though much smaller, is also a selenoprotein in a subset of mercury methylators (around 5–10% of HgcB sequences have a Sec residue)

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=intermediates%2C%20we%20investigated%20the%20known,That)

. The presence of selenocysteine in HgcA and HgcB underscores the idea that these proteins are adapted for mercury chemistry. A selenolate (Sec) at the active site could directly coordinate Hg^2+ or assist in the transfer of the methyl group to mercury, since the strong Hg–Se affinity might facilitate formation of a Hg–enzyme intermediate. This is analogous to how MerA (mercuric reductase) often uses multiple cysteine residues to bind Hg^2+ during detoxification; in HgcA, a cysteine–selenocysteine pair could serve as a unique mercury-binding motif to ensure the toxic metal is handed off efficiently to the corrinoid methyl donor. The recurring observation of Cys–Sec motifs in organomercury-related operons (not only in HgcA, but also in some MerB-like enzymes and even a mercury transport protein MerT in certain systems

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=homologous%20to%20MerB%20organomercurial%20lyases,heavy%20metal%20bond%2C%20and%20finally)

) suggests an evolutionary pattern: selenoproteins are leveraged for handling organometallic intermediates. It is likely no coincidence that mercury-methylators also invest in selenoproteins for anaerobic energy metabolism – selenium may simultaneously bolster their antioxidant capacity and provide a means to snare mercury in benign complexes (such as Sec-bound Hg in enzymes or in sink proteins)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=toxicity%20of%20Hg%20is%20associated,a%20variety%20of%20different%20protein)

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1367848/#:~:text=binding%20ability%20is%20limited%2C%20which,at%20higher%20Hg%20exposure%20concentrations)

. From a physiological standpoint, all evidence indicates that methylating mercury is beneficial to these microbes under mercury stress. By converting Hg^2+ (which readily attacks protein thiols) into methylmercury, the bacteria might reduce immediate damage: the methylated form can be either sequestered (bound to specific proteins or cell components) or eventually exported from the cell. Consistent with this, *hgcAB* expression is often found in anaerobic microbes living in sediment environments with mercury present, and no alternate metabolic role for these genes has been found

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23393089/#:~:text=encode%20a%20putative%20corrinoid%20protein%2C,and%20archaea%20sequenced%20to%20date)

. Thus, we can conclude that *HgcA/B-mediated methylation* is a genuine biological process serving the cell’s interests, not an accidental side reaction. It’s one piece of a larger strategy in which selenoproteins and metal-handling enzymes work together to detoxify mercury while allowing the microbe to thrive in anoxic, mercury-rich niches

[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC187198/#:~:text=decreased%20if%20DL,and%20secreted%20into%20the%20environment)

.

## **Organometallic Compounds Beyond Methylmercury**

Mercury is unique among most biologically relevant metals in its ability to form stable covalent bonds with carbon – in essence, to form organometallic compounds. (Another notable example is cobalt, which forms a Co–C bond in vitamin B₁₂ coenzymes, as in methylcobalamin; tin and lead can form organometallics too, though those often arise from anthropogenic chemicals like organotin pesticides or tetraethyllead.) In nature, the best-known organomercurials are methylmercury and dimethylmercury. Methylmercury can in some cases be further converted to dimethylmercury (Me\_2Hg), a volatile compound – for instance, certain anaerobic conditions promote the formation of trace dimethylmercury from MeHg

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416519300121#:~:text=Methylmercury%27s%20chemistry%3A%20From%20the%20environment,be%20formed%20from%20MeHg)

. Dimethylmercury is extremely toxic (and famously volatile), but from a bacterium’s perspective it might serve as a means to eliminate mercury by outgassing it from the local environment. The biochemistry of dimethylmercury production is still not fully resolved – the specific organisms or enzymes responsible are not yet identified – but its occurrence in nature suggests *additional microbial pathways for organomercury biosynthesis* beyond the HgcAB system. Moreover, environmental and genomic studies hint at a diversity of organomercurial compounds that microbes might produce or transform. Different *organomercurial lyase* enzymes (MerB family and similar proteins) have been found with varying substrate specificities: some cleave methylmercury, others can degrade ethylmercury, phenylmercury, or other alkyl- and aryl-mercury compounds

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=substrate,heavy%20metal%20bond%2C%20and%20finally)

. This implies that those organomercurials must exist in the environment (at least transiently), possibly as products of microbial metabolism or abiotic methylation in the presence of organic matter. In fact, the discovery of the *selenocysteine-assisted organometallic* (SAO) operon in *Clostridium difficile* and relatives – an 8–9 gene cluster with six selenoproteins – supports the idea of a broader organometallic biochemistry in anaerobes

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=cryptic%20aspects%20of%20microbial%20biochemistry,metals%20as%20cofactors%20in%20organometallic)

. The SAO system appears to handle some heavy-metal-containing organic substrate: it encodes a MerB-like selenoprotein (likely cleaving a carbon–metal bond), an ABC transporter to import or export organometal species, and an efflux pump for metals

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=homologous%20to%20MerB%20organomercurial%20lyases,is%20possible%2C%20but%20SAO%20instead)

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=resistance%20transporter%20subunit%20MerT,occur%20with%20Stickland)

. Organisms with SAO loci also carry *hgcAB* in many cases, and both systems show the signature Cys–Sec motifs, suggesting they are part of a continuum of microbial organometallic transformations

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=suggests%20substrate%20interaction%20with%20surface,the%20known%20methylmercury%20formation%20protein)

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=describes%20the%20SAO%20%28selenocysteine,metals%20as%20cofactors%20in%20organometallic)

. In essence, these bacteria may deliberately form organometallic intermediates (like methyl-Hg, or other alkyl-metal compounds) as part of a metabolic process – perhaps to access otherwise recalcitrant substrates or to rid themselves of toxic metals

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598231/#:~:text=suggests%20substrate%20interaction%20with%20surface,the%20known%20methylmercury%20formation%20protein)

. This emerging “world” of microbial organometallic chemistry is still being unraveled, but methylmercury biosynthesis by HgcA/HgcB is a prime example of its ecological and physiological significance.

## **Implications for Classification and Ontology**

Given the evidence above, it is clear that mercury methylation is a bona fide microbial metabolic process – one that likely evolved for the organism’s benefit. This has implications for how we classify and annotate such processes. In the Gene Ontology (GO), methylmercury production can be categorized under *metabolic and biosynthetic processes* (in fact, GO:0042192 is defined as “methylmercury biosynthetic process”). However, GO historically had a broader term “organometal metabolic process” (GO:0018942) which was recently obsoleted on the grounds that it was an unnecessary grouping class

[ebi.ac.uk](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0018942#:~:text=This%20term%20is%20obsolete,obsolete%20organometal%20metabolic%20process)

. The only direct child terms under it were specific cases like methylmercury metabolism and organotin metabolism, mostly viewed as detoxification of xenobiotics. Now, with a deeper appreciation that organisms actively carry out organomercury biosynthesis (not just breakdown) as part of their normal metabolism, one could argue that such processes deserve recognition as legitimate metabolic pathways. The methylation of mercury is most definitely a biosynthetic process – the cell spends energy and reducing equivalents to form a new organometallic compound. Whether or not curators consider it “beneficial” to the microbe, it fits the definition of a metabolic pathway that transforms a substrate (Hg^2+) into a distinct product (MeHg) with the help of enzymes. Indeed, recent literature refers to this as the mercury biogeochemical cycle and the enzymatic methylation as a crucial step in mercury’s environmental transformation

. In practical terms, microbes encoding *hgcAB* are carrying out a specialized organomercury biosynthesis. This process is akin to a detoxification mechanism, but it is also part of their anaerobic lifestyle and biochemical repertoire. The involvement of selenoproteins and unique motifs highlights how evolved and specific this capability is, rather than a fortuitous side reaction. We can infer, by analogy, that there may be other “cryptic” organometallic processes in nature (for example, formation of dimethylmercury or methylated tin/arsenic compounds) that serve biological roles for microbes in certain niches. Each of these would similarly qualify as a metabolic process in GO if evidence supports it. In summary, the role of HgcA and HgcB is to enzymatically produce methylmercury – a reaction that detoxifies mercury for the host bacterium and alters mercury’s mobility in the environment. This does change the perspective from seeing methylmercury only as an environmental toxin to recognizing it as a *microbially synthesized metabolite*. The HgcAB system and related pathways form a network of biochemical reactions that forge and break metal–carbon bonds, expanding our understanding of metabolism. Far from being accidental, these processes are finely tuned adaptations. Therefore, methylmercury biosynthesis (and analogous organometallic biochemistry) should be acknowledged as part of the organism’s metabolic capacity in both scientific discourse and ontology classifications – reflecting its physiological purpose in microbial survival and metal cycling
