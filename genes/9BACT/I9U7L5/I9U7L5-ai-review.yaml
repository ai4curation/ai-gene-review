  id: NCBITaxon:997891
  label: Phocaeicola vulgatus CL09T03C04
description: "HMPREF1058_RS08555 is a large membrane-associated regulatory protein containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) LuxR-type DNA-binding domain. This 798-amino acid protein functions as a transcriptional regulator controlling genes involved in phosphosugar metabolism and growth responses. The protein contains a signal peptide, multiple transmembrane domains, and structural similarities to quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase-like proteins, suggesting it may have dual regulatory and enzymatic functions. This protein represents an important regulatory component in Bacteroidetes metabolism, particularly for adapting to different carbon sources in the gut environment."
