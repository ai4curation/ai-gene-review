    label: iron ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate as HgcB is a ferredoxin that binds iron ions
      as part of its two [4Fe-4S] clusters. While somewhat general, iron ion binding
      is a core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HgcB contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters that require iron ion binding for
      structural integrity and electron transfer function. Confirmed by spectroscopic
      analysis and domain annotations.

    label: electron transfer activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation accurately captures HgcB's core molecular function as
      a ferredoxin involved in electron transfer, which is essential for its role
      as electron donor in mercury methylation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HgcB functions as an electron donor for corrinoid cofactor reduction in
      the HgcAB mercury methylation complex. This is its primary molecular function.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate as HgcB binds iron in iron-sulfur clusters
      and potentially mercury during the methylation process, but is very general
      compared to more specific annotations.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While accurate, this term is too general when more specific iron-sulfur
      cluster binding terms are available. The mercury binding aspect is hypothetical
      based on conserved cysteines.

    full_text_unavailable: true
  - statement: HgcB contains a strictly conserved cysteine residue critical for mercury
      methylation activity
    supporting_text: HgcB includes another strictly conserved Cys (Cys73 in D. desulfuricans
      ND132), located ~12 residues downstream of the second [4Fe-4S]-binding motif,
      and up to four additional Cys residues at its C-terminus. Mutation of Cys73
      to Ala completely abolished Hg methylation in vivo.
    full_text_unavailable: true
  - statement: HgcB requires at least one C-terminal cysteine residue for maximal
      mercury methylation activity
    supporting_text: Mutation of either C-terminal cysteine (Cys94 or Cys95) individually
      to Ala did not affect Hg methylation activity, but mutation of both residues
      simultaneously to Ala led to a 95% reduction in activity compared to the wild-type.
      Thus, at least one Cys is required at the C-terminus for maximal Hg methylation
      activity.
