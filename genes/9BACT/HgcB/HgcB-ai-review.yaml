    label: iron ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate as HgcB is a ferredoxin that binds iron ions
      as part of its two [4Fe-4S] clusters. While somewhat general, iron ion binding
      is a core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HgcB contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters that require iron ion binding for
      structural integrity and electron transfer function. Confirmed by spectroscopic
      analysis and domain annotations.

  review:
    summary: This annotation accurately captures HgcB's core molecular function as
      a ferredoxin involved in electron transfer, which is essential for its role
      as electron donor in mercury methylation.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate as HgcB binds iron in iron-sulfur clusters
      and potentially mercury during the methylation process, but is very general
      compared to more specific annotations.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While accurate, this term is too general when more specific iron-sulfur
      cluster binding terms are available. The mercury binding aspect is hypothetical
      based on conserved cysteines.
