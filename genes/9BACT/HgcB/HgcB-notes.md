   - **Historic significance**: Discovery paper identifying HgcA/HgcB genes
   - Key findings: gene essentiality, ferredoxin function, electron donor role
   - 3 specific findings extracted with supporting text

2. **PMID:32561885** - "Structure determination of the HgcAB complex using metagenome sequence data" (Smith et al., 2020, Communications Biology)
   - **Structural breakthrough**: First structural model of HgcAB complex
   - Key findings: dicluster ferredoxin structure, cysteine residues, complex formation
   - 8 specific findings extracted with supporting text

#### Impact
- **Literature references**: 0 → 2 PMIDs (discovery + structure)
- **Total references**: 3 → 5
- **Total findings**: 0 → 11 findings with experimental evidence
- **Quality**: Now includes seminal discovery and mechanistic studies

### Research Strategy Used

1. **Partner gene approach**: Used same publications as HgcA since they function as a complex
2. **Ferredoxin focus**: Emphasized iron-sulfur cluster binding and electron transfer
3. **Structural insights**: Highlighted cysteine residues and complex formation
4. **Mechanistic detail**: Described redox requirements and mercury handling
5. **Environmental context**: Connected to anaerobic mercury cycling

### Key Scientific Insights Added

- **Essential partner**: Gene deletion abolishes mercury methylation completely
- **2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin**: Contains two iron-sulfur cluster binding motifs
- **Electron donor function**: Provides electrons for corrinoid cofactor reduction
- **Structural bridging**: Forms extensive contacts with both domains of HgcA
- **Critical cysteine residues**: Conserved cysteines essential for function
- **Redox sensitivity**: Requires low redox conditions for proper function
- **Mercury shuttling**: Likely involved in Hg(II)/methylmercury handling

### Environmental Impact

HgcB is the essential ferredoxin partner in mercury methylation:
- **Electron transfer**: Provides electrons needed for corrinoid activation
- **Complex formation**: Bridges HgcA domains in functional complex
- **Redox regulation**: Activity controlled by environmental redox conditions
- **Global distribution**: Found alongside HgcA in anaerobic environments
- **Public health**: Critical component in methylmercury production pathway

### Next Steps for HgcB
- Consider adding mutagenesis studies of conserved cysteines
- Look for ferredoxin-specific mercury interaction studies
- Check for redox potential measurements
- Review environmental distribution patterns

### Lessons Learned
- Partner gene approach works well for functionally coupled genes
- Ferredoxin function well-characterized in literature
- Structural studies provide key mechanistic insights
- Mercury methylation complex requires both subunits for activity

### Quality Metrics
- PMID:23393089 is highly cited discovery paper in Science (>500 citations)
- PMID:32561885 provides first structural model of the complex
- Comprehensive ferredoxin function coverage achieved
- Strong environmental and biochemical relevance established
