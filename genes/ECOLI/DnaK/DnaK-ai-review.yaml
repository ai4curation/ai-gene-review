description: 'DnaK is the E. coli HSP70 homolog and the canonical bacterial chaperone.
  It is an ATP-dependent foldase that works in concert with its J-domain co-chaperone
  DnaJ (Hsp40) and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE to assist de novo protein folding
  and repair heat-damaged proteins. DnaK undergoes ATP-driven conformational cycles:
  ATP-bound DnaK has an open substrate-binding domain with fast on/off rates; ATP
  hydrolysis (stimulated by DnaJ and substrate) closes the lid and stabilizes substrate
  binding; GrpE-catalyzed ADP release and ATP rebinding triggers substrate release
  for folding. Multiple rounds of this cycle are required for efficient folding of
  many substrates (PMID:7937953). DnaK also functions as a holdase under some conditions,
  protecting proteins from aggregation in an ATP-independent manner (PMID:2203539).
  It cooperates with trigger factor in chaperoning nascent polypeptides (PMID:10380927),
  and collaborates with ClpB (Hsp100) in disaggregation of protein aggregates. DnaK
  also plays a regulatory role by binding and inactivating the heat shock transcription
  factor sigma32 (RpoH) through chaperone-mediated feedback (PMID:8599944). Additionally,
  DnaK is essential for phage lambda DNA replication and participates in chromosomal
  DNA replication via interaction with DnaA.'

    summary: DnaK has intrinsic ATPase activity that is central to its chaperone cycle.
      The ATP hydrolysis rate is stimulated by substrates and DnaJ (PMID:7776367).
      IBA annotation is well-supported phylogenetically across the HSP70 family and
      experimentally validated for DnaK.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core enzymatic activity of DnaK. ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational

  review:
    summary: DnaK directly binds its co-chaperones DnaJ (Hsp40) and GrpE, as well
      as HtpG (Hsp90) and ClpB (Hsp100). The IBA annotation reflects conserved interactions
      across the HSP70 family. Multiple experimental studies confirm these interactions

    summary: This IEA annotation is inferred from GO:0016989 (sigma factor antagonist
      activity) via logical inference. DnaK binds and inactivates sigma32, which represses
      heat shock gene transcription (PMID:8599944). The inference is sound since antagonizing
      sigma32 leads to negative regulation of sigma32-dependent transcription.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Logically sound inference from the experimentally validated sigma factor
      antagonist activity (GO:0016989). DnaK-mediated sequestration of sigma32 represses

      This is a broader parent of the more specific ATP binding annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct but very general. Subsumed by more specific ATP binding (GO:0005524)

      as a peripheral inner membrane protein (PMID:16079137). DnaK has also been found
      associated with membrane fractions (PMID:16858726 HDA). This is a secondary
      localization.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: DnaK is primarily cytosolic but has been detected at the cell inner membrane
      as a peripheral protein. This is not a core localization but is supported by
      UniProt annotations citing PMID:16079137.

    label: DNA replication
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping (KW-0235 DNA replication).
      UniProt describes DnaK as essential for phage lambda DNA replication and involved
      in chromosomal DNA replication through interaction with DnaA. This reflects
      a genuine but non-core function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: DnaK's role in DNA replication is well-documented for phage lambda (releasing
      lambda O and P from the preprimosomal complex) and proposed for chromosomal
      replication via DnaA interaction. However, this is not DnaK's primary evolved
      function -- it reflects chaperone activity applied to replication machinery,
      not a direct replication function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from InterPro (IPR012725). GO:0051082 is proposed for
      obsoletion (go-ontology#30962). DnaK does bind unfolded proteins, but this binding
      is in the context of its foldase activity, not as a passive binder. The function
      is better captured by GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) or GO:0140662 (ATP-dependent
      protein folding chaperone), both of which DnaK already has.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. DnaK's binding of unfolded proteins
      is mechanistically part of its ATP-dependent foldase cycle, not passive binding.
      The correct MF is GO:0044183 or its child GO:0140662. DnaK can also function
      as a holdase in some contexts (PMID:2203539, ATP-independent protection from
      aggregation), but the holdase NTR has not yet been created.

    label: ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
  description: DnaK is the E. coli HSP70 homolog that functions as an ATP-dependent
    protein folding chaperone (foldase). It binds unfolded polypeptide segments, undergoes
    ATP hydrolysis- driven conformational changes (with DnaJ and GrpE co-chaperones),
    and releases substrates to allow folding. Multiple rounds of binding and release
    are required for efficient folding of most substrates (PMID:7937953). DnaK also
    protects proteins from heat inactivation (holdase function, ATP-independent; PMID:2203539)
    and cooperates with trigger factor to chaperone nascent polypeptides (PMID:10380927).

    relate to its foldase activity? Should both be annotated once the holdase NTR
    is created?

    is it solely a co-factor for ClpB-mediated disaggregation?
- question: Is the zinc-binding detected by Katayama et al. (PMID:11985624) biologically
    relevant or adventitious?
