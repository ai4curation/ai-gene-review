description: HdeA is a small (89-residue mature form) periplasmic acid-stress chaperone
  in E. coli that protects periplasmic proteins from aggregation during transit through
  the mammalian stomach (pH 1-3). At neutral pH, HdeA exists as a well-folded, inactive
  homodimer stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond (Cys39-Cys87). Upon exposure
  to extremely acidic pH (below 3), the dimer dissociates and each monomer undergoes
  an order-to-disorder transition, exposing hydrophobic surfaces that bind acid-denatured
  substrate proteins non-specifically (PMID:15911614, PMID:30573682). HdeA functions
  as an ATP-independent holdase in the ATP-devoid periplasm, preventing irreversible
  aggregation of denatured proteins. Upon return to neutral pH, HdeA slowly releases
  substrates, keeping the concentration of aggregation-sensitive folding intermediates
  below the aggregation threshold, thereby facilitating their refolding (PMID:20080625).
  HdeA cooperates with its paralog HdeB and other periplasmic chaperones (DegP, SurA)
  during acid stress recovery (PMID:17085547, PMID:21892184). HdeA is essential for
  acid resistance in pathogenic enteric bacteria (PMID:10623550).

      HdeA forms a homodimer at neutral pH that dissociates into active monomers at
      acidic pH (PMID:10623550, PMID:20080625). The homodimerization is functionally
      important as the dimer-to-monomer transition is the activation mechanism. However,

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for involvement in protein folding from EcoCyc, based
      on the demonstration that HdeA suppresses aggregation of acid-denatured proteins
      (PMID:10623550). However, HdeA is primarily a holdase that prevents aggregation
      rather than actively assisting protein folding. PMID:20080625 later showed that
      HdeA does facilitate refolding of acid-denatured proteins upon pH neutralization
      via slow substrate release, but this is a passive mechanism distinct from active
      foldase activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: HdeA does not actively catalyze protein folding in the conventional sense
      (it is ATP- independent and lacks foldase activity). Its primary function is
      preventing aggregation of acid-denatured proteins (holdase activity). While
      PMID:20080625 showed it facilitates refolding upon pH neutralization, this is
      achieved through passive slow release of substrates rather than active folding
      assistance. The BP term "protein folding" overstates HdeA's role. A more appropriate
      term would capture the chaperone-mediated protein refolding or protein stabilization
      aspect. However, given that refolding does occur as a consequence of HdeA activity
      (PMID:20080625), the annotation is not entirely wrong -- it is the process outcome
      rather than the mechanism.

      GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" is defined as "binding to a protein or
      a protein-containing complex to assist the protein folding process." While HdeA
      does assist in the overall folding process (preventing aggregation and facilitating
      refolding upon pH return), it is mechanistically a holdase rather than a foldase.
      However, GO:0044183 is the best available MF term for chaperone function pending
      creation of a holdase-specific term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GO:0044183 is the best available MF term for HdeA's chaperone activity.
      HdeA binds denatured proteins and assists in the folding process by preventing
      aggregation and facilitating refolding upon pH neutralization. Although HdeA
      is mechanistically a holdase (ATP-independent, prevents aggregation in situ),
      the definition of GO:0044183 ("binding to a protein...to assist the protein
      folding process") is broad enough to encompass holdase activity. This annotation
      should be retained as the primary MF annotation pending creation of a holdase-specific

      surfaces for binding denatured substrates. Chaperone activity exclusively within
      stomach pH range.
    supporting_text: 'HdeA employs a novel strategy to modulate its chaperone activity:
      it possesses an ordered conformation that is unable to bind denatured substrate
      proteins under normal physiological conditions (i.e. at neutral pH) and transforms
      into a globally disordered conformation that is able to bind substrate proteins
      under stress conditions (i.e. at a pH below 3)'

  title: Escherichia coli HdeB is an acid stress chaperone.
  findings:
  - statement: Demonstrated HdeA and HdeB both required for optimal acid stress protection.
      HdeA more efficient at pH 2, HdeB at pH 3. Confirmed periplasmic localization.
    supporting_text: both proteins are required for optimal protection of the bacterial
      periplasm against acid stress...At pH 2, the aggregation of periplasmic extracts
      is prevented by the addition of HdeA...At pH 3, however, HdeB is more efficient
      than HdeA in preventing periplasmic-protein aggregation

  title: Solubilization of protein aggregates by the acid stress chaperones HdeA and
    HdeB.
  findings:
  - statement: HdeA promotes solubilization of protein aggregates at neutral pH after
      acid treatment.
    supporting_text: HdeA and HdeB not only help to maintain proteins in a soluble
      state during acid treatment, as previously reported, but also assist, both in
      vitro and in vivo, in the solubilization at neutral pH of mixed protein-chaperone
      aggregates formed at acidic pH

  title: Protein refolding by pH-triggered chaperone binding and release.
  findings:
  - statement: 'Demonstrated HdeA facilitates refolding of acid-denatured proteins
      via pH-triggered binding and release cycle. ATP-independent mechanism: stable
      binding at low pH prevents aggregation, slow release upon pH neutralization
      keeps folding intermediates below aggregation threshold.'
    supporting_text: HdeA stably binds substrates at low pH, thereby preventing their
      irreversible aggregation. pH neutralization subsequently triggers the slow release
      of substrate proteins from HdeA, keeping the concentration of aggregation-sensitive
      intermediates below the threshold where they begin to aggregate. This provides
      a straightforward and ATP-independent mechanism that allows HdeA to facilitate
      protein refolding

  title: A genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals chaperone cooperation in acid
    resistance.
  findings:
  - statement: Demonstrated cooperation between HdeA and other periplasmic chaperones
      (DegP, SurA) during acid stress recovery using in vivo crosslinking.
    supporting_text: the periplasmic chaperones DegP and SurA were initially found
      to be protected by HdeA at a low pH, but they subsequently facilitated the HdeA-mediated
      acid recovery of other client proteins. This unique, ATP-independent chaperone
      cooperation in the ATP-deprived E. coli periplasm may support the acid resistance
      of enteric bacteria

  title: Structural basis and mechanism of the unfolding-induced activation of HdeA,
    a bacterial acid response chaperone.
  findings:
  - statement: NMR characterization of activated HdeA. Identified two hydrophobic
      patches essential for client interactions and three acid-sensitive structural
      locks regulating activation. Revealed multistep activation mechanism.
    supporting_text: the structure of activated HdeA becomes largely disordered and
      exposes two hydrophobic patches essential for client interactions...we identified
      three acid-sensitive regions that act as structural locks in regulating the
      exposure of the two client-binding sites during the activation process, revealing
      a multistep activation mechanism
