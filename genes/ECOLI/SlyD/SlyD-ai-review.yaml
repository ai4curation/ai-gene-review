description: SlyD (Sensitive to lysis D) is a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein
  in E. coli that combines three distinct activities in a modular domain architecture.
  The N-terminal FKBP domain harbors peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
  activity (EC 5.2.1.8), catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds in
  peptide substrates with high efficiency (kcat/Km approximately 10^6 M-1 s-1 for
  protein substrates; PMID:16388577). An insert-in-flap (IF) domain inserted within
  a loop of the FKBP domain provides a spatially separate chaperone holdase function
  that binds unfolded or partially folded proteins and prevents aggregation (PMID:19356587).
  The C-terminal tail is extremely rich in histidine, cysteine, and acidic residues
  and binds up to 7 nickel ions as well as zinc, copper, and cobalt (PMID:19947632,
  PMID:22047179). SlyD functions as a nickel metallochaperone in the [NiFe]-hydrogenase
  metallocenter assembly pathway, interacting with HypB to stimulate nickel release
  and deliver it for insertion into the hydrogenase large subunit HycE (PMID:15569666,
  PMID:17426034). The hydrogenase maturation function requires the chaperone domain
  and the metal-binding tail but NOT the PPIase activity (PMID:17720786). SlyD PPIase
  activity is reversibly inhibited by nickel binding to the C-terminal region (PMID:9188461,
  PMID:19645725). SlyD is also required for stabilization of the phiX174 lysis protein
  E, enabling phage-mediated lysis (PMID:12100551). SlyD is upregulated under heat
  stress (PMID:17971396).

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for PPIase activity. SlyD is an FKBP-type PPIase with
      demonstrated catalytic activity for the cis-trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds
      (PMID:9188461, PMID:16388577). The PPIase activity is carried in the N-terminal
      FKBP domain and is conserved across SlyD orthologs.

      NMR titration experiments revealed that the IF domain recognizes and binds unfolded

    summary: IMP annotation for PPIase activity from Zhang et al. (2007). Mutations
      that decrease PPIase activity (I42S, F132Y) do not produce corresponding decreases
      in hydrogenase production, demonstrating that PPIase activity is separable from

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IMP evidence supports the existence of PPIase activity in SlyD, even
      though the study's main finding is that PPIase is NOT required for hydrogenase
      maturation. The mutant phenotype evidence confirms PPIase is a real enzymatic
      activity of SlyD.

  review:
    summary: IMP annotation for protein stabilization from Han et al. (2007). SlyD

      of aggregation-prone heterologous proteins. SlyD sequesters interactive surfaces

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The protein stabilization function is demonstrated in the context of a
      biotechnological fusion partner system, which reflects SlyD's chaperone properties.
      This is a real activity but the in vivo significance as a standalone "protein

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE

    summary: NEW annotation for nickel chaperone activity. SlyD functions as a nickel
      metallochaperone that participates in the nickel insertion step of [NiFe]-hydrogenase
      metallocenter assembly. Deletion of slyD results in reduced hydrogenase activity,
      which is rescued by excess nickel but not zinc (PMID:15569666). SlyD interacts
      with HypB and stimulates nickel release from HypB's high-affinity Ni(II)-binding
      site (PMID:17426034). SlyD also directly interacts with HycE, the hydrogenase
      3 large subunit (PMID:21185288).
    action: NEW
    reason: Nickel metallochaperone activity is one of SlyD's most well-characterized
      and biologically important functions. GO:0170061 "nickel chaperone activity"
      (defined as "Directly binding to and delivering nickel ions to a target protein")
      precisely describes SlyD's role in delivering nickel to [NiFe]-hydrogenase.

      PMID:21185288, PMID:22047179) and requires the chaperone domain and C-terminal
