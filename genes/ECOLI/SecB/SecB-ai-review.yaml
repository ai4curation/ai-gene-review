description: 'SecB is a dedicated export chaperone in E. coli that functions as a
  cytosolic homotetramer (dimer of dimers) in the general secretory (Sec) pathway.
  It binds newly synthesized precursor proteins in an unfolded or molten-globule state,
  preventing their premature folding and aggregation, and delivers them to the membrane-associated
  ATPase SecA for translocation across the inner membrane via the SecYEG translocon
  (PMID:2170023). SecB functions as an ATP-independent holdase/carrier: it captures
  unfolded preproteins, wraps them around its tetrameric surface (PMID:16962134),
  maintains them in a translocation-competent state (PMID:2848249), and then transfers
  them to SecA through specific binding at the SecA C-terminus (PMID:9321390). Its
  substrates include a defined subset of exported proteins such as MalE (MBP), OmpA,
  OmpF, LamB, PhoA, and others (PMID:16352602). SecB was first identified through
  mutations causing defective protein localization (PMID:6403503). The crystal structure
  shows a beta-sheet-rich tetramer with helical elements (PDB:1QYN), and NMR studies
  reveal that substrates wrap around the tetramer, making contact with a large portion
  of the chaperone surface (PMID:16962134, PMID:27501151).'

  review:
    summary: SecB maintains precursor proteins in an unfolded, translocation-competent
      state. This antifolding/holdase activity is the core biological process of SecB,
      demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro experiments (PMID:2834066, PMID:2848249,
      PMID:18048690).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of SecB. Collier et al. showed that SecB prevents
      premature folding of MBP precursor (PMID:2834066). Weiss et al. demonstrated
      that purified SecB "quantitatively retarded folding of precursor MBP into a
      stable, protease-resistant conformation" (PMID:2848249). Bechtluft et al. showed
      by single-molecule optical tweezers that SecB "completely prevent stable tertiary
      contacts" and "retains MBP in this [molten-globule] state" (PMID:18048690).
      The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence.

      supporting_text: Interactions with SecB completely prevent stable tertiary contacts

  review:
    summary: SecB is a dedicated component of the Sec-dependent protein export pathway.
      It delivers unfolded preproteins to SecA, which is the peripheral ATPase of
      the SecYEG translocon (PMID:2170023, PMID:9321390). SecB mutations cause pleiotropic
      defects in protein secretion (PMID:6403503).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: SecB is specifically dedicated to the Sec translocation pathway. The GO
      term comment notes this is for "proteins that compose the transport complex
      but not the proteins being transported." SecB is not a structural component
      of the translocon itself, but rather functions as the dedicated chaperone that
      delivers substrates to the Sec machinery. The original secB mutant was identified
      by defective protein secretion (PMID:6403503), and the SecB-SecA-SecYEG binding
      cascade is well-established (PMID:2170023). The IBA annotation is appropriate.

  review:
    summary: SecB does bind unfolded proteins, but GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding)
      under-represents the actual molecular function. SecB is not merely a passive
      binder of unfolded proteins; it actively carries unfolded precursors from the
      ribosome/cytosol to SecA at the membrane (PMID:2170023, PMID:16962134). GO:0140309
      (unfolded protein carrier activity) better captures this carrier/escort function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: SecB is a canonical example of a protein carrier chaperone. It binds unfolded
      preproteins and escorts them to SecA at translocation sites. Crane et al. mapped
      the path of unfolded precursor on SecB surface and described a "model for transfer
      of the ligand" from SecB to SecA (PMID:16962134). Hartl et al. described SecB
      as having "a dual function in stabilizing the precursor and in passing it on
      to membrane-bound SecA" (PMID:2170023). The GO term GO:0140309 "unfolded protein
      carrier activity" (defined as "A protein carrier activity that binds to a protein
      in an unfolded state and escorts it between two different cellular components")
      precisely describes SecB function. GO:0051082 is slated for obsoletion, and
      the carrier term is the correct replacement.

      (PMID:2664780). This is a core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT

      The IBA annotation is strongly supported by experimental data showing SecB-preprotein
      complexes in vivo (PMID:2664780) and the extensive characterization of SecB
      substrates (UniProt lists DegP, FhuA, FkpA, GBP, LamB, MalE, OmpA, OmpF, OmpT,

    action: ACCEPT

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000104
  review:
    summary: 'SecB is annotated to protein folding via automated transfer from UniRule.
      However, SecB is an anti-folding chaperone: its function is to PREVENT folding,
      not to assist in it. SecB maintains proteins in an unfolded state for translocation
      (PMID:2834066, PMID:2848249, PMID:18048690).'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: SecB is functionally opposite to a protein folding chaperone. While GroEL/DnaK
      assist in proper folding, SecB specifically prevents folding. Collier et al.
      described SecB's function as "antifolding activity" (PMID:2834066). Bechtluft
      et al. showed SecB "completely prevent stable tertiary contacts" (PMID:18048690).
      Weiss et al. demonstrated SecB "retards folding" (PMID:2848249). The correct

      Sec-dependent export pathway. The IEA annotation is correct and consistent with

    reason: This is the original identification of the secB gene and its role in protein
      localization. While the more specific annotations (protein transport by the
      Sec complex, protein targeting) also capture this, the broader intracellular
      protein localization term is appropriate for what the mutant phenotype directly
      demonstrates.

  review:
    summary: Crane et al. used site-directed spin labeling and EPR to map the binding
      pathway of unfolded precursor galactose-binding protein on SecB (PMID:16962134).
      They showed the precursor makes contact with a large portion of the SecB surface
      and established a model for transfer of the ligand from SecB to SecA.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While this paper confirms SecB binds unfolded proteins, the study explicitly
      describes the delivery/transfer function: "SecB delivers its ligand to export
      sites through its specific binding to SecA" and discusses "a model for transfer
      of the ligand." This is carrier activity, not mere binding. GO:0140309 (unfolded

        SecB delivers its ligand to export sites through its specific binding to SecA,
        a peripheral component of the membrane translocon. At the translocon the ligand
        is passed from SecB to SecA and subsequently through the SecYEG channel.

      SecB prevents stable tertiary contacts in MBP and retains it in a molten-globule-like

    reason: The original paper identifies secB as a gene required for protein secretion
      alongside secA. While the original paper did not explicitly name the "Sec complex,"
