description: HdeB is a periplasmic acid-stress chaperone in E. coli that functions
  as an ATP-independent holdase to prevent aggregation of periplasmic proteins under
  acidic conditions. It is a paralog of HdeA, and both proteins are encoded by the
  hdeAB acid stress operon. HdeB exists as a homodimer at neutral pH and dissociates
  into active monomers at acidic pH (complete dissociation at pH 3). While HdeA is
  more effective at pH 2, HdeB is more effective than HdeA at pH 3, and both are required
  for optimal protection against acid stress in vivo (PMID:17085547). HdeB exposes
  hydrophobic surfaces at acidic pH, consistent with its chaperone function. The protein
  is induced by the EvgS/EvgA two-component system and negatively regulated by H-NS
  and TorS/TorR.
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0009268
    label: response to pH
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation via InterPro mapping. HdeB is indeed involved in the cellular
      response to pH, specifically acidic pH. This is a broader parent of the more
      specific GO:0010447 (response to acidic pH), which is already annotated with
      experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is a broader IEA term, it is not incorrect. HdeB is fundamentally
      a pH-responsive chaperone. The more specific term GO:0010447 is already annotated
      with IDA/IMP evidence, so this broader IEA is acceptable as a supporting annotation.
- term:
    id: GO:0042597
    label: periplasmic space
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for periplasmic space localization. This is consistent
      with the experimentally determined localization (IDA for GO:0030288, outer membrane-bounded
      periplasmic space). This IEA is a broader parent term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Periplasmic localization is well established for HdeB. The more specific
      term GO:0030288 (outer membrane-bounded periplasmic space) is annotated with
      IDA. This broader IEA is acceptable.
- term:
    id: GO:0051082
    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation via InterPro mapping. HdeB does bind unfolded/aggregation-prone
      periplasmic proteins under acidic conditions. However, its function is better
      described as a holdase chaperone rather than simple binding.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: HdeB functions as an ATP-independent holdase that prevents aggregation
      of periplasmic proteins at acidic pH (PMID:17085547). The term GO:0051082 "unfolded
      protein binding" describes only the binding aspect, not the chaperone holdase
      function. GO:0140309 "unfolded protein carrier activity" (a protein carrier
      activity that binds to a protein in an unfolded state and escorts it, preventing
      aggregation) better captures the holdase function.

      label: unfolded protein binding (retain until holdase NTR is created)
    supported_by:

      supporting_text: HdeB has a molecular mass of 10 kDa... HdeB is more efficient
        than HdeA in preventing periplasmic-protein aggregation [at pH 3]... we can
        conclude that Escherichia coli possesses two acid stress chaperones that prevent
        periplasmic-protein aggregation at acidic pH.

    label: cellular stress response to acidic pH
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000104
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from UniRule transfer. HdeB is specifically involved in
      the cellular stress response to acidic pH, protecting periplasmic proteins from
      acid-induced aggregation. This term is appropriate and well-supported by the
      known biology.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This term accurately captures HdeB's role in the acid stress response.
      The protein functions specifically as an acid-activated chaperone (PMID:17085547).

  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:17085547
  review:
    summary: IDA annotation based on direct experimental evidence from Kern et al.
      (2007). The study demonstrated that HdeB is an acid stress chaperone that prevents
      periplasmic protein aggregation at acidic pH, with optimal activity at pH 3.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by direct experimental evidence. HdeB's chaperone activity
      is specifically activated at acidic pH and is required for protection against
      acid stress (PMID:17085547).

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:17085547
  review:
    summary: IMP annotation based on mutant phenotype evidence. hdeB mutants display
      increased sensitivity to acid stress (PMID:17085547). This complements the IDA
      annotation for the same term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The mutant phenotype clearly demonstrates HdeB's role in the acid stress
      response. hdeB deletion mutants show reduced viability at pH 2 and pH 3 (PMID:17085547).

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for localization to the outer membrane-bounded periplasmic
      space. HdeB was extracted from bacteria by the osmotic-shock procedure, confirming
      its periplasmic localization (PMID:17085547). UniProt also confirms periplasm
      localization with a signal peptide (residues 1-29).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Directly supported by experimental evidence. HdeB has a signal peptide
      and was purified from the periplasm by osmotic shock (PMID:17085547).

    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:17085547
  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding based on direct experimental
      evidence. Kern et al. demonstrated that HdeB prevents aggregation of periplasmic
      proteins at acidic pH, consistent with binding unfolded proteins. However, the
      function is better described as holdase/chaperone activity rather than simple
      binding.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While HdeB does bind unfolded proteins, its function is more accurately
      described as a holdase chaperone. GO:0140309 "unfolded protein carrier activity"
      better captures the ATP-independent holdase function that prevents aggregation
      and escorts substrates. The experimental evidence from PMID:17085547 demonstrates
      chaperone-like prevention of aggregation, not just binding.

      label: unfolded protein binding (retain until holdase NTR is created)
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:17085547
      supporting_text: At pH 3, however, HdeB is more efficient than HdeA in preventing
        periplasmic-protein aggregation. The solubilization of several model substrate
        proteins at acidic pH supports the hypothesis that, in vitro, HdeA plays a
        major role in protein solubilization at pH 2 and that both proteins are involved
        in protein solubilization at pH 3.
