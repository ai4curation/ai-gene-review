description: 'DnaJ (Hsp40) is the founding member of the J-domain protein family and
  the primary co-chaperone of the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system in E. coli. DnaJ is
  a modular protein consisting of four domains: an N-terminal J-domain (residues 3-72)
  that stimulates DnaK ATPase activity via a conserved HPD motif, a glycine/phenylalanine-rich
  region, a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain (residues 131-209) containing two Zn(2+)
  centers, and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain. DnaJ functions as a homodimer
  that binds unfolded or misfolded polypeptides and delivers them to DnaK, stimulating
  DnaK ATPase activity to form a stable DnaK-substrate complex. Together with GrpE
  (nucleotide exchange factor), the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system constitutes a chaperone
  machine essential for protein folding, refolding of stress-denatured proteins, regulation
  of the heat shock response (via sigma32 inactivation), and initiation of phage lambda
  and plasmid DNA replication. DnaJ also possesses DnaK-independent chaperone activity
  dependent on zinc center 1, and thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity mediated
  by its zinc finger cysteines. DnaJ is not an independent foldase but rather a co-chaperone
  that assists the DnaK folding cycle.'

core_functions:
- description: DnaJ functions as the primary co-chaperone of the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone
    system. It binds unfolded or misfolded substrates via its C-terminal domain and
    delivers them to DnaK, stimulating DnaK ATPase activity through the conserved
    HPD motif in its J-domain. Together with GrpE (nucleotide exchange factor), the
    DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system refolds stress-denatured proteins and converts stably misfolded
    proteins into intermediates that spontaneously refold to the native state (PMID:20953191).
    DnaJ is the founding member of the J-domain protein family.

    supporting_text: Hsp70-Hsp40-NEF and possibly Hsp100 are the only known molecular
      chaperones that can use the energy of ATP to convert stably pre-aggregated polypeptides
      into natively refolded proteins.
  - reference_id: PMID:12941935
    supporting_text: it appears that zinc center II mutant proteins lack a necessary
      additional interaction site with DnaK, which seems to be crucial for locking-in
      substrate proteins onto DnaK.
- description: DnaJ cooperates with DnaK to inactivate sigma32 (the heat shock transcription
    factor) by direct binding, constituting a negative feedback loop in the heat shock
    response. DnaJ binds free sigma32 with Kd 20 nM (PMID:8599944) and mediates efficient
    DnaK binding to sigma32, cooperatively inhibiting its transcriptional activity.
