description: Spy (Spheroplast protein Y) is an ATP-independent periplasmic chaperone
  in E. coli that functions primarily as a holdase, preventing protein aggregation
  under stress conditions (tannins, butanol, ethanol). It forms a thin, cradle-shaped
  homodimer with a novel alpha-helical fold. Spy is massively upregulated (up to 25-50%
  of periplasmic protein) under envelope stress via the Bae and Cpx two-component
  systems. Remarkably, Spy can also allow substrate proteins to fold while remaining
  bound to its surface, making it unusual among ATP-independent chaperones. It binds
  unfolded, intermediate, and native conformations of its substrates with comparable
  micromolar affinities.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for periplasmic localization of Spy, inferred from phylogenetic
      analysis. Spy is well established as a periplasmic protein based on extensive
      experimental evidence from multiple studies (PMID:9068658, PMID:21317898, PMID:9694902).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Spy was originally identified as a periplasmic protein (PMID:9068658)
      and its periplasmic localization has been confirmed repeatedly. The IBA annotation
      is consistent with all available experimental evidence and the UniProt record.
      The IDA annotation (below) provides direct experimental support.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for unfolded protein binding, inferred by phylogeny. Spy
      is indeed one of the best-characterized unfolded protein binders, demonstrated
      by ITC, stopped-flow fluorescence, and crystallographic studies (PMID:26619265,
      PMID:27239796). However, GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion and Spy is primarily
      a holdase chaperone that prevents aggregation in the periplasm.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Spy is primarily a holdase -- an ATP-independent chaperone that binds
      unfolded/misfolded proteins to prevent aggregation in situ. It does not escort
      proteins between compartments, so GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity)
      does not apply. The ideal replacement is a proposed "holdase chaperone activity"
      NTR. Until that NTR exists, GO:0051082 should be retained. Spy also has some
      foldase-like activity (PMID:26619265), but its primary mechanism is holdase.
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone, already annotated separately) captures
      the foldase aspect.

      supporting_text: It has previously been thought that only ATP dependent "foldase"
        chaperones can actively facilitate protein folding. The ATP independent "holdase"
        chaperones were thought to play a more passive role, holding onto aggregation-sensitive
        folding intermediates

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for periplasmic space based on InterPro and UniProt subcellular
      location mappings. This is a broader term than GO:0030288 (outer membrane-bounded
      periplasmic space), which is also annotated. Both are correct.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IEA mapping to periplasmic space is consistent with all experimental
      evidence. While GO:0030288 is more specific, the broader GO:0042597 is not incorrect
      for an IEA annotation. Spy is unambiguously a periplasmic protein (PMID:9068658,

    summary: IPI annotation for protein binding based on physical interaction evidence
      from IntAct (Spy interacts with immunity protein Imm). The PMID:26619265 study
      used ITC and stopped-flow fluorescence to demonstrate direct binding of Spy
      to Im7 in multiple conformational states (Kd values of 3.5-20.5 uM).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: GO:0005515 (protein binding) is uninformative for a protein whose core
      function is binding unfolded proteins as a chaperone. The chaperone-substrate
      interaction is already captured by GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) and
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone). Per curation guidelines, protein binding
      should be avoided in favor of more specific MF terms.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for involvement in protein folding, based on the discovery
      paper showing that Spy suppresses protein aggregation and aids protein refolding
      in vitro. Spy increased refolding yield of chemically and thermally unfolded
      substrates in the absence of ATP or cofactors (PMID:21317898). Subsequent work
      showed that substrates can actually fold while bound to Spy's surface (PMID:26619265).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Spy is directly involved in protein folding in the periplasm. The original
      discovery paper demonstrated that Spy suppresses aggregation of multiple substrates
      (MDH, aldolase, GAPDH) and significantly increases refolding yield (PMID:21317898).
      The follow-up study (PMID:26619265) provided the remarkable finding that Im7
      folds while bound to Spy. This BP annotation accurately captures Spy's role.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for protein folding chaperone activity, based on the landmark
      study demonstrating that Im7 substrate folds while bound to Spy (PMID:26619265).
      Global kinetic fitting showed that the only model consistent with the data requires
      Im7 to fold completely (U -> I -> N) while remaining associated with Spy. This
      is unusual for an ATP-independent chaperone.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Spy is demonstrated to function as a protein folding chaperone, as the
      substrate Im7 folds through all intermediates while continuously bound to Spy's
      surface (PMID:26619265). Although Spy is primarily considered a holdase (preventing
      aggregation), it clearly also promotes folding without ATP. GO:0044183 is appropriate
      for this experimentally demonstrated activity. The structural basis for this
      was further elucidated by READ crystallography (PMID:27239796).

        that can explain all of the experimental data

    summary: IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding based on ITC and stopped-flow
      kinetics showing Spy binds unfolded, intermediate, and native Im7 with micromolar
      affinities (PMID:26619265). Spy bound Im7U with Kd of 10.4 uM and association
      rate constant of 1.3 x 10^7 M-1 s-1, indicating rapid capture of unfolded substrate.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The experimental evidence robustly supports Spy binding to unfolded proteins.
      However, GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. Spy is primarily a holdase --
      it prevents aggregation in situ in the periplasm, not a carrier that escorts
      proteins between compartments. GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity)
      does NOT fit because Spy acts in situ. The ideal replacement is a proposed "holdase

      unfolded protein binding. However, GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion and

      of Spy (PMID:9068658). Spy was identified as a new periplasmic protein produced
      abundantly in spheroplasts but not in intact cells. The protein contains a signal
      peptide (residues 1-23) directing it to the periplasm.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The original identification of Spy as a periplasmic protein (PMID:9068658)
      is the foundational localization evidence. The signal peptide cleaves at position
      23 to generate the mature periplasmic form. This has been confirmed by multiple

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Independent confirmation of Spy homodimerization using multiple biophysical
      methods (crystallography, SEC, AUC) in the landmark chaperone discovery paper.
      This is a duplicate of the PMID:20799348 annotation (both correct) and reflects
