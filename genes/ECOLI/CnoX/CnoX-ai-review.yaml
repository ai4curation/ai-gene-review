description: CnoX (formerly YbbN) is an E. coli chaperedoxin -- a bifunctional protein
  that combines ATP-independent holdase chaperone activity with a redox-protective
  function. It contains an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain (lacking the canonical
  CXXC active site and therefore not a functional oxidoreductase) fused to a C-terminal
  tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Upon activation by hypochlorous acid (HOCl/bleach)
  via chlorination of its TPR domain, CnoX functions as an efficient holdase, binding
  unfolded client proteins to prevent their aggregation (PMID:29754824). Uniquely,
  CnoX also protects its bound substrates from irreversible oxidation by forming mixed
  disulfide bonds via Cys-63 (PMID:29754824). After bleach stress subsides, CnoX transfers
  its substrates to the major ATP-dependent foldases GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE
  for refolding (PMID:29754824, PMID:18657513). CnoX interacts with and coordinately
  regulates GroEL/GroES (as a mild inhibitor) and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (as an enhancer),
  suggesting it helps direct client protein traffic between these two major chaperone
  systems (PMID:21498507, PMID:18657513). CnoX is the founding member of the chaperedoxin
  protein family.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference. CnoX contains a thioredoxin-like
      domain and was initially thought to have oxidoreductase activity (PMID:16563353).
      However, multiple studies have now conclusively shown that CnoX lacks a canonical
      CXXC active site and is NOT a functional oxidoreductase (PMID:21498507, PMID:29754824).
      The thioredoxin domain instead forms mixed disulfide bonds with substrates to
      protect them from irreversible oxidation during HOCl stress (PMID:29754824),
      which is a protective/chaperone function rather than classical redox homeostasis.
      The IBA annotation likely propagated from ancestral thioredoxin-family proteins
      that do have oxidoreductase activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While CnoX has a thioredoxin fold and forms disulfide bonds with substrates,
      it is not a classical oxidoreductase that maintains redox homeostasis. UniProt
      explicitly states "Lacks oxidoreductase activity" based on PMID:21498507 and
      PMID:29754824. The IBA likely reflects ancestral thioredoxin function that has
      been repurposed in CnoX. A more accurate biological process annotation would
      be 'cellular response to oxidative stress' (GO:0034599) which is already annotated,
      or 'maintenance of unfolded protein' (GO:0036506).

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation from ARBA machine learning model. CnoX is indeed involved
      in the stress response -- it is activated by HOCl (bleach) stress and protects
      proteins from aggregation and irreversible oxidation during oxidative stress
      (PMID:29754824). The ybbN-deficient strain also shows increased sensitivity
      to thermal stress (PMID:18657513). However, GO:0006950 'response to stress'
      is very broad.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0006950 is very general, it is acceptable as an IEA annotation.
      The more specific term GO:0034599 'cellular response to oxidative stress' is
      already annotated with IMP evidence from PMID:29754824. Keeping this broader

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation from Goemans et al. (2018). CnoX itself does not directly
      refold proteins -- it is an ATP-independent holdase that maintains substrates
      and then transfers them to GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE for refolding (PMID:29754824).
      Earlier work by Kthiri et al. showed that YbbN increases 4-fold the rate of
      protein renaturation by the DnaK chaperone machine (PMID:18657513), but this
      enhancement is indirect -- CnoX facilitates refolding by delivering substrates
      to the foldases.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: CnoX participates in protein refolding indirectly by acting as a holdase
      that maintains substrates in a refolding-competent state and then hands them
      off to the ATP-dependent foldases GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. The annotation
      is not wrong -- CnoX does contribute to protein refolding as part of its overall
      pathway -- but it is not the core molecular function. The core function is holdase
      activity and redox protection. Protein refolding is a downstream consequence
      of CnoX's holdase activity.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation from Goemans et al. (2018). CnoX does bind unfolded proteins,
      but its function goes beyond simple binding. CnoX is an ATP-independent holdase
      that actively prevents aggregation of client proteins and escorts them between
      cellular states -- from unfolded/stressed to the GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE
      foldase systems (PMID:29754824). The term GO:0051082 'unfolded protein binding'
      is a child of GO:0005515 'protein binding' and only describes the binding aspect,
      not the functional chaperone/carrier activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While CnoX does bind unfolded proteins, 'unfolded protein binding' is
      too simplistic for the actual molecular function. CnoX is an ATP-independent
      holdase chaperone that binds unfolded clients and escorts/carries them to the
      major foldase systems. The more appropriate term is GO:0140597 'protein carrier
      chaperone' (defined as "Binding to and carrying a protein between two different
      cellular components by moving along with the target protein") or its child GO:0140309
      'unfolded protein carrier activity'. CnoX fits the holdase/carrier paradigm
      -- it binds unfolded clients, prevents their aggregation, and delivers them
      to GroEL/DnaK for refolding.
