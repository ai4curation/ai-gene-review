description: 'GroEL (Cpn60/Hsp60) is the large subunit of the essential E. coli chaperonin
  complex. It forms a barrel-shaped homo-tetradecameric double-ring structure (two
  stacked heptameric rings) that, together with its co-chaperonin GroES (Hsp10), functions
  as an ATP-dependent protein folding machine (EC 5.6.1.7). The GroEL/ES system encapsulates
  non-native substrate proteins within a central cavity (the "Anfinsen cage"), providing
  a sequestered environment that prevents aggregation and actively accelerates folding
  through iterative cycles of ATP binding, GroES capping, substrate encapsulation,
  ATP hydrolysis, and product release. Approximately 10-15% of E. coli cytoplasmic
  proteins are obligate GroEL substrates. GroEL is essential for viability and is
  heat-shock inducible. It was originally identified as a host factor required for
  bacteriophage lambda and T4 head assembly. UniProt catalytic activity annotation:
  ATP + H2O + an unfolded polypeptide = ADP + phosphate + a folded polypeptide (PMID:9285585,
  PMID:9285593).'

      GroEL1/2. GroEL is the prototypical chaperonin that assists protein folding
      in vivo and in vitro (PMID:2573517, PMID:10532860, PMID:14517228). This is a
      core biological process annotation for GroEL.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Protein folding is the central biological process for GroEL. The IBA annotation
      is well supported by extensive experimental evidence. UniProt states GroEL "plays
      an essential role in assisting protein folding" (PMID:10532860, PMID:2573517).

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for ATP binding supported by phylogenetic inference. GroEL
      binds ATP in the equatorial domain, and this binding is essential for triggering
      conformational changes that drive the chaperonin cycle (PMID:8564544, PMID:9285585).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: ATP binding is a well-characterized molecular function of GroEL. The crystal
      structure of GroEL complexed with ATPgammaS (PMID:8564544) directly demonstrates
      ATP binding. The asymmetric GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 structure (PMID:9285585) also

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GroEL (also called Hsp60/Cpn60) is a canonical heat shock protein in E.
      coli. Its expression is induced by heat stress and it functions to prevent protein
      aggregation under thermal stress conditions. The IBA annotation is consistent

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for unfolded protein binding. While GroEL does bind unfolded/non-native
      proteins, GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. The function of GroEL is better described
      as an ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone (GO:0140662) because GroEL does
      not merely bind unfolded proteins -- it actively facilitates their folding through
      ATP-driven encapsulation cycles.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 "unfolded protein binding" is a passive binding term that fails
      to capture GroEL's active foldase function. GroEL is the canonical ATP-dependent
      chaperonin that encapsulates substrates in a central cavity and promotes folding
      through an iterative ATP hydrolysis cycle (PMID:7935796, PMID:8097882, PMID:9285585).
      The appropriate replacement is GO:0140662 "ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone"
      which is a child of GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone" and accurately captures
      the ATP-dependent foldase mechanism. GO:0051082 is being obsoleted as part of
      the unfolded protein binding obsoletion project.

    summary: IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping (KW-0547 Nucleotide-binding).
      This is a parent term of GO:0005524 ATP binding, which is already annotated
      with IBA and IDA evidence. The IEA is broader but not incorrect.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GroEL is unambiguously a nucleotide-binding protein (it binds ATP and
      ADP). This is correctly inferred from the UniProt keyword. While more general
      than the specific ATP binding annotation, it is not wrong. The IBA/IDA annotations
      for ATP binding provide the more specific annotation.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Correct electronic inference. GroEL is a cytoplasmic protein. UniProt

      not wrong even though a more specific "cytosol" annotation exists with IDA evidence.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043

    summary: IEA annotation for isomerase activity from UniProt keyword KW-0413. GroEL
      is classified as EC 5.6.1.7 (protein-folding chaperone) in the isomerase class,
      which catalyzes the conversion of unfolded polypeptides to folded polypeptides.
      This is a technically correct but very broad classification.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: UniProt assigns EC 5.6.1.7 to GroEL, placing it in the isomerase class
      (EC 5). The IEA mapping from the Isomerase keyword to GO:0016853 is technically
      correct. However, the more specific GO:0140662 "ATP-dependent protein folding
      chaperone" annotation better captures the specific activity.

      GroEL/ES can refold denatured proteins back to their native state in vitro and
      in vivo.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: GroEL/ES is well-established to catalyze protein refolding. UniProt describes
      how the system can "rescue kinetically trapped intermediates" (PMID:20603018)
      and multiple studies show refolding of denatured substrates (PMID:10532860).
      The IEA annotation is correct.

      Like the IBA annotation for this term, this should be modified to the more appropriate
      protein folding chaperone term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Same rationale as for the IBA annotation of GO:0051082. GroEL is not merely
      an unfolded protein binder -- it is an ATP-dependent foldase. GO:0051082 is
      being obsoleted. The correct replacement is GO:0140662 "ATP-dependent protein

    label: ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:9285585
  review:
    summary: 'NEW annotation. GroEL is the prototypical ATP-dependent protein folding
      chaperone. The crystal structure of the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 complex (PMID:9285585)
      together with the catalytic activity annotation (EC 5.6.1.7: ATP + H2O + unfolded
      polypeptide = ADP + phosphate + folded polypeptide) provides direct evidence
      for this molecular function. This term is already annotated via IEA but lacks
      direct experimental support in the current annotation set.'
    action: NEW
    reason: GO:0140662 "ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone" is the single most
      accurate molecular function term for GroEL. It captures both the ATP dependence
      and the protein folding chaperone activity. UniProt assigns EC 5.6.1.7 with
      evidence from PMID:9285585 and PMID:9285593. While an IEA annotation exists,
      there is no experimental annotation for this term in the current GOA set. Given
      that multiple GO:0051082 annotations are being recommended for modification
      to this term, having an explicit experimental annotation is important.

core_functions:
- description: 'GroEL is the prototypical ATP-dependent protein folding chaperone
    (EC 5.6.1.7). It catalyzes the reaction: ATP + H2O + unfolded polypeptide = ADP
    + phosphate + folded polypeptide within the GroEL-GroES complex in the cytosol.
    Multiple crystal structures (PMID:8564544, PMID:9285585), mutational analyses
    (PMID:7935796), and functional studies establish this as the core molecular function.
    GroEL also has intrinsic ATPase activity (PMID:379350) that drives the chaperonin
    conformational cycle. Approximately 10-15% of E. coli cytoplasmic proteins are
    obligate GroEL substrates. groEL mutations cause protein misfolding in vivo (PMID:2573517).'
