  label: Escherichia coli (strain K12)
description: RidA (formerly YjgF) is a 2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate deaminase
  (EC 3.5.99.10) in E. coli that accelerates the release of ammonia from reactive
  enamine/imine intermediates generated by PLP-dependent enzymes such as threonine
  dehydratase (IlvA). RidA is a cytoplasmic homotrimer (PMID:10595546) and its primary
  evolved function is detoxification of reactive intermediates in amino acid metabolism,
  particularly in the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway. Importantly, RidA acquires
  chaperone holdase activity ONLY when post-translationally modified by HOCl (hypochlorous
  acid) via N-chlorination of lysine and arginine residues (PMID:25517874). Untreated
  RidA has NO chaperone activity. This conditional chaperone function is a secondary,
  stress-activated moonlighting function and not the core evolved role of RidA.

    label: deaminase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033

    summary: IBA annotation for deaminase activity, consistent with the primary enzymatic
      function of RidA as a 2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.10).
      This is the core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT

    label: amino acid biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for amino acid biosynthetic process. RidA detoxifies reactive
      enamine/imine intermediates from PLP-dependent enzymes in amino acid metabolism,
      supporting isoleucine biosynthesis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: RidA's deaminase activity contributes to amino acid biosynthesis by removing
      toxic intermediates. This is a broad but accurate annotation.

    label: branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. RidA deaminates
      reactive intermediates from threonine dehydratase (IlvA), which is part of the
      isoleucine biosynthetic pathway.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a more specific and appropriate annotation. RidA's primary biological
      role is in the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway via detoxification of IlvA intermediates.

  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for isoleucine biosynthetic process. Note that this GO
      term is marked as obsolete.
    action: REMOVE

    label: response to toxic substance
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for response to toxic substance. RidA detoxifies reactive
      enamine/imine intermediates that are nucleophilic and potentially toxic.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: RidA's primary function is detoxification of reactive intermediates. This
      term is consistent with its role, though the IDA annotation from PMID:25517874
      for the same term provides stronger experimental support.

    label: hydrolase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: IEA annotation for hydrolase activity. RidA is classified as EC 3.5.99.10,
      which is a hydrolase. This is a very broad parent of the more specific deaminase
      activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: As an EC 3.5.99.10 enzyme, RidA is indeed a hydrolase. This broad IEA
      is acceptable alongside the more specific deaminase annotations.

      deaminase activity was first characterized in Salmonella enterica RidA and transferred
      to E. coli by sequence similarity.

  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for response to toxic substance from Mueller et al. (2014).
      ridA deletion mutants are sensitive to HOCl stress, showing prolonged lag phase
      at medium HOCl concentrations (1-2 mM). RidA plays a role in protecting E. coli
      against HOCl-mediated stress.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The ridA mutant is sensitive to HOCl, demonstrating a role in response
      to toxic substance. This is supported by growth assays in the presence of HOCl
      (PMID:25517874). Note that this response involves the HOCl-activated chaperone
      function, not the deaminase activity.

  original_reference_id: PMID:25517874
  review:
    summary: IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding based on Mueller et al. (2014).
      However, this study explicitly demonstrated that untreated RidA has NO chaperone
      activity. Chaperone holdase function is ONLY activated upon N-chlorination by
      HOCl or monochloramine. This is a conditional, post-translationally activated
      moonlighting function, not a constitutive property of the native protein.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The PMID:25517874 paper is very clear that native RidA has no chaperone
      activity. The abstract states "E. coli RidA modified with HOCl acts as a highly
      effective chaperone." The paper also shows that "incubation of IlvA with a 10-fold
      molar excess of untreated RidA had no effect on IlvA's aggregation behaviour."
      The chaperone function requires HOCl-mediated N-chlorination, which is a stress-specific
      post-translational modification. Annotating RidA with "unfolded protein binding"
      without any qualifier about the HOCl requirement is misleading and overstates
      the constitutive function. The primary function is 2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate
      deaminase activity.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:25517874
      supporting_text: E. coli RidA modified with HOCl acts as a highly effective
        chaperone. Although activation of RidA is reversed by treatment with DTT,
        ascorbic acid, the thioredoxin system and glutathione, it is independent of
        cysteine modification.

  review:
    summary: HDA annotation for membrane localization from a complexomics study. This
      is unexpected given that RidA is a soluble cytoplasmic protein with no signal
      peptide or transmembrane domain.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: RidA is a well-characterized soluble cytoplasmic protein with no signal
      peptide, transmembrane domain, or membrane-binding motif. UniProt annotates
      it as cytoplasmic. The HDA from a complexomics study likely represents a non-specific
      or artifactual association. This annotation is inconsistent with all other localization
      evidence.
