description: >
  MrdA (also known as PBP2 or PbpA) is a class B penicillin-binding protein that functions as a
  monofunctional D,D-transpeptidase (EC 3.4.16.4) essential for lateral cell wall synthesis and
  rod shape determination in E. coli. It catalyzes the formation of 4-3 peptide crosslinks in
  peptidoglycan by transferring the terminal D-Ala from stem peptides to acceptor meso-diaminopimelate
  (mDAP) residues on neighboring glycan strands. MrdA works in partnership with RodA (a SEDS-family
  glycan polymerase) as the core elongasome synthase complex, with additional components including
  MreB, MreC, MreD, and RodZ. The protein is anchored in the inner membrane with its large catalytic
  domain exposed to the periplasm. MrdA is specifically inhibited by mecillinam (amdinocillin) and
  is also targeted by other beta-lactam antibiotics and diazabicyclooctane (DBO) inhibitors like
  avibactam. Loss of MrdA function causes cells to become spherical (cocci), demonstrating its
  essential role in maintaining rod morphology.

      MrdA/PBP2 is classified as EC 3.4.16.4 (serine-type D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase). This EC
      number encompasses the D,D-transpeptidase activity - the transpeptidation reaction involves

      The enzyme catalyzes preferential cleavage at (Ac)2-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala and also performs
      transpeptidation. GO does not have a separate D,D-transpeptidase activity term, so this

      meso-diaminopimelate (mDAP) at position 3 of an acceptor stem peptide on a neighboring
      glycan strand. This is distinct from L,D-transpeptidase activity which forms 3-3 crosslinks.
    justification: >
      GO currently has GO:0071972 (peptidoglycan L,D-transpeptidase activity) but no corresponding
      term for D,D-transpeptidase activity. D,D-transpeptidases (class B PBPs like MrdA/PBP2) and
      L,D-transpeptidases (like YcbB/LdtD) catalyze fundamentally different crosslinking reactions
      and have different substrate specificities, inhibitor sensitivities, and active site chemistry.
      A specific term would improve annotation accuracy. Currently GO:0009002 is used as a proxy
      but it emphasizes the carboxypeptidase aspect rather than the transpeptidation.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >
      Why was GO:0071972 (L,D-transpeptidase activity) annotated to MrdA/PBP2 when it is
      clearly a D,D-transpeptidase? Both IBA and IDA annotations exist for this term. The IDA cites
      PMID:6297485 which actually describes D,D-transpeptidase activity (mecillinam-sensitive crosslinking).
      This appears to be a significant annotation error that should be corrected.
  - question: >
      Should GO add a specific peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase activity term? D,D-transpeptidases
      and L,D-transpeptidases are mechanistically distinct enzymes with different active sites
      (serine vs cysteine), different crosslink products (4-3 vs 3-3), and different inhibitor
      sensitivities (beta-lactam sensitive vs resistant).
