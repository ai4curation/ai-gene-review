description: Skp is a homotrimeric periplasmic chaperone in E. coli that functions
  as an ATP-independent carrier for unfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Structurally,
  Skp adopts a jellyfish-like architecture with alpha-helical tentacles protruding
  from a beta-barrel body, defining a central cavity in which unfolded OMP substrates
  are bound (PMID:15304217). After OMPs emerge from the Sec translocon at the inner
  membrane, Skp captures them and maintains their solubility during transit through
  the periplasm to the BAM complex for insertion into the outer membrane (PMID:10455120,
  PMID:19181847). Skp functions in a parallel chaperone pathway with DegP, serving
  as a backup to the primary SurA pathway for OMP biogenesis (PMID:17908933). Skp
  binds specifically to bacterial OMPs including OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, LamB, PhoE, OmpX,
  and OmpG, forming stable 1:1 (OMP:Skp trimer) complexes with nanomolar dissociation
  constants via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (PMID:17928002). LPS binding
  to Skp-OMP complexes facilitates subsequent membrane insertion (PMID:12509434).
  Skp is architecturally similar to the archaeal/eukaryotic chaperone prefoldin/GimC
  (PMID:15304217).

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for protein folding. Skp is involved in the biogenesis
      pathway of outer membrane proteins, but its primary role is as a holdase/carrier
      rather than a classical foldase. Skp maintains OMP substrates in an unfolded
      state during periplasmic transit (PMID:19181847). The OmpA beta-barrel domain
      remains unfolded while bound to Skp (PMID:19181847). Folding and insertion into
      the outer membrane only occurs after release from Skp at the BAM complex, often
      requiring LPS (PMID:12509434). While Skp participates in the broader folding
      pathway, a more accurate description would be that Skp prevents premature folding/aggregation
      and escorts OMPs to the site of folding. The IBA annotation is reasonable at
      a high level given its role in the OMP biogenesis pathway.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Although Skp acts more as a holdase/carrier than a classical foldase,
      it participates in the broader protein folding pathway for OMPs. The IBA annotation
      is phylogenetically sound and represents a legitimate, if broad, annotation
      of Skp's biological role.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for protein stabilization. This is well-supported by multiple
      experimental studies. Skp prevents aggregation of unfolded OMP intermediates
      in the periplasm (PMID:10455120, PMID:15304217, PMID:23796519). In skp null
      mutants combined with degP deletion, protein aggregates accumulate in the periplasm
      (PMID:10455120). Skp protects substrates from aggregation in a cavity-dependent
      manner (PMID:19181847).

      bind unfolded proteins, GO:0051082 is being considered for obsoletion as it
      is overly broad and fails to distinguish between different modes of chaperone
      action. Skp is a true carrier chaperone that escorts unfolded OMPs from the
      Sec translocon/inner membrane to the BAM complex in the outer membrane (PMID:10455120,
      PMID:19181847). The term GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity) precisely
      captures this escort/carrier function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0051082 is being reviewed for obsoletion. Skp functions as an unfolded
      protein carrier -- it binds unfolded OMPs at the inner membrane and escorts

      is a carrier/escort function, not merely binding.

    summary: EXP annotation from Rizzitello et al. 2001. This genetic study demonstrated
      synthetic lethality between skp and surA mutations, establishing that Skp and
      SurA function in parallel chaperone pathways for OMP biogenesis (PMID:11698367).
      Loss of both pathways results in severely reduced envelope protein levels and
      bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects.

      Its primary localization is the periplasm, not the cytosol. The cytosolic detection
