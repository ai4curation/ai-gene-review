description: >-
  D-ribose pyranase (EC 5.4.99.62) that catalyzes the interconversion of beta-D-ribopyranose and
  beta-D-ribofuranose. This enzyme was originally misidentified as a high-affinity ribose transport
  protein based on its genomic location in the rbs operon, but NMR studies (PMID:15060078)
  definitively demonstrated its enzymatic function as a pyranase. The enzyme also catalyzes the
  conversion between beta-allofuranose and beta-allopyranose. RbsD forms a homodecameric toroidal
  structure with active sites formed at the interface between adjacent subunits. The catalytic
  mechanism involves His-20 as a proton donor. This enzyme is essential for D-ribose catabolism,
  converting the pyranose form of ribose (which enters the cell via the RbsB transporter) into the
  furanose form that can be phosphorylated by ribokinase (RbsK) for entry into the pentose phosphate
  pathway [file:ECOLI/rbsD/rbsD-deep-research-falcon.md].

        RbsD functions in the D-ribose degradation pathway, converting beta-D-ribopyranose
        (the form that enters the cell) to beta-D-ribofuranose, which can then be phosphorylated

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This accurately describes the biological process context for RbsD function. The enzyme
        performs step 1 of 2 in the pathway from beta-D-ribopyranose to D-ribose 5-phosphate
        (UniPathway UPA00916). This is the core biological process for this enzyme.

        This is the top-level isomerase activity term, representing EC class 5. D-ribose pyranase
        is indeed an isomerase (EC 5.4.99.62).

        This correctly captures the broad enzymatic class. EC 5.4.99.62 belongs to EC class 5

        informative than the specific GO:0062193 term, this hierarchical annotation is not wrong.

        This is the correct parent term based on EC classification. D-ribose pyranase (EC 5.4.99.62)
        is classified under EC 5.4 (intramolecular transferases), which corresponds to GO:0016866.
        The IBA evidence appropriately captures this hierarchical relationship through phylogenetic
        analysis.

      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        This annotation appears to be INCORRECT. D-ribose pyranase (EC 5.4.99.62) is classified
        under EC 5.4 (intramolecular transferases), NOT EC 4.x (lyases). The GO term GO:0016872
        (intramolecular lyase activity) describes "catalysis of certain rearrangements of a
        molecule to break or form a ring" which superficially sounds similar, but the enzyme
        is definitively an intramolecular transferase per IUBMB/ExpaSy classification. The
        correct parent term is GO:0016866 (intramolecular transferase activity), as correctly
        captured by the IBA annotation. This UniRule mapping should be corrected.

        This annotation reflects the homodecameric quaternary structure of RbsD, as characterized
        by Feng et al. (2006) studying the stepwise assembly/disassembly of the oligomer

        The homodecameric structure is well-established by both crystallographic and biochemical
        studies. This self-association is required for enzymatic activity, as active sites are
        formed at interfaces between subunits. This represents a core structural feature of the
        functional enzyme.

        This annotation reflects the substrate binding capability of RbsD for D-ribose

        conversion.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        As an enzyme that acts on D-ribose, RbsD necessarily binds monosaccharides. The UniProt
        entry documents substrate binding residues at positions 28, 106, and 128-130. This
        annotation is consistent with the catalytic function and supported by structural data.

        This is the core enzymatic function of RbsD, definitively established by Ryu et al. (2004)
        using NMR spectroscopy. The paper demonstrated that RbsD catalyzes the interconversion
        of beta-D-ribopyranose and beta-D-ribofuranose, correcting the earlier misidentification
        as a ribose transport protein [file:ECOLI/rbsD/rbsD-deep-research-falcon.md].

        This annotation represents the primary, experimentally validated molecular function of RbsD.
        The NMR-based evidence from PMID:15060078 directly demonstrated pyranase activity, and
        mutagenesis of the catalytic His-20 residue abolished activity. This is the core evolved
