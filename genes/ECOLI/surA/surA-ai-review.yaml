description: >-
  SurA is a periplasmic chaperone that functions as the primary pathway for delivery
  of unfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to the BAM complex for insertion into
  the outer membrane. It also possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
  activity via its second parvulin domain, but this enzymatic activity is dispensable
  for its in vivo chaperone function. The N-terminal domain and C-terminal tail are
  necessary and sufficient for chaperone activity and OMP substrate recognition.
  SurA binds preferentially to unfolded OMPs, recognizing aromatic-rich peptide motifs
  characteristic of integral outer membrane beta-barrel proteins. It functions as a
  holdase, stabilizing unfolded OMPs in a dynamic state to prevent aggregation while
  enabling stepwise membrane insertion of beta-hairpins. SurA is required for the
  efficient folding of OmpA, OmpF, LamB, and FimD, and for overall outer membrane
  integrity. Loss of SurA leads to decreased outer membrane density and activates
  the sigmaE stress response.

      SurA participates in the maturation of outer membrane porins, which involves
      conversion of unfolded monomers into folded monomers and subsequent trimerization
      (PMID:8985185). SurA mutants show defective folding of OmpA, OmpF, and LamB
      (PMID:8626309). The IBA annotation to protein folding is phylogenetically
      supported and consistent with experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      SurA is directly involved in protein folding as demonstrated by multiple
      experimental studies. Loss of SurA blocks the LamB assembly pathway at a
      step prior to folded monomer formation (PMID:8985185), and surA mutants
      show defective folding of three outer membrane proteins (PMID:8626309).

      SurA has confirmed PPIase activity (EC 5.2.1.8) residing in its second parvulin
      domain (PMID:8985185, PMID:11226178). However, this enzymatic activity is dispensable

  review:
    summary: >-
      SurA directly binds unfolded outer membrane proteins in the periplasm. Behrens
      et al. (PMID:11226178) demonstrated that SurA interacts preferentially (>50-fold)
      with in vitro synthesized porins over other similarly sized proteins, and this
      chaperone activity resides in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains independent
      of PPIase activity. Thoma et al. (PMID:26344570) characterized SurA as a holdase
      that stabilizes a dynamic unfolded state, preventing misfolding and allowing
      stepwise beta-hairpin insertion into the membrane. Per the UPB project decision
      rules, SurA functions as a holdase-type chaperone that prevents aggregation of
      unfolded OMPs in transit to the BAM complex. It does not actively refold substrates
      via ATPase cycles. However, because it escorts unfolded OMPs from the Sec translocon
      to the BAM complex (between two cellular locations), GO:0140309 (unfolded protein
      carrier activity) could potentially apply. Since the primary mode of action
      described in the literature is holdase/carrier, not foldase, the most appropriate
      replacement depends on whether SurA's escort function qualifies for GO:0140309
      or whether a general holdase NTR is needed.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. SurA is described as a holdase chaperone
      by Thoma et al. (PMID:26344570), who explicitly titled their paper "Impact of
      holdase chaperones Skp and SurA on the folding of beta-barrel outer-membrane
      proteins." SurA stabilizes unfolded OMPs in a dynamic state without actively
      refolding them via ATPase cycles, instead allowing stepwise membrane insertion.
      SurA also escorts OMPs from the Sec translocon across the periplasm to the BAM
      complex, which constitutes transport between two cellular components.
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) could apply if SurA is considered to
      actively assist folding, but the evidence from PMID:26344570 characterizes it
      more as a holdase. Given the escort/carrier function, GO:0140309 may be
      appropriate, but if the carrier semantics do not fit (since SurA acts in a
      single compartment, the periplasm), then the holdase NTR is needed. As an
      interim, retain GO:0051082 until the holdase NTR is created.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The trypsin sensitivity assay demonstrates that SurA contributes to
      protein stabilization of OMPs. Loss of SurA leads to unstable OMP
      conformations. This is consistent with SurA's chaperone function.

      Behrens et al. (PMID:11226178) directly demonstrated that SurA has chaperone
      activity independent of its PPIase domains. A SurA variant lacking both parvulin
      domains exhibited PPIase-independent chaperone-like activity in vitro and almost

    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      GO:0044183 (protein folding chaperone) is not currently annotated for SurA

      chaperone that facilitates OMP folding and assembly, with direct in vitro
      evidence for chaperone activity. This annotation should be added to replace
      GO:0051082 which is proposed for obsoletion. Evidence supports both holdase
      and chaperone mechanisms - SurA prevents aggregation (holdase) and enables
      stepwise folding (facilitating folding). GO:0044183 is the best available
