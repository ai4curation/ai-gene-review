## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P0AD68
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase FtsI {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080, ECO:0000305}; EC=3.4.16.4 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3531167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6450748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7030331}; AltName: Full=Essential cell division protein FtsI {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Murein transpeptidase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6450748}; AltName: Full=Penicillin-binding protein 3 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080, ECO:0000303|PubMed:1103132, ECO:0000303|PubMed:7030331}; Short=PBP-3 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080, ECO:0000303|PubMed:7030331}; AltName: Full=Peptidoglycan synthase FtsI {ECO:0000305}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=ftsI {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080, ECO:0000303|PubMed:7030331}; Synonyms=pbpB; OrderedLocusNames=b0084, JW0082;
- **Organism (full):** Escherichia coli (strain K12).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the transpeptidase family. FtsI subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Bact_Transpept/Beta-Lactamase. (IPR050515); Beta-lactam/transpept-like. (IPR012338); FtsI_transpept. (IPR037532); PBP_dimer. (IPR005311); PBP_dimer_sf. (IPR036138)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ftsI" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Escherichia coli (strain K12).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ftsI' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ftsI** (gene ID: ftsI, UniProt: P0AD68) in ECOLI.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification
We verified the target as Escherichia coli K-12 ftsI (pbpB) encoding Penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3), UniProt P0AD68. PBP3 is the essential class B penicillin-binding protein (bPBP) that provides D,D-transpeptidase activity for septal peptidoglycan (sPG) synthesis during division; it operates with the SEDS glycosyltransferase FtsW in the core divisome complex, and is activated by the FtsQ–FtsB–FtsL (FtsQLB) regulators and FtsN, matching the family/domain annotations provided (transpeptidase/PBP) (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0AD68/entry, database reference; mechanistic/structural details below) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular identity and role: FtsI (PBP3) is the monofunctional, membrane-anchored class B PBP that catalyzes D,D-transpeptidation to form 4→3 peptide crosslinks in sPG at midcell during cytokinesis. It has an N-terminal transmembrane helix, a periplasmic “pedestal” domain that interfaces with divisome regulators, and a C-terminal transpeptidase domain that harbors the canonical serine-active-site motifs (SXXK, SXN, KTG) conserved across Gram-negatives (illustrated for FtsI orthologs; catalytic Ser is acylated by substrate/β-lactams) (Cell Discovery, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-023-00629-w; Nature Rev Microbiol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x; additional motif detail from ortholog structural work) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18, oladele2025impactofsingle pages 37-42).
- Cellular localization and complex: FtsI localizes to the septal ring (Z-ring region) as part of the late-assembling divisome, functioning within the FtsW–FtsI synthase module that executes sPG polymerization (FtsW) and crosslinking (FtsI). FtsQLB binds and stabilizes the complex and transduces activation signals, while FtsN is the late essential activator that triggers robust sPG synthesis. These interaction and activation relationships are established in recent structural and review work (Cell Discovery, 2024; Nature Rev Microbiol, 2024) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).
- Essentiality: FtsI/PBP3 is essential for cell division in E. coli; loss of function blocks septation and leads to filamentation (summarized in divisome reviews; functional genetics cited therein). Crosslinking studies in Salmonella emphasize the conserved divisome composition and occupancy competition by FtsI paralogs, underscoring the central divisome role of bPBP TPases (Molecular Microbiology, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15309) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18, castanheira2024invivocross‐linking pages 22-22).

Catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity
- Reaction: FtsI is a D,D-transpeptidase that forms 4→3 crosslinks by transferring the terminal D-Ala-containing acyl donor (stem peptide attached to glycan) to an acceptor stem peptide (D-Ala–meso-DAP in E. coli), via a covalent acyl-enzyme at the catalytic serine, then deacylation to complete crosslink formation (conserved PBP mechanism; motifs SXXK/SXN/KTG). Structural and biochemical data from PBP3 orthologs define the catalytic serine acylation by β-lactams and substrate (examples compiled in recent literature) (oladele2025impactofsingle pages 37-42, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Cryo-EM divisome architecture and activation: A 2024 cryo-EM structure of a FtsW–FtsI–FtsQLB complex (from Pseudomonas; homologous to E. coli) resolved the SEDS–bPBP core and regulator interfaces. It shows FtsI’s pedestal contacting FtsBL coiled coil and FtsW’s ECL4/H2 being stabilized by FtsL, rationalizing how FtsQLB promotes the active conformation of FtsWI and supporting conserved SEDS–bPBP architecture across species (Cell Discovery, 2024; 3.3 Å; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-023-00629-w) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3).
- Division activation models: Nature Reviews Microbiology (2024) synthesizes evidence that FtsN triggers an activation cascade via FtsQLB to stimulate FtsWI activity, consolidating genetic and structural data, and highlights prior FtsI mutations affecting FtsN recruitment and divisome function (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).
- FtsN dynamics at septa: Single-molecule and imaging work (bioRxiv preprint 2024) in E. coli reports that FtsN partitions between a synthesis track (with active FtsWI) and a denuded-glycan track coordinating hydrolases, consistent with an activation role for FtsN engaging FtsL/FtsI to stimulate sPG synthesis (bioRxiv 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.13.594014) ().
- Divisome movement paradigms: High-resolution live-cell studies in Gram-positives show that processive movement of septal synthases is driven by PG synthesis rather than FtsZ treadmilling, with emerging two-track models in Gram-negatives; these reinforce that active bPBP TPases like FtsI operate within multimeric synthase complexes coordinated by regulators (Nature Microbiol, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01650-9) (whitley2024peptidoglycansynthesisdrives pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Clinical targeting: β-Lactam antibiotics target PBP3 (FtsI) among other PBPs; aztreonam is classically PBP3-selective in Enterobacterales, and cefiderocol shows primary interaction with PBP3 with additional PBP engagement. A large European surveillance demonstrated high cefiderocol susceptibility among Enterobacterales (including E. coli) and highlighted frequent ftsI mutations among cefiderocol-resistant isolates, linking PBP3 alterations to clinical resistance (Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.04181-23) (henriksen2024invitroactivitya pages 1-2).
- β-Lactamase inhibitor combinations: Aztreonam–avibactam (ATM–AVI) restores activity against metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales and is EMA-approved; however, emergent resistance patterns often involve target modification, including PBP3 (ftsI) changes, especially in conjunction with permeability/efflux alterations (Pharmacotherapy, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.4629) ().

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Divisome regulation consensus: Cameron and Margolin (Nature Reviews Microbiology, 2024) consolidate that FtsI/PBP3 operates as the septal TPase of the FtsW–FtsI synthase; FtsQLB and FtsN are core activators, and specific FtsI substitutions disrupt septal localization and FtsN recruitment. The review integrates structural advances (FtsWIQLB), genetic activation (“superfission” alleles), and SPOR-domain targeting to sPG, reflecting field consensus on divisome activation logic (URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).
- Structural mechanisms of core synthase: The 2024 cryo-EM FtsWIQLB structure provides a mechanistic model for how FtsQLB stabilizes the active state of the SEDS–bPBP synthase, with conserved features applicable to E. coli FtsI and supporting the regulator-bridged activation concept (Cell Discovery, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-023-00629-w) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies (2023–2024)
- Cefiderocol surveillance across Enterobacterales (Europe, 2020 collection; reported 2024): 1,909 isolates total (970 Klebsiella, 382 E. coli, 244 Enterobacter). Overall cefiderocol susceptibility 98.1% across Enterobacterales; in meropenem-resistant Enterobacterales (n=148) susceptibility 87.8%. Among cefiderocol-resistant Enterobacterales (n=37), 24/37 (64.9%) harbored ftsI (PBP3) mutations in addition to iron-uptake pathway mutations and carbapenemases, implicating target modification in resistance (Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; Aug 2024 online) (henriksen2024invitroactivitya pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic inhibition metrics for PBPs: Methodological advances have enabled live-cell determination of kinact/KI for PBP inhibition by β-lactams using activity-based probes, refining potency metrics beyond IC50 for covalent inhibitors; though demonstrated in S. pneumoniae, the approach generalizes to PBP families including E. coli PBPs (ACS Infectious Diseases, 2024; Dec 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.4c00370) ().

Biochemical pathway and interaction map (concise)
- FtsZ/FtsA early assembly → recruitment of FtsK → FtsQLB → FtsW–FtsI assembly at midcell → arrival of FtsN, which binds FtsL/FtsI and activates FtsWI synthase to initiate robust sPG synthesis; amidase activation (FtsEX–EnvC–AmiB) coordinates sPG hydrolysis with synthesis. FtsI’s pedestal engages FtsBL; FtsI transpeptidase executes crosslinking of nascent sPG produced by FtsW (Nature Rev Microbiol, 2024; Cell Discovery, 2024; PLoS Biology, 2024 for FtsEX–EnvC activation) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18, yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3).

Subcellular location
- Periplasmic enzyme tethered to the inner membrane by an N-terminal TM helix; catalysis occurs in the periplasm at the septal ring where the divisome assembles (structural review and cryo-EM complex) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18).

Inhibitors and substrate specificity
- Substrate: pentapeptide stems terminating in D-Ala–D-Ala on Lipid II–derived glycan strands; acceptor stems (D-Ala–meso-DAP) are crosslinked via the FtsI acyl-enzyme intermediate. Inhibitors: β-lactams including aztreonam (PBP3-selective monobactam) and cefiderocol (catechol-siderophore cephalosporin with primary PBP3 engagement in Enterobacterales). Resistance mechanisms increasingly involve target-site modifications in ftsI alongside porin/efflux and β-lactamases (Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; Pharmacotherapy, 2024) (henriksen2024invitroactivitya pages 1-2).

Recent resistance mechanisms involving ftsI
- Clinical datasets associate ftsI mutations with cefiderocol resistance in Enterobacterales. Surveillance identified ftsI mutations in 24/37 cefiderocol-resistant isolates and multiple iron uptake mutations, often alongside carbapenemases (Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.04181-23) (henriksen2024invitroactivitya pages 1-2).
- Reviews of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor therapy note that resistance to aztreonam–avibactam can involve PBP3 changes (ftsI), especially in co-presence of permeability defects/ESBLs/MBLs, underscoring PBP3 as a key adaptive target (Pharmacotherapy, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/phar.4629) ().

Notes on protein family/domains
- FtsI is a class B PBP (transpeptidase family). The pedestal domain mediates interactions with FtsBL; the catalytic TPase domain bears SXXK/SXN/KTG motifs of serine TPases. The recent FtsWIQLB structure confirms these domain organizations and interfacial contacts consistent with transpeptidase/PBP_dimer superfamily folds described in UniProt (Cell Discovery, 2024) (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3).

Conclusion
The E. coli K-12 ftsI gene encodes PBP3, the essential septal D,D-transpeptidase of the divisome. Its periplasmic catalytic domain performs 4→3 crosslinking on nascent septal PG synthesized by FtsW. Activation is mediated by FtsQLB and FtsN, as supported by 2024 cryo-EM of the FtsWIQLB complex and synthesis-focused reviews. Clinically, PBP3 is a principal target of β-lactams; aztreonam and cefiderocol maintain activity against many resistant Enterobacterales, though emerging resistance frequently includes ftsI mutations, highlighting the translational importance of PBP3-focused surveillance and inhibitor design (yang2024structuralinsightsinto pages 1-3, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 16-18, henriksen2024invitroactivitya pages 1-2).
