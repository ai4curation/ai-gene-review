description: FtsI (also known as PBP3/PbpB) is an essential peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase required
  for cell division in E. coli. It is a Class B high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein that catalyzes
  cross-linking of peptidoglycan at the division septum. FtsI is a monofunctional transpeptidase - unlike
  Class A PBPs, it lacks glycosyltransferase activity. FtsI forms a subcomplex with FtsW (a SEDS protein
  that provides glycosyltransferase activity) and interacts with multiple divisome proteins including
  FtsQ, FtsL, FtsN, and PBP1b. FtsI localizes to the division septum during later stages of cell growth
  and throughout septation. Inhibition by beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin blocks cell division
  causing filamentation.

  review:
    summary: FtsI is an integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane helix that anchors it to
      the plasma membrane. The bulk of the protein protrudes into the periplasmic space [PMID:2677607].
      UniProt confirms "Cell inner membrane; Single-pass membrane protein; Periplasmic side."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Well-supported by phylogenetic inference (IBA) and consistent with the experimentally determined
      topology of FtsI. The protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane anchor and the periplasmic catalytic
      domain [PMID:2677607, PMID:9614966].

  review:
    summary: FtsI is involved in septation-specific peptidoglycan synthesis. While cell division affects
      cell shape, FtsI is not primarily a shape-regulating protein like PBP2 (which determines rod shape).
      FtsI specifically functions in division, not elongation.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Spratt 1975 [PMID:1103132] showed distinct PBPs for division (PBP3/FtsI), elongation (PBP1),
      and shape (PBP2). FtsI loss causes filamentation but does not alter cell shape in the way PBP2 mutations
      do. This annotation conflates division with shape regulation.

    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is a well-documented error. Meeske et al. 2016 [PMID:27525505] clearly state that Class
      B PBPs "have TP domains but lack PGT activity." The glycosyltransferase activity is provided by
