description: CpxP is a periplasmic auxiliary protein of the Cpx two-component envelope
  stress response system in E. coli. Its primary function is to inhibit the autophosphorylation
  activity of the sensor kinase CpxA, thereby negatively regulating the Cpx stress
  response in the absence of envelope stress signals (PMID:17259177, PMID:21239493).
  CpxP forms an elongated homodimer with a cap-shaped structure. Its concave polar
  surface interacts with the periplasmic sensor domain of CpxA, while an extended
  hydrophobic cleft on its convex surface recognizes misfolded periplasmic proteins
  such as P pilus subunits (PMID:21239493). Upon detection of misfolded proteins (e.g.,
  PapE), CpxP is displaced from CpxA and degraded by the DegP protease together with
  its substrate, thus activating the Cpx response (PMID:16303867, PMID:25207645).
  CpxP therefore acts as a dual-function adaptor protein, serving both as a signaling
  inhibitor and as a periplasmic adaptor that delivers misfolded proteins to DegP
  for degradation. UniProt describes CpxP as having only "mild protein chaperone activity"
  (PMID:21239493, PMID:21317898), and its primary evolved function is clearly that
  of a signaling modulator and proteolysis adaptor, not a general chaperone.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for periplasmic localization, consistent with the IDA
      annotation for the same term (PMID:9473036). CpxP is a well-established periplasmic
      protein with a signal peptide (residues 1-21).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Periplasmic localization of CpxP is confirmed experimentally (PMID:9473036,
      PMID:25207645) and phylogenetically by IBA. This is a core localization annotation.

    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for unfolded protein binding. CpxP does interact with
      misfolded periplasmic proteins via its hydrophobic cleft (PMID:21239493), but
      this interaction is primarily in the context of its adaptor function for DegP-mediated
      proteolysis, not general chaperone holdase activity. UniProt explicitly describes
      CpxP as having only "mild protein chaperone activity" (PMID:21317898).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While CpxP does bind misfolded proteins, this is not its primary function.
      CpxP functions as a signaling inhibitor and proteolysis adaptor, not as a general
      chaperone. The "unfolded protein binding" annotation overstates the chaperone
      aspect and obscures the true function. The misfolded protein binding is in service
      of its adaptor role for DegP proteolysis (PMID:16303867) and signal transduction
      modulation (PMID:21239493), not for preventing aggregation per se. UniProt explicitly
      states "mild protein chaperone activity" (PMID:21317898).

  review:
    summary: IPI annotation for identical protein binding. CpxP forms a homodimer,
      as demonstrated by crystal structure (PMID:21317318, PMID:21239493). The homodimer
      has an intertwined antiparallel alpha-helical structure.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: CpxP homodimerization is well-established structurally and functionally.
      The crystal structures (PMID:21317318 at 2.85A, PMID:21239493 at 1.45A) confirm
      the dimer is the functional form. This is a meaningful interaction relevant

    action: MODIFY
    reason: The "protein binding" term is too generic. CpxP binds CpxA specifically
      to inhibit its sensor kinase activity. A more informative term would be GO:0030547
      "signaling receptor inhibitor activity" which captures the functional consequence
      of the binding -- inhibition of CpxA signaling.

  review:
    summary: EXP annotation for regulation of proteolysis. Isaac et al. (2005) demonstrated
      that CpxP acts as a periplasmic adaptor protein required for the effective DegP-mediated
      degradation of misfolded P pilus subunits. The presence of misfolded substrate
      enhances CpxP proteolysis by DegP.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-supported core function. CpxP serves as an adaptor for
      DegP protease, facilitating the degradation of misfolded periplasmic proteins
      (PMID:16303867). This adaptor function for proteolysis is one of CpxP's two

  review:
    summary: ISM (sequence model) annotation for unfolded protein binding based on
      Zhou et al. (2011). The crystal structure revealed a hydrophobic cleft on the
      convex surface that may serve as a substrate recognition site for misfolded
      proteins.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Same reasoning as for the IBA annotation of this term. The hydrophobic
      cleft identified by structural analysis (PMID:21239493) is primarily involved
      in recognition of misfolded substrates for delivery to DegP protease, not for
      general chaperone holdase activity. CpxP has only "mild protein chaperone activity"
      per UniProt.

      This study showed CpxP binds misfolded PapE pilus subunits and promotes their
      degradation by DegP. The study also confirmed mild chaperone activity for CpxP.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: CpxP does bind misfolded proteins, but this binding is primarily in the
      context of its adaptor function for DegP-mediated proteolysis and its role in
      sensing misfolded proteins for Cpx signaling, not general chaperone activity.
      Overexpression of CpxP leads to DegP-mediated degradation of misfolded pilus
      subunits (PMID:21239493). The primary function is signal transduction modulation
      and proteolysis adaptor activity, with chaperone activity being only mild and
      secondary.

      is dynamic and modulated by stress signals.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: Same as the other protein binding annotation -- "protein binding" is too
      vague. This study specifically demonstrates CpxP-CpxA interaction that inhibits
      Cpx signaling. GO:0030547 "signaling receptor inhibitor activity" is more appropriate.

    reason: CpxP is a core component of the envelope stress response, combating toxicity
      from misfolded periplasmic proteins (PMID:9473036, PMID:16303867). While this
      is a broad term, it accurately reflects CpxP's role. A more specific term could
