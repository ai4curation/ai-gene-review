  label: Pseudomonas putida KT2440
description: "HglS is a 2-oxoadipate dioxygenase/decarboxylase that catalyzes the final step in D-lysine catabolism by converting 2-oxoadipate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate through an Fe(II)- and O2-dependent mechanism involving successive decarboxylation and intramolecular hydroxylation. The enzyme shows high specificity for 2-oxoadipate (KM ~0.01-0.06 mM) and is essential for growth on both L-lysine and D-lysine. HglS belongs to the DUF1338 family and represents the last missing enzymatic step in plant lysine catabolism that was identified through high-resolution crystal structures (PDB: 6W1G, 6W1H) which revealed the molecular basis for substrate specificity mediated by a conserved arginine residue (Arg74)."

- term:
    id: GO:0016491
    label: oxidoreductase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Accurate but general - HglS is specifically a dioxygenase/decarboxylase
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While correct, this term is too general. The more specific dioxygenase activity term better captures HglS function.
- term:
    id: GO:0051213
    label: dioxygenase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Correct and specific - HglS performs dioxygenase activity on 2-oxoadipate
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurately describes the core molecular function. HglS is a Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase that incorporates O2 during the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate.

  original_reference_id: PMID:31064836
  review:
    summary: Core biological process - HglS is essential for lysine catabolism
    action: NEW
    reason: HglS catalyzes a key step in lysine breakdown and deletion mutants cannot grow on lysine.
- term:
    id: GO:0042180
    label: ketone metabolic process
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:31064836
  review:
    summary: Specific metabolic process - HglS processes 2-oxoadipate (a ketone derivative)
    action: NEW
    reason: The substrate 2-oxoadipate is a ketone derivative and the reaction involves ketone metabolism.

    id: GO:0006520
    label: amino acid metabolic process
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:31064836
  review:
    summary: Broad metabolic process - HglS functions in amino acid catabolism
    action: NEW
    reason: As part of lysine catabolism, HglS participates in amino acid metabolic processes.
