description: >-
  Atg2 is a large, rod-shaped lipid transfer protein essential for autophagosome biogenesis. It physically
  tethers the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the expanding phagophore membrane while simultaneously
  transferring phospholipids from the ER to the phagophore for membrane expansion. The N-terminal
  Chorein_N domain contains a hydrophobic cavity that binds multiple lipid molecules, enabling
  high-capacity lipid transfer. Atg2 localizes to phagophore-ER contact sites (PERCS), where it
  works cooperatively with Atg18 (via PI3P binding) and the lipid scramblase Atg9 to coordinate
  membrane biogenesis. Beyond phospholipids, recent evidence shows ATG2 also transfers triglycerides.
  The protein is required for macroautophagy, mitophagy, and other selective autophagy pathways.
  Atg2 mutants show defective autophagosome formation and impaired Atg8 processing.

    summary: >-
      Atg2 is essential for autophagosome assembly, functioning as a lipid transfer protein that
      tethers the ER to the expanding phagophore and mediates phospholipid transfer for membrane
      expansion. This is phylogenetically conserved across ATG2 family members (PMID:30911189).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core function of Atg2 confirmed by extensive experimental evidence. The IBA annotation
      is well-supported by the phylogenetic analysis and confirmed by direct experimental evidence
      in S. pombe showing Atg2 is required for autophagosome formation (PMID:23950735, PMID:37553386).

      This annotation derives from the UniProt Meiosis keyword assigned because atg2/mug36
      was identified as meiotically up-regulated. However, Atg2 is autophagy machinery, not
      meiotic cell cycle machinery.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear over-annotation. Atg2 is autophagy machinery that becomes upregulated
      during meiosis/sporulation because autophagy provides nutrients needed for this process.
      Atg2 has no direct role in meiotic cell cycle regulation (chromosome segregation,
      cell division, etc.). The gene was named mug36 (meiotically up-regulated) based on
      expression pattern, not function. ATG genes are not meiotic regulators - they are
      upregulated during meiosis because autophagy is induced. This SPKW-derived annotation
      conflates correlation (upregulation during meiosis) with causation (involvement in meiosis).

      This is the primary molecular function of Atg2. The protein acts as a bridge-like
      lipid transfer protein (BLTP), binding approximately 20 lipids simultaneously and transferring
      them through its extended hydrophobic channel.
