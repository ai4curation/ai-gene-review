description: >
  Atg16 is a core autophagy protein that functions as an essential structural component
  of the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex (E3-like ligase), which promotes the conjugation of
  Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) during autophagosome biogenesis. The protein
  contains an N-terminal Atg5-binding domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain required
  for homodimerization. In S. pombe, Atg16 localizes to the phagophore assembly site (PAS)
  in a manner dependent on Atg18a and is required for efficient macroautophagy.

    summary: >
      IEA annotation derived from UniProtKB-SubCell mapping. Atg16 is predominantly
      cytosolic in vegetative cells, with a fraction localizing to the PAS upon
      autophagy induction. High-throughput localization data from PMID:16823372
      confirms cytoplasmic localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      Cytoplasmic localization is consistent with the known biology of Atg16. The
      protein exists in the cytoplasm and is recruited to the PAS upon autophagy
      induction. This annotation correctly captures the baseline localization.

      IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping from the Autophagy keyword.
      Atg16 is a core autophagy protein essential for autophagosome biogenesis.
      Direct experimental evidence supports its role in macroautophagy [PMID:23950735].
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While not incorrect, this annotation is too general. More specific experimental
      evidence (IMP from PMID:23950735) supports a role in macroautophagy (GO:0016236),
      which is the correct specific term for this protein. The IEA should be retained
      but the more specific macroautophagy term (already annotated with IMP) better
      captures the function.

      IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping from the Protein Transport
      keyword. This appears to be an indirect annotation reflecting that autophagy
      involves protein transport to the vacuole/lysosome.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >
      Atg16 does not directly function as a protein transporter. Its role is as a
      scaffold/E3-like ligase component in the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex that promotes
      Atg8 lipidation. The protein transport annotation is too generic and does not
      capture the specific molecular function. Autophagy does involve protein
      transport to the vacuole, but this is not Atg16's specific function.

    summary: >
      IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword mapping from the Meiosis keyword.
      The Meiosis keyword was assigned to atg16 based on PMID:16169489, a high-throughput
      knockout screen that identified genes affecting meiotic chromosome segregation.
      However, this is a classic case of over-annotation: autophagy is upregulated during
      meiosis/sporulation in yeast, and loss of autophagy genes affects meiotic processes
      indirectly rather than through direct involvement in the meiotic cell cycle machinery.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This annotation represents an over-annotation resulting from the indirect effects
      of autophagy defects on meiosis. Atg16 is a core autophagy protein, not a meiotic
      cell cycle regulator. The screen in PMID:16169489 identified atg16 because autophagy
      is required during nutrient starvation that triggers meiosis/sporulation in fission
      yeast. The meiotic defects observed in atg16 mutants are secondary consequences of
      impaired autophagy, not evidence that Atg16 directly participates in meiotic cell
      cycle regulation. ATG genes are autophagy machinery components, and this keyword
      assignment conflates upstream/downstream relationships. The protein's core function
      is in autophagosome biogenesis, not meiotic regulation.
