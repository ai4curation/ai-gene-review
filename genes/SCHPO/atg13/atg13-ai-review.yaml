description: >-
  Atg13 is an essential regulatory scaffolding protein in the autophagy initiation complex
  in S. pombe. It contains an N-terminal HORMA domain that stabilizes through heterodimerization
  with Atg101, and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that mediates multivalent
  interactions with Atg1, Atg17, and other autophagy factors. The protein serves as a molecular
  hub that bridges the Atg1 serine/threonine kinase to the Atg17 scaffold, enabling formation
  of the Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex. Atg13 is regulated by phosphorylation; under nutrient-rich
  conditions it is hyperphosphorylated by TOR, suppressing autophagy, while nitrogen starvation
  leads to dephosphorylation and autophagy induction. The HORMA domain recruits Atg9 vesicles
  to the phagophore assembly site (PAS), which is critical for autophagosome formation.
  Atg13 is required for macroautophagy, mitophagy, and normal sporulation under nitrogen
  starvation conditions.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Atg13 functions as a key regulator of the Atg1 serine/threonine kinase. The binding
      of dephosphorylated Atg13 to Atg1 dramatically enhances Atg1 kinase activity, effectively
      activating the enzyme for substrate phosphorylation (Popelka & Mizushima, 2017, PMC5361603).
      The IBA annotation is phylogenetically inferred from S. cerevisiae Atg13 where this
      function is well characterized.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately reflects the core molecular function of Atg13. The deep
      research confirms that Atg13 binding rigidifies the Atg1 EAT domain and enhances
      kinase activity. While Atg13 acts more as a scaffolding activator than a classic
      regulator, the term "protein kinase regulator activity" appropriately captures the
      regulatory function. The IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive literature
      on the Atg1 complex.

      This is a clear over-annotation resulting from keyword mapping. Atg13 is
      an autophagy protein, not a meiotic cell cycle regulator. The gene name
      mug78 reflects its upregulation during meiosis, but this upregulation
      occurs because autophagy is induced during the nitrogen starvation that
      precedes meiosis/sporulation. The protein does not directly regulate the
      meiotic cell cycle - it provides recycled nutrients through autophagy
      that support the energy-intensive meiosis/sporulation process. The

      This IPI annotation indicates that Atg13 binds Atg1 (SPAC10F6.11c),
      Atg101 (SPAC25H1.03), itself (SPAC4F10.07c), and Atg17 (SPCC63.08c)
      based on coprecipitation experiments.

      While these protein-protein interactions are experimentally validated
      and functionally important, "protein binding" is an uninformative term.
      The study demonstrates specific interactions between Atg1 complex subunits.
      More informative terms would better capture the functional significance.

      This IMP annotation demonstrates that Atg13 is required for macroautophagy
