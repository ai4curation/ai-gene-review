description: >-
  Autophagy protein 5 (Atg5) is a core component of the autophagy machinery in S. pombe.
  It forms a covalent conjugate with Atg12 through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system
  (involving Atg7 as E1-like enzyme and Atg10 as E2-like enzyme). The Atg12-Atg5 conjugate
  further associates with Atg16 to form the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex, which functions as
  an E3-like ligase to promote lipidation of Atg8 with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
  a modification essential for autophagosome membrane formation. Atg5 localizes to the
  phagophore assembly site (PAS) through interactions with Atg18a. The gene is essential
  for macroautophagy, mitophagy, reticulophagy, and related selective autophagy pathways.
  The synonym mug77 (meiotically up-regulated gene 77) reflects transcriptional upregulation
  during meiosis, but autophagy itself is the core function of this protein.

      Atg5 is essential for autophagosome assembly as part of the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex.

      This annotation is derived from the UniProtKB keyword "Meiosis" (KW-0469),

      gene 77). The gene is transcriptionally upregulated during meiosis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation represents an over-annotation. The "Meiosis" keyword was assigned
      because atg5/mug77 is transcriptionally upregulated during meiosis, NOT because
      the protein directly participates in the meiotic cell cycle machinery. Atg5 is
      autophagy machinery that is upregulated during meiosis/sporulation because
      autophagy is required during this nutrient-stress condition to recycle cellular
      components. The deep research confirms: "The fission yeast atg5 deletion mutant
      cannot grow on minimal media or under nitrogen starvation conditions" and
      "autophagy-deficient mutants undergo partial sporulation" - this indicates
      autophagy supports sporulation by providing nutrients, not that Atg5 is a
      meiotic regulator. GO:0051321 implies direct involvement in meiotic progression,
      which is not the case for an autophagy component.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      Atg5 is an essential component of the macroautophagy machinery. It forms a covalent
      conjugate with Atg12 and associates with Atg16 to form the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex.
      This complex functions as an E3-like ligase that promotes lipidation of Atg8 with
      phosphatidylethanolamine, a modification essential for autophagosome membrane expansion.
      Multiple IMP annotations from PMID:19778961 and PMID:23950735 directly demonstrate
      the essential role in macroautophagy.
