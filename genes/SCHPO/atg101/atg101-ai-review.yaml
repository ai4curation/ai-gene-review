description: >-
  Atg101 is an essential autophagy initiation factor that functions as a
  structural stabilizer of Atg13 within the Atg1 kinase complex. The protein
  contains a HORMA domain that adopts an O-Mad2-like open conformation and
  forms a constitutive heterodimer with Atg13, stabilizing the intrinsically
  unstable HORMA domain of Atg13. Atg101 is required for autophagosome
  formation during nitrogen starvation and is essential for macroautophagy.
  It localizes to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) upon starvation induction.
  The protein also contains a conserved WF finger motif responsible for
  recruiting downstream factors to the autophagosome formation site. Atg101
  was originally identified as mug66 (meiotically up-regulated gene 66) but
  its core function is in autophagy machinery, not direct meiotic regulation.
  The meiotic and sporulation phenotypes observed in atg101 mutants are
  secondary consequences of defective autophagy during nitrogen starvation,
  which is required for mating and sporulation in S. pombe.

    summary: >-
      Atg101 interacts with Atg13, which is part of the Atg1 kinase complex.
      The Atg1 kinase complex includes the serine/threonine kinase Atg1, and
      Atg101 is a component of this complex (PMID:26030876, PMID:28976798).
      However, Atg101 does not directly bind Atg1 kinase; instead it binds
      Atg13 via HORMA domain interactions. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically
      inferred and is reasonably accurate given the association with the kinase
      complex, though the actual molecular function is more accurately described
      as stabilizing Atg13.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is acceptable as Atg101 is indeed a component of the Atg1
      kinase complex and interacts with complex members. While the direct
      interaction is with Atg13 rather than Atg1, the term 'protein kinase
      binding' encompasses indirect association within a kinase complex.

      This annotation is derived from UniProt keyword mapping. While autophagy
      does involve transport of cytoplasmic materials to the vacuole, the term
      'protein transport' is too general and does not accurately capture
      Atg101's function. Atg101 is not a transport factor per se; it is a
      structural component of the autophagy initiation complex.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is an over-generalization. Atg101 does not function
      directly in protein transport. Its role is in stabilizing Atg13 and

      This annotation is derived from UniProt keyword 'Sporulation'. The
      atg101 gene was originally identified as mug66 (meiotically up-regulated
      gene 66). However, the sporulation defect in atg101 mutants is a
      secondary consequence of defective autophagy. During nitrogen starvation
      in S. pombe, mating is triggered and followed by meiosis and sporulation.
      Autophagy mutants show mating defects because they cannot supply enough
      nitrogen intracellularly. Atg101 is not a sporulation-specific factor.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The sporulation phenotype is an indirect consequence of defective
      autophagy during nitrogen starvation, not a direct function of Atg101.
      The mating defect of autophagy mutants is attributed to an inability
      to supply enough nitrogen intracellularly through autophagy. This is
      a classic case of over-annotation based on phenotype rather than
      direct molecular function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from UniProt keyword 'Meiosis'. The gene
      was originally named mug66 (meiotically up-regulated gene 66) because
      its expression is induced during meiosis. However, Atg101 is not a
      meiotic regulator. It is an autophagy factor. The meiotic/mating
      phenotype observed in atg101 mutants is a secondary consequence of
      defective autophagy. During nitrogen starvation in S. pombe, autophagy
      is required to provide intracellular nitrogen for mating and subsequent
      meiosis. ATG genes are autophagy machinery components, not meiotic
      regulators. Autophagy is upregulated during meiosis/sporulation, which
      led to the original mug66 designation, but this reflects transcriptional
      regulation rather than direct function in meiosis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear case of over-annotation. The meiotic phenotype is an
      indirect consequence of the autophagy defect. Atg101 is a core autophagy
      factor, not a meiotic cell cycle regulator. The mating defect of
      autophagy mutants is attributed to inability to supply nitrogen
      intracellularly through autophagy, not to a direct role in meiosis.
      The SPKW annotation conflates transcriptional upregulation during

    ORFeome cloning and global analysis of protein localization in the fission
    yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
  findings:
    - statement: High-throughput localization study detected Atg101 in nucleus and cytosol

        Next, we determined the localization of 4,431 proteins, corresponding to approximately 90% of the fission yeast proteome, by tagging each ORF with the yellow fluorescent protein.

  title: Global analysis of fission yeast mating genes reveals new autophagy factors.
  findings:
    - statement: First experimental evidence that atg101 is required for autophagy in S. pombe
      supporting_text: >-
        In addition, we found that atg6, atg11, atg17, and atg101 are also required for CFP-Atg8 processing, thus providing for the first time evidence that they are required for autophagy.
    - statement: Atg101 localizes to PAS upon nitrogen starvation
      supporting_text: >-
        Co-expressing other autophagy proteins tagged with YFP in the CFP-Atg8 strain showed that 14 Atg proteins and Ctl1 colocalized with Atg8 on the punctate structure (Figure 3A).
    - statement: Mating defect of autophagy mutants is due to inability to supply nitrogen intracellularly
      supporting_text: >-
        The mating defect of autophagy mutants, which is attributed to an inability to supply enough nitrogen intracellularly, was only discovered during a focused study on these mutants [3].

        Atg101 has a Hop1, Rev7 and Mad2 (HORMA) architecture similar to that of Atg13.
    - statement: WF finger motif recruits downstream factors
      supporting_text: >-
        Mutational studies revealed that Atg101 is responsible for recruiting downstream factors to the autophagosome-formation site in mammals via a newly identified WF finger.

  title: Conserved and unique features of the fission yeast core Atg1 complex.
  findings:
    - statement: Atg101 interacts with HORMA domain of Atg13
      supporting_text: >-
        Atg101 interacts with the HORMA domain of Atg13 and this enhances the stability of both proteins.
    - statement: Atg101 does not bind Atg17 directly
      supporting_text: >-
        Atg101 does not bind Atg17.

    - statement: Comprehensive review of Atg101 function in autophagy initiation
core_functions:
- description: >-
    Atg101 is essential for macroautophagy in S. pombe. Deletion of atg101
    completely blocks CFP-Atg8 processing, indicating that autophagosome
    formation cannot occur without Atg101 (PMID:23950735). The protein
    functions as a structural stabilizer of Atg13 within the Atg1 kinase
    complex, which is the primary autophagy initiation complex.
