    summary: IBA annotation correctly identifies ER localization, consistent with comprehensive evidence from recent studies and UniProt annotation
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The ER localization is well-supported across multiple lines of evidence. The deep research document states "Bst1 localizes primarily to two distinct cellular compartments within the secretory pathway the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi apparatus" and "Within the ER, the protein exhibits a characteristic distribution pattern extending from the nuclear envelope ER to peripheral ER tubules and sheets" [bst1-deep-research-perplexity.md]. UniProt annotation confirms "Endoplasmic reticulum membrane" localization [bst1-uniprot.txt]. The IBA phylogenetic inference is supported by conservation of this localization across orthologs including mammalian PGAP1 and budding yeast Bst1 [bst1-deep-research-perplexity.md].

  review:
    summary: While technically correct, this general deacylase activity term is too broad and should be replaced with the more specific GO:0050185 (phosphatidylinositol deacylase activity) that accurately reflects the enzyme's substrate specificity
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The IBA annotation uses a very general molecular function term that lacks informative value about the actual biochemical function. Bst1 specifically catalyzes "removal of inositol-linked acyl chains from GPI-anchored proteins" [bst1-deep-research-perplexity.md], not general deacylation. UniProt records the function as "GPI inositol-deacylase" with EC 3.1.-.- [bst1-uniprot.txt]. The deep research extensively documents that "The primary enzymatic function of Bst1 is the catalysis of inositol deacylation, a critical step in the post-translational modification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins" and "Bst1 catalyzes the hydrolytic removal of this inositol-acyl chain" [bst1-deep-research-perplexity.md]. Note that there is already an IBA annotation in the full GOA for GO:0050185 (phosphatidylinositol deacylase activity), which is the appropriate specific term.

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This very general molecular function term from UniProt "Hydrolase" keyword is technically accurate since Bst1 is a serine hydrolase, but provides minimal informative value. The deep research describes "The catalytic mechanism of Bst1 and its human ortholog PGAP1" involving "a serine hydrolase lipase domain" with "serine hydrolase-type catalysis" [bst1-deep-research-perplexity.md]. However, this general term should be superseded by the specific GO:0050185 (phosphatidylinositol deacylase activity). This represents over-annotation up the hierarchy.

      supporting_text: "The accumulation of the cis-Golgi marker protein Anp1 at the nuclear ER in bst1 mutants specifically demonstrates that early ER-to-Golgi transport is defective"
    - statement: Bst1 is required for cytokinesis
      supporting_text: "In bst1 mutants, this constriction is substantially prolonged to approximately 78 minutes"
