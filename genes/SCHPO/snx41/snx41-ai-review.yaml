description: >-
  Sorting nexin-41 (SNX41/Mug186) is a member of the sorting nexin family containing a PX domain
  and BAR domain. It functions as a core component of heterodimeric SNX-BAR complexes that mediate
  retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi and promote selective autophagy processes
  including pexophagy. The protein localizes to endosomal compartments and
  the phagophore assembly site (PAS) through PI3P binding via its PX domain. While originally
  identified as a meiotically up-regulated gene (mug186), its upregulation during meiosis/sporulation
  reflects the increased autophagy that occurs during this developmental transition rather than
  a direct role in meiotic cell cycle regulation.

      SNX41 localizes to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) during nitrogen starvation.
      The deep research extensively documents this localization, stating that SNX41
      "localizes to endosomal compartments enriched in PI3P and the phagophore assembly
      site (PAS) in yeast cells" and that "SNX41 additionally localizes to punctate
      structures that associate with or are adjacent to autophagosomes."
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence showing PAS localization
      of SNX4 subfamily proteins during starvation. The PX domain mediates PI3P-dependent
      membrane targeting to PI3P-enriched pre-autophagosomal membranes. This represents
      a core aspect of SNX41 function in autophagy.

      SNX41 is involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to Golgi based on
      sequence orthology (ISO) with S. cerevisiae Snx41 (SGD:S000002833). This is
      a core function extensively documented in the deep research.

      This biological process annotation is core to SNX41 function and is

  review:
    summary: >-
      SNX41 is implicated in pexophagy (selective autophagy of peroxisomes) based
      on phylogenetic inference and extensive studies in related fungi. The deep
      research states that "SNX41 participates in selective autophagy pathways,
      particularly in the degradation of peroxisomes through a process termed
      pexophagy (peroxisomal autophagy)."
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Pexophagy is a well-documented function of SNX41 orthologs. The deep research
      extensively documents pexophagy function: "The involvement of SNX41 in pexophagy
      has been demonstrated through studies in both budding yeast and the rice blast
      fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, where SNX41-deletion mutants show defective pexophagy."
      UniProt also notes "May be required for cytoplasm to vacuole transport (Cvt) and
      pexophagy." This is a core selective autophagy function that should be annotated.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What are the specific cargo proteins sorted by Snx4-Snx41 complexes in S. pombe, and how do they compare to budding yeast Snx4-Snx41 cargo such as Atg27?
  - question: Does S. pombe snx41 have distinct pexophagy functions, or is pexophagy primarily mediated by other Atg20/Atg24 family members in fission yeast?

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Pexophagy assays in S. pombe snx41 mutants to confirm pexophagy function. This would
      provide direct evidence for pexophagy function in fission yeast, currently inferred
