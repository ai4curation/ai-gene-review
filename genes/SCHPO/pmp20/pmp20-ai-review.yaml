description: >-
  Peroxiredoxin homolog pmp20 (SPCC330.06c) in S. pombe, belonging to the Prx5
  subfamily of peroxiredoxins (PANTHER PTHR10430:SF39). Unlike most members of
  the broader PTHR10430 family (which are active peroxidases), pmp20 has lost
  peroxidase activity due to absence of the resolving cysteine residue. Kim et
  al. (PMID:20356456) showed that recombinant pmp20 has no
  thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity and no glutathione peroxidase
  activity, but does inhibit thermal aggregation of citrate synthase,
  indicating weak chaperone (holdase) activity. This contrasts sharply with
  orthologs in the main SF16 subfamily such as C. boidinii CbPmp20
  (PMID:11278957, active glutathione peroxidase essential for peroxisomal ROS
  detoxification) and H. polymorpha Pmp20 (PMID:18694816, whose deletion
  causes peroxisomal rupture and necrotic cell death). S. pombe pmp20 thus
  represents a case of neo-functionalization within the peroxiredoxin family,
  shifting from peroxidase to chaperone function. This is consistent with the
  broader observation that hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins can switch to
  chaperone/holdase activity; pmp20 appears to have constitutively adopted this
  alternative function. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed pmp20 has only one
  cysteine (C43) with no resolving-cysteine equivalent
  (file:SCHPO/pmp20/pmp20-bioinformatics/RESULTS.md). Forms homodimers that
  are disulfide-linked upon oxidation. Localized to cytosol and nucleus
  (PMID:16823372); peroxisomal and mitochondrial localization inferred from
  orthologs (IBA). The PTHR10430 family deep research
  (file:interpro/panther/PTHR10430/PTHR10430-deep-research-falcon.md) cautions
  that GO annotations should not be naively propagated across peroxiredoxin
  subfamilies without active-site profiling, as mechanistic diversity within
  the family is extensive.

      While many Prx5 subfamily members are active peroxidases, pmp20
      specifically lacks the resolving cysteine and has no

      states it "may act as a chaperone rather than a peroxidase." The IBA
      inference from functional orthologs does not apply well here since
      pmp20 has diverged from the canonical peroxidase function.

      IDA annotation for unfolded protein binding. GO:0051082 is proposed for
      obsoletion. Based on direct assay showing weak chaperone activity
      (thermal aggregation prevention). UniProt also has an IC annotation
      for GO:0042026 (protein refolding) from PomBase, but the actual
      experimental assay measured prevention of aggregation (holdase-type),
      not active refolding.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. PMID:20356456 demonstrated that pmp20
      inhibits thermal aggregation of citrate synthase (a holdase/chaperone
      assay), with weaker activity than S. pombe TPx (tpx1). The
      appropriate replacement is GO:0044183 "protein folding chaperone."
      This is consistent with the broader observation from family-level
      analysis (file:interpro/panther/PTHR10430/PTHR10430-deep-research-falcon.md)
      that hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins can switch to chaperone/holdase
      activity; pmp20 appears to have constitutively adopted this
      alternative function due to loss of the resolving cysteine. Note that
      the UniProt record also carries GO:0042026 (protein refolding) via IC

      Hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins can switch to chaperone/holdase activity,
      representing a functional divergence from simple detoxification.
    supporting_text: >-
      Reduced forms favor decamer/dodecamer assemblies, disulfide forms
      favor dimers, and hyperoxidized forms can produce high-molecular-weight
      species associated with chaperone-like (holdase) activity.

- description: >-
    Weak protein folding chaperone. Despite belonging to the peroxiredoxin
    family (Prx5 subfamily, PANTHER PTHR10430:SF39), pmp20 has lost the
    canonical peroxidase function due to absence of the resolving cysteine.
    It inhibits thermal aggregation of citrate synthase, indicating
    holdase-type chaperone activity, though weaker than the S. pombe TPx
    (tpx1). This represents a neo-functionalization within the peroxiredoxin
    family: orthologs such as C. boidinii CbPmp20 (PMID:11278957) and H.
    polymorpha Pmp20 (PMID:18694816) are active peroxidases essential for
    peroxisomal integrity, while S. pombe pmp20 has constitutively shifted
    to chaperone function, paralleling the redox-state-dependent
    chaperone/holdase switch observed in hyperoxidized typical 2-Cys
    peroxiredoxins.

      Ortholog studies demonstrate conserved peroxidase function in other
      yeast Pmp20 proteins while S. pombe pmp20 has diverged.
