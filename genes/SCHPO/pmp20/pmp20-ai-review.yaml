description: >-
  Peroxiredoxin homolog pmp20 in S. pombe. Despite belonging to the
  peroxiredoxin family (Prx5 subfamily), pmp20 lacks the resolving cysteine
  residue and has no thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity. Instead, UniProt
  states it "may act as a chaperone rather than a peroxidase" and shows "weak
  chaperone activity" (PMID:20356456). Forms homodimers that are disulfide-linked
  upon oxidation. Lacks glutathione peroxidase activity (confirmed by NOT
  annotation). A reproducible bioinformatics analysis found only one cysteine
  (C43) in pmp20 and no resolving-cysteine equivalent versus active controls,
  consistent with loss of thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase function
  (file:SCHPO/pmp20/pmp20-bioinformatics/RESULTS.md). Localized to cytoplasm,
  nucleus, and possibly peroxisome and mitochondria by phylogenetic inference.

      The protein is named "peroxisomal membrane associated protein 20" and
      peroxisomal localization is inferred from phylogenetic analysis of

      demonstrated peroxisomal localization.

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While many Prx5 subfamily members are active peroxidases, pmp20
      specifically lacks the resolving cysteine and has no
      thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity (PMID:20356456). UniProt
      states it "may act as a chaperone rather than a peroxidase." The IBA
      inference from functional orthologs does not apply well here since
      pmp20 has diverged from the canonical peroxidase function.

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Although pmp20 lacks peroxidase activity, its weak chaperone activity
      may still contribute to oxidative stress responses. The IBA annotation
      from orthologs is plausible but not a core function for this protein
      given its divergent activity.

      Pmp20 lacks the resolving cysteine and has no thioredoxin-dependent

      UniProt explicitly states "Has no thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase
      activity" (PMID:20356456). The IBA inference from active peroxiredoxin
      orthologs is misleading for this particular protein.

      Given the lack of peroxidase activity, antioxidant activity is

    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is being obsoleted. PMID:20356456 demonstrated that pmp20
      has weak chaperone activity but no peroxidase activity. UniProt states
      "May act as a chaperone rather than a peroxidase. Shows weak chaperone
      activity." The appropriate replacement is GO:0044183 "protein folding
      chaperone." Note that the chaperone activity is described as weak and
      this appears to be the primary function of pmp20 given its loss of
      peroxidase activity.
