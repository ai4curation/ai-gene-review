description: >-
  Tim10 is a small Tim family protein that functions as a subunit of the heterohexameric Tim9-Tim10
  chaperone complex (3:3 stoichiometry) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). The complex
  acts as an ATP-independent chaperone that binds hydrophobic precursor proteins, particularly
  mitochondrial carrier family proteins (SLC25/ADP-ATP carrier type), as they emerge from the TOM
  complex in the outer membrane and escorts them to the TIM22 translocase for insertion into the
  inner membrane. Tim10 contains a characteristic twin CX3C motif that forms two intramolecular
  disulfide bonds in the oxidizing IMS environment. The Tim9-Tim10 hexamer adopts a six-bladed
  alpha-propeller structure with tentacle-like helices that engage hydrophobic client proteins.
  Function inferred from highly conserved small Tim biology across fungi and metazoans

    summary: >-
      This annotation places Tim10 as part of the TIM22 complex. While Tim9-Tim10 does transiently
      associate with TIM22 to deliver substrates, the soluble Tim9-Tim10 hexamer is primarily
      localized in the IMS as a distinct chaperone complex, not as a permanent subunit of TIM22.
      The GO term GO:0042719 (mitochondrial intermembrane space chaperone complex) more accurately
      describes the primary location of Tim10. The TIM22 complex definition explicitly mentions
      Tim9-Tim10-Tim12 as peripheral components, so this annotation is technically defensible but
      may be misleading about the primary localization [PMID:16387659, PMID:14726512,

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    Is there direct experimental evidence for Tim10 function in S. pombe, or is all
    functional annotation based on inference from S. cerevisiae and other organisms?
    The deep research and literature review found no S. pombe-specific experimental
    studies on Tim10. All functional understanding is inferred from conserved small
    Tim biology in other organisms.

- question: >-
    Does S. pombe Tim10 have additional functions beyond carrier protein chaperoning,
    such as roles in respiratory complex assembly as seen for some human small TIMs?
    Recent work (Anderson et al. 2023) showed human Tim8a/8b/13 have roles in Complex IV
    assembly. It would be interesting to know if S. pombe small Tims have similar
    expanded functions.

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Generate S. pombe tim10 deletion or temperature-sensitive mutants to assess
    essentiality and phenotypes in fission yeast. Tim9 and Tim10 are essential in
    S. cerevisiae but this has not been directly demonstrated in S. pombe. Mutants
    are expected to be lethal or show severe mitochondrial carrier protein import defects.
  hypothesis: >-
    Tim10 is essential for viability in S. pombe due to its conserved role in
    mitochondrial carrier protein import.

- description: >-
    Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of S. pombe Tim10 to identify
    interaction partners and client proteins. This would confirm Tim9-Tim10 complex
    formation and identify specific substrates in S. pombe. Expected to co-purify
    with Tim9 and mitochondrial carrier proteins.
  hypothesis: >-
    S. pombe Tim10 forms a conserved hexameric complex with Tim9 and interacts with
    mitochondrial carrier family proteins as clients.
