## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9UTE9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit tim10;
- **Gene Information:** Name=tim10; ORFNames=SPAC222.03c;
- **Organism (full):** Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain 972 / ATCC 24843) (Fission yeast).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the small Tim family. .
- **Key Domains:** Tim10-like. (IPR004217); Tim10-like_dom_sf. (IPR035427); zf-Tim10_DDP (PF02953)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "tim10" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Schizosaccharomyces pombe (strain 972 / ATCC 24843) (Fission yeast).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'tim10' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **tim10** (gene ID: Tim10, UniProt: Q9UTE9) in SCHPO.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive research report: tim10 (UniProt Q9UTE9) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Identity and family: tim10 (SPAC222.03c) in S. pombe encodes a small Tim family protein with a Tim10-like domain (pfam PF02953), characteristic of soluble IMS chaperones that assist hydrophobic precursors to the TIM22 translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (UniProt description consistent with the small Tim family). As a small Tim, Tim10 typically partners with Tim9 to form a heterohexameric Tim9–Tim10 complex that acts in the IMS. While direct S. pombe studies were not retrieved, these features are deeply conserved across fungi and metazoans. Elder (2023) synthesizes the small Tim field and TIM22 pathway, providing primary citations to structural and mechanistic work on Tim9–Tim10 complexes. URL: https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)
- Localization: Small Tims (including Tim9/Tim10) are soluble IMS proteins. They chaperone hydrophobic segments of multi‑pass mitochondrial proteins between the TOM complex in the outer membrane and the TIM22 translocase in the IMM. The IMS localization and chaperone role are supported by multiple primary sources reviewed in Elder (2023) and by 2023 EMBO Reports work on human small TIMs. URL: https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023); https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (Published online Jun 5, 2023). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172, anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2)
- Molecular function: The Tim9–Tim10 hexameric chaperone binds and stabilizes hydrophobic precursors (e.g., mitochondrial carrier family, SLC25) in the IMS, delivers them to the TIM22 translocase, often docking via Tim12, and facilitates their insertion into the IMM. Early biochemical reconstitution showed TOM plus Tim9/Tim10 complexes suffice to support translocation of ADP/ATP carrier-type substrates, highlighting the core chaperone function. URLs: Elder 2023 thesis (compiles Vasiljev et al. 2004 Mol Biol Cell https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E03-05-0272). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)
- Complex membership and stoichiometry: In yeast, the soluble small Tim complexes in the IMS form heterohexamers: Tim9–Tim10 (3:3) and Tim8–Tim13 (3:3); Tim12 associates at the membrane with TIM22. Tim9 and Tim10 are essential for viability in S. cerevisiae and function as the major carrier chaperone; Tim12 is bound to the TIM22 complex. Although not shown directly for S. pombe here, the complex architecture is considered conserved. URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4)
- Structural/biophysical features and domains: Small Tim subunits share a conserved twin Cys motif (twin CX3C), forming two intramolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the fold in the IMS. The hexamer adopts a ring-like six-bladed alpha-propeller with “tentacle” helices thought to engage clients. Earlier work proposed Zn2+-binding by the CX3C motifs could contribute to folding in specific contexts (e.g., human Tim8/DDP1). URLs: https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Human small TIMs and broader roles: Anderson et al. (2023) demonstrated that human Tim8a, Tim8b, and Tim13 not only act as small TIM chaperones in the IMS but also serve as auxiliary assembly factors for Complex IV, expanding the functional repertoire of small TIMs beyond carrier import. This underscores the functional adaptability of small TIM family members across eukaryotes. URL: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (Published online Jun 5, 2023). (anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2)
- Updated mechanistic synthesis: Elder (2023) provides an integrative 2023 synthesis of structural and biochemical literature on small Tims and the TIM22 pathway, including high-resolution structural insights into the Tim9•Tim10 complex and functional reconstitution of carrier import, which together underpin current models for small Tim–mediated chaperoning and TIM22 insertion. URL: https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)
- Comparative systems emphasize small Tim complexity: Guillén et al. (2023 preprint) reported organism-specific variations in trypanosomes where multiple small Tim complexes interface with a divergent TIM complex (TbTIM17), illustrating modularity of small Tim assemblies and their docking to IMM translocases. Although this is a non-fungal system and a preprint, it highlights conserved principles of IMS chaperone–translocase cooperation relevant to inference in S. pombe. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.29.542777 (posted May 31, 2023). (guillen2023uniqueinteractionsand pages 28-32, guillen2023uniqueinteractionsand pages 1-5, guillen2023uniqueinteractionsand pages 11-15)

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Disease relevance and clinical genetics: The small Tim family is implicated in human mitochondrial disease. Mutations in TIMM8A (human Tim8a/DDP1) cause Mohr‑Tranebjærg (deafness–dystonia) syndrome, demonstrating that perturbations in small TIM biology lead to neuromuscular/neurodegenerative phenotypes. While not directly S. pombe–related, this human genetic evidence underscores the essential role of small TIM chaperones in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis, a conserved cellular requirement shared with fungi. URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009); https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (Jun 2023). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2, anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2)
- TIM22‑associated disease factors: The identification of AGK as a subunit of the human TIM22 complex links TIM22 dysfunction to Sengers syndrome; this helps contextualize how defects in the carrier import pathway manifest clinically and supports the importance of Tim9–Tim10 chaperoning upstream of TIM22. Elder (2023) cites Vukotic et al. (2017 Mol Cell) identifying AGK within the human TIM22 complex, connecting TIM22 pathway to disease. URL: https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Consensus role of small Tims as IMS chaperones: Authoritative syntheses concur that Tim9–Tim10 hexamers are core IMS chaperones for hydrophobic precursors destined for TIM22, stabilizing clients post‑TOM and guiding to the IMM for insertion. Anderson et al. (2023) reiterate IMS localization and chaperone functions of small TIMs in humans; Elder (2023) compiles structural and biochemical evidence; Petrakis et al. (2009) discuss ATP‑independent chaperoning, essentiality of Tim9/Tim10 in yeast, and Tim12’s docking role at TIM22. URLs: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (Jun 2023); https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023); https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009). (anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2, elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)
- Structural basis and domain logic: The conserved twin CX3C motif and the hexameric ring with tentacle helices provide a structural rationale for broad but selective binding to hydrophobic segments of clients, consistent with ATP‑independent chaperoning in the IMS redox environment. Petrakis et al. (2009) summarize these structural features and their functional implications. URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Chaperone complex size and composition: Small Tim chaperones exist as ~70 kDa heterohexamers (e.g., Tim9–Tim10 3:3, Tim8–Tim13 3:3); human cells encode six small TIMs (Tim8a, Tim8b, Tim9, Tim10a, Tim10b, Tim13), which assemble into analogous hexamers that deliver membrane proteins to TIM22. Anderson et al. (2023) and prior literature summarized in Petrakis (2009) and Elder (2023) report these values. URLs: https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202256430 (Jun 2023); https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009); https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023). (anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4, elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)
- Essentiality in fungi: Tim9 and Tim10 are essential for viability in S. cerevisiae, and a fraction of Tim9/Tim10 associates with the IMM‑bound TIM22 complex while Tim12 is exclusively associated with TIM22, delineating functional partitioning. This provides a strong basis for expecting essential or critical roles in S. pombe. URL: https://doi.org/10.1002/iub.235 (Sep 2009). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)

Organism‑specific note and verification of ambiguity
- We verified that the target is S. pombe tim10 (UniProt Q9UTE9; SPAC222.03c), a small Tim family protein with a Tim10‑like domain. Our literature scan did not identify S. pombe‑specific experimental papers on tim10; thus, specific phenotypes in S. pombe are inferred from conserved small Tim biology established in fungi and metazoans. We avoided conflating with similarly named genes in other organisms. URL: Elder 2023 (for conserved small Tim biology) https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.thesis.83542 (Jan 2023). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)

Detailed functional model for S. pombe Tim10 (inferred from conserved evidence)
- Primary function: Tim10 forms a heterohexamer with Tim9 in the IMS to chaperone hydrophobic precursors, especially SLC25 carrier proteins, from TOM to the TIM22 complex; docking may involve a Tim12‑like subunit at TIM22. This model is supported by reconstitution of carrier translocation with TOM plus Tim9/Tim10 and by extensive structural studies of the Tim9•Tim10 complex. URL: Elder 2023 (compiling Vasiljev 2004 Mol Biol Cell https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E03-05-0272; Webb 2006 Mol Cell https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2005.11.010; Weinhäupl 2018 Cell https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.039). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172)
- Substrates: The principal client spectrum includes mitochondrial carrier family proteins (e.g., ADP/ATP carrier) and other multi‑spanning IMM proteins. Different small Tim assemblies (Tim9–Tim10 vs Tim8–Tim13) have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities, with Tim9–Tim10 favoring carrier proteins.

- Localization: IMS, where the oxidizing milieu supports twin CX3C disulfide formation and ATP‑independent client binding and release. URL: Petrakis 2009 (Sep 2009); Anderson 2023 (Jun 2023). (petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 2-4, anderson2023humantim8atim8b pages 1-2, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)
- Pathway context: TIM22 carrier translocase in the IMM receives the small Tim–bound clients and inserts them laterally. Small Tim complexes also transiently associate with the TIM22 machinery, mediated by a membrane‑proximal small Tim (Tim12 in budding yeast). URLs: Elder 2023 (Jan 2023); Petrakis 2009 (Sep 2009). (elder2023structurefunctionand pages 168-172, petrakis2009mitochondrialatp‐independentchaperones pages 1-2)

Limitations and open questions
- Species‑specific knowledge gap: Direct genetic, proteomic, or structural analyses of S. pombe tim10 were not located in this search, and most detailed mechanistic/structural insights derive from S. cerevisiae and metazoan systems. Nonetheless, the deep conservation of small Tim domain architecture, complex stoichiometry, IMS localization, and TIM22 pathway logic supports the assignments above for S. pombe Tim10.

Summary
- The S. pombe gene tim10 (Q9UTE9; SPAC222.03c) encodes a small Tim family protein localized to the mitochondrial IMS, forming a Tim9–Tim10 heterohexamer that functions as an ATP‑independent chaperone to deliver hydrophobic multi-pass precursors—especially mitochondrial carrier proteins—to the TIM22 translocase for insertion into the IMM, a model strongly supported by conserved evidence from fungi and metazoans. Structural hallmarks (twin CX3C motif/disulfides; Tim10-like domain) and essential roles (by analogy to yeast) underpin its core function in mitochondrial protein biogenesis. Recent 2023 work extends small TIM biology to additional roles (e.g., Complex IV assembly in human cells), highlighting the broader significance of this protein family in mitochondrial proteostasis.
