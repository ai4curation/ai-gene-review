description: >-
  Atg38 is an essential subunit of the autophagy-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K)
  complex I in fission yeast. The protein contains an N-terminal MIT domain that mediates interaction
  with other complex I subunits and a C-terminal coiled-coil homodimerization domain. In S. pombe,
  Atg38 uniquely contains an Atg8-family-interacting motif (AIM) that establishes a positive feedback
  loop by binding lipidated Atg8 at the phagophore assembly site, enhancing PtdIns3K complex I
  recruitment and autophagosome formation efficiency. The protein is required for nitrogen
  starvation-induced autophagy. The alternative name mug167 (meiotically up-regulated gene 167)
  reflects transcriptomic identification but does not indicate a meiosis-specific function; rather,
  atg38 is a core autophagy component.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Atg38 localizes to both the cytosol and the phagophore assembly site (PAS). The UniProt
      record states subcellular location as "Cytoplasm, cytosol" in addition to the preautophagosomal
      structure membrane. This is supported by experimental evidence showing that Atg38 exists
      in a soluble cytoplasmic fraction when the C-terminal domain is disrupted.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The cytosol localization is correct as a baseline localization for Atg38. The deep research
      indicates that "under nutrient-rich conditions without autophagy induction, Atg38-GFP signals
      are detected on the vacuolar membrane in addition to the cytoplasm" and UniProt confirms
      cytosol as one of the subcellular locations.

    summary: >-
      Atg38 is an essential component of the autophagy machinery. The deep research and primary
      literature clearly establish that atg38 deletion mutants show severely compromised viability
      during nitrogen starvation and complete absence of starvation-induced autophagy.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While Atg38 is clearly involved in autophagy, the term GO:0006914 (autophagy) is quite broad.
      More specific experimental evidence demonstrates involvement in macroautophagy specifically.
      The more specific term GO:0016236 (macroautophagy) is already annotated with experimental
      evidence (IMP), so this broader IEA annotation is acceptable as a correct but less specific
      annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on the UniProt keyword "Meiosis" which was assigned because of
      the alternative gene name mug167 (meiotically up-regulated gene 167). However, this naming
      reflects transcriptomic identification context, not functional involvement in meiosis.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The deep research explicitly states: "the primary function of Atg38 is not meiosis-specific;
      rather, it represents a housekeeping component of the autophagy machinery that is essential
      for both vegetative autophagy and the nitrogen starvation response that precedes sexual
      differentiation. The dual naming convention reflects the different experimental contexts
      in which the gene was discovered." The connection to meiosis is purely circumstantial -
      the gene was named mug167 because it was found to be upregulated during meiosis in a
      transcriptomic screen, but this does not indicate a meiosis-specific function. The primary
      and well-characterized function of Atg38 is in autophagy. This represents a classic
      over-annotation based on naming rather than functional evidence.

  review:
    summary: >-
      PMID:31941401 demonstrated direct interaction between Atg38 and Atg8 via the AIM motif
      in Atg38. However, the term "protein binding" (GO:0005515) is uninformative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The annotation captures a real interaction (Atg38-Atg8 binding via AIM motif) but
      GO:0005515 is overly generic and provides no meaningful functional information. A more
      informative term would be one that captures the specific nature of this interaction.
      However, GO does not currently have a specific term for "Atg8 binding" or "AIM-mediated
      binding." The best approach would be to use a term that captures the structural or
      functional context of this binding. Given the constraints, this could be kept but marked
      as non-core, or replaced with a more informative complex membership annotation.
