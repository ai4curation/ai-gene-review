description: >-
  KdpB is the catalytic ATP-binding subunit of the KdpFABC high-affinity potassium
  uptake system in N. vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3338). As a P-type ATPase (EC 7.2.2.6),
  KdpB hydrolyzes ATP and forms an aspartyl-phosphate intermediate (Asp302) during
  the E1/E2 catalytic cycle, driving K+ translocation across the inner membrane.
  The KdpFABC complex is induced under severe K+ limitation and provides high-affinity
  K+ uptake (apparent Km ~2 uM). KdpB couples ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes
  that drive K+ transport through a ~40 A tunnel from the KdpA selectivity filter
  to the cytoplasmic release site in KdpB.

      KdpB is the catalytic subunit of the KdpFABC high-affinity K+ pump that drives
      potassium ion transmembrane transport. This annotation is correctly inferred
      from the GO:0008556 molecular function annotation via logical inference.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      KdpB is definitively involved in potassium ion transmembrane transport as the
      ATP-hydrolyzing catalytic subunit of KdpFABC. The UniProt function annotation
      explicitly states this is a high-affinity ATP-driven potassium transport system.
      This is the primary biological process for this protein.

      KdpB binds nucleotides (specifically ATP) as part of its P-type ATPase catalytic
      mechanism. This is correct but overly general - GO:0005524 (ATP binding) is
      also annotated and is more specific and informative.

      While technically correct (KdpB does bind nucleotides), this annotation is
      redundant with the more specific GO:0005524 (ATP binding) annotation. The
      protein specifically binds ATP at defined residues. For annotation parsimony,
      the more specific ATP binding term is preferred.

      Magnesium ion binding is essential for P-type ATPase catalytic function. The
      Mg2+ cofactor is required for ATP hydrolysis. UniProt HAMAP annotation identifies
      specific Mg2+ binding residues (positions 514 and 518) in KdpB. This represents

    summary: >-
      KdpB is the ATP-binding catalytic subunit of KdpFABC. ATP binding is essential
      for its P-type ATPase function. Multiple ATP binding residues are annotated
      in UniProt (339, 343, 371-378, 389). This is a core molecular function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ATP binding is fundamental to KdpB's function as a P-type ATPase. The protein
      hydrolyzes ATP to drive K+ transport. The catalytic reaction is: ATP + H2O +
      K+(out) = ADP + phosphate + K+(in) (EC 7.2.2.6). ATP binding is clearly a core
      molecular function that should be retained.

      KdpB is the catalytic subunit of the high-affinity K+ uptake system KdpFABC.

      Potassium ion transport is definitively the core biological process of KdpB.
      While GO:0071805 (potassium ion transmembrane transport) is more specific,

      GO:0008556 is the most specific and appropriate molecular function term for
