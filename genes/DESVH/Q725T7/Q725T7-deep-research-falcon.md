### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "kdpB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'kdpB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **kdpB** (gene ID: Q725T7, UniProt: Q725T7) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive Research Report: kdpB (UniProt Q725T7; DVU_3338) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

Identity verification and domain/family consistency
- Gene/protein identity: The target is kdpB from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3338), annotated as the ATP-binding/catalytic subunit of the high-affinity K+ pump KdpFABC, a hybrid complex that combines a K+ channel-like subunit (KdpA) with a P-type ATPase subunit (KdpB). Recent primary literature and reviews consistently define KdpB as the catalytic P-type ATPase subunit of the KdpFABC system, in line with the UniProt description for Q725T7 (P-type ATPase, EC 7.2.2.6; domains consistent with P-type ATPases) (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4). 
- Organismal context: Specific primary literature on kdpB in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3338) is limited. Given this, functional annotation is inferred from strong conservation of the KdpFABC system across bacteria and from P-type ATPase/domain conservation that matches UniProt annotations. Where organism-specific data are lacking, we base conclusions on well-supported mechanistic studies from model bacteria (e.g., E. coli) and on general regulatory paradigms that are broadly conserved (KdpDE, c-di-AMP) (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Complex and composition: KdpFABC is a hetero-oligomeric K+ uptake pump. KdpA forms the K+-selective path, KdpB is the catalytic P-type ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP and forms the aspartyl phosphate intermediate, KdpC is an accessory subunit, and KdpF is a small membrane protein that stabilizes the complex (KdpFABC). Small-protein reviews and recent mechanistic/structural work support these roles (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2). 
- Enzymatic class and mechanism: KdpB is a P-type ATPase catalytic subunit that drives K+ transport via the Post–Albers reaction cycle (E1/E2 transitions) and an aspartyl-phosphate intermediate on a conserved aspartate (Asp307 in E. coli KdpB). ATP binding/hydrolysis at the cytosolic N/P/A domains is coupled to conformational changes in the transmembrane region to move K+ across the membrane (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 16-18). 
- Substrate specificity: The transported substrate for the KdpFABC system is K+. Kdp is a high-affinity K+ uptake system induced under severe K+ limitation, distinct from lower-affinity, higher-capacity systems such as Ktr/Trk in many bacteria (nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4). 
- Cellular localization: KdpFABC is an inner-membrane complex; KdpA provides a membrane-embedded selectivity filter and KdpB’s transmembrane region contains the canonical ion-binding pocket typical of P-type ATPases (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Tandem serine–histidine kinase regulation by KdpD: In 2024, a Nature Communications study established that KdpD is a tandem serine–histidine kinase. Beyond the canonical HK function that activates KdpE to induce kdpFABC transcription under low K+, an N-terminal atypical serine kinase (ASK) domain in KdpD directly phosphorylates KdpB at Ser162 under high K+. This post-translational phosphorylation rapidly and apparently irreversibly inhibits KdpFABC activity in E. coli, preventing K+ toxicity. Full inhibition occurs within ~2 minutes upon K+ upshift; preventing the KdpB S162 phosphorylation (S162A) increases ATP hydrolysis ~6-fold. The KdpD ASK requires a Walker A/B nucleotide-binding module, and the ASK control mechanism varies among species (direct K+ sensing in E. coli; c-di-AMP control in some shorter KdpD variants). These findings substantially expand the regulatory framework for K+ homeostasis (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8) (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4). 
- Conduction pathway and turnover-state structures: A 2025 cryo-EM preprint captured E. coli KdpFABC in lipid nanodiscs under turnover, resolving an E1~P·ADP conformation at 2.1 Å. The data support K+ entry via the KdpA selectivity filter, passage through a ~40 Å tunnel parallel to the membrane, and occupancy of a canonical ion-binding site within KdpB’s transmembrane domain coincident with phosphorylation of KdpB Asp307. The tunnel appears water-filled proximally but hydrophobic and dewetted near the KdpA–KdpB interface, suggesting an energy landscape shaped for vectorial K+ transfer. Mutational and transport assays (SSME) support K+ flux through the tunnel and point to a low-affinity release site in KdpB for cytoplasmic release. These structural/functional data refine the coupling between KdpA selectivity and KdpB catalysis (bioRxiv, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 16-18). 
- c-di-AMP as a master regulator of cell volume and K+ uptake: A 2024 MMBR review synthesizes quantitative evidence that c-di-AMP broadly regulates potassium transport systems and cell volume across diverse bacteria, highlighting KdpFABC as a high-affinity K+ import system induced under severe K+ limitation and dependent on ATP hydrolysis by KdpB (MMBR, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00181-23) (). 
- c-di-AMP inhibits Kdp via KdpD and riboswitch: In Bacillus anthracis, c-di-AMP accumulation downregulates Kdp (and other K+ importers) by binding to KdpD and to a ydaO-type riboswitch, linking second-messenger signaling to virulence regulation via control of intracellular K+ (Microbiology Spectrum, Aug 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03786-23) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4). 
- Preprint precursor (2023): The 2023 preprint that preceded the 2024 Nature Communications paper similarly demonstrated KdpD’s ASK-dependent phosphorylation of KdpB S162 as a rapid inhibitory mechanism at high K+ and suggested species diversification in regulatory inputs (K+ vs c-di-AMP) (bioRxiv, Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405) (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 13-16, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 4-7, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Regulatory modules as biosensing/engineering targets: The KdpDE–KdpFABC axis and its newly discovered serine phosphorylation branch offer modular control points for synthetic biology and biosensing platforms responsive to K+ and to second messengers such as c-di-AMP. General frameworks on engineering bacterial transmembrane signaling underscore the practicality of rewiring two-component systems to alter outputs, including K+ homeostasis modules (Open Biology review, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.180023) (). 
- Pathogenesis and stress physiology: c-di-AMP’s inhibition of Kdp via KdpD and riboswitches links K+ homeostasis to virulence factor expression in pathogens (B. anthracis), suggesting translational routes to attenuate virulence by perturbing K+ uptake regulatory networks (Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03786-23) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4). 
- Environmental/physiological resilience: Comparative work in cyanobacteria highlights Kdp’s role in survival under trace K+ and during recovery from osmotic perturbations (slower, high-affinity role vs. Ktr’s rapid capacity), informing ecological modeling and bioprocess designs where K+ limitation is relevant (Journal of Bacteriology, 2015; https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.02276-14) (nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis
- KdpB catalytic role and KdpF stabilization: Expert reviews on small proteins emphasize KdpF’s stabilizing role in KdpFABC and reaffirm KdpB as the catalytic P-type ATPase subunit, consistent with mechanistic studies and structures (FEMS Microbiol Rev, Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuad064; FEMS Microbiol Rev, Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuad063) (nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2). 
- Expanded regulatory paradigm: The 2024 Nature Communications work introduces a paradigm wherein KdpD integrates K+ (and in some species c-di-AMP) to control KdpFABC both transcriptionally and post-translationally, ensuring rapid, energy-efficient adaptation to potassium repletion and averting toxicity. This dual-level control is likely widespread given the conservation of the KdpD ASK module across taxa (Nature Communications, Apr 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8) (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4). 
- Structural convergence of channel–pump partnership: Turnover-state cryo-EM and functional assays support a continuous K+ conduction path from KdpA’s selectivity filter to KdpB’s ion-binding site via a hydrophobic, partially dewetted tunnel, reconciling channel-like selectivity with P-type ATPase catalysis. This integrated mechanism likely generalizes across KdpFABC systems given the conserved architecture (bioRxiv, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 16-18).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Apparent affinity and induction regime: KdpFABC exhibits an apparent K+ affinity of ~2 µM and is expressed under extreme K+ limitation; it must be swiftly inhibited upon K+ repletion to avoid toxicity (Nature Communications, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8) (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4). 
- Rapid post-translational inhibition: In E. coli, KdpB Ser162 phosphorylation fully inhibits the pump within ~2 minutes of K+ increase (>~2 mM). Blocking this phosphorylation (S162A) yields ~6-fold higher ATPase activity versus wild type under the assay conditions, indicating the strength of this regulatory switch (Nature Communications, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8; bioRxiv, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405) (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 4-7, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4). 
- Catalytic intermediate and state: Turnover-state cryo-EM captured an E1~P·ADP conformation with phosphorylation on Asp307 of KdpB and clear density for K+ at the KdpA selectivity filter and the KdpB canonical site; map resolution 2.1 Å. Data collection: ~50,000 micrographs, total dose ~50 e/Å2; SSME distinguished binding vs transport currents in functional analysis (bioRxiv, 2025; https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 16-18). 
- c-di-AMP control of K+ transporters: Reviews and primary data support c-di-AMP as a master regulator of bacterial K+ homeostasis and cell volume, including repression of Kdp expression/activity in certain species via binding to KdpD and riboswitch elements (MMBR, 2024; Microbiology Spectrum, 2024) (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4).

Function, biological process, localization, and pathway (synthesis for DVU_3338)
- Primary function: kdpB encodes the catalytic P-type ATPase subunit of the KdpFABC high-affinity K+ uptake system. KdpB hydrolyzes ATP and cycles through E1/E2 conformations with a catalytic aspartyl phosphate, driving K+ translocation across the inner membrane. Substrate: K+ (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4). 
- Mechanism and conduction: K+ is selected in KdpA’s channel-like selectivity filter and delivered to the KdpB transmembrane ion-binding site via a ~40 Å tunnel; ATP hydrolysis by KdpB (E1~P·ADP state captured) drives conformational changes to translocate and release K+ to the cytoplasm (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 16-18). 
- Localization and complex requirements: The functional complex resides in the inner membrane and requires KdpA/B/C plus the small stabilizer KdpF. KdpB provides catalysis and coupling, KdpA provides selectivity, KdpC/F aid assembly/stability and proper coupling (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2). 
- Regulation: Under low K+, KdpD (HK) activates KdpE to induce kdpFABC transcription; under high K+, KdpD’s N-terminal ASK directly phosphorylates KdpB at S162 to rapidly inhibit the pump. In some bacteria, c-di-AMP modulates this KdpD serine-kinase branch or reduces kdp expression via KdpD/riboswitch binding, linking K+ homeostasis to broader physiology (Nature Communications, 2024; Microbiology Spectrum, 2024; MMBR, 2024) (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4). 
- Organism-specific note for D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3338): We found no direct experimental literature on kdpB from D. vulgaris Hildenborough in the retrieved 2023–2024 sources. Given the strong conservation of KdpFABC and P-type ATPase features, we infer that DVU_3338 functions analogously to KdpB orthologs in bacteria: the catalytic ATPase subunit of a high-affinity K+ pump localized to the inner membrane and regulated by KdpDE and potentially by c-di-AMP signaling via KdpD, especially under K+ limitation and osmotic stress. Future DV-specific work (transcriptomics/proteomics under K+ limitation or salt stress and targeted mutagenesis) would be needed to confirm regulatory and kinetic specifics in this sulfate-reducing bacterium (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 1-2, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4).

Ambiguity note
- The gene symbol kdpB is shared across bacteria and refers to the KdpFABC catalytic subunit; literature is extensive in model organisms (e.g., E. coli) but limited for Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. We therefore base the DVU_3338 functional annotation on conserved family/domain features and well-established KdpFABC mechanisms (silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 1-4, hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4, nanatani2015comparativeanalysisof pages 1-2).
