description: >-
  Cytosolic TrkA-like RCK (regulator of K+ conductance) regulatory subunit that gates
  a Trk/Ktr K+ uptake channel.
  Q72F06 contains RCK_N and RCK_C domains and forms an octameric gating ring that
  docks to an inner membrane
  TrkH/KtrB-type pore subunit. ATP binding promotes the active/open channel state
  while ADP promotes an
  inactive/closed state. Na+ binding stabilizes the ATP-bound active conformation.
  The second messenger
  c-di-AMP can bind the RCK domain and reduce K+ uptake capacity. Critically, Q72F06
  is the cytosolic
  REGULATOR of K+ transport, not the membrane pore itself - it does not directly transport
  ions but rather
  gates the associated membrane channel through nucleotide-dependent conformational
  changes.

        This BP annotation was inferred from the MF annotation GO:0008324 (transporter

        is the cytosolic RCK regulatory subunit, not the transmembrane pore. It regulates
        K+ transport rather
        than directly participating in it. A more appropriate annotation would be
        GO:1901379 (regulation of

        The protein regulates

        While Q72F06 is part of the K+ transport system, the InterPro-to-GO mapping
        does not distinguish between
        pore subunits that directly transport K+ and regulatory subunits that gate
        the channel. Q72F06 is the
        regulatory subunit and should be annotated to regulation of K+ transport.

        This MF annotation is incorrect for Q72F06. GO:0008324 describes "enables
        the energy-independent
        facilitated diffusion" of cations across membranes - an activity performed
        by channels and pores.
        Q72F06 lacks transmembrane domains and functions as a cytosolic regulatory

        MF term is GO:0015459 (potassium channel regulator activity) which describes

        Q72F06 has RCK domains (5-121 aa RCK_N, 138-221 aa RCK_C per UniProt) but
        no transmembrane segments.
        It cannot itself transport ions across membranes. Instead, it binds ATP/ADP
        and undergoes conformational
        changes that gate the associated TrkH/KtrB membrane channel. This is a classic
        channel regulator function.

        valS is an aminoacyl-tRNA

        annotation is also

        should be annotated more
