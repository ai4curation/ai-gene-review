### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q72BM9
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Potassium uptake protein, TrkA family {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS96084.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=DVU_1606 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS96084.1};
- **Organism (full):** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** K_chnl_dom. (IPR013099); NAD(P)-bd_dom_sf. (IPR036291); RCK_C. (IPR006037); RCK_C_sf. (IPR036721); RCK_N. (IPR003148)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Q72BM9" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Q72BM9' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Q72BM9** (gene ID: Q72BM9, UniProt: Q72BM9) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan (summary)
- Verify target identity and domains from the provided UniProt context and align with literature on Trk/Ktr systems.
- Synthesize current mechanistic understanding of Trk/Ktr (architecture, gating, ligands), emphasizing 2023–2024 sources.
- Map likely cellular localization and complex composition for DVU_1606 by homology.
- Summarize physiological roles, regulation by c-di-AMP, and quantitative parameters from recent studies.
- Note DVU-specific evidence and limitations.

Gene/protein verification and scope
- Identity: The target is DVU_1606 (UniProt Q72BM9) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, annotated as a TrkA-family potassium uptake protein with RCK (KTN) domains. This aligns with the canonical TrkA/KtrA cytosolic regulatory subunits that assemble with TrkH/KtrB membrane pores to mediate K+ uptake in bacteria (architecture detailed below). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in the retrieved literature; we proceed under the DVU_1606 annotation provided. Inference-based conclusions are made where DVU-specific data are lacking (see Limitations). (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Trk/Ktr potassium uptake systems: Two-component assemblies mediating low- to moderate-affinity K+ uptake that is primarily energized by the membrane potential. The membrane component (TrkH/KtrB/KtrD) forms the K+ permeation pathway, and the cytosolic component (TrkA/KtrA/KtrC) is a ring-like assembly of RCK (Regulator of Conductance of K+) domains that gates the pore in response to ligands. DVU_1606, as a TrkA-family protein with RCK_N and RCK_C domains, is most consistent with the soluble gating subunit. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)
- RCK/KTN domains: Cytosolic ligand-binding domains that assemble into an octameric gating ring (a tetramer of dimers). Ligand occupancy at RCK_N interfaces and conformational transitions in the ring couple to opening/closing of the membrane pore. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)
- Affinity/function: Trk/Ktr systems typically show low-affinity uptake (KM ~1 mM K+) and serve first-line osmoadaptive K+ import; high-affinity uptake in many bacteria is mediated by KdpFABC, an inducible K+ pump. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, osman2020therolesof pages 45-49)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- High-resolution architecture and gating mechanism: 2024 cryo-EM structures of Bacillus subtilis KtrAB (2.8 Å) show an octameric KtrA RCK ring bound to a dimeric KtrB pore. ATP-bound KtrA adopts a square-like active conformation; ADP-bound adopts a diamond-like inactive state. A Na+ ion binds at an intra-dimer site of ATP-bound KtrA, stabilizing the complex and synergistically enhancing K+ flux; gating involves a channel loop and helix elements under the selectivity filter. These structural transitions define how RCK ligands control pore gating. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48057-y (Nature Communications, May 2024). (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)
- c-di-AMP as master regulator of K+ homeostasis: A 2024 MMBR review synthesizes evidence that c-di-AMP binds many RCK/CBS-containing K+ transport regulators (including TrkA/KtrA/KtrC), with affinities spanning ~40 nM to low µM, and reduces K+ import by destabilizing regulator–pore interactions. Perturbing c-di-AMP causes predictable cell-volume phenotypes via altered K+ uptake. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00181-23 (MMBR, Jun 2024). (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)
- Direct c-di-AMP control of K+ importers: In Bacillus anthracis, elevated c-di-AMP diminishes expression and activity of K+ uptake systems via binding to RCK-containing subunits (e.g., KtrC) and to riboswitches (ydaO) upstream of transporter genes and by targeting KdpD. This links nucleotide signaling to reduced K+ uptake and diminished virulence factor expression. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03786-23 (Microbiology Spectrum, Aug 2024). (hu2024cdiampaccumulationimpairs pages 1-2)
- TrkA as a c-di-AMP receptor in vivo: In Streptococcus mitis, TrkA directly binds c-di-AMP and is required for growth under low K+. Loss of TrkA compromises growth and modulates cellular c-di-AMP levels, reinforcing TrkA’s role in c-di-AMP–mediated K+ control. URL: https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.001597 (Microbiology, Aug 2025). (vevik2025trkaofstreptococcus pages 1-2)

3) Cellular localization and complex composition (inference for DVU_1606)
- Localization and assembly: By homology to experimentally resolved complexes, DVU_1606 (TrkA-family RCK protein) is a cytosolic/peripheral protein that assembles into an octameric RCK gating ring associated with an inner-membrane K+ pore (TrkH/KtrB homolog) via cytosolic interfaces. The active transport relies on membrane potential; the RCK ring does not span the membrane. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)
- Likely complex composition: A functional Ktr/Trk complex comprises a TrkH/KtrB-type dimeric membrane pore and a TrkA/KtrA-type octameric regulator. DVU_1606 most plausibly partners with a TrkH/KtrB homolog encoded elsewhere in the D. vulgaris genome (specific locus organization not located in the retrieved evidence). (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)

4) Ligand regulation and RCK-mediated gating
- ATP/ADP: ATP binding to RCK_N intra-dimer interfaces stabilizes an activating “square” ring conformation; ADP stabilizes an inactivating “diamond” conformation, switching K+ flux on/off through mechanical coupling to the pore’s intramembrane gate. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)
- Na+ synergy: Na+ binds specifically to the ATP-bound RCK ring and synergistically enhances activation and complex stability, revealing an Na+-dependent allosteric site in KtrA. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)
- c-di-AMP: c-di-AMP binds to RCK/CBS domains in TrkA/KtrA-type proteins and typically decreases K+ import by weakening regulator–pore interaction or shifting the regulatory state; in vivo, TrkA can be a direct high-affinity c-di-AMP receptor required for low-K+ growth. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, vevik2025trkaofstreptococcus pages 1-2, hu2024cdiampaccumulationimpairs pages 1-2)
- Other ligands: RCK/KTN modules in K+ systems can also engage NAD(H) and divalent cations in some species; these have been reported to modulate gating states and complex stability, though their generality is system-dependent. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2)

5) Physiological roles, pathways, and quantitative data
- Core roles of K+: K+ is the predominant cytosolic cation essential for charge balance, pH homeostasis, enzyme function, and turgor. Upon osmotic upshift, rapid K+ uptake via Trk/Ktr systems restores cell turgor; excessive ionic strength is later mitigated by exchanging K+ for compatible solutes. Typical intracellular K+ levels are in the hundreds of millimolar (often ~300–1,000 mM, species- and condition-dependent). (osman2020therolesof pages 45-49, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)
- c-di-AMP—K+ axis and cell volume: Elevated c-di-AMP reduces K+ uptake and cell size and impairs growth under hypertonic stress; reduced c-di-AMP can lead to toxic K+ accumulation and lysis propensity. These phenotypes underscore c-di-AMP’s role as a master regulator of K+ homeostasis. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)
- Impact on virulence/fitness (cross-species evidence): In B. anthracis, increasing c-di-AMP down-regulates K+ importers (including Ktr/Kdp pathways) and diminishes toxin expression; manipulating K+ homeostasis affects pathogenic phenotypes. (hu2024cdiampaccumulationimpairs pages 1-2)

Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU)–specific notes
- Genome- and stress-level context: D. vulgaris Hildenborough is a model sulfate-reducing bacterium with a fully sequenced genome; potassium and osmotic stress responses are prominent in transcriptomic studies. However, within the retrieved evidence, no DVU_1606-specific operon mapping or direct transcriptomic modulation of DVU_1606 was identified. Therefore, for DVU_1606 (Q72BM9), function and localization are inferred from conserved TrkA/KtrA mechanisms and its domain architecture (RCK_N/RCK_C; NAD(P)-binding-like domain signatures). (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)
- Inference-based annotation: Given the RCK domain composition and TrkA-family annotation, DVU_1606 is best interpreted as the cytosolic regulatory subunit of a Trk/Ktr K+ uptake system in D. vulgaris Hildenborough, gating a cognate TrkH/KtrB-type membrane pore in response to ATP/ADP, Na+ and likely c-di-AMP. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)

Applications and real-world implementations
- Industrial and environmental microbiology: K+ uptake systems are central to osmoadaptation of anaerobes, influencing growth and stress resilience in bioreactors and subsurface environments where sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio spp. operate. Targeting or tuning K+ transport (e.g., via c-di-AMP signaling or nutrient regimes) is a plausible lever to modulate biofilm formation, robustness, and community interactions; mechanistic insight from structural studies (ATP/Na+ synergy) suggests avenues for rational modulation. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, hu2024cdiampaccumulationimpairs pages 1-2)
- Therapeutic microbiology (cross-species): Manipulating c-di-AMP–K+ networks affects virulence and stress survival in pathogens, illustrating translatable principles that could inform strategies in unrelated bacteria sharing Trk/Ktr regulation. (hu2024cdiampaccumulationimpairs pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)

Expert perspectives and synthesis
- Converging structural, biochemical, and physiological data now resolve a unified model: the RCK ring in TrkA/KtrA integrates adenine nucleotides and Na+ to set the gating state of the membrane pore, while c-di-AMP overlays a negative feedback that limits K+ influx and enforces cell-volume control. DVU_1606’s RCK architecture strongly supports this model as the basis of its function in D. vulgaris. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)

Relevant statistics and data (selected)
- KtrAB cryo-EM resolution and ligands: 2.8 Å structures for ATP- and ADP-bound states; Na+ identified at the RCK intra-dimer site, stabilizing ATP-bound KtrA and enhancing K+ flux. (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3)
- Typical Trk/Ktr affinity and role: Low-affinity uptake (~1 mM K+) functioning primarily under higher external K+; high-affinity uptake via Kdp under K+ limitation. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, osman2020therolesof pages 45-49)
- c-di-AMP binding range to RCK-type receptors: ~40 nM to ~8 µM across species/systems; binding generally lowers K+ import capacity. (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8)

Limitations and guidance for future DVU-specific work
- The literature retrieved here did not provide DVU_1606-specific experimental characterization (biochemistry, complex partner identification, or mutational phenotypes). We therefore explicitly label DVU_1606 functional statements as inference from conserved TrkA/KtrA biology and domain content. Focused genomic context analysis (operon mapping for DVU_1606 with a neighboring trkH/ktrB homolog) and condition-specific transcriptomics (salt/K+ stress) in D. vulgaris would be the next steps to solidify the annotation.
