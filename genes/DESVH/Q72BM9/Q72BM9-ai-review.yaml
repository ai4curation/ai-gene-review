description: >-
  DVU_1606 (Q72BM9) is a TrkA-family potassium uptake regulatory protein containing
  RCK_N and RCK_C domains. Based on structural homology to characterized KtrA/TrkA
  proteins from other bacteria, it functions as the cytosolic regulatory subunit of
  a Trk/Ktr K+ uptake system. The protein assembles into an octameric RCK gating ring
  that associates with a membrane-embedded TrkH/KtrB pore. ATP binding promotes an
  active square-like conformation that opens the pore for K+ flux, while ADP binding
  induces an inactive diamond-like conformation. Na+ binding at intra-dimer sites
  synergistically stabilizes the active state. The protein may also bind c-di-AMP,
  which typically reduces K+ import by destabilizing regulator-pore interactions.
  The core physiological role is regulation of K+ homeostasis and osmoadaptation.

      This annotation was inferred from GO:0008324 (transporter activity) via logical
      inference. However, Q72BM9 is NOT the membrane transporter itself but the
      cytosolic regulatory RCK subunit that gates the TrkH/KtrB pore. While the
      protein is involved in regulating cation transport, it does not itself
      participate in the transmembrane transport process. The annotation should be
      modified to reflect regulatory involvement rather than direct transport.

      TrkA/KtrA family proteins are cytosolic regulatory subunits that form octameric
      RCK gating rings to modulate the activity of membrane K+ pores (TrkH/KtrB).
      Cryo-EM structures of B. subtilis KtrAB at 2.8 A resolution demonstrate that
      KtrA forms an octameric ring bound to dimeric KtrB, with ATP/ADP binding
      controlling pore gating rather than direct transport (Chiang et al. 2024).
      The protein regulates K+ transmembrane transport but does not itself transport
      ions across the membrane.

      This annotation derives from UniProtKB subcellular location vocabulary mapping,
      which incorrectly predicts Q72BM9 as a multi-pass membrane protein based on
      Phobius transmembrane helix predictions. However, characterized TrkA/KtrA
      homologs are cytosolic proteins that associate with the membrane pore
      peripherally via protein-protein interactions, not as integral membrane
      proteins. The RCK domains (positions 127-350) are clearly cytosolic based on
      structural data from homologs.

      Structural biology of KtrA/TrkA proteins demonstrates they are cytosolic
      regulatory subunits. The 2024 cryo-EM structure of B. subtilis KtrAB shows
      KtrA as a cytosolic octameric ring that binds to the cytoplasmic face of the
      KtrB membrane pore. The RCK_N and RCK_C domains that comprise the functional
      core of this protein are well-established as cytosolic ligand-binding domains.
      While Phobius predicts two N-terminal transmembrane helices, the dominant
      functional domains are cytosolic, and the protein should be annotated to
      cytoplasm with peripheral association to the plasma membrane.

      This annotation from InterPro (IPR003148, IPR006037, IPR036721) captures the
      involvement of Q72BM9 in potassium ion transport. While the protein does not
      directly transport K+, it is an essential regulatory component of the K+
      uptake system. The term GO:0006813 is appropriately general (covering both
      direct transport and regulatory involvement) and is acceptable, though a more
      specific regulatory term would be more informative.
    action: ACCEPT

      GO:0006813 (potassium ion transport) describes the directed movement of K+
      ions by means of transporters or pores, which includes regulatory subunits
      that are essential for this process. TrkA/KtrA proteins are obligate components
      of the functional Trk/Ktr K+ uptake system, and without them the pore cannot
      be properly gated. The annotation is acceptable as it captures the biological
      process in which the protein participates, even though its specific role is
      regulatory rather than catalytic.

      This MF annotation from InterPro (IPR006037 - RCK_C) is an over-annotation.
      Q72BM9 is the regulatory RCK subunit, NOT the membrane transporter itself.
      RCK domains bind nucleotides (ATP/ADP) and undergo conformational changes
      that regulate the associated membrane pore, but they do not themselves
      enable transmembrane transport. The appropriate MF annotation would be
      potassium channel regulator activity or transporter regulator activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Transporter activity terms should be reserved for proteins that directly
      enable the movement of substrates across membranes. TrkA/KtrA RCK proteins
      regulate transporter activity by binding to and modulating the TrkH/KtrB
      membrane pore. The 2024 structural study demonstrates that KtrA binds ATP/ADP
      at RCK interfaces and undergoes square-to-diamond conformational transitions
      that mechanically gate the associated pore. This is regulator activity, not
      transporter activity. The most appropriate term is GO:0015459 (potassium
      channel regulator activity) which specifically describes proteins that bind
      to and modulate K+ channels/transporters.
