description: >
  DVU_0848 (Q72DT1) encodes an HdrA-like flavoprotein that is part of the cytosolic
  FlxABCD-HdrABC complex in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. This protein
  contains FAD/NAD-binding domains and 4Fe-4S clusters, functioning as the
  catalytic bifurcating/confurcating subunit of the Hdr-like complex. The complex
  couples the exergonic reduction of a heterodisulfide analog (likely involving
  DsrC) to drive endergonic ferredoxin reduction using NADH (electron bifurcation),
  or operates in reverse to combine electrons from reduced ferredoxin and NADH
  (confurcation). This redox-balancing activity is essential for ethanol metabolism
  and supports sulfate respiration in anaerobic conditions. Note: Despite
  superficial similarity in name, this is NOT QmoA (which is DVU_0851); this is
  an HdrA-like protein with distinct function in electron bifurcation.

    summary: >
      DVU_0848 is annotated as an oxidoreductase based on UniProt keyword mapping.
      The HdrA-like protein functions as a flavin-based electron bifurcating
      oxidoreductase, coupling NADH oxidation with ferredoxin reduction. The
      FAD_oxidored domain (PF12831) and FAD/NAD-binding architecture support
      this annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The oxidoreductase activity annotation is appropriate but general. DVU_0848
      functions as an electron-bifurcating/confurcating oxidoreductase within
      the FlxABCD-HdrABC complex. The protein contains FAD/NAD-binding domains
      consistent with oxidoreductase function (Pereira et al. 2011). While a more
      specific term would be preferable, no GO term exists for "electron bifurcating
      oxidoreductase activity" and the general oxidoreductase activity is accurate.

      Metal ion binding annotation is based on UniProt keyword mapping. The protein
      contains iron-sulfur clusters (4Fe-4S) which bind iron ions. This is a
      general annotation that captures the iron-sulfur cofactor binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      While accurate, this annotation is very general. The protein binds iron
      as part of its 4Fe-4S clusters which are essential for electron transfer
      function. The more specific annotation GO:0051539 (4 iron, 4 sulfur cluster
      binding) is also present and is more informative. This general annotation
      is subsumed by the more specific iron-sulfur cluster binding annotation
      but is not incorrect.

      This annotation is appropriate. HdrA-like proteins contain iron-sulfur

      The 4Fe-4S cluster binding annotation is based on UniProt keyword mapping.
      This is the most specific and informative of the iron-sulfur related

      This is an appropriate and specific annotation. The sequence contains
      the characteristic CxxCxxCxxxC motif pattern for 4Fe-4S cluster binding.
      The 4Fe-4S clusters participate in electron transfer during the bifurcating
      reaction, accepting and donating electrons between FAD and ferredoxin/NADH.

      This annotation derives from a large-scale AP-MS interactome study of

    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While the protein binding annotation is technically correct (DVU_0848 does
      interact with other proteins), GO:0005515 "protein binding" is not an
      informative annotation per GO curation guidelines. The interaction with
      DVU_0849 (the adjacent gene in the flxABCD-hdrABC operon) is expected as
      part of the Flx-Hdr complex. However, this should be annotated with a more
      specific binding term if available, or as part of a complex annotation.
      The actual biological role is forming part of the FlxABCD-HdrABC electron
      bifurcating complex.

  proposed_definition: >
    Catalysis of an electron bifurcation reaction in which electrons from a

    Electron bifurcation is a distinct mechanism of energy conservation in
