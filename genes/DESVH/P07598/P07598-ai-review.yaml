description: >-
  hydA (DVU_1769) encodes the large catalytic subunit of a periplasmic [FeFe]-hydrogenase (HydAB)
  in Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction
  2 H+ + 2 e- <-> H2 (EC 1.12.7.2), functioning primarily in H2 oxidation during dissimilatory
  sulfate reduction. The HydA subunit contains the catalytic H-cluster (a diiron center linked to
  a [4Fe-4S] subcluster) and two additional [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin-type clusters that mediate electron
  transfer. The physiological electron acceptor is Type I cytochrome c3 (TpI-c3), which shuttles
  electrons to membrane complexes (Hmc, Tmc, Qrc) for ultimate delivery to cytoplasmic sulfate
  reductases. The enzyme has high turnover with a Km for H2 of approximately 100 uM, is reversibly
  inhibited by CO, and can form an O2-protected inactive state likely involving sulfide ligation
  at the H-cluster. HydA forms a heterodimer with the small subunit HydB for full periplasmic
  [FeFe]-hydrogenase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      HydA contains multiple iron centers including three [4Fe-4S] clusters and a binuclear iron
      center at the H-cluster active site. X-ray crystallography at 1.6 A resolution (PMID:10368269)
      confirmed binding of iron ions through both the [4Fe-4S] clusters and the diiron active site.
      This annotation is accurate but less informative than the more specific 4Fe-4S cluster binding term.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is technically correct as confirmed by structural studies (PMID:10368269).
      HydA binds iron both in [4Fe-4S] clusters and in the binuclear H-cluster active site.
      However, this is a parent term of more specific annotations already present.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0008901 describes catalysis of the reaction "2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H+ = 2 oxidized
      ferredoxin + H2". While HydA does catalyze H2/proton interconversion, the physiological
      electron partner is NOT ferredoxin but rather Type I cytochrome c3 (TpI-c3). Literature
      consistently identifies cytochrome c3 as the native electron carrier for periplasmic
      [FeFe]-hydrogenase in D. vulgaris.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The reaction catalyzed is correct in principle (H2 interconversion), but the specified
      electron partner (ferredoxin) is incorrect for this periplasmic enzyme. The physiological
      electron carrier is cytochrome c3, not ferredoxin. GO:0047806 (cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase
      activity) describes "2 H2 + ferricytochrome c3 = 4 H+ + ferrocytochrome c3" which matches
      the physiological function of HydAB.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      GO:0016491 is a very high-level term for oxidoreductase activity. HydA is indeed an
      oxidoreductase (EC 1.12.7.2), catalyzing electron transfer between H2 and cytochrome c3.
      However, this term is too general and more specific hydrogenase activity terms should be used.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While technically correct, this is a high-level parent term. The annotation derives from
      UniProtKB keyword mapping and accurately captures the oxidoreductase nature of the enzyme.
      More specific terms (GO:0047806 cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase activity) should also be present
      to provide specificity.

      HydA is unambiguously localized to the periplasmic space. This is supported by biochemical

      requirement for interaction with periplasmic cytochrome c3.

      Periplasmic localization is well-established from multiple lines of evidence including

      GO:0046872 is a very general term for metal ion binding. HydA binds iron in multiple

      Technically correct as HydA binds iron ions extensively. This is a parent term of
      GO:0005506 (iron ion binding) which is also annotated. The annotation captures the
      general metal-binding property but more specific terms provide the mechanistic detail.
