description: >-
  Periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenase large subunit (hynA1/DVU_1922) catalyzing H2 oxidation
  with cytochrome c3 as the physiological electron acceptor. This enzyme is part of
  the hydrogen-cycling machinery that couples periplasmic H2 oxidation to dissimilatory
  sulfate reduction in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. The large subunit contains the
  bimetallic [NiFe] active site with CO and CN ligands on Fe, while the small subunit
  (HynB) provides the Fe-S cluster relay for electron transfer to cytochrome c3. The
  heterodimer is exported to the periplasm via the Tat pathway, with the small subunit
  carrying the twin-arginine signal peptide.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation assigns ferredoxin hydrogenase activity based on InterPro domain
      matching (IPR018194). However, the physiological electron acceptor for this
      periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenase is cytochrome c3, not ferredoxin. The GO term
      GO:0008901 describes the reaction "2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H+ = 2 oxidized
      ferredoxin + H2" which is the H2 evolution direction with ferredoxin as electron
      donor - opposite to the physiological function of this uptake hydrogenase.
      Deep research summaries indicate that periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenases in
      Desulfovibrio transfer electrons primarily to tetraheme cytochrome c3.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The annotation is based on domain similarity but assigns an incorrect electron
      partner (ferredoxin) and incorrect reaction direction (H2 production vs uptake).
      D. vulgaris Hildenborough periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenases function as H2 uptake
      enzymes with cytochrome c3 as the immediate acceptor. "Periplasmic electron
      transfer proceeds primarily to tetraheme cytochrome c3 (TpIc3; DVU3171)" as
      summarized in the deep research report. The more appropriate term is GO:0047806
      (cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase activity) which describes the correct reaction with
      the physiological acceptor.

      This annotation correctly identifies nickel binding based on InterPro domain
      matching for the [NiFe] hydrogenase large subunit (IPR001501, IPR018194). The
      large subunit contains the bimetallic [NiFe] active site where Ni is coordinated
      by conserved cysteine residues. UniProt annotation shows Ni(2+) binding sites at

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a generic annotation based on UniProt keyword mapping (KW-0560: Oxidoreductase).
      While technically correct - hydrogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze
      H2 + A = 2H+ + AH2 - this term is too general and provides no specific information
      about the enzyme's function. More specific child terms are available and already
      annotated (GO:0047806 cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase activity).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Although this term is very general, it is not incorrect. The enzyme is indeed an
      oxidoreductase (EC 1.12.2.1). Since more specific annotations exist (GO:0047806),
      this general term provides hierarchical coverage without being misleading. The
      presence of more specific terms means this annotation adds little information but
      also does no harm.

    summary: >-
      This cellular component annotation correctly identifies periplasmic localization

      possesses multiple periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenases that oxidize H2 in the periplasm
      and transfer electrons to the periplasmic cytochrome c3 pool. The heterodimeric

  review:
    summary: >-
      This generic annotation for metal ion binding is derived from UniProt keyword
      mapping (KW-0479: Metal-binding). While technically accurate - the enzyme binds
      Ni, Fe, and Mg - this term is too general. More specific metal binding terms

      The annotation is correct but redundant given the more specific GO:0016151
      (nickel cation binding) annotation. The protein does bind multiple metal ions
      (Ni, Fe, Mg) at the active site and structural positions. UniProt shows binding

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the most accurate molecular function annotation for this enzyme. GO:0047806
      describes "Catalysis of the reaction: 2 H2 + ferricytochrome c3 = 4 H+ +
      ferrocytochrome c3" which matches the physiological function of periplasmic
      [NiFe] hydrogenases in Desulfovibrio species. The annotation is derived from
      RHEA:20625 and EC:1.12.2.1. Kinetic studies demonstrated that cytochrome c3 is
      the primary physiological acceptor for periplasmic hydrogenases.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation captures the core molecular function of the enzyme. "Kinetic

      reduce Hmc efficiently and that cytochrome c3 markedly accelerates Hmc reduction,
      positioning c3 as the principal immediate acceptor from hydrogenases" (Pereira
      et al. 1998). UniProt catalytic activity annotation confirms: "2 Fe(III)-[cytochrome

    summary: >-
      This biological process annotation captures the pathway context in which hynA1
      functions. The periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenases provide electrons from H2 oxidation
      that feed into the cytoplasmic sulfate reduction pathway via membrane-spanning
      complexes. While hynA1 does not directly catalyze sulfate reduction, it is part
      of the electron transport chain that powers this process.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The role of periplasmic [NiFe] hydrogenases in dissimilatory sulfate reduction
      is well established. "Periplasmic H2 oxidation via [NiFe] hydrogenases provides
      electrons to the periplasmic cytochrome pool and inner-membrane complexes, coupling
      to cytoplasmic sulfate reduction" (deep research). This represents the core
      biological role of this enzyme in D. vulgaris energy metabolism.
      GO annotation guidelines support annotating enzymes to the biological process they
      contribute to even when they don't directly catalyze the terminal reaction.
