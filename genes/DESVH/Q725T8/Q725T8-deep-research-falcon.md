## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q725T8
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Potassium-transporting ATPase KdpC subunit {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00276}; AltName: Full=ATP phosphohydrolase [potassium-transporting] C chain {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00276}; AltName: Full=Potassium-binding and translocating subunit C {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00276}; AltName: Full=Potassium-translocating ATPase C chain {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00276};
- **Gene Information:** Name=kdpC {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-Rule:MF_00276, ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS97805.1}; OrderedLocusNames=DVU_3337 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS97805.1};
- **Organism (full):** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the KdpC family. {ECO:0000256|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** KdpC. (IPR003820); KdpC (PF02669)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "kdpC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'kdpC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **kdpC** (gene ID: Q725T8, UniProt: Q725T8) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
We verified the target identity and then synthesized recent primary/review literature on the bacterial KdpFABC K+ pump with emphasis on the KdpC subunit and late-breaking regulatory/structural insights (2023–2025). Organism-specific inferences to Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3337; UniProt Q725T8) are provided with caution due to limited species-specific primary data in the retrieved corpus.

Mandatory identity verification
- Gene symbol and product: The target is kdpC, encoding the KdpC subunit of the potassium-transporting ATPase (KdpFABC). This matches the UniProt description and canonical nomenclature for the KdpFABC complex. The KdpC subunit is a small, periplasmically oriented, single-pass membrane protein belonging to the KdpC family (PF02669; IPR003820), consistent with current structural/functional overviews of KdpFABC. (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Organism: Nitratidesulfovibrio (Desulfovibrio) vulgaris Hildenborough; locus DVU_3337 as provided. No contradictions were found in the contemporary KdpFABC literature surveyed; species-specific functional inference is based on conservation of the KdpC family and the architecture of KdpFABC. (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)

1) Key concepts and current definitions
- The KdpFABC complex: a heterotetrameric, ATP-dependent K+ pump induced under K+ limitation/osmotic stress. KdpA provides K+ selectivity (Trk/Ktr/Kdp superfamily-like), KdpB is the P-type ATPase motor, KdpC is a periplasmic single-pass membrane subunit, and KdpF is a small membrane anchor. Central mechanistic concept: K+ moves via an intersubunit tunnel from the KdpA selectivity filter to the canonical ion-binding site in KdpB (CBS), coupling to the P-type ATPase Post–Albers-like cycle in KdpB. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- KdpC subunit role/definition: KdpC is periplasmically oriented and single-pass. Contemporary models assign KdpC a non-catalytic but essential structural/modulatory role—controlling ion access to KdpA and stabilizing KdpFABC assembly. Its precise catalytic involvement remains limited; most catalytic chemistry resides in KdpB. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)

2) Recent developments (2023–2024 priority; 2025 preprint where pertinent)
- High-resolution cryo-EM under turnover: A 2.1 Å structure of E. coli KdpFABC in an E1~P·ADP conformation shows strong K+ densities in KdpA’s selectivity filter and at KdpB’s CBS, with D307 phosphorylated and ADP + two Mg2+ bound in the N-domain, directly supporting the intersubunit-tunnel conduction and P-type coupling mechanism. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293 (May 2025). (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4)
- Intersubunit tunnel confirmation and mutagenesis: Functional assays and targeted mutations along the tunnel validate conduction and identify a low-affinity K+ release site in KdpB, refining how ions traverse from KdpA to KdpB and are released to the cytoplasm. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293 (May 2025). (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4)
- Updated mechanism and regulation from recent reviews: The intersubunit transport model, residue-level roles (e.g., F232, D583, K586 in KdpB), and lipid dependence (cardiolipin at KdpA–KdpB interface) are emphasized, alongside a regulatory brake via phosphorylation of KdpB S162 that traps the complex in an E1P off-cycle state at high K+. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Discovery of tandem serine–histidine kinase activity in KdpD: KdpD both transcriptionally activates kdpFABC via its histidine kinase function under low K+ and post-translationally inhibits the pump at high K+ by directly phosphorylating KdpB at S162 via an N-terminal atypical serine kinase (ASK) domain. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (April 2024); preprint version: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405 (Nov 2023). (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 16-19)

3) Function, localization, and pathway context (with focus on KdpC)
- Function within the transporter: KdpC is not the catalytic ATPase; rather, it is a periplasmic single-spanning subunit thought to modulate ion access in the periplasmic vestibule and help stabilize the KdpA–KdpB interface, indirectly tuning K+ entry into the intersubunit tunnel. This aligns with its conserved family/domain assignment (PF02669/IPR003820) and periplasmic topology. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Subcellular localization: Periplasmically oriented, single-pass membrane protein embedded with KdpA/KdpB/KdpF in the cytoplasmic membrane. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Pathway context: KdpFABC mediates high-affinity K+ uptake under limitation, controlled by the KdpDE two-component system. KdpD integrates signals (including K+ and, in some species, c-di-AMP) to regulate kdpFABC both transcriptionally and post-translationally by KdpB S162 phosphorylation. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405 (Nov 2023). (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 16-19)

4) Regulation under high vs. low K+
- Low K+: KdpD’s histidine kinase activates KdpE, driving kdpFABC expression and thereby increasing high-affinity K+ uptake via KdpFABC. Review context supports induction under K+ limitation/osmotic stress. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023); https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (Apr 2024). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6, silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4)
- High K+: KdpD’s N-terminal ASK domain phosphorylates KdpB at S162 to inhibit ATPase turnover by preventing the E1P→E2P transition (electrostatic conflict with D307-P), thus avoiding wasteful ATP consumption. Species diversity exists: in some bacteria, c-di-AMP modulates this ASK activity. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405 (Nov 2023). (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 16-19)

5) Quantitative/statistical details
- Cryo-EM resolution/state: 2.1 Å E1~P·ADP state in nanodiscs; K+ densities at KdpA SF and KdpB CBS; D307 phosphorylation and ADP + two Mg2+ in N-domain observed. URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.05.652293 (May 2025). (hussein2025conductionpathwayfor pages 1-4)
- Conduction pathway length and residues: ~40 Å intersubunit tunnel; key KdpB residues F232, D583, K586; catalytic aspartate D307 cycles through phosphorylation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Regulatory phosphorylation site: KdpB S162 directly phosphorylated by KdpD’s ASK; mutation of Walker A in the ASK domain abolishes S162 phosphorylation and relieves inhibition. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (Apr 2024). (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4)

6) Applicability to Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3337; Q725T8)
- Conservation and inference: KdpC is a conserved periplasmic single-spanning subunit (PF02669/IPR003820). Given the conservation of the KdpFABC architecture and KdpC family membership, DVU_3337 (kdpC) is expected to localize to the cytoplasmic membrane with a periplasmic orientation and to function structurally/modulatorily in high-affinity K+ uptake under K+ limitation. Direct organism-specific structural/biochemical data were not retrieved in the present corpus; conclusions are inferred from cross-species conservation and contemporary mechanistic models. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Regulatory framework: Many bacteria use KdpDE; the newly described KdpD ASK-mediated post-translational inhibition is widespread, with species-specific inputs (e.g., c-di-AMP). Desulfovibrio spp. may share this regulatory architecture, but explicit demonstration in D. vulgaris Hildenborough was not identified here; this remains an inference pending species-specific confirmation. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47526-8 (Apr 2024); https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.09.566405 (Nov 2023). (silberberg2024kdpdisa pages 2-4, silberberg2023sensorykinasekdpd pages 16-19)

7) Current applications and implementations
- Structural and mechanistic benchmarking: KdpFABC serves as a model for intersubunit ion transfer coupled to a P-type ATPase cycle, widely used in cryo-EM method development and mechanistic dissection of ion pumps, including lipid cofactor requirements (e.g., cardiolipin). This informs general strategies for studying membrane protein lipid interactions and transporter regulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)

8) Expert perspectives
- Reviews emphasize the uniqueness of KdpFABC among P-type ATPases: the intersubunit tunnel linking a channel-like selectivity filter (KdpA) to a P-type ATPase motor (KdpB) and nuanced multilayer regulation (transcriptional via KdpDE and post-translational via KdpD ASK on KdpB S162). This combination is cited as a paradigmatic example of mixed-domain transport and regulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1042/bst20221543 (June 2023). (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)

*Table: Compact table linking 2023–2025 structural and regulatory findings about the KdpFABC pump and KdpC, with quantitative details, methods, species, and primary sources; useful for tracing evidence on KdpC's putative structural role and KdpFABC regulation (citations provided).*

Limitations and open questions
- KdpC’s precise mechanistic contribution beyond structural/assembly and periplasmic gating remains incompletely defined at atomic detail relative to KdpA/KdpB; continued targeted mutagenesis and subunit-specific cryo-EM analyses are warranted. (stock2023fastforwardonptype pages 4-6)
- Species-specific validation in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3337) is needed to confirm regulatory inputs (e.g., c-di-AMP effects on KdpD) and any unique lipid dependencies.

Conclusion
kdpC (DVU_3337; UniProt Q725T8) encodes the periplasmic, single-pass KdpC subunit of the KdpFABC high-affinity K+ pump. Contemporary work establishes a conduction pathway from KdpA to KdpB and reveals a dual regulatory regime wherein KdpD activates kdpFABC expression at low K+ and directly inhibits pump turnover at high K+ by phosphorylating KdpB S162 via an atypical serine kinase domain. While KdpC’s role is primarily structural/modulatory, its conservation supports analogous function in D. vulgaris Hildenborough.
