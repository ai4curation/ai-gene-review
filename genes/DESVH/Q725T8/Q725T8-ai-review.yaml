description: >
  KdpC is a periplasmic, single-pass membrane subunit of the KdpFABC high-affinity
  potassium-transporting ATPase complex. It functions as a catalytic chaperone that
  increases the ATP-binding affinity of the ATPase subunit KdpB by forming a transient
  KdpB/KdpC/ATP ternary complex. KdpC does not itself possess catalytic ATPase or
  hydrolase activity; rather, it modulates ion access in the periplasmic vestibule
  and stabilizes complex assembly. The KdpFABC complex is induced under potassium
  limitation to enable high-affinity K+ uptake (Stock et al., 2023).

  review:
    summary: >
      KdpC is part of the KdpFABC complex which transports potassium ions across the
      membrane. While KdpC does not directly catalyze ion transport (this is performed
      by KdpA/KdpB), it is an essential accessory subunit required for complex function.
      The annotation correctly reflects KdpC's involvement in the biological process.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      KdpC is an essential subunit of the KdpFABC potassium-transporting ATPase.
      Contemporary structural and mechanistic studies confirm that KdpC is required
      for proper complex function, even though it does not directly catalyze transport.
      The 'involved_in' qualifier is appropriate for an accessory subunit that enables
      the process through its catalytic chaperone function.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0547). The annotation
      is misleading for KdpC. While KdpC participates in forming a transient ternary
      complex with KdpB and ATP, it is KdpB that directly binds ATP. KdpC functions
      as a catalytic chaperone to increase ATP-binding affinity of KdpB, but does
      not itself possess intrinsic nucleotide-binding capability.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      KdpC does not directly bind nucleotides. The UniProt HAMAP annotation states
      that KdpC "increases the ATP-binding affinity of the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit
      KdpB by the formation of a transient KdpB/KdpC/ATP ternary complex." This
      describes an indirect role in modulating ATP binding to KdpB, not direct
      nucleotide binding by KdpC itself. The cryo-EM structures show ADP and Mg2+
      bound in the KdpB N-domain, not KdpC. This is an over-annotation resulting
      from keyword propagation that does not accurately reflect KdpC's molecular function.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation derives from UniRule:UR000058586 and keyword mapping. Like
      the nucleotide binding annotation, this is an over-annotation. KdpC participates
      in ternary complex formation with KdpB and ATP, but does not itself directly
      bind ATP. The ATP-binding site resides in KdpB, not KdpC.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      KdpC is not an ATP-binding protein. The catalytic aspartate (D307) that becomes
      phosphorylated during the reaction cycle is located in KdpB, and ATP/ADP are
      bound to the KdpB N-domain. KdpC's role is to enhance ATP-binding affinity
      of KdpB through allosteric/chaperone mechanisms, not to directly bind ATP.
      This annotation incorrectly attributes to KdpC a molecular function that
      belongs to KdpB.

  review:
    summary: >
      This molecular function annotation is inappropriate for KdpC. GO:0008556
      describes the enzymatic transporter activity, which in the KdpFABC complex
      is performed by KdpB (the P-type ATPase) together with KdpA (the K+ channel).
      KdpC does not possess transporter activity; it is an accessory subunit with
      a regulatory/chaperone role.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      GO:0008556 is defined as "Enables the transfer of a solute... according to
      the reaction: ATP + H2O + K+(out) = ADP + phosphate + K+(in)." This describes
      catalytic activity that KdpC does not possess. KdpB is the ATPase that
      hydrolyzes ATP (containing the catalytic aspartate D307), and KdpA is the
      K+ translocase. KdpC functions as a "catalytic chaperone" that modulates
      KdpB activity but does not itself catalyze transport. This annotation
      incorrectly attributes complex activity to an individual subunit that
      lacks the catalytic machinery.

      This annotation is incorrect for KdpC. The hydrolase (ATPase) activity in

      catalytic hydrolase activity.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      The ATPase activity (ATP hydrolysis) is carried out by KdpB, which contains
      the catalytic aspartate D307 that becomes phosphorylated during the P-type
      ATPase cycle. KdpC has no catalytic residues and functions as a regulatory/
      chaperone subunit. The UniProtKB keyword "Hydrolase" (KW-0378) was incorrectly
      propagated to KdpC, likely because the KdpFABC complex has hydrolase activity.
      This conflates complex function with individual subunit function. KdpC
      "acts as a catalytic chaperone" but is not itself a catalyst.
