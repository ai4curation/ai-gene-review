description: >-
  RpoH (sigma-32) is the heat shock sigma factor encoded by DVU_1584 in
  Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. As a member of the sigma-70 family
  (Group 3), RpoH directs the RNA polymerase holoenzyme to heat shock promoters
  with the consensus motif aTTGAAA-[N12]-aaCTaT (Chhabra et al., 2006).
  RpoH functions as a cytosolic transcription initiation factor that regulates
  expression of heat shock genes including chaperones (GroEL, GroES, ClpB, HtpG)
  and proteases (ClpX) in response to proteotoxic stress conditions including
  heat shock, oxidative stress, and biocide exposure. The protein contains
  characteristic sigma-70 domains (regions 1.2, 2, and 4) essential for
  promoter recognition and RNA polymerase binding.

    summary: >-
      RpoH regulates transcription initiation by directing RNA polymerase to
      heat shock promoters. The predicted rpoH promoter motif in D. vulgaris
      is aTTGAAA-[N12]-aaCTaT (PMID:16484192). Under heat shock and biocide stress,
      RpoH-regulated genes (groEL, groES, clpX, clpB, htpG) show increased expression
      (PMID:20437234), demonstrating regulation of transcription initiation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation correctly captures the regulatory function of sigma factors.
      RpoH specifically regulates transcription initiation by conferring promoter
      specificity to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, directing it to heat shock
      promoters. Evidence from D. vulgaris transcriptomics shows RpoH-dependent
      activation of heat shock genes under stress conditions.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma factors like RpoH do not bind DNA autonomously but confer promoter
      specificity to the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The GO term definition for
      sigma factor activity explicitly states that sigma does not bind DNA
      on its own but when combined with the core to form the holoenzyme, the sigma
      factor binds specifically to promoter elements.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While technically sigma factors enable DNA binding as part of the holoenzyme,
      this annotation is misleading. Sigma factors do not bind DNA independently -
      they require association with core RNA polymerase. The more specific and
      accurate annotation is GO:0016987 'sigma factor activity' which already
      exists in the annotation set. The DNA binding annotation is redundant and
      potentially misleading about the mechanism of sigma factor function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      RpoH is a sigma factor, not a classical DNA-binding transcription factor.
      Sigma factors function by associating with RNA polymerase core enzyme to
      confer promoter specificity, then dissociating once elongation begins.
      This differs fundamentally from transcription factors that bind DNA
      regulatory elements independently and modulate transcription.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      This annotation conflates two distinct mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
      Sigma factors do not function as conventional transcription factors - they are
      dissociable subunits of RNA polymerase that confer promoter recognition specificity.
      The GO term GO:0016987 'sigma factor activity' is the appropriate molecular
      function annotation for RpoH. The UniProt keywords also classify this protein
      as 'Sigma factor' rather than 'Transcription factor'.

  review:
    summary: >-
      RpoH participates in transcription initiation as part of the RNA polymerase
      holoenzyme. When associated with core RNA polymerase, RpoH enables recognition
      and binding of heat shock promoters to initiate transcription of stress response
      genes. Evidence from D. vulgaris heat shock studies confirms involvement in
      transcription initiation at sigma-32 promoters (PMID:16484192).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This biological process annotation is accurate for sigma factors. RpoH directly
      participates in DNA-templated transcription initiation by forming the holoenzyme
      with core RNA polymerase and enabling promoter recognition. The sigma subunit
      is released after promoter escape/clearance but is essential for the initiation
      phase. This is consistent with the InterPro-based evidence source.

      RpoH regulates transcription by directing RNA polymerase to heat shock genes

      This is an appropriate biological process annotation for sigma factors. RpoH
      regulates transcription by determining which promoters the RNA polymerase

      transcription of heat shock regulon genes. Multiple D. vulgaris studies

    summary: >-
      RpoH is the canonical heat shock sigma factor that mediates the cellular
      response to heat in bacteria. In D. vulgaris, heat shock activates the
      RpoH-dependent regulon including chaperones and proteases essential for
      survival under thermal stress (PMID:16484192). The predicted rpoH
      promoter motif matches canonical sigma-32 heat shock promoters.
    action: NEW

      This biological process annotation should be added as it represents a core
      function of RpoH. The sigma-32 (rpoH) gene product specifically mediates
      cellular response to heat by activating expression of heat shock proteins.
      This is well-documented in D. vulgaris through the global heat shock response
