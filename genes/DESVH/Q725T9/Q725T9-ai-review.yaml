description: >-
  DVU_3336 is a KdpD-like sensory protein located in the kdp locus of D. vulgaris Hildenborough,
  positioned between kdpD and the structural kdpFABC genes. The protein contains an N-terminal
  KdpD sensor domain (IPR003852) and a C-terminal UspA stress-response domain (IPR006016),
  along with a P-loop NTPase fold. Critically, the catalytic histidine kinase domains (HisKA
  and HATPase_c) required for phosphotransfer activity are located on the adjacent DVU3335
  gene, not on DVU_3336. This protein likely functions as a sensory/adapter component that
  participates in osmotic and K+ stress sensing, feeding into the KdpD/KdpE two-component
  regulatory system that controls expression of the high-affinity K+ transporter KdpFABC.
  The UspA domain suggests involvement in stress sensing, while the P-loop NTPase domain
  may enable nucleotide binding for signal modulation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      KdpD-like proteins are typically membrane-associated sensors in the two-component
      KdpD/KdpE system. The N-terminal KdpD domain (IPR003852) described in UniProt as
      "Signal transduction histidine kinase osmosensitive K+ channel sensor N-terminal"
      is typically membrane-associated. However, DVU_3336 lacks predicted transmembrane
      helices in its UniProt entry, and the membrane association is inferred by analogy
      rather than direct evidence (Freeman 2013).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Plasma membrane localization is consistent with the role of KdpD-like sensors,
      which function at the membrane interface to sense osmotic/K+ changes. While direct
      localization evidence for DVU_3336 is lacking, the TreeGrafter annotation based
      on phylogenetic inference (PANTHER:PTN008137371) supports membrane association.
      The KdpD domain in canonical systems requires membrane proximity for signal
      integration (Freeman 2013).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is problematic. While DVU_3336 contains a KdpD N-terminal sensor
      domain (IPR003852), it LACKS the catalytic histidine kinase domains (HisKA/HATPase_c)
      required for actual kinase activity. Domain analysis shows DVU_3336 has only the
      sensory portion (aa 13-218) and a UspA domain (aa 243-357). The adjacent DVU3335
      contains the conserved histidine kinase catalytic domains. The IEA annotation
      was generated from InterPro:IPR003852 combined with PANTHER, but this represents
      an over-annotation - having a sensor domain associated with kinases does not
      confer kinase activity itself.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      DVU_3336 lacks the conserved histidine kinase catalytic domains (HisKA containing
      the phosphorylatable His residue, and HATPase_c for ATP binding/hydrolysis).
      Domain architecture shows only the N-terminal KdpD sensor domain (Pfam PF02702,
      aa 13-218) and UspA domain (Pfam PF00582, aa 243-357). The actual histidine
      kinase domains are on adjacent DVU3335 in DvH. Assigning kinase activity based
      on a sensor domain that is often found fused with kinase domains (in other
      organisms) but is separate in this operon organization is an over-annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      DVU_3336 is located within the kdp locus and contains domains consistent with
      participation in the KdpD/KdpE phosphorelay signal transduction system. While
      it does not possess catalytic kinase activity itself, the KdpD sensor domain
      and UspA stress-sensing domain suggest it participates in sensing environmental
      signals (K+ limitation, osmotic stress) that are transduced through this system.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Involvement in phosphorelay signal transduction is appropriate even for non-catalytic
      components. The protein's location in the kdp operon, its KdpD sensor domain, and
      UspA domain all indicate participation in sensing and signal relay within the
      KdpD/KdpE two-component system. The term describes involvement in the process,
      not necessarily catalytic function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. It was assigned via InterPro:IPR003852 mapping,
      but IPR003852 is "Signal transduction histidine kinase KdpD N-terminal" - a
      SENSOR domain, not a catalytic kinase domain. The InterPro-to-GO mapping
      conflates the sensor domain with kinase activity because in many organisms
      these domains are fused on a single protein. In DVU_3336, only the sensor
      domain is present; the catalytic domains are on the adjacent DVU3335.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      DVU_3336 lacks the HisKA domain containing the conserved phosphorylatable
      histidine residue and lacks the HATPase_c domain required for ATP hydrolysis
      and phosphotransfer. The protein is 379 aa with domains at positions 13-218
      (KdpD N-terminal sensor) and 243-357 (UspA). There is no sequence region
      corresponding to histidine kinase catalytic function. This is a clear case
      of over-annotation where a sensory domain associated with kinases was
      incorrectly annotated as having kinase activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      ARBA annotation for cytoplasm localization. KdpD-like sensors are membrane-associated
      but their cytoplasmic portions (including the UspA domain) extend into the cytoplasm.
      The UspA domain and P-loop NTPase region would be cytoplasmic. This is consistent
      with the dual annotation of plasma membrane and cytoplasm.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      For membrane-associated signaling proteins, the cytoplasmic annotation captures
      the localization of the functional domains (KdpD sensor C-terminal region, UspA
      domain) that interact with cytoplasmic partners and nucleotides. The annotation
      is not contradictory with plasma membrane localization but rather complementary.

      This is consistent with the more specific plasma membrane annotation. KdpD-like
      proteins are membrane-associated sensors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Membrane localization is consistent with KdpD-like sensors. While more specific
      than "plasma membrane" would be ideal, this general term is acceptable as a
      broader annotation alongside the more specific plasma membrane annotation.
      Both annotations capture the membrane association of this sensory protein.

      Annotation derived from UniProtKB keyword KW-0418 (Kinase). This keyword was
      likely assigned based on the protein name containing "histidine kinase domain"
      and the presence of KdpD-related domains. However, DVU_3336 lacks catalytic
      kinase domains - it has only sensory/regulatory domains.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      DVU_3336 does not possess kinase activity. The "kinase" in the protein name
      refers to the type of signaling system (histidine kinase two-component system)
      it participates in, not its own enzymatic function. Domain analysis confirms
      absence of HisKA and HATPase_c catalytic domains. The P-loop NTPase fold
      present in the protein may bind ATP but does not confer kinase activity -
      it is a distinct nucleotide-binding fold found in many non-kinase proteins.

      DVU_3336 is not a transferase. It lacks the catalytic domains required for
      phosphotransfer activity. This annotation cascades from the incorrect

  review:
    summary: >-
      Annotation derived from UniProtKB keyword KW-0407 (Ion transport). This is
      incorrect - DVU_3336 is a sensor protein that participates in REGULATING
      ion transport (via the KdpD/KdpE system controlling KdpFABC), but it is NOT
      itself an ion transporter. The protein lacks transmembrane transporter domains.
      The "potassium channel" in the protein name refers to its role in sensing/
      regulating potassium channel/transporter expression, not to being a channel
      itself.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      DVU_3336 is NOT an ion transporter. It is a sensory protein that participates
      in the regulatory system controlling the high-affinity K+ transporter KdpFABC.
      The KdpFABC complex (encoded by separate genes) performs the actual ion
      transport. The keywords "Ion channel" and "Ion transport" in UniProt are
      misleading - they reflect the pathway context (kdp locus) rather than the
      protein's direct function. This is a clear over-annotation where regulatory
      components were annotated with the function they regulate.

  review:
    summary: >-
      DVU_3336 contains a P-loop NTPase domain (IPR027417) which is associated with
      nucleotide binding. This domain is distinct from the HATPase_c domain found
      in histidine kinases. The P-loop (Walker A motif) is a conserved nucleotide-
      binding element found in many ATP/GTP-binding proteins.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      The presence of the P-loop NTPase domain (IPR027417) and Rossmann-like fold
      (IPR014729) strongly suggests ATP binding capability. This is a structural
      prediction based on conserved domain architecture. ATP binding by UspA-domain
      proteins and P-loop containing proteins is well documented. This annotation

  review:
    summary: >-
      The KdpD/KdpE system responds to osmotic stress and K+ limitation. DVU_3336
      contains both a KdpD N-terminal sensor domain (osmosensitive K+ channel sensor)
      and a UspA domain. UspA domains are characteristic of universal stress proteins
      that respond to various stresses including osmotic stress.
    action: NEW

      The protein's domain architecture (osmosensitive KdpD sensor domain plus UspA
      stress domain) and operon context (kdp locus controlling K+ homeostasis under
      stress) strongly support involvement in osmotic stress response. The KdpD/KdpE
      system is a well-characterized osmotic stress response pathway, and DVU_3336
      is positioned within this regulatory network.
