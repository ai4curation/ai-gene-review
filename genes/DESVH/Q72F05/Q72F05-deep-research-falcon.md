3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Q72F05' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Q72F05** (gene ID: Q72F05, UniProt: Q72F05) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: DVU_0413 (UniProt Q72F05), a TrkH-family potassium uptake protein in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

Executive verification and identity
- Target verification: The UniProt record provided maps Q72F05 to DVU_0413 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and annotates it as a TrkH-family potassium uptake protein with TrkH (PF02386) and cation transporter/cation transpt (IPR003445) domains. These domains are canonical for the membrane pore-forming subunit of Trk/Ktr K+ uptake systems, which are inner-membrane proteins. Together, these features affirm that DVU_0413 is a TrkH-like transmembrane K+ uptake component in D. vulgaris (inference consistent with authoritative reviews and structural studies of TrkH/KtrB) (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).

1) Key concepts and definitions; current understanding
- Trk/Ktr systems: Bacterial low-affinity K+ uptake assemblies composed of a membrane pore subunit (TrkH/KtrB/KtrD) and a cytosolic regulatory ring of RCK-domain subunits (TrkA/KtrA/TrkC). These systems are generally ATP-gated channels that exploit the membrane potential for inward K+ flux when extracellular K+ is relatively high (mM range) (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8). The membrane subunit (e.g., TrkH/KtrB) provides the ion-conducting pathway, while the associated RCK octamer senses ligands (nucleotides and second messengers) and allosterically controls pore opening/closing (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).
- DVU_0413 functional class: By domain/family, DVU_0413 corresponds to the TrkH/KtrB-type pore subunit and is expected to form a dimeric inner-membrane channel that couples to a TrkA/KtrA RCK ring for regulation (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).
- Cellular localization: TrkH/KtrB homologs are integral inner-membrane proteins forming the K+ conductance pathway; DVU_0413’s TrkH domain architecture and transmembrane nature support inner-membrane localization (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).

2) Mechanism of transport and regulation; recent mechanistic advances (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Gating by RCK (TrkA/KtrA) and nucleotides: High-resolution cryo-EM structures of Bacillus subtilis KtrAB demonstrate that ATP binding to the KtrA octamer stabilizes an active conformation that enhances K+ flux through KtrB, whereas ADP-bound states are inactive. The structures identify gating elements in KtrB (e.g., Phe91, Arg417) and allosteric coupling between the RCK ring and the transmembrane pore (2.5–2.8 Å maps; multiple PDB/EMDB depositions) (May 2024) (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13). By homology, TrkH-family pores such as DVU_0413 are expected to employ similar gating logic under control of a cognate TrkA regulator.
- Synergistic activation by Na+: The same 2024 structural study discovered a Na+ binding site at the intra-dimer interface of ATP-bound KtrA; Na+ stabilizes the ATP-bound state and boosts K+ flux, establishing ATP–Na+ synergism in activation. Biophysical assays (ICP-MS, anomalous scattering) corroborate ATP-dependent Na+ binding to the RCK ring (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13). This provides an updated regulatory paradigm for Trk/Ktr systems.
- Regulation by c-di-AMP (global perspective): Authoritative review evidence shows many RCK-containing gating proteins of Trk/Ktr systems bind c-di-AMP with affinities spanning ~tens of nM to low µM. c-di-AMP binding reduces K+ uptake by destabilizing the RCK–pore interaction, thereby tuning cellular K+ and cell volume. Phenotypes of altered c-di-AMP include reduced K+ import and plasmolysis sensitivity at high c-di-AMP; toxic K+ accumulation at low c-di-AMP. These mechanisms are broadly conserved among bacteria that produce c-di-AMP (Jun 2024) (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8). By inference, if D. vulgaris uses c-di-AMP signaling, DVU_0413 activity could be subject to this layer of regulation via a TrkA-like partner (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).

3) Biological process, substrate specificity, and pathway context
- Substrate and transport mode: TrkH/KtrB-family pores are selective for K+ and operate as low-affinity, membrane-potential-driven channels rather than primary active transporters; ATP acts as a ligand for the cytosolic RCK ring (not as a direct energy source for pumping). The K+ flux relies on the electrochemical gradient (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8). Structural work in 2024 refined the gating residues and showed ATP/ADP and Na+ liganding control the conductive state (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13).
- Pathway context: Trk/Ktr systems complement other K+ uptake systems (e.g., high-affinity Kdp, other low-affinity systems like Kup/KimA), and these systems are often redundant, collectively ensuring K+ homeostasis, osmoadaptation, and pH/salt stress resilience in diverse bacteria (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, acciarri2023redundantpotassiumtransporter pages 12-12). DVU_0413 likely functions within such a redundant K+ uptake network in D. vulgaris.

4) Evidence in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and osmostress linkage
- Stress responses in D. vulgaris: Transcriptomic and physiological studies show D. vulgaris reprograms gene expression under alkaline and salt stress, implicating transport and osmoadaptation pathways. Although the retrieved summaries do not isolate DVU_0413 specifically, they support that K+ uptake and osmotic homeostasis are integral to D. vulgaris stress responses (Dec 2007; Mar 2010) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).
- Genetic resource for phenotypes: A 2023 D. vulgaris RB‑TnSeq library mapped conditional phenotypes for >1,100 non-essential genes and provides an experimental platform to test DVU_0413 fitness under salt, pH, or ionic challenges, even though a DVU_0413-specific phenotype was not reported in the retrieved summary (Mar 2023) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).

5) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- 2024 structural advance: ATP–Na+ synergism and pore gating residues in KtrAB, providing a current mechanistic blueprint transferable to TrkH homologs like DVU_0413 (May 2024) (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13).
- 2024 regulatory synthesis: Review linking c-di-AMP to control of Trk/Ktr gating subunits, quantifying affinities and physiological phenotypes of K+ homeostasis dysregulation (Jun 2024) (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).
- 2024 environmental context: Metagenomics across estuarine salinity gradients ranked a Trk-type K+ transporter as the top genomic feature linked to high salinity, highlighting the ecological importance of TrkH-mediated “salt-in” strategies (Jun 2024) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19). Additional metagenomic studies in hypersaline lakes also reported enrichment of trk/ktr genes with salinity (Jan 2024) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).
- 2023 physiological genetics: Enterococcus studies emphasized redundancy of K+ systems and Ktr involvement under stress, reinforcing generalizable roles for Trk/Ktr in osmoadaptation (Feb 2023) (acciarri2023redundantpotassiumtransporter pages 12-12).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Environmental microbiology and biotechnology: TrkH/Ktr-mediated “salt-in” strategies contribute to community fitness in saline estuaries and hypersaline lakes; these insights inform selection/engineering of salt-tolerant consortia for saline wastewater bioprocesses and energy applications, where maintaining intracellular K+ is critical for osmoprotection and metabolic stability (ecological genomics pointing to TrkH as a key feature) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19). Reviews of saline bioprocessing discuss K+ homeostasis and Trk/Ktr management in practical settings (contextualized by the importance of Trk/Ktr in osmoadaptation) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).
- Industrial/bioremediation contexts: Sulfate-reducing bacteria such as D. vulgaris are relevant to corrosion and bioremediation; understanding K+ uptake systems like DVU_0413 can guide media formulation or stress-conditioning strategies to modulate growth, stress tolerance, and activity under variable salinity and pH (supported by D. vulgaris stress response literature and genetic toolkits) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic authority: The 2024 Nature Communications structural study revises and extends the textbook model by adding a Na+ activation site to the RCK ring and by pinpointing gating residues; this places nucleotide and cation sensing directly at the regulatory octamer with clear allosteric consequences for the pore, a likely conserved feature across TrkH homologs including DVU_0413 (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13).
- Regulatory authority: The 2024 MMBR review argues c-di-AMP is a master regulator of cell volume largely via K+ transport targets, prominently including Trk/Ktr RCK subunits. For organisms with c-di-AMP signaling, TrkH-family transport is expected to be under tight post-translational control to balance osmotic stress vs. K+ toxicity (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).

8) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Structural metrics: Cryo-EM resolutions of 2.5–2.8 Å for ATP- and ADP-bound KtrAB; identification of a single Na+ per KtrA dimer at the intra-dimer interface in the ATP-bound state by ICP-MS and crystallography (May 2024) (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13).
- Binding/regulatory ranges: c-di-AMP affinities for RCK regulators of K+ uptake span ~40 nM to 8 µM across species; phenotypic extremes include plasmolysis sensitivity with high c-di-AMP and K+ toxicity with low c-di-AMP (Jun 2024) (foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8).
- Environmental prevalence: In a 2024 estuarine metagenomic analysis, a Trk-type K+ transporter (COG0168) ranked as the top feature distinguishing salinity-adapted genomes, with relative abundance increasing with salinity across metagenomes and dominant phyla (Jun 2024) (wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).

Limitations and inferences for DVU_0413
- Direct, locus-specific experimental characterization of DVU_0413 (Q72F05) in D. vulgaris was not retrieved in the gathered texts. Functional annotation is therefore inferred from conserved domains/family assignments (TrkH PF02386; IPR003445), established Trk/Ktr mechanisms, D. vulgaris stress-response literature, and the availability of D. vulgaris RB‑TnSeq resources to test DVU_0413 phenotypes under ionic/pH stress. These lines collectively support annotation of DVU_0413 as an inner-membrane TrkH-family K+ uptake pore subunit likely regulated by a cognate TrkA RCK complex and modulated by nucleotides, Na+, and potentially c-di-AMP (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).

Actionable next steps
- Use the D. vulgaris RB‑TnSeq library to query DVU_0413 under low/high K+, NaCl/osmotic upshift, and alkaline pH; couple with targeted deletion/complementation. Reconstitute DVU_0413 with its TrkA partner in proteoliposomes to test ATP/ADP and Na+ dependence as defined in 2024 structural work. Screen for c-di-AMP binding to the D. vulgaris TrkA homolog and test functional inhibition of DVU_0413-mediated K+ flux (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).

Conclusion
DVU_0413 (Q72F05) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris is best annotated as an inner-membrane TrkH-family K+ uptake pore subunit. Recent structural work details ATP/ADP-dependent gating and identifies a Na+ activation site on the RCK ring that synergizes with ATP to activate K+ flux, providing a contemporary mechanistic framework likely applicable to DVU_0413. c-di-AMP broadly regulates Trk/Ktr RCK subunits, linking potassium import with bacterial cell volume control. Environmental metagenomics emphasizes TrkH importance in saline habitats, aligning with the expectation that DVU_0413 contributes to osmoadaptation in D. vulgaris. While direct DVU_0413 functional experiments were not retrieved, D. vulgaris stress studies and genetic resources enable targeted validation under relevant ionic and pH conditions (chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 1-2, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 2-3, chiang2024structuralbasisand pages 12-13, foster2024bacterialcellvolume pages 6-8, acciarri2023redundantpotassiumtransporter pages 12-12, wu2024metagenomicinsightsinto pages 19-19).
