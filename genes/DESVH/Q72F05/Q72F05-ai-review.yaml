description: >-
  DVU_0413 is a TrkH-family potassium uptake protein that functions as the membrane pore-forming
  subunit of the Trk/Ktr K+ uptake system. It contains the TrkH domain (PF02386) and Cat_transpt
  domain (IPR003445), which are canonical for inner-membrane K+ conductance channels. The protein
  forms a dimeric channel that couples to a TrkA RCK ring for allosteric regulation. The system
  functions as an ATP-gated, low-affinity K+ uptake channel that exploits membrane potential for
  inward K+ flux when extracellular K+ is relatively high (mM range). ATP binding to the RCK
  octamer stabilizes an active conformation, while ADP-bound states are inactive. The system plays
  a key role in K+ homeostasis and osmoadaptation, particularly important under salt stress
  conditions. TrkH-family transporters are strongly associated with salinity adaptation in
  environmental metagenomics studies (Chiang et al. 2024, Foster et al. 2024, Wu et al. 2024).

      This annotation is correct but overly general. TrkH-family proteins are specifically
      potassium ion channels, not general cation transporters. The term was inferred from
      the MF annotation GO:0008324 (monoatomic cation transmembrane transporter activity).
    action: MODIFY

      DVU_0413 is a TrkH-family K+ uptake pore subunit with well-characterized specificity
      for potassium ions. Structural studies of homologous KtrAB complexes demonstrate K+
      selectivity through a selectivity filter (Chiang et al. 2024). The term should be
      made more specific to potassium ion transmembrane transport.

      Correct cellular component annotation. TrkH/KtrB homologs are integral inner-membrane
      proteins forming the K+ conductance pathway. In bacteria, the plasma membrane is
      equivalent to the inner/cytoplasmic membrane where this protein localizes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The TrkH domain architecture and transmembrane nature support inner-membrane (plasma
      membrane) localization. This is consistent with the established function of TrkH-family
      proteins as membrane-embedded K+ channels (Foster et al. 2024).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is a very general parent term that is technically correct but uninformative.
      The annotation comes from UniProtKB keyword mapping. Given that DVU_0413 specifically
      transports potassium ions, more specific terms are warranted.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      This general term does not capture the specific substrate (K+) of the TrkH-family
      transporter. While not incorrect, it should be replaced with the more specific
      potassium ion transport term for informative annotation.

      Derived from InterPro:IPR003445 (Cat_transpt domain). This is a correct but overly
      broad annotation that encompasses all cation transport. TrkH proteins are specifically
      K+ selective.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The Cat_transpt domain (IPR003445) is found in cation transporters, but TrkH-family
      proteins have evolved specificity for K+. Structural and biochemical evidence from
      homologous systems confirms K+ selectivity, warranting a more specific term.

      This molecular function annotation from InterPro is correct but should be made more

    action: MODIFY

      TrkH-family proteins function specifically as K+ channels. The protein enables
      transfer of K+ ions across the membrane through a selectivity filter, with activity
      regulated by the RCK domain of the cognate TrkA partner. A more specific MF term
      better captures the actual molecular function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: >-
      This ARBA-derived annotation is problematic. While potassium is technically a metal
      (alkali metal), in GO ontology conventions, "metal ion transport" (GO:0030001) is
      typically used for transition metals and heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, etc.), not for
      alkali metal cations like K+ and Na+. Potassium ion transport has its own dedicated
      branch (GO:0006813).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation represents a mapping error or overly broad inference. In GO usage
      and biological convention, K+ is classified under "monoatomic cation" and "potassium
      ion" terms rather than "metal ion" terms. The term GO:0030001 is a sibling of
      GO:0006812 (monoatomic cation transport), not a parent, and is typically reserved
      for transition/heavy metals. Retaining this annotation would be misleading about
      the substrate specificity of DVU_0413.

      This is the most general transmembrane transport term. While technically correct
      (DVU_0413 does perform transmembrane transport), it provides minimal information
      about the actual function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This very general term is implied by more specific annotations. It is not incorrect,
      but adds no functional insight beyond what is captured by potassium-specific terms.
      Keeping as non-core maintains the hierarchical relationship without cluttering the
      core annotation set.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TrkH/Ktr systems function specifically in K+ uptake (import) rather than export.
      This term captures the directionality of transport that is missing from the existing
      annotations.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      DVU_0413 is part of the Trk K+ uptake system, which specifically imports K+ into
      the cell. The deep research clearly indicates this is an uptake/import system
      operating when external K+ is in the mM range. This term more precisely describes
      the biological process than the bidirectional "transport" terms.
