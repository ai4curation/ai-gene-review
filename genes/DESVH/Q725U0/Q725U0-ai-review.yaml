description: >
  DVU_3335 (Q725U0) is a membrane-associated two-component system (TCS) sensor histidine kinase
  in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (now Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris). The protein contains
  two predicted transmembrane helices (residues 14-36 and 148-170), a PAS sensory domain (residues 238-283),
  and a C-terminal histidine kinase catalytic core comprising a dimerization/histidine phosphotransfer
  (DHp/HisKA) domain and a HATPase_C domain (residues 363-578). It catalyzes ATP-dependent autophosphorylation
  on a conserved histidine residue and subsequent phosphotransfer to a cognate response regulator.
  The specific environmental signal detected and the cognate response regulator remain uncharacterized.
  Based on domain architecture and organism-level TCS studies, it likely participates in adaptive
  regulation tied to nutrient availability, stress sensing, or biofilm-related behaviors.

  review:
    summary: >
      This biological process annotation is appropriate for a sensor histidine kinase that functions
      within a two-component phosphorelay system. The annotation was inferred from GO:0000155
      (phosphorelay sensor kinase activity) via logical inference. DVU_3335 contains the canonical
      HisKA and HATPase_C domains characteristic of TCS sensor kinases, supporting participation
      in phosphorelay signaling.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The domain architecture (HisKA/DHp + HATPase_C) is diagnostic of two-component system sensor
      histidine kinases that function via autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to response regulators.
      This is the core biological process for TCS sensor kinases. UniProt annotation confirms EC 2.7.13.3
      (protein histidine kinase) activity. Genome-wide studies in D. vulgaris Hildenborough have
      demonstrated TCS roles in regulating substrate-specific functions and stress responses.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >
      This is the most specific and appropriate molecular function term for DVU_3335. The protein
      contains the HisK_dim/P (HisKA/DHp) and HATPase_C domains that define phosphorelay sensor
      kinase activity. This term specifically describes catalysis of histidine autophosphorylation
      in response to an extracellular signal, followed by phosphotransfer to a response regulator.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      GO:0000155 is the correct specific MF term for two-component sensor histidine kinases.
      The protein has InterPro domains IPR003661 (HisK_dim/P_dom) and IPR003594 (HATPase_dom)
      which are the structural basis for this activity. The PAS domain (IPR000014) provides
      the sensory input module typical of environmental signal-responsive sensor kinases.
      This term captures both the kinase activity and its functional context in phosphorelay
      signaling better than more generic kinase terms.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is based on EC 2.7.13.3 mapping and describes the core catalytic activity
      (ATP + protein L-histidine = ADP + protein phospho-L-histidine). While technically correct,
      it is less informative than GO:0000155 which captures the same reaction in the context
      of two-component signaling.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The annotation is accurate based on EC number mapping. UniProt explicitly annotates
      this protein with EC 2.7.13.3. The term describes the biochemical reaction without
      the functional context. Having both GO:0000155 (more specific, context-aware) and
      GO:0004673 (based on EC classification) is acceptable as they represent different
      evidence sources and annotation pipelines.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation was inferred from InterPro:IPR013767 (PAS_fold). While many TCS sensor
      kinases ultimately regulate transcription through their cognate response regulators,
      DVU_3335 is a sensor kinase, not a transcriptional regulator itself. The transcriptional
      regulation is performed by the downstream response regulator, not the sensor kinase.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >
      This annotation represents an over-annotation based on the PAS domain. The PAS domain
      in DVU_3335 functions as a signal sensor, not as a DNA-binding or transcriptional
      regulatory domain. The protein lacks any DNA-binding domains and is a membrane-associated
      sensor with two transmembrane helices. While the phosphorelay cascade may ultimately
      affect transcription via the response regulator, the sensor kinase itself does not
      directly regulate transcription. This annotation conflates the downstream effect of
      phosphorelay signaling with the direct function of the sensor kinase.

  review:
    summary: >
      This is a broad biological process term that accurately describes the general function
      of DVU_3335 as a signal transduction component. However, GO:0000160 (phosphorelay signal
      transduction system) is more specific and already present, making this annotation redundant.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      While redundant with the more specific GO:0000160, this general annotation is not
      incorrect. It was inferred from the HisK_dim/P domains (IPR003661, IPR036097) which
      are hallmarks of signal transducing histidine kinases. Retaining both allows for
      different levels of annotation granularity in queries. The IEA annotation is valid
      and consistent with domain-based inference.

      This is a very general molecular function term inferred from the UniProt keyword "Kinase".
      It is true but uninformative given that more specific terms (GO:0000155, GO:0004673)
      are already annotated.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >
      While technically correct, this term is too general to be informative. GO:0000155
      (phosphorelay sensor kinase activity) and GO:0004673 (protein histidine kinase activity)
      already provide the specific kinase function. "Kinase activity" alone does not distinguish
      this protein from serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, or small molecule kinases.
      The annotation is not wrong but adds no information beyond what is captured by the
      more specific annotations.

      meaningful detail. This annotation is redundant and uninformative for understanding

      This is an intermediate-specificity term describing the transfer of phosphorus groups,
      inferred from InterPro:IPR004358 (Sig_transdc_His_kin-like_C). It is more specific
      than GO:0016740 but less specific than the kinase annotations.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      This annotation bridges the GO hierarchy between general transferase activity and
      specific kinase activity. It was correctly inferred from the histidine kinase-like
      C-terminal domain (IPR004358). While less informative than GO:0000155 or GO:0004673,
      it is a valid IEA annotation that accurately describes the biochemical class of
      reaction catalyzed. The annotation is acceptable as part of the annotation hierarchy.

      DVU_3335 is a two-component system sensor histidine kinase with canonical domain architecture
      (HisKA/DHp + HATPase_C + PAS sensory domain). It functions via ATP-dependent autophosphorylation
      on a conserved histidine residue followed by phosphotransfer to a cognate response regulator.
      This is the core molecular function of the protein.
