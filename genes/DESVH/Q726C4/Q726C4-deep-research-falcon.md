### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fliA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fliA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fliA** (gene ID: Q726C4, UniProt: Q726C4) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity verification: The target is DVU_3229 (gene symbol fliA) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, corresponding to UniProt Q726C4. Literature in D. vulgaris directly identifies DVU_3229 as fliA encoding a σ28/σ70-family alternative sigma factor (FliA) that regulates flagellar formation and motility, consistent with the sigma-70 FliA/WhiG subfamily domain architecture (regions 2 and 4) specified in UniProt (organism and gene context match) (ray2014exploringtherole pages 4-5, ray2014exploringtherole pages 5-6, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154).

Research report: fliA (DVU_3229; UniProt Q726C4) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DESVH)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein and family: fliA encodes RNA polymerase sigma factor FliA (σ28), a member of the sigma-70 family, specifically the FliA/WhiG clade. FliA contains conserved sigma-70 regions that mediate promoter recognition and RNA polymerase core binding, with regions 2 and 4 central to DNA element recognition and anti-sigma interactions (general σ28 mechanistic features) (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 61-65).
- Functional class: FliA directs transcription of the “late” (class III/IV) flagellar regulon, which typically includes flagellin (fliC), hook-associated proteins, motor components (e.g., motAB), and chemotaxis genes in diverse bacteria (definition and examples from model systems) (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, oladosu2024fliptheswitch pages 3-4).
- Promoter consensus: σ28-dependent promoters characteristically contain a −35/−10-like motif approximated by TAAA–N15–GCCGATAA in model organisms; this consensus encapsulates the sequence specificity recognized by FliA region 4 and region 2 analogs (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69).

2) Primary biological role and mechanism
- Primary role: FliA is an alternative sigma factor that associates with RNA polymerase core in the cytosol to initiate transcription from σ28 promoters, governing late stages of flagellar gene expression necessary for assembly of functional flagella and motility (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 61-65).
- Mechanistic integration with assembly: The FliA regulon is controlled by an export/assembly checkpoint. During hook–basal body (HBB) assembly, the anti-sigma factor FlgM sequesters FliA and inhibits σ28-dependent transcription. Upon HBB completion, FlgM is secreted through the flagellar type III export apparatus, relieving inhibition and allowing FliA-driven expression of late genes; FliA can also facilitate FlgM secretion and FlgM can stabilize σ28 against proteolysis (canonical mechanism) (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 69-73).

3) Organism-specific function in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough
- Genetic identity and mutant phenotype: DVU_3229 (fliA) is present in the D. vulgaris Hildenborough genome. A ΔfliA mutant (JW9017) shows severe motility defects on soft agar and in wet-mount assays, and transmission electron microscopy indicates defective or truncated flagella under the conditions tested. These data directly implicate FliA in flagellar biogenesis and motility in D. vulgaris (ray2014exploringtherole pages 4-5, ray2014exploringtherole pages 5-6).
- Biofilm and flagella linkage: Independent work in D. vulgaris reports that ΔfliA mutants lack functional flagella, are non-motile, and fail to form biofilm, consistent with a requirement for FliA-driven late flagellar gene expression to achieve functional flagellation and surface-associated behaviors in this anaerobe (clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 135-139, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154).

4) Cellular localization and action
- Localization: FliA functions in the cytosol, forming a holoenzyme with RNA polymerase to recognize σ28-type promoters. Its availability and activity are controlled by cytosolic sequestration with FlgM and release upon export-coupled checkpoints (mechanistic paradigm) (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 61-65).

5) Regulatory network and partners
- Anti-sigma factor: FlgM is the canonical anti-σ28 factor. It binds FliA (and can engage the holoenzyme) to block transcription until structural checkpoints trigger its secretion; this couples flagellar assembly status to late-gene transcription (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 69-73).
- Additional regulatory layers: In Pseudomonas, the HptB–HsbR–HsbA partner-switching system can antagonize FlgM-mediated sequestration of FliA, highlighting layered control beyond the core anti-sigma checkpoint; a FleQ-centered network integrates second messenger signaling and transcriptional regulation upstream of FliA-dependent genes (model system illustrating contemporary regulatory complexity) (oladosu2024fliptheswitch pages 3-4).

6) Conservation and comparative context
- Prevalence: A genomic survey cited in foundational work identified FliA/SigD orthologs across at least 552 genomes (≈300 species) predominantly in flagellated taxa, with notable lineage-specific absences (e.g., frequent lack in many α-Proteobacteria). This indicates widespread but non-universal conservation of σ28 across bacteria (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69).
- Phylogenetic variation: Comparative analyses show extensive diversity in flagellar regulatory architectures; some lineages lack FliA but regulate motility through σ70-type promoters and post-transcriptional mechanisms, underscoring that while the FlgM–FliA export-coupled checkpoint is common, alternatives exist (smith2009regulationofthe pages 69-73). Large-scale, recent mappings of flagellar components across thousands of genomes confirm that the presence of FliA varies and correlates with specific flagellar modules, reinforcing lineage-specific strategies for motility control (philip2025mappingtheloss pages 9-10).

7) Recent developments (2023–2024) relevant to σ28/FliA control
- Layered flagellar regulation interfacing with second messengers: Contemporary reviews in Pseudomonas detail how transcription factors (e.g., FleQ) and c-di-GMP-responsive circuits modulate the motility–biofilm switch and intersect with FlgM–FliA control, including partner-switching systems that influence σ28 activity. These works emphasize the modular, multi-signal integration around FliA-dependent late gene expression (Journal of Bacteriology, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00365-23) (oladosu2024fliptheswitch pages 3-4).
- Systems/phylogenomic perspective: A 2025 systems-level mapping quantifies component distributions (including σ factors) across >11,000 genomes and correlates them with motility states, highlighting FliA’s heterogeneous distribution and its association with conserved flagellar modules; this provides updated comparative context even though not D. vulgaris–specific (The ISME Journal, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wraf111) (philip2025mappingtheloss pages 9-10).

8) Current applications and real-world implications
- Motility and biofilm in SRB: In D. vulgaris, ΔfliA eliminates functional flagella, abrogates motility, and disrupts biofilm formation, directly tying FliA to phenotypes that influence surface colonization and community behaviors relevant to environmental persistence and engineered systems where sulfate-reducing bacteria operate (e.g., biofilms). These organism-specific data establish FliA as a lever for controlling motility-associated traits in this SRB (clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 135-139, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154).

9) Expert opinions and authoritative sources
- Canonical model: Foundational syntheses emphasize the export-coupled checkpoint integrating the flagellar type III secretion system with FliA and FlgM to ensure temporal control of late gene expression—an expert consensus model supported by multiple genetic and biochemical studies in diverse bacteria (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, smith2009regulationofthe pages 69-73, smith2009regulationofthe pages 61-65).
- Modern perspectives: Recent field overviews in Pseudomonas integrate sigma-factor control with second-messenger signaling and partner-switching mechanisms, reflecting the prevailing expert view that FliA operates within multi-layered, signal-responsive networks (oladosu2024fliptheswitch pages 3-4).

10) Relevant statistics and data
- Conservation statistics: FliA/SigD reported across 552 genomes (≈300 species) in a survey of flagellated bacteria, with 83% of species lacking FliA/SigD belonging to α-Proteobacteria, illustrating uneven phylogenetic distribution (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69).
- D. vulgaris phenotypes: ΔfliA (DVU_3229) shows (i) severe motility defects on soft agar and wet mounts; (ii) defective or truncated flagella by TEM; (iii) failure to form biofilm under tested conditions—quantitative assay details provided in the primary organism-specific studies (ray2014exploringtherole pages 4-5, ray2014exploringtherole pages 5-6, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 135-139, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154).

Notes on the promoter motif and domains
- Promoter: The σ28 motif TAAA–N15–GCCGATAA (−35/−10-like) is reported from model systems; while D. vulgaris–specific promoters were not delineated in the cited organism-specific studies, DVU_3229’s functional role in flagellar assembly and motility supports the inference that a σ28-like regulon exists in DVH (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, ray2014exploringtherole pages 4-5, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154).
- Domains: Anti-sigma FlgM binding targets conserved σ28 surfaces overlapping with regions 2 and 4, explaining sequestration and modulation of holoenzyme stability; these mechanistic insights from model organisms are consistent with the family/domain annotations for Q726C4 (smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69).

Summary
- The fliA gene in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DVU_3229; UniProt Q726C4) encodes a σ28/FliA sigma factor essential for late flagellar gene expression, functional flagella, motility, and biofilm formation under tested conditions. Its regulation is expected to conform to the canonical FlgM-mediated, export-coupled checkpoint observed broadly in bacteria, with emerging multi-layered controls exemplified in model systems. Comparative analyses underscore wide but uneven conservation of FliA across bacterial lineages. Together, organism-specific genetics and general mechanistic studies provide a coherent, well-supported functional annotation for Q726C4 as the flagellar sigma factor FliA in this sulfate-reducing bacterium (ray2014exploringtherole pages 4-5, ray2014exploringtherole pages 5-6, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 135-139, clark2008physiologicalanalysisof pages 149-154, smith2009regulationofthe pages 65-69, oladosu2024fliptheswitch pages 3-4, smith2009regulationofthe pages 69-73).
