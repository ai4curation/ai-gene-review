description: >-
  FliA (sigma-28, sigma^F) is an alternative sigma factor belonging to the sigma-70
  family
  that directs RNA polymerase to flagellar gene promoters in D. vulgaris Hildenborough.
  As the master regulator of late flagellar gene expression (class III/IV genes),
  FliA
  controls transcription of genes encoding flagellin (fliC), hook-associated proteins,
  motor components (motAB), and chemotaxis machinery. FliA activity is regulated by
  the
  anti-sigma factor FlgM, which sequesters FliA in the cytoplasm until hook-basal
  body
  (HBB) assembly is complete; upon HBB completion, FlgM is secreted through the flagellar
  type III export apparatus, releasing FliA to drive late gene expression. Deletion
  of
  fliA in D. vulgaris results in severe motility defects, defective/truncated flagella,
  and loss of biofilm formation capacity.

    review:
      summary: >-
        FliA (sigma-28) regulates transcription initiation by directing RNA polymerase
        to sigma-28-dependent promoters of late flagellar genes. The annotation to
        "regulation of DNA-templated transcription initiation" is accurate since sigma
        factors specifically function in transcription initiation rather than elongation.
        However, this term is generic and does not capture the flagellar-specific
        function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This annotation correctly reflects that FliA functions in regulation of transcription
        initiation. Sigma factors are initiation factors that promote attachment of
        RNA
        polymerase to specific promoter sequences and are released after initiation
        (UniProt Q726C4). While a more specific term involving flagellar regulation
        would
        be ideal, no such term exists in GO. The IEA annotation via logical inference
        (GO_REF:0000108) is appropriate.

        FliA/sigma-28 contains conserved sigma-70 regions 2 and 4 that mediate DNA
        element

        The DNA binding annotation is acceptable because sigma factors confer DNA-binding

        FliA
        contains the characteristic sigma-70 region 2 and region 4 domains (IPR007627,

        This annotation characterizes FliA as a DNA-binding transcription factor.
        While
        sigma factors do regulate transcription and confer promoter specificity, the

        "DNA-binding transcription factor activity" is typically used for sequence-specific
        DNA-binding proteins that directly bind DNA and regulate transcription of

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation incorrectly attributes RNA polymerase catalytic activity to
        FliA.
        Sigma factors do not possess RNA polymerase enzymatic activity themselves;
        rather,
        they are regulatory subunits that associate with the RNA polymerase core enzyme
        (alpha2-beta-beta') to direct promoter recognition. The catalytic activity
        resides
        in the core enzyme subunits, not the sigma factor.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        FliA is a sigma factor, not an RNA polymerase enzyme. Sigma factors function
        by
        binding to the RNA polymerase core to form a holoenzyme and directing it to
        specific
        promoters; they do not possess catalytic polymerase activity. This annotation
        appears
        to be an over-annotation based on InterPro domain associations (GO_REF:0000002).
        The
        UniProt record correctly identifies Q726C4 as "RNA polymerase sigma factor"
        not as
        RNA polymerase itself. This distinction is critical for accurate functional
