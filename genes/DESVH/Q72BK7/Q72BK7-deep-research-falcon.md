- **Key Domains:** RNA_pol_sigma_54. (IPR000394); RNA_pol_sigma_54_core-bd. (IPR007046); RNA_pol_sigma_54_DNA-bd. (IPR007634); RpoN_core-bd_sf. (IPR038709); Sigma54_AID (PF00309)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "rpoN" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'rpoN' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **rpoN** (gene ID: Q72BK7, UniProt: Q72BK7) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation of rpoN (Q72BK7) from Nitratidesulfovibrio (Desulfovibrio) vulgaris Hildenborough: σ54-dependent transcription, regulons, and EBPs

Abstract
We verified the identity of rpoN (UniProt Q72BK7) from Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (Desulfovibrio vulgaris) Hildenborough as encoding the σ54 (RpoN) alternative sigma factor, characterized by conserved activator interaction and DNA-binding domains typical of the σ54 family. We synthesize organism-specific evidence for σ54-dependent regulation, enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs), motif features, and processes regulated in D. vulgaris, and we integrate 2023–2024 developments relevant to sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Where appropriate, cross-species mechanistic studies anchor definitions and mechanisms.

1. Identity verification and domains
• Gene symbol and organism: rpoN encodes σ54 (RpoN) in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (also known as Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough), a model SRB (Kazakov et al., 2015). (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)
• Domain architecture: σ54 comprises an N-terminal activator-interaction domain (AID; PF00309), a central core-binding domain (CBD; PF04963), and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD; PF04552). These assignments and the σ54 promoter recognition properties are corroborated by comparative analyses of σ54 domains and promoters across bacteria. (carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 2-4, carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 28-30, carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 1-2)

2. Molecular function, mechanism, and localization
• Function: σ54 is a promoter specificity factor for −24/−12 class promoters that, unlike σ70, forms a transcriptionally inactive closed complex with RNAP and requires ATP-dependent remodeling by EBPs (AAA+ ATPases) to form the open complex and initiate transcription. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3, carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 1-2, bush2014interdomainrepressionin pages 67-68)
• Mechanism: EBPs bind upstream activating sequences (UASs), assemble (typically hexamers), and, upon signal-dependent activation, hydrolyze ATP to remodel σ54 within the closed complex. DNA looping, often aided by IHF/HU, brings EBPs to σ54-RNAP. Structural work shows σ54 occludes DNA loading and must be reorganized by EBP contact with the σ54 N-terminus. (bush2014interdomainrepressionin pages 67-68, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)
• Localization: σ54 operates in the bacterial nucleoid as part of the RNAP holoenzyme, acting at chromosomal promoters; EBPs bind UASs typically ≥100 bp upstream and contact the σ54-RNAP via looping. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)

3. Promoter motif features
• D. vulgaris-specific σ54 promoter consensus: derived −24/−12 elements are tGGcacg (−24) and tTGCt (−12). A refined set of 87 σ54-dependent promoters was compiled by combining comparative genomics with 5′-RNA-seq and motif analysis. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 13-14)

4. σ54 regulome size and composition in D. vulgaris
• Counts: The reconstructed D. vulgaris σ54 sigmulon includes 36 regulons covering 201 protein-coding genes and 4 non-coding RNAs, associated with 87 σ54-dependent promoters upstream of 85 operons. Most regulons are small (1–4 operons), but some EBPs regulate larger sets (e.g., 6–12 operons). (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7)
• Process categories: Enriched functions include flagellar assembly and cell-exterior structures (~37 operons), and metabolic/transport modules (~24 operons) such as ammonia assimilation, nitrogen fixation, amino acid/amide catabolism, carboxylic-acid metabolism; direct σ54 control was also inferred for pyruvate metabolism and a type III secretion system. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)

5. Key σ54-dependent systems and EBPs in D. vulgaris
• Orange Protein (ORP) complex operons: Two divergent operons (orp1: DVU2107–DVU2109; orp2: DVU2103–DVU2105) are transcribed by σ54-RNAP and co-regulated by a cognate EBP, DVU2106. IHF is required for robust transcription, with two functional IHF sites identified between the promoters. DVU2106 contains PAS-like sensory domain features and retrocontrols its expression; ORP complex composition (DVU2103/2104/2105/2108/2109) was validated by pulldown. (Fiévet et al., 2011, J. Bacteriol.; Fiévet et al., 2014, PLoS ONE). (fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 1-2, fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 12-13, fievet2014ihfisrequired pages 1-2, fievet2014ihfisrequired pages 8-9)
• DVU2956 EBP (σ54-dependent): Controls a biofilm-to-planktonic switch; overexpression reduces biofilm formation by ~70%, deletion increases biofilm and raises H2S production by ~131%. Mechanistically influences the Hmc complex (DVU0531–DVU0536) and Fe-only hydrogenase (hydA/hydB; DVU1769/DVU1770). Also regulates DVU2960 and DVU2962 downstream. (Zhu et al., 2019, Environ. Microbiol.). (zhu2019σ54dependentregulator pages 1-2)
• Additional EBPs and targets: D. vulgaris encodes 37 σ54-associated EBPs; 25 harbor the canonical GAFTGA σ54-interaction motif, with variants in others. Examples include DVU0110 (linked to exopolysaccharide/biofilm and transport), DVUA0057 (exopolysaccharide/biofilm), DVUA0143 (nitrogenase operon), and DVU2894 (flagellar module; conserved inverted repeat yGTCA–N6–TGACr). Many EBP genes co-localize with σ54 promoters. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 3-4, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 13-14, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 4-5)

6. Current applications and real-world implementations (SRB context)
• Biofilm control and corrosion: DVU2956’s σ54-dependent regulation modulates biofilm and H2S outputs, pointing to genetic control points with potential to mitigate microbiologically influenced corrosion by SRB. (zhu2019σ54dependentregulator pages 1-2)
• Anaerobe-specific systems: ORP σ54/IHF-dependent operons exemplify anaerobe-specific regulation that may modulate cell division/morphology and redox-related protein complexes under strict anaerobiosis. (fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 1-2, fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 12-13)

7. 2023–2024 updates relevant to SRB/deltaproteobacteria
• SRB biofilm studies (2024): RpoN (σ54) was explicitly monitored in Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis G20 biofilms on copper and graphene-coated copper, framed as a key activator of stress, motility, and survival-associated genes; the study described σ54-dependent two-component signaling as central to adaptation under surface/biofilm contexts. (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2024, Microorganisms, Aug 2024). (gopalakrishnan2024impactofgraphene pages 5-8)
• Comparative cross-phyla perspective (2025, included for motif/domain currency): Large-scale analysis across 16 phyla confirmed σ54 promoter architecture, domain composition, and broad process coverage (nitrogen, motility, secretion, biofilms), providing updated reference PSSMs and an online database (aRpoNDB). (carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 2-4, carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 28-30, carrerareyna2025analysisandcomparison pages 1-2)

8. Expert consensus and mechanistic reviews
• EBPs as specialized σ54 activators: EBPs universally use a central AAA+ ATPase with the σ54-interacting GAFTGA loop; regulation is typically via phosphorylation (NtrC-like), ligand sensing (PAS/GAF/V4R), or partner proteins (e.g., PspA–PspF). (bush2014interdomainrepressionin pages 67-68)
• σ54 structural mechanism: σ54 stabilizes a closed RNAP–promoter complex; EBP ATPase action is required to reorganize σ54 and enable DNA melting and template loading. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)

9. Relevant statistics and specific examples
• Network size: 36 regulons; 201 protein-coding genes + 4 ncRNAs; 87 σ54 promoters upstream of 85 operons; 37 EBPs in D. vulgaris Hildenborough; 25 EBPs with exact GAFTGA motif. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 3-4)
• Functional distribution: ≈37 operons for flagella/cell exterior; ≈24 operons for metabolism/transport, including nitrogen fixation/assimilation and carboxylic-acid metabolism; additional modules in amino acid/amide catabolism and type III secretion. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7)
• Promoter consensus: tGGcacg (−24), tTGCt (−12); UASs upstream, with IHF sites facilitating looping at ORP promoters. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 13-14, fievet2014ihfisrequired pages 1-2)
• EBP exemplars: DVU2106 (ORP; PAS-type; σ54/IHF dependent), DVU2956 (biofilm/planktonic/H2S; Hmc and hydrogenase), DVU0110 and DVUA0057 (EPS/biofilm), DVUA0143 (nitrogenase), DVU2894 (flagella). (fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 1-2, fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 12-13, zhu2019σ54dependentregulator pages 1-2, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 3-4, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 13-14, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 4-5)

10. Conclusions and functional annotation for rpoN (Q72BK7)
• Primary function: rpoN encodes σ54, the alternative sigma factor that directs RNAP to −24/−12 promoters and absolutely requires EBP ATPase activity for transcription initiation; it broadly controls motility/flagella, extracellular structures, nitrogen and carbon metabolism, secretion, and stress-adaptive systems in D. vulgaris. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7)
• Localization: cytosolic, acting at chromosomal promoters within the nucleoid as part of the RNAP holoenzyme; function requires DNA looping and EBP contact. (kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 1-3)
• Pathways: σ54-dependent operons include ORP (DVU2103–2105; DVU2107–2109) with EBP DVU2106 and IHF; biofilm/H2S control via EBP DVU2956 targeting Hmc and Fe-only hydrogenase; broader regulons encompass nitrogen fixation/assimilation and motility. (fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 1-2, fievet2011theanaerobespecificorange pages 12-13, fievet2014ihfisrequired pages 1-2, zhu2019σ54dependentregulator pages 1-2, kazakov2015σ54dependentregulomein pages 5-7)
• 2023–2024 perspective: SRB biofilm studies continued to track σ54 as a central stress/biofilm regulator in deltaproteobacteria, supporting its relevance to corrosion and surface-associated growth. (gopalakrishnan2024impactofgraphene pages 5-8)

Limitations
Direct experimental characterization of Q72BK7 in D. vulgaris Hildenborough at the protein level is limited in the cited set; most functional assertions are based on the well-established σ54 mechanism and organism-level regulon mapping coupled with EBP functional studies. Additional 2023–2024 D. vulgaris-specific experiments on σ54 per se were not identified in this search, though SRB-level studies tracked RpoN expression in biofilm contexts.

Overall, rpoN (Q72BK7) encodes σ54, a central transcriptional regulator in D. vulgaris Hildenborough with an extensive sigmulon controlling motility, extracellular structures, nitrogen/carbon metabolism, secretion, and stress/biofilm-associated pathways, activated exclusively by specialized σ54 EBPs.
