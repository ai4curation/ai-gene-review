  label: Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough
description: >-
  RpoN (sigma-54) is an alternative sigma factor that directs bacterial RNA polymerase
  to recognize -24/-12 type promoters. Unlike the housekeeping sigma-70, sigma-54 forms
  a transcriptionally inactive closed complex with RNAP that absolutely requires ATP
  hydrolysis by enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs) to transition to the open complex and
  initiate transcription. In D. vulgaris Hildenborough, sigma-54 regulates an extensive
  regulon of 36 regulons covering 201 protein-coding genes, including flagellar assembly,
  nitrogen fixation/assimilation, biofilm formation, the anaerobe-specific Orange Protein
  (ORP) complex, and various metabolic pathways. The protein contains three characteristic
  domains: an N-terminal activator-interaction domain (AID) that contacts EBPs, a central
  core-binding domain (CBD) that associates with RNAP core, and a C-terminal DNA-binding
  domain (DBD) for -24/-12 promoter recognition.

    summary: >-
      Sigma factor activity is the core molecular function of rpoN. Sigma-54 acts as the
      promoter specificity subunit for -24/-12 class promoters in bacteria. The protein
      combines with the RNAP core to form a holoenzyme that recognizes specific promoter
      elements.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of sigma-54. The deep research confirms that
      rpoN encodes the sigma-54 factor that directs RNAP to -24/-12 promoters. The D. vulgaris
      sigma-54 promoter consensus is tGGcacg (-24) and tTGCt (-12). This annotation directly
      reflects the core biochemical activity of the protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is mechanistically incorrect for sigma-54. Unlike sigma-70, sigma-54
      does NOT have intrinsic transcription activator activity. Instead, sigma-54 forms a
      CLOSED complex that actively blocks transcription initiation until EBPs provide the
      ATP-dependent remodeling signal. Sigma-54 is better characterized as a transcription
      specificity factor that gates promoter access.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The deep research clearly establishes that sigma-54 forms a transcriptionally inactive
      closed complex with RNAP and requires ATP-dependent remodeling by EBPs to form the open
      complex. This is fundamentally different from transcription activators which directly
      enhance transcription. Sigma-54 actually INHIBITS transcription until EBPs activate it.
      The IEA annotation from InterPro domains IPR000394 and IPR007634 conflates promoter
      recognition with transcription activation, which are mechanistically distinct for sigma-54.
      GO:0016987 (sigma factor activity) correctly captures this function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma-54 has a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD, Pfam PF04552) that recognizes
      -24/-12 promoter elements. However, this DNA binding occurs only in the context
      of the RNAP holoenzyme - sigma-54 does not bind DNA on its own.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The UniProt entry documents the RNA polymerase sigma factor 54 DNA-binding domain
      (residues 315-473). This is a legitimate function, although the GO term definition
      notes that sigma does not bind DNA on its own, but when combined with the core to form
      the holoenzyme, the sigma factor binds specifically to promoter elements. The deep
      research confirms sigma-54 recognizes specific -24/-12 promoter elements in D. vulgaris.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. Sigma factors do not have nucleotidyltransferase activity.
      The catalytic activity of RNA polymerase (RNA synthesis) is performed by the core subunits
      (beta, beta-prime), not by the sigma factor. Sigma-54 is a promoter specificity subunit
      that determines WHERE transcription occurs, not an enzyme that catalyzes nucleotide transfer.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear over-annotation based on the UniProtKB keyword KW-0548 (Nucleotidyltransferase).
      The keyword mapping is inappropriate for sigma factors. The sigma subunit provides promoter
      recognition but does not participate in the catalytic RNA synthesis reaction. The GO term
      GO:0016987 definition explicitly states that sigma factors bind specifically to promoter
      elements and are released once elongation begins - they are not catalytic subunits.
      Sigma-54 lacks any nucleotidyltransferase domain.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT for the same reason as nucleotidyltransferase activity.
      Sigma-54 has no catalytic transferase function. It is a regulatory subunit that provides
      promoter specificity, not an enzyme.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a parent term of nucleotidyltransferase activity and is equally inappropriate.
      Sigma factors are NOT enzymes. The UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-0808, Transferase) is
      incorrect for sigma factors, which function as promoter specificity factors rather than
      catalytic subunits. No transferase domain is present in sigma-54 domain architecture.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma-54 is a subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex. When associated
      with the core RNAP (alpha2-beta-beta-prime), it forms the sigma-54 holoenzyme that
      recognizes -24/-12 promoters.

      This cellular component annotation is correct. Sigma-54 associates with the RNAP core
      via its central core-binding domain (CBD, Pfam PF04963) to form the holoenzyme. The
      deep research confirms sigma-54 operates in the bacterial nucleoid as part of the
      RNAP holoenzyme, acting at chromosomal promoters.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma-54 is directly involved in transcription initiation at -24/-12 promoters,
      although its mechanism is distinct from sigma-70 in that it requires EBP activation.
      Once activated, sigma-54 participates in the transition from closed to open complex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This biological process annotation is appropriate. Sigma-54 is essential for
      transcription initiation at its cognate promoters. The requirement for EBP activation
      does not negate its role in initiation - it defines the specific mechanism. In D. vulgaris,
      87 sigma-54-dependent promoters drive transcription initiation of 85 operons.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is problematic because sigma-54 does not positively regulate transcription
      in isolation - it forms a CLOSED complex that blocks transcription until activated by EBPs.
      The positive regulation comes from the EBPs, not from sigma-54 itself.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The logical inference from GO:0001216 (DNA-binding transcription activator activity) to
      GO:0045893 is based on the incorrect premise that sigma-54 has activator activity. Sigma-54
      actually forms a closed complex that must be opened by EBPs. The more accurate annotation
      is GO:0006355 (regulation of DNA-templated transcription), which is already present.
      Sigma-54 enables transcription of specific genes when activated, but the positive regulation
      comes from the EBP signal, not sigma-54.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma-54 does regulate transcription initiation by determining which promoters are
      recognized and by controlling the transition from closed to open complex (via EBP
      requirement). This is more specific than GO:0006355 but accurately reflects sigma-54
      function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation correctly captures that sigma-54 regulates the initiation step of
      transcription. The sigma-54-dependent promoters require both sigma-54 for recognition
      and EBPs for activation, representing a regulatory checkpoint at initiation. The
      logical inference from GO:0016987 (sigma factor activity) to this term is valid.
