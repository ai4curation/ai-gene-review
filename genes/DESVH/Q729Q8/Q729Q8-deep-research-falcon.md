## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q729Q8
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Carbon monoxide-induced hydrogenase CooH, putative {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS96764.1};
- **Gene Information:** OrderedLocusNames=DVU_2291 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS96764.1};
- **Organism (full):** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ComplexI_49kDa-like. (IPR052197); NADH_Q_OxRdtase_suD. (IPR001135); Ni-dep_hyd_lsu. (IPR001501); NiFe-Hase_large. (IPR029014); Complex1_49kDa (PF00346)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "Q729Q8" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'Q729Q8' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **Q729Q8** (gene ID: Q729Q8, UniProt: Q729Q8) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

- Objective 7 (final report): Provided below.

Comprehensive research report: DVU_2291 (UniProt Q729Q8) — CooH in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and organism: DVU_2291 encodes the large subunit (CooH) of a carbon monoxide-induced [NiFe]-hydrogenase in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (also referenced as Nitratidesulfovibrio/Desulfovibrio vulgaris). This assignment is supported by protein–protein interactomics and operon-context analyses in D. vulgaris Hildenborough. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (published Jun 30, 2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).
- Protein family and domains: Bioinformatic annotations place DVU_2291 in the [NiFe]-hydrogenase large-subunit family (NiFe-Hase_large/Ni-dep_hyd_lsu) with a ComplexI_49kDa-like fold characteristic of group 4 (energy-converting) [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which typically form multi-subunit membrane-associated complexes. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069 (published Mar 30, 2011) (pereira2011acomparativegenomic pages 14-15).

Operon architecture, regulation, and localization
- Operon context: In D. vulgaris Hildenborough, the Coo-type hydrogenase locus is organized as cooMKLXUH, encoding a membrane-linked, cytoplasmically oriented hydrogenase, while the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) locus is in a separate region (cooFSCTJ). The arrangement suggests functional coupling between CODH (CooS) and the Coo hydrogenase, but with distinct operons; transcriptional control appears to involve the CO-sensing regulator CooA. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).
- Subcellular localization: CooH (DVU_2291) is part of a membrane-bound complex oriented toward the cytoplasm, consistent with energy-conserving group 4 [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Such membrane association enables coupling of H2 interconversion to electron transport/ion translocation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011); URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9, pereira2011acomparativegenomic pages 14-15).

Catalytic activity, cofactors, and maturation (current understanding)
- Catalytic role: As a [NiFe]-hydrogenase large subunit, CooH houses the heterobimetallic Ni–Fe active site that catalyzes the reversible interconversion between H2 and protons/electrons. In the context of CO metabolism, CooH is proposed to receive low-potential electrons generated by CODH (CooS) oxidation of CO, using them to produce H2 (i.e., CO oxidation linked to H2 evolution) or to feed electrons into respiratory modules, depending on physiological conditions. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011); URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9, pereira2011acomparativegenomic pages 14-15).
- Active-site chemistry: Contemporary reviews emphasize that [NiFe]-hydrogenases share a conserved Ni–Fe(CN)2CO cofactor coordinated by cysteine residues, with outer-sphere protein environment tuning oxygen tolerance, catalytic bias (oxidation vs evolution), and reversibility. While these reviews are not DVU_2291-specific, they define the mechanistic framework applicable to CooH. URL: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4sc00691g (published Mar 22, 2024) (sokolova2024exploitinghydrogenasesfor pages 1-2).

Interactions and protein partnerships
- Interacting subunits and partners: Affinity pulldown experiments in D. vulgaris Hildenborough identified co-purification of CooU with CooH under the conditions tested, supporting assembly of at least part of the CooMKLXUH complex. The study also observed association of CooH with DsrC (DVU_2776), a central electron-transfer protein in sulfate reduction, via detection of a modified DsrC peptide in the pulldown, suggesting physiological electron-transfer connectivity. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).
- CODH linkage: Genomic neighborhood and regulatory evidence imply functional association of the Coo hydrogenase with the CODH (CooS)-containing locus, though the two operons are distinct; in other bacteria, analogous complexes physically couple CODH and hydrogenase for CO-driven H2 evolution, supporting a similar model in D. vulgaris. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).

Physiological role and pathway context in CO metabolism
- CO metabolism model: In carboxydotrophic contexts, CODH (CooS) oxidizes CO to CO2, generating reduced electron carriers (e.g., ferredoxin) that can be directed to the Coo hydrogenase (CooMKLXUH) for H2 production or routed into respiratory chains. This scheme aligns with the separation yet coordinated regulation of CODH and CooH operons and the detection of partial complex assembly. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011); URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9, pereira2011acomparativegenomic pages 14-15).

Current applications and real-world implementations (hydrogenase field, 2023–2024 focus)
- Biocatalytic hydrogenations and cofactor recycling: Recent work highlights practical deployment of [NiFe]-hydrogenases for H2-driven biocatalysis, including NAD(P)H recycling and site-separated hydrogenation cascades on conductive supports, offering greener alternatives to precious-metal catalysis. These developments demonstrate how hydrogenases’ H2 activation can be wired to reduction reactions relevant to synthesis and manufacturing. URL: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4cc04525d (published Oct 2024) (sokolova2024exploitinghydrogenasesfor pages 1-2).
- Tuning catalytic properties by outer-sphere effects: 2024 expert review outlines how modifications to residues and second-sphere features modulate O2 sensitivity, catalytic bias, and reversibility of [NiFe]-hydrogenases, guiding enzyme selection and engineering for applications (e.g., O2-tolerant, high-affinity, or production-biased catalysts). URL: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4sc00691g (published Mar 22, 2024) (sokolova2024exploitinghydrogenasesfor pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Network-level insights in D. vulgaris Hildenborough: The affinity-purification interactome underscores the presence of two membrane-bound cytoplasmically oriented hydrogenases, including the Coo-type, and suggests specialized electron-transfer routes tied to oxidoreductases and sulfate reduction machinery, including a putative role for CooH in CO-responsive energy metabolism. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).
- Comparative metabolism perspective: Comparative genomics of sulfate-reducing bacteria indicates common deployment of complex I homologs, Rnf, and Ech/Coo-type hydrogenases for energy conservation, supporting the inference that DVU_2291 functions within a membrane-associated electron-transport framework in D. vulgaris. URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2011.00069 (2011) (pereira2011acomparativegenomic pages 14-15).
- Application-focused expert view (2023–2024): Hydrogenase researchers emphasize the promise of [NiFe]-hydrogenases as industrial biocatalysts due to selectivity for H2 activation and emerging strategies for oxygen tolerance and catalytic tuning, informing future translation of Coo-type enzymes where expression/stability can be achieved. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4cc04525d (Oct 2024); https://doi.org/10.1039/d4sc00691g (Mar 2024) (sokolova2024exploitinghydrogenasesfor pages 1-2).

Recent statistics and data
- Pulldown interactomics in D. vulgaris: Experimental co-purification of CooU with CooH and detection of DsrC peptides provide direct evidence for complex assembly and potential electron-transfer connections in vivo; the study also reports that some membrane subunits are under-represented due to extraction limitations, a common caveat in membrane-complex proteomics. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021470 (2011) (chhabra2011towardsarigorous pages 8-9).
- Field-wide performance indicators: 2024 reviews summarize productivities and operational contexts for hydrogenase-enabled hydrogenations and cofactor recycling, though enzyme-specific turnover numbers depend on the scaffold and configuration; these reviews serve as authoritative summaries for technology readiness and performance benchmarks. URL: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4cc04525d (Oct 2024) (sokolova2024exploitinghydrogenasesfor pages 1-2).

Conclusions
- DVU_2291 (Q729Q8) in D. vulgaris Hildenborough encodes CooH, the large subunit of a CO-induced [NiFe]-hydrogenase that is part of a membrane-bound, cytoplasmically oriented multi-subunit complex (CooMKLXUH). Genomic organization indicates coordination with a separate CODH operon (cooFSCTJ) under CO-responsive regulation (CooA). Pulldown evidence supports interaction with CooU and association with DsrC, situating CooH at a nexus of CO oxidation, hydrogen metabolism, and energy conservation. While organism-specific kinetic parameters are not reported in the retrieved sources, current hydrogenase research provides a strong mechanistic and applied framework for understanding and potentially exploiting this enzyme system.
