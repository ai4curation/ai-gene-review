  label: Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain Hildenborough)
description: >-
  RpoC is the beta' subunit of bacterial DNA-directed RNA polymerase (RNAP) in
  Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (formerly Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
  This essential enzyme subunit forms the catalytic core of the RNAP holoenzyme
  (alpha2-beta-beta'-omega) and contains the active site for phosphodiester bond
  formation during transcription. The beta' subunit houses the bridge helix (BH),
  trigger loop (TL), and clamp/switch regions that govern DNA loading, open-complex
  formation, nucleotide addition, and pausing/termination dynamics. RpoC binds
  1 Mg2+ ion at the active site (essential for catalysis) and 2 Zn2+ ions that
  play structural roles. In D. vulgaris, RpoC (DVU_2929) has been experimentally
  validated through proteomics and protein-protein interaction studies showing
  its association with other RNAP subunits including RpoB.

    summary: >-
      The beta' subunit of RNAP contains the catalytic active site with conserved
      aspartate residues (D466, D468, D470 in Q727C6) that coordinate Mg2+ ions
      essential for phosphodiester bond formation during transcription. This is
      a well-established core function of the RpoC subunit based on UniProt
      annotation and extensive structural studies of bacterial RNAP
      (file:DESVH/Q727C6/Q727C6-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Magnesium binding is essential for RNAP catalytic activity. The UniProt entry
      clearly documents Mg2+ binding at residues 466, 468, and 470 based on HAMAP
      rule MF_01322. The deep research confirms the active-site metals via FEL
      and structural work (file:DESVH/Q727C6/Q727C6-deep-research-falcon.md).

      RpoC is a core component of the bacterial RNAP complex (alpha2-beta-beta'-omega).
      DvH proteomics and PPI studies confirm that DVU_2929 (RpoC) co-purifies with

      UniProt records experimental interaction evidence (IntAct) showing RpoC interacts
      with RpoB (Q727C7) with 4 experiments documented. This cellular component
      annotation accurately captures where RpoC functions.

  review:
    summary: >-
      RpoC contributes to DNA binding as part of the RNAP complex. The beta' subunit
      contains the clamp domain that contacts template DNA and helps maintain the
      transcription bubble. However, the beta' subunit alone is not the primary
      DNA-binding component - sigma factors provide promoter specificity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While the beta' subunit does contact DNA as part of the RNAP complex (through
      clamp/switch regions that help hold the DNA template), this annotation is
      appropriate at a general level. The domain-based inference (InterPro domains
      IPR000722, IPR006592, etc.) correctly identifies this function. The clamp
      dynamics of beta' are essential for DNA loading and bubble maintenance
      (file:DESVH/Q727C6/Q727C6-deep-research-falcon.md).

      This annotation captures the core enzymatic function. While the complete RNAP

      residues for phosphodiester bond formation. The UniProt entry assigns EC 2.7.7.6

      The beta' subunit contains two zinc-binding sites with conserved cysteine
      residues. In Q727C6, Zn2+ site 1 uses C75, C77, C90, C93, and Zn2+ site 2
      uses residues at positions 809, 883, 890, 893. These zinc ions play

      Zinc binding is well documented for the RpoC subunit. The UniProt entry

      While GO:0003899 is more specific, this intermediate-level term from the

      nucleotidyl groups (from NTPs to the growing RNA chain). This annotation

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IPI annotation is based on AP-MS protein-protein interaction data from
      a systematic D. vulgaris interactome study. RpoC was shown to interact with
      RpoB (Q727C7), which is biologically expected as these are adjacent subunits
      in the RNAP complex (PMID:26873250).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While the protein binding annotation captures a true interaction, "protein binding"
      (GO:0005515) is uninformative. The specific interaction is with RpoB within
      the RNAP complex. A more informative annotation would be to GO:0000428
      (DNA-directed RNA polymerase complex) as a cellular component annotation,
      which already exists. The molecular function annotation should reflect the
      specific binding context.
