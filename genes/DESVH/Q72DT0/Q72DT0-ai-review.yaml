description: |
  HdrA is the FAD- and iron-sulfur cluster-containing subunit of the cytoplasmic
  FlxABCD-HdrABC complex in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. This protein
  functions as the bifurcating/confurcating core of the complex, containing six
  [4Fe-4S] clusters and one FAD cofactor that enable flavin-based electron
  bifurcation (FEB). The FlxABCD-HdrABC ensemble acts as a novel NADH
  dehydrogenase/heterodisulfide reductase that couples mid-potential NADH oxidation
  with endergonic low-potential ferredoxin reduction and DsrC protein disulfide
  chemistry. This electron coupling is essential for energy conservation during
  dissimilatory sulfate reduction and fermentative growth. HdrA belongs to the HdrA
  protein family and is homologous to heterodisulfide reductase subunits found in
  methanogens, though in sulfate-reducing bacteria it partners with the DsrC sulfur
  carrier rather than CoM-CoB heterodisulfide.

  review:
    summary: |
      HdrA functions as the FAD-containing bifurcating subunit of the FlxABCD-HdrABC
      complex, mediating electron transfer between NADH, ferredoxin, and DsrC
      (Ferreira 2023). The term "oxidoreductase activity" is accurate but very general
      for a protein with such specific electron bifurcation function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      The IEA annotation based on InterPro domain IPR023753 (FAD/NAD-binding domain)
      correctly identifies oxidoreductase activity. While this term is broad, it
      accurately captures the fundamental catalytic function. More specific terms
      for electron bifurcation activity do not yet exist in GO. The protein's
      FAD-dependent electron transfer function in the FlxABCD-HdrABC complex is
      well-documented (Ferreira 2023).

  review:
    summary: |
      HdrA contains multiple iron-sulfur clusters that bind iron ions as part of
      their electron transfer function. The annotation is correct but less
      informative than the more specific iron-sulfur cluster binding terms.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: |
      This IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0479 (Metal-binding) is
      correct. HdrA contains six [4Fe-4S] clusters that require iron binding
      (Ferreira 2023). While more specific annotations for 4Fe-4S cluster binding
      are also present, this general term is not incorrect and can be retained
      as it is encompassed by the more specific terms.

      This IEA annotation based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0004 (4Fe-4S) is highly

    summary: |
      High-throughput AP-MS study in D. vulgaris identified interaction between
      Q72DT0 (HdrA/DVU_0849) and Q72DS8 (DVU_0851). Q72DS8 is likely HdrC or a
      Flx subunit based on genomic context. This interaction is biologically
      meaningful as HdrA functions within the FlxABCD-HdrABC complex.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: |
      While the protein-protein interaction is experimentally validated (IPI evidence
      from AP-MS), the term "protein binding" (GO:0005515) is uninformative. HdrA
      physically interacts with other subunits of the FlxABCD-HdrABC complex as
      part of its electron bifurcation function. A more specific term would better
      capture the functional nature of this interaction. However, no more specific
      GO term adequately captures the interaction between electron bifurcating
      complex subunits. The interaction supports the complex formation but
      "protein binding" alone provides minimal functional insight.

      The interaction with Q72DT1 (DVU_0848) is experimentally validated and
      biologically meaningful - this represents HdrA-HdrB interaction within
      the heterodisulfide reductase complex. However, "protein binding" is too
      generic. The HdrA-HdrB interaction is essential for the electron bifurcation
      mechanism, where HdrB contains additional [4Fe-4S] clusters that receive
      electrons from HdrA.
