description: >
  RNA polymerase sigma factor SigA (RpoD) is the primary/housekeeping sigma-70 factor in
  Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (formerly Desulfovibrio vulgaris) Hildenborough. Sigma factors
  are initiation factors that promote the attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation
  sites and are then released. RpoD is the principal sigma factor during exponential growth,
  directing RNA polymerase to housekeeping gene promoters. The protein contains conserved
  sigma-70 domains: region 2 (recognizes -10 promoter element and promotes DNA melting),
  region 4 (contains helix-turn-helix motif that recognizes -35 promoter element), region 1.2
  (contributes to promoter escape), and region 1.1 (modulates promoter complex formation).
  RpoD interacts transiently with the RNA polymerase catalytic core to form the holoenzyme
  and functions in the cytoplasm during transcription initiation.

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is appropriate but represents an indirect consequence of sigma factor
      function rather than the core activity. Sigma factors directly participate in transcription
      initiation rather than regulating it. The term describes modulation of the frequency/rate
      of transcription initiation, whereas sigma factors are essential components of the
      transcription initiation machinery itself.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >
      While RpoD does influence transcription initiation rates by directing RNAP to promoters,
      this is a downstream effect of its primary sigma factor activity (GO:0016987). The core
      function is sigma factor activity enabling promoter recognition and transcription initiation,
      not regulation of that process. This annotation captures a true aspect of sigma factor
      biology but at a less precise level than the more specific terms.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is correct but very general. RpoD binds DNA specifically at promoter
      sequences through its sigma-70 domains. Region 2 recognizes the -10 element and region 4
      recognizes the -35 element via a helix-turn-helix motif (residues 550-569 in Q72B50).
      However, sigma factors do not bind DNA independently - they only recognize promoter DNA
      when complexed with RNAP core as part of the holoenzyme.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      DNA binding is a fundamental activity of sigma factors, although it occurs in the context
      of the holoenzyme complex. The UniProt entry documents a DNA_BIND region (H-T-H motif at
      residues 550-569) which directly supports this annotation. This is appropriately general
      for an IEA annotation.

    summary: >
      This annotation is INCORRECT for sigma factors. The GO term definition states that
      DNA-binding transcription factors modulate transcription via "selective and non-covalent
      binding to a specific double-stranded genomic DNA sequence within a cis-regulatory region."
      While sigma factors do recognize promoter elements, they do not function as transcription
      factors that independently bind DNA to regulate transcription. Sigma factors are integral
      components of the transcription machinery, not regulatory factors.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      Sigma factors have a distinct molecular function (GO:0016987 sigma factor activity) that
      is fundamentally different from transcription factor activity. Sigma factors do not bind
      DNA independently - they only bind promoter DNA when part of the RNAP holoenzyme. The
      GO guidelines explicitly note that sigma factors should be annotated to sigma factor
      activity, not transcription factor activity. This InterPro-derived annotation is an
      over-generalization.

      This is an excellent and appropriate biological process annotation for sigma factors.
      The primary function of RpoD is to enable transcription initiation by directing RNAP
      to promoters. The GO term describes "The initial step of transcription, consisting of

      This is a core biological process annotation that accurately captures the essential

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is redundant and less specific than GO:0006352 (DNA-templated transcription
      initiation). While sigma factors do influence transcription, they are more precisely
      involved in the initiation process itself rather than regulation of transcription broadly.
      This term is an ancestor of more specific transcription-related terms.

      This is a broader parent term that is technically true but not the most informative

      acceptable for completeness but represents an over-generalization of sigma factor function.

      This is a very high-level annotation that is technically correct but not very informative.

    reason: >
      While sigma factors do affect gene expression by determining which promoters are
      recognized by RNAP, this annotation is at too high a level of abstraction to be
      informative. More specific terms (GO:0006352, GO:0016987) better capture the actual
      molecular role of sigma factors. This annotation adds little value beyond the more
      specific terms.

      This is the most precise and appropriate molecular function annotation for RpoD.
      Sigma factor activity is defined as the promoter specificity subunit of bacterial
      RNA polymerases that, when combined with the core enzyme to form the holoenzyme,
      binds specifically to promoter elements. This exactly describes the function of RpoD.
    action: ACCEPT

      multisubunit RNA polymerases... Although sigma does not bind DNA on its own, when

  review:
    summary: >
      This annotation is based on high-throughput AP-MS (affinity purification-mass spectrometry)
      data from the Butland et al. D. vulgaris interactome study. The UniProt entry shows
      RpoD interacts with DVU_1368 (Q72CB5) with 2 experiments in IntAct. However, "protein
      binding" is an uninformative term that should be replaced with a more specific binding
      term if possible.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While the protein-protein interaction is experimentally supported, "protein binding"
      (GO:0005515) is explicitly discouraged in GO annotation guidelines as uninformative.
      For sigma factors, the known protein interactions are with RNAP core subunits (RpoA,
      RpoB, RpoC). The UniProt entry notes "Interacts transiently with the RNA polymerase
      catalytic core" and shows a motif for "Interaction with polymerase core subunit RpoC"
      at residues 380-383. A more appropriate term would be RNA polymerase binding or a
