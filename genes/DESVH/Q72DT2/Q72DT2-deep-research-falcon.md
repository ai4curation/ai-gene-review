## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q72DT2
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=Adenylyl-sulphate reductase, alpha subunit {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS95327.1}; EC=1.8.99.2 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS95327.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=aprA {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS95327.1}; OrderedLocusNames=DVU_0847 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:AAS95327.1};
- **Organism (full):** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** AprA. (IPR011803); FAD-dep_OxRdtase_2_FAD-bd. (IPR003953); FAD/NAD-bd_sf. (IPR036188); Fum_R/Succ_DH_flav-like_C_sf. (IPR037099); SdhA/FrdA/AprA. (IPR030664)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "aprA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris (strain ATCC 29579 / DSM 644 / CCUG 34227 / NCIMB 8303 / VKM B-1760 / Hildenborough) (Desulfovibrio vulgaris).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'aprA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **aprA** (gene ID: Q72DT2, UniProt: Q72DT2) in DESVH.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive Research Report: aprA (DVU_0847; UniProt Q72DT2) of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Target verification and identity: The gene aprA in DvH (ordered locus DVU_0847; UniProt Q72DT2) encodes the alpha subunit of adenylyl-sulfate (adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate, APS) reductase, the central enzyme in dissimilatory sulfate reduction that reduces APS to sulfite and AMP; it functions as a heterodimer with AprB (beta subunit) to form APS reductase (AprAB). In Desulfovibrio and other sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), AprAB is the canonical enzyme for this step in energy metabolism, distinguishing it from the assimilatory pathway variants. In DvH proteomics, AprA is explicitly mapped to DVU_0847, confirming the gene-protein assignment in this organism. (Barton et al., 2014; Leavitt et al., 2019) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19, leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9, leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 5-7)
- Enzyme class and reaction: APS reductase (EC 1.8.99.2) catalyzes APS + 2e− + H+ → AMP + sulfite (SO3(2−)). The AprA subunit houses the catalytic FAD, while AprB contains iron-sulfur clusters that mediate electron transfer, consistent with a flavoprotein-iron–sulfur oxidoreductase mechanism. (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Electron donor system and complex association: Electron delivery to AprAB is mediated by the membrane-associated Qmo (quinone-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase) complex (QmoABC), which couples quinone pool redox chemistry to APS reduction; genomic co-localization of aprAB with qmoABC is common in SRB and functionally linked to APS reduction. (Barton et al., 2014; D’Ermo et al., 2024; Saxena et al., 2023) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1086021 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19, d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8, saxena2023integrationoftext pages 5-6)
- Pathway context: In DvH’s dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfate is activated by ATP sulfurylase (Sat) to APS, reduced by AprAB to sulfite, and then by dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) to sulfide, with multiple electron transfer modules (including Qmo and downstream complexes) supporting energy conservation. (Barton et al., 2014; D’Ermo et al., 2024) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19, d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8)

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- Genome-wide fitness genetics in DvH (2023): A large RB‑TnSeq study in DvH mapped essential and conditionally essential genes across 2,741 loci under diverse conditions, providing a reference for sulfate-reduction gene fitness. Although focused broadly on metabolism, this dataset defines condition dependencies and essential gene sets relevant to sulfate reduction, establishing a contemporary genetic framework that includes the sulfate reduction module (sat/apr/dsr). (Trotter et al., 2023, Frontiers in Microbiology; Mar 2023) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1095191 (trotter2023largescalegeneticcharacterization pages 4-6)
- Updated mechanistic overview (2024): A 2024 scholarly chapter synthesizes sulfur bioenergetics, reaffirming that Sat→AprAB→DsrAB is the canonical dissimilatory route, with AprAB receiving electrons via Qmo linked to the quinone pool, emphasizing electron-transfer coupling and broader geochemical interplay. This contextualizes AprAB within redox network models that integrate quinone-linked electron flow. (D’Ermo et al., 2024; Jan 2024) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15 (d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Biogeochemistry and environmental monitoring: aprA/AprAB are widely used functional markers for detecting and quantifying SRB activity in sediments and subsurface environments, forming part of multi-gene panels with dsrAB and sat to infer sulfate reduction potential and activity. This has implications for interpreting sulfur-coupled carbon transformations and contaminant mobility. (Barton et al., 2014; D’Ermo et al., 2024) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19, d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8)
- Industrial relevance and corrosion: SRB-mediated sulfide generation (to which AprAB is central) underpins souring and microbiologically influenced corrosion problems; understanding AprAB and its regulation within the pathway informs strategies for monitoring and mitigation. (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 4-7)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Enzymology and electron transfer architecture: Authoritative review content consolidates the model in which AprA contains the catalytic FAD, AprB contributes Fe–S electron-transfer capacity, and QmoABC serves as the physiological electron donor, linking APS reduction to the quinone pool—placing AprAB at the hub of energy conservation in sulfate respiration. (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Systems perspective on sulfur bioenergetics: Expert synthesis in 2024 situates AprAB’s role within modular redox networks and geochemical cycles, underscoring the coupling between quinone redox chemistry and APS reduction and motivating integrative studies that combine genomics/proteomics with environmental geochemistry. (D’Ermo et al., 2024) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15 (d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Proteomics expression in DvH: In a DvH proteomics study testing perturbation of the downstream DsrC component, AprA (DVU_0847) abundance decreased in the mutant relative to wild type (−0.35 ± 0.21), and the associated QmoB (DVU_0849) also decreased (−0.52 ± 0.27), consistent with coordinated regulation and functional linkage in the sulfate-reduction chain. (Leavitt et al., 2019; Apr 2019) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658 (leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9, leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 5-7)
- Genome-wide fitness framework in DvH: RB‑TnSeq across 2,741 protein-coding genes identified extensive conditional phenotypes and essentiality patterns, delineating a modern genetic map for DvH metabolism that includes sulfate-reduction modules, which can be used to frame hypotheses about aprA essentiality under sulfate-respiring conditions. (Trotter et al., 2023; Mar 2023) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1095191 (trotter2023largescalegeneticcharacterization pages 4-6)

Functional annotation for aprA (DVU_0847; Q72DT2) in DvH
- Primary function and reaction: AprA is the alpha subunit of APS reductase (AprAB). Together with AprB, it catalyzes reduction of APS to sulfite and AMP; AprA contains the catalytic FAD cofactor, while AprB houses [4Fe–4S] clusters for electron transfer. Substrate: APS; products: sulfite + AMP. (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Subunit composition and cofactors: AprAB is an αβ heterodimer. AprA (FAD-binding flavoenzyme); AprB (Fe–S protein). These features align with UniProt domain annotations (FAD/NAD-binding and succinate dehydrogenase–like flavoprotein folds). (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Electron donor system: Physiological electrons are delivered from the membrane quinone pool via the QmoABC complex to AprAB, consistent with aprAB–qmoABC genomic linkage and coordinated protein abundance. (Barton et al., 2014; D’Ermo et al., 2024; Leavitt et al., 2019) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19, d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8, leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9)
- Genomic context in DvH: In DvH, aprA corresponds to DVU_0847 and is adjacent to qmo genes (e.g., qmoB DVU_0849), supporting an operonic/linkage relationship typical for SRB sulfate-reduction loci. (Leavitt et al., 2019) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658 (leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9)
- Cellular localization: AprAB is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme, functioning in proximity to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane-associated Qmo complex that connects to the quinone pool. (Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Pathway integration: AprA/AprAB sits between Sat (ATP sulfurylase) and DsrAB in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction chain, central to energy metabolism in DvH. (D’Ermo et al., 2024; Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8, barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)
- Organism-specific experimental evidence: DvH proteomics links DVU_0847 (AprA) to decreased abundance under DsrC perturbation, along with decreased QmoB, consistent with coordinated control; RB‑TnSeq in DvH provides a contemporary essentiality/fitness scaffold for sulfate-reduction genes. (Leavitt et al., 2019; Trotter et al., 2023) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1095191 (leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9, trotter2023largescalegeneticcharacterization pages 4-6, leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 5-7)

Ambiguity check
- The symbol aprA can be used broadly across bacteria and archaea for APS reductase alpha subunits. Here, the identity is unambiguous: DVU_0847 in DvH (UniProt Q72DT2), matching the organism Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and aligning with canonical AprA domains and the AprAB enzyme system. If literature on other organisms with aprA exists, it was not used to infer divergent functions here. (Leavitt et al., 2019; Barton et al., 2014) https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00658; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9269-1_10 (leavitt2019proteomicandisotopic pages 7-9, barton2014hydrogensulfidea pages 16-19)

Limitations and open questions
- While structures and biophysical details of AprAB are well-established in the SRB literature, the most recent organism-specific structural updates for DvH AprAB were not identified in the 2023–2024 window surveyed here. Nevertheless, multiple 2023–2024 sources reaffirm the mechanistic model and genetic context for AprAB/Qmo in sulfate reducers. (D’Ermo et al., 2024; Trotter et al., 2023) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-54306-7_15; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1095191 (d’ermo2024thecomplexinterplay pages 5-8, trotter2023largescalegeneticcharacterization pages 4-6)
