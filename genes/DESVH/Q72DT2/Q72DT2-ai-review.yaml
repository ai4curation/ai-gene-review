description: >-
  AprA is the alpha (catalytic) subunit of adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase (EC 1.8.99.2),
  the central enzyme in dissimilatory sulfate reduction. AprA contains the catalytic FAD
  cofactor and forms an alpha-beta heterodimer with AprB (the beta subunit containing [4Fe-4S]
  clusters) to constitute the functional AprAB enzyme. AprAB catalyzes the reduction of
  adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to AMP and sulfite, receiving electrons from the
  membrane-associated QmoABC complex which connects to the quinone pool. This enzyme sits
  between ATP sulfurylase (Sat) and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) in the
  dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. AprA is a soluble cytoplasmic protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on TreeGrafter propagation from a PANTHER node
      (PTN000908678) that encompasses both succinate dehydrogenase and APS reductase
      family members due to their shared FAD-binding domain architecture. While AprA
      shares structural homology with succinate dehydrogenase flavoproteins (both belong
      to the SdhA/FrdA/AprA family IPR030664), AprA catalyzes a completely different
      reaction. APS reductase (EC 1.8.99.2) catalyzes APS + 2e- + H+ -> AMP + sulfite.
      This is mechanistically distinct from succinate dehydrogenase activity.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      AprA does not catalyze succinate dehydrogenation. The structural similarity with
      succinate dehydrogenase flavoproteins (shared FAD-binding domain) does not imply
      functional equivalence. AprA specifically reduces APS to sulfite and AMP as part
      of dissimilatory sulfate reduction. This is a clear case of over-annotation from
      domain-based phylogenetic inference.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      This localization annotation from TreeGrafter is incorrect for AprA. The deep
      research clearly indicates that AprAB is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme, functioning
      in proximity to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane-associated Qmo complex.
      While AprAB does interact with the membrane-associated QmoABC complex for electron
      transfer, AprA itself is not membrane-localized.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      AprA is a soluble cytoplasmic protein, not a plasma membrane protein. The
      TreeGrafter annotation likely propagated from succinate dehydrogenase family
      members which are membrane-associated. AprA functions in the cytoplasm where it
      receives electrons from the membrane-associated Qmo complex.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is marginally appropriate but misattributes function within the
      AprAB complex. The electron transfer function is primarily associated with AprB,
      which contains the iron-sulfur clusters responsible for shuttling electrons to the
      catalytic site. AprA contains FAD at the catalytic site and performs the reduction
      of APS, but does not have the iron-sulfur clusters that mediate electron transfer.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While AprA participates in an electron-dependent reaction, the electron transfer
      activity per se is mediated by AprB (with its Fe-S clusters) and the QmoABC
      complex. AprA's role is catalytic reduction of APS using electrons delivered by
      AprB. This annotation conflates the catalytic function of AprA with the electron
      transfer function of its partner subunit.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is accurate but insufficiently specific. AprA functions specifically
      in dissimilatory sulfate reduction, a type of anaerobic respiration where sulfate
      serves as the terminal electron acceptor. In DvH's dissimilatory sulfate reduction,
      sulfate is activated by ATP sulfurylase (Sat) to APS, reduced by AprAB to sulfite,
      and then by dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) to sulfide.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While anaerobic respiration is technically correct, the more specific term
      GO:0019420 (dissimilatory sulfate reduction) precisely captures AprA's biological
      role. AprA catalyzes a key step in this pathway where APS is reduced to sulfite.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is accurate. AprA contains a FAD cofactor that is essential for
      its catalytic function. UniProt lists FAD as a cofactor (ChEBI:57692), and the
      deep research confirms that AprA contains the catalytic FAD. The protein has a
      FAD-binding domain (IPR003953, Pfam:PF00890).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      FAD binding is well-established for AprA based on domain architecture (FAD-binding_2
      domain) and functional characterization. The FAD cofactor is central to the
      catalytic mechanism of APS reduction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the core molecular function of AprA. The annotation is based on EC mapping
      (EC:1.8.99.2), which is the correct enzyme classification for APS reductase. The
      deep research extensively supports this: AprA in DvH (DVU_0847; UniProt Q72DT2)
      encodes the alpha subunit of adenylyl-sulfate (APS) reductase. APS reductase
      (EC 1.8.99.2) catalyzes APS + 2e- + H+ -> AMP + sulfite.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of AprA, strongly supported by multiple
      lines of evidence including EC classification, domain architecture (IPR011803
      AprA, TIGR02061), UniProt annotation, and extensive literature.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is accurate but represents a very general parent term. AprA is
      indeed an oxidoreductase (catalyzing the reduction of APS), and this annotation
      is derived from InterPro domain mapping (IPR037099) and the oxidoreductase UniProt
      keyword. However, the more specific term GO:0009973 (adenylyl-sulfate reductase
      activity) is already present and is more informative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While accurate, this is a high-level parent term that is redundant with the more
      specific GO:0009973. The annotation is technically correct based on the catalytic
      function of AprA in reducing APS.
