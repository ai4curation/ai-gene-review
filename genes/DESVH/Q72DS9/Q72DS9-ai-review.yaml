description: >-
  QmoC (DVU_0850) is the membrane-integral subunit C of the quinone-interacting
  membrane-bound oxidoreductase (QmoABC) complex in Desulfovibrio vulgaris
  Hildenborough. The Qmo complex functions as an electron transfer hub in
  dissimilatory sulfate reduction, transferring electrons from the menaquinone
  pool to adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase (AprAB). QmoC contains six
  transmembrane helices and a 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type domain, serving as the
  membrane anchor that interfaces with the quinone pool. The protein is
  essential for the anaerobic electron transport chain during sulfate
  respiration, connecting cytoplasmic electron donors to the terminal
  reduction of sulfate. Proteomic and interactome studies in D. vulgaris
  have validated the physical interaction between the Qmo complex and APS
  reductase.

  review:
    summary: >-
      QmoC is the membrane-integral subunit of the QmoABC complex. UniProt
      Phobius predictions identify six transmembrane helices (aa 121-145,
      165-186, 238-259, 279-297, 309-329, 341-362). Literature explicitly
      describes DVU0849-DVU0850 as encoding the quinone-interacting
      membrane-bound oxidoreductase complex. The deep research file confirms
      that the Qmo complex is membrane-associated and DVU_0850 is a membrane
      protein that interfaces with the quinone pool at the cytoplasmic membrane.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Multiple lines of evidence support plasma membrane localization.

      transmembrane di-heme cytochromes (Gene3D 1.20.950.20), and literature
      explicitly describing Qmo as membrane-bound. This is a core localization
      for QmoC function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      QmoC is a subunit of the quinone-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase
      (Qmo) complex. The complex transfers electrons between the quinone pool
      and APS reductase during dissimilatory sulfate reduction. While this
      annotation is correct, it is quite broad for a protein with a specific
      role in electron transfer to APS reductase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is accurate as QmoC is part of an oxidoreductase complex.
      UniProt keywords include "Oxidoreductase" and the protein belongs to
      the NarG-like superfamily (respiratory nitrate reductase-related).
      The term captures the general enzymatic category, though more specific
      terms for electron transfer activity could supplement this.

      QmoC contains a 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type domain (aa 61-86) and is predicted

      The protein clearly binds metal ions through its iron-sulfur cluster.

      While more specific child terms (iron ion binding, 4Fe-4S cluster binding)
      are also annotated, retaining this parent term is appropriate for
      completeness.
