description: >-
  DVU_0279 is a SulP/SLC26 family secondary-active anion transporter with a C-terminal STAS
  (Sulfate Transporter and Anti-Sigma factor antagonist) regulatory domain. Despite being named
  "sulfate permease family protein," comparative genomic analysis indicates DVU_0279 phylogenetically
  clusters with DauA-like dicarboxylate transporters rather than with sulfate-selective SulP members.
  The protein is a multi-pass integral membrane protein with 8 predicted transmembrane helices.
  DVU_0279 is one of three SulP-type transporters in D. vulgaris Hildenborough (along with DVU0053
  and DVU1999), but it is not essential for sulfate uptake; the organism relies primarily on CysZ
  transporters and possibly DVU0053 for sulfate import during dissimilatory sulfate reduction.
  The precise substrate specificity of DVU_0279 remains to be experimentally determined, but
  phylogenetic evidence suggests it may transport C4-dicarboxylates (e.g., succinate, fumarate)
  or related anions rather than sulfate.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The annotation to membrane (GO:0016020) is well-supported. UniProt predicts 8 transmembrane helices
      using Phobius. The protein contains both the SLC26A/SulP transmembrane domain (IPR011547) and a
      cytosolic STAS domain (IPR002645). The SLC26/SulP family members are established integral membrane
      transporters. However, GO:0016020 (membrane) is quite general; a more specific term like GO:0005886
      (plasma membrane) would be appropriate since bacterial SulP/SLC26 transporters localize to the
      inner/cytoplasmic membrane.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term GO:0016020 (membrane) is correct but too general. Given that this is a bacterial secondary-active
      transporter of the SulP/SLC26 family with multiple transmembrane domains, it should localize to the
      bacterial inner membrane (plasma membrane). The evidence from family homology and predicted topology
      (8 TM helices) supports annotation to the more specific term GO:0005886 (plasma membrane).

  review:
    summary: >-
      The annotation to transmembrane transport (GO:0055085) is appropriate as a general biological process
      term. DVU_0279 belongs to the SLC26A/SulP family (IPR001902), which are established secondary-active
      transmembrane transporters. The SulP/SLC26 family operates via an elevator-type alternating access
      mechanism with multiple anion-binding sites. However, this process term is quite general and does not
      specify the substrate being transported.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct. DVU_0279 is a member of the SulP/SLC26 family of anion transporters, which
      are well-characterized secondary-active transporters. While more specific process terms exist (such as
      GO:1902358 sulfate transmembrane transport), the evidence suggests DVU_0279 may not be primarily a sulfate
      transporter. The comparative genomics analysis places DVU_0279 with DauA-like dicarboxylate transporters,
      and it is not essential for sulfate uptake in D. vulgaris. Therefore, the general term GO:0055085 is
      appropriately conservative until experimental data clarify substrate specificity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is proposed based on domain architecture and family membership. The SLC26A/SulP family
      are established anion transporters that move inorganic anions (sulfate, bicarbonate, chloride, oxalate)
      across membranes. The STAS domain modulates transporter function.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      DVU_0279 contains the SLC26A/SulP domain (IPR011547, IPR001902), which defines a family of secondary-active
      anion transporters. While the precise substrate is unknown, family membership strongly supports annotation
      to monoatomic anion transmembrane transporter activity. This is more informative than no MF annotation while
      being appropriately general given the uncertainty about whether DVU_0279 transports sulfate vs. other anions.
