description: >-
  AprB is the beta subunit of adenylylsulfate (APS) reductase (EC 1.8.99.2) in the sulfate-reducing
  bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. The AprAB heterodimer catalyzes the two-electron
  reduction of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to sulfite and AMP, a central step in dissimilatory
  sulfate reduction. AprB is a small ferredoxin-like protein containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters that
  function as an intramolecular electron relay, transferring electrons from the membrane-associated
  QmoABC complex to the FAD cofactor in the catalytic alpha subunit AprA. AprB is a soluble
  cytoplasmic protein that transiently interacts with the membrane Qmo complex during electron
  transfer (KD approximately 90 nM).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is derived from EC number mapping (EC:1.8.99.2). AprB is indeed a subunit of
      the APS reductase enzyme, but AprB itself is the electron-transfer subunit containing two
      [4Fe-4S] clusters, not the catalytic subunit. The catalytic activity (APS reduction to sulfite
      and AMP) resides in AprA which contains the FAD cofactor. AprB's function is to relay electrons
      to AprA's FAD active site (Meyer & Kuever 2007, Meyer & Kuever 2008).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While AprB is essential for APS reductase function, the catalytic activity per se is mediated
      by the FAD-containing AprA subunit. AprB should be annotated with electron transfer activity
      rather than the catalytic adenylyl-sulfate reductase activity. The beta subunit serves as the
      electron conduit to the active site, which is a distinct molecular function from the catalytic
      chemistry itself.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping. While technically accurate (AprB
      participates in an oxidoreductase reaction as part of the AprAB complex), this term is too
      general and uninformative. AprB's specific role is electron transfer via its [4Fe-4S] clusters,
      not general oxidoreductase activity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      GO:0016491 (oxidoreductase activity) is a very high-level term that provides little functional
      insight. AprB's molecular function is more precisely described as electron transfer activity
      (GO:0009055), as the protein mediates directional electron flow from QmoABC to AprA's FAD
      cofactor during APS reduction.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping (Metal-binding, Iron). AprB binds iron
      as part of its two [4Fe-4S] clusters. However, this term is too general - the protein binds
      iron specifically in the context of iron-sulfur clusters, not as free metal ions.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While AprB does bind iron, this generic term fails to capture the biologically meaningful
      context. The iron binding is specifically within [4Fe-4S] clusters that are integral to the
      protein's electron transfer function. The more specific term GO:0051539 (4 iron, 4 sulfur
      cluster binding) is already annotated and is the appropriate level of specificity.

      also correctly annotated, this parent term can be retained as it captures the general Fe-S

      This annotation derives from UniProtKB keyword mapping (4Fe-4S). AprB specifically contains
      two [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin-type clusters (domains at positions 1-35 and 38-67 per UniProt).

      essential for the protein's electron transfer role, relaying electrons from membrane
