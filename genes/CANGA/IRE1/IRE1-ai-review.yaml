description: >-
  IRE1 (Ire1p) is a type I transmembrane serine/threonine-protein kinase and
  endoribonuclease that serves as the primary ER stress sensor in Trichoderma reesei
  (Hypocrea jecorina). It is the ortholog of S. cerevisiae IRE1 (P32361). The protein
  contains an N-terminal lumenal domain (residues 36-585) that senses unfolded proteins,
  a single transmembrane helix (residues 586-606), and a cytoplasmic portion with both
  a protein kinase domain (residues 809-1105) and a KEN/endoribonuclease domain (residues
  1108-1240). The T. reesei IRE1 has intrinsic kinase activity demonstrated by in vitro
  autophosphorylation assay (PMID:15480788). It can complement S. cerevisiae ire1 mutants,
  confirming functional conservation. Overexpression of ire1 upregulates UPR target genes
  (bip1, pdi1) and induces HAC1 mRNA splicing (PMID:15480788).

  review:
    summary: >-
      TreeGrafter IEA annotation for unfolded protein binding. GO:0051082 is proposed
      for obsoletion. IRE1 senses unfolded proteins via its lumenal domain, but this
      is a signaling/sensor function, not a chaperone function. Following the precedent
      set for S. cerevisiae IRE1 (P32361), this should be marked as over-annotated.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. While IRE1 detects unfolded proteins in
      the ER lumen, its binding serves a sensor/signaling function, not a chaperone
      function. IRE1 does not assist protein folding. The unfolded protein sensing
      function is already captured by GO:0036498 (IRE1-mediated unfolded protein
      response) and GO:0030968 (ER unfolded protein response). Following the yeast
      IRE1 (P32361) precedent where the same annotation was marked as over-annotated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TreeGrafter IEA annotation for apoptotic signaling in response to ER stress.
      This term is primarily relevant to metazoan IRE1alpha/beta where IRE1 contributes
      to apoptosis under prolonged ER stress via JNK pathway. T. reesei, like
      S. cerevisiae, does not have classical apoptosis. This annotation is inferred
      from metazoan orthologs and is not appropriate for this fungal protein.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Filamentous fungi do not have classical apoptosis. This annotation is inferred
      from mammalian IRE1 orthologs via TreeGrafter. Following the yeast IRE1 (P32361)
      precedent where the same annotation was marked as over-annotated for the same
      reason. The core function of T. reesei IRE1 is the UPR signaling pathway, not
      apoptotic signaling.

  review:
    summary: >-
      TreeGrafter IEA annotation for IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex. This complex is specific
      to metazoan IRE1alpha signaling. TRAF2 and ASK1 are metazoan-specific proteins
      that do not exist in fungi. T. reesei IRE1 cannot form this complex.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex is a metazoan-specific signaling complex. TRAF2
      and ASK1 have no orthologs in T. reesei or other filamentous fungi. This
      TreeGrafter annotation is incorrectly propagated from metazoan orthologs and
      is biologically impossible in this organism.
