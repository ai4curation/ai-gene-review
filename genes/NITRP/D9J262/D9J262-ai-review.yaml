aliases:
- Ammonia monooxygenase subunit A
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:338192
  label: Nitrosopumilus maritimus
description: AmoA is the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A that catalyzes the
  first step of nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to hydroxylamine. This copper-containing
  integral membrane protein is a critical component of the ammonia oxidation pathway
  in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which play essential roles in the global nitrogen
  cycle. The archaeal amoA is phylogenetically distinct from bacterial amoA and is
  often difficult to distinguish from particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) due
  to sequence similarity. This protein is widely used as a molecular marker gene for
  detecting and quantifying AOA in environmental samples.
