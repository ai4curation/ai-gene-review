  id: NCBITaxon:338192
  label: Nitrosopumilus maritimus
description: "AmoA is the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A that catalyzes the first step of nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to hydroxylamine. This copper-containing integral membrane protein is a critical component of the ammonia oxidation pathway in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which play essential roles in the global nitrogen cycle. The archaeal amoA is phylogenetically distinct from bacterial amoA and is often difficult to distinguish from particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) due to sequence similarity. This protein is widely used as a molecular marker gene for detecting and quantifying AOA in environmental samples."
