description: 'Ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) is a key marker gene for ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), catalyzing the first step of nitrification: ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine. As noted by the colleague, amoA is difficult to distinguish from pmoA (particulate methane monooxygenase) due to high sequence similarity - both are copper-dependent membrane-bound monooxygenases with homologous active sites. This archaeal amoA from marine ammonia oxidizer N. maritimus represents the dominant ammonia oxidizers in many environments. The enzyme contains transmembrane helices and forms a complex with amoB and amoC subunits. Distinguishing amoA from pmoA requires careful phylogenetic analysis and examination of conserved residues specific to each function.'

  review:
    summary: AmoA is a membrane-bound enzyme subunit that contains transmembrane helices and functions as part of the copper-dependent ammonia monooxygenase complex embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane of ammonia-oxidizing archaea
    action: NEW
    reason: Membrane localization is essential for amoA function as a transmembrane subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase complex. The enzyme requires membrane-bound topology to properly coordinate copper cofactors and form the functional amo complex with amoB and amoC subunits for ammonia oxidation
