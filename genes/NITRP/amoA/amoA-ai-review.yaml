  label: Nitrosopumilus maritimus
description: 'Ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) is a key marker gene for ammonia-oxidizing
  archaea (AOA), catalyzing the first step of nitrification: ammonia oxidation to
  hydroxylamine. As noted by the colleague, amoA is difficult to distinguish from
  pmoA (particulate methane monooxygenase) due to high sequence similarity - both
  are copper-dependent membrane-bound monooxygenases with homologous active sites.
  This archaeal amoA from marine ammonia oxidizer N. maritimus represents the dominant
  ammonia oxidizers in many environments. The enzyme contains transmembrane helices
  and forms a complex with amoB and amoC subunits. Distinguishing amoA from pmoA requires
  careful phylogenetic analysis and examination of conserved residues specific to
  each function.'

  review:
    summary: AmoA is a membrane-bound enzyme subunit that contains transmembrane helices
      and functions as part of the copper-dependent ammonia monooxygenase complex
      embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane of ammonia-oxidizing archaea
    action: NEW
    reason: Membrane localization is essential for amoA function as a transmembrane
      subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase complex. The enzyme requires membrane-bound
      topology to properly coordinate copper cofactors and form the functional amo
      complex with amoB and amoC subunits for ammonia oxidation
