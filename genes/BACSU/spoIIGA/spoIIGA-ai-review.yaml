description: >-
  SpoIIGA is a membrane-embedded, signal-transducing aspartic protease essential for sporulation
  in Bacillus subtilis. It is responsible for proteolytic processing of the inactive pro-sigma-E
  (pro-sigmaE/P31) to generate the active sigma factor sigmaE in the mother cell during endospore
  formation. SpoIIGA contains an N-terminal multi-pass transmembrane domain that anchors it to
  the mother cell side of the sporulation septum, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that faces
  the mother cell cytoplasm. The enzyme is activated by interaction with the forespore-secreted
  signaling protein SpoIIR, representing a key intercellular signaling mechanism that coordinates
  gene expression between the forespore and mother cell compartments. SpoIIGA belongs to the
  peptidase U4 family and functions as a novel type of aspartic protease with a dimeric active
  site architecture similar to retroviral proteases. The catalytic mechanism requires the
  conserved aspartate residue D183. Upon activation, SpoIIGA cleaves the N-terminal pro-sequence
  from pro-sigmaE, releasing mature sigmaE to associate with RNA polymerase and activate the
  mother cell transcriptional program required for spore development.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation correctly identifies SpoIIGA as an aspartic-type endopeptidase.
      Experimental studies have demonstrated that SpoIIGA functions as a signal-transducing
      aspartic protease, with the catalytic aspartate D183 being essential for activity.
      The annotation is well-supported by biochemical and mutational evidence from PMID:18378688
      and PMID:21362630.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately reflects the core molecular function of SpoIIGA. The protein
      has been experimentally characterized as an aspartic protease that cleaves pro-sigmaE.
      Mutation of the catalytic aspartate D183 abolishes protease activity. While SpoIIGA
      belongs to the peptidase U4 family rather than typical pepsin-like aspartic proteases,
      it functions via an aspartic protease mechanism with a dimeric active site.

    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation indicates plasma membrane localization for SpoIIGA. This is

      multiple transmembrane segments.

      While 'plasma membrane' is technically correct, SpoIIGA is more specifically localized

      This annotation indicates protein binding based on physical interaction evidence.
      SpoIIGA has been shown to interact with SpoIIR (the signaling protein from the

      is uninformative.

      The generic 'protein binding' term does not capture the functional significance
      of the interactions. SpoIIGA interacts with SpoIIR as part of signal transduction,
      and with pro-sigmaE as its substrate. A more specific term would be preferable,
