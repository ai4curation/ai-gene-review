description: ComGA is an AAA+ ATPase that powers the assembly of the ComG competence
  pseudopilus in Bacillus subtilis. The protein contains a P-loop NTPase domain homologous
  to type II secretion system ATPases (GspE/T2SS-E family). ComGA is essential for
  DNA binding at the cell surface during natural genetic transformation, as it drives
  the assembly of competence pili composed primarily of ComGC pilin subunits. The
  protein localizes to cell poles through diffusion-capture mediated by ComEB, where
  it forms foci coincident with the DNA uptake machinery. ATP hydrolysis by ComGA
  is required for function, as Walker B motif mutations abolish both DNA binding and
  transformation competence while still allowing polar localization. During competence
  development, ComGA dynamics increase upon addition of extracellular DNA, consistent
  with pilus activity during substrate engagement.
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0005886
    label: plasma membrane
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: ComGA localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane as a peripheral
      membrane protein, with enrichment at cell poles during competence development.
      The protein accumulates at cell poles through diffusion-capture and forms discrete
      foci coincident with the DNA uptake machinery.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence. UniProt
      annotates ComGA as a peripheral membrane protein on the cytoplasmic side of
      the cell membrane based on PMID:9723928. Recent studies demonstrate polar membrane
      localization during competence. While ComGA also localizes more specifically
      to cell poles (GO:0060187), the plasma membrane annotation captures the essential
      cellular location.

    label: ATP hydrolysis activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: ComGA is an AAA+ ATPase with functional Walker A/B motifs that powers
      competence pilus assembly. ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA binding and transformation
      function, as Walker B motif mutations abolish DNA binding activity while still
      permitting polar localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is strongly supported by both sequence analysis (P-loop
      NTPase domain, Walker A/B motifs) and functional studies. ComGA belongs to the
      GSP E family of secretion ATPases. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that ATP
      hydrolysis is essential for function in DNA uptake. The IBA annotation correctly
      captures the core molecular function.

  review:
    summary: ComGA contains a P-loop NTPase domain with Walker A/B motifs that bind
      ATP. The protein has a predicted ATP binding site at residues 144-151.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping is correct but redundant
      with the more specific ATP binding annotation (GO:0005524). ComGA clearly binds
      nucleotides (specifically ATP) based on domain analysis and functional requirements.
      Accept as a valid but less informative parent term.

  review:
    summary: ComGA binds ATP through its P-loop NTPase domain. UniProt annotates a

      Mutagenesis of the Walker A lysine (K150Q) abolishes transformation while preserving
      polar localization.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported by domain analysis showing Walker A/B
      motifs characteristic of AAA+ ATPases, and by functional evidence that ATP binding/hydrolysis
      is essential for ComGA function. The ATP binding annotation complements the
      ATP hydrolysis activity annotation and is appropriately specific.

      vocabulary is consistent with experimental evidence showing membrane association.
    action: ACCEPT

  review:
    summary: ComGA is essential for natural genetic transformation in B. subtilis.
      It powers the assembly of competence pili required for DNA binding and uptake
      at the cell surface. Deletion of comGA abolishes transformation and eliminates
      surface-exposed pilus structures.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures the core biological process in which
      ComGA functions. ComGA is expressed specifically in competent cells (5-15% of
      population) under ComK regulation, and is absolutely required for DNA uptake
      during natural transformation. The term appropriately describes the process-level
      function of the protein.

      mediated by ComEB. The protein forms discrete foci at cell poles coincident
      with the DNA uptake machinery.
    action: NEW
    reason: Cell pole localization is a well-characterized feature of ComGA that is
      more specific than plasma membrane. Multiple studies demonstrate polar localization
      during competence, with dynamics increasing upon DNA addition. This annotation
      adds precision to the cellular location without conflicting with the broader
      plasma membrane annotation.

  review:
    summary: ComGA powers the assembly of competence pili (ComG pseudopilus) from
      ComGC pilin subunits. Deletion of comGA abolishes surface-exposed pilus structures.
    action: NEW
    reason: Pilus assembly is the direct biochemical function through which ComGA
      enables competence. The protein provides ATP hydrolysis energy for pseudopilus
      biogenesis. This annotation links the molecular function (ATP hydrolysis) to
      the specific cellular assembly process.
