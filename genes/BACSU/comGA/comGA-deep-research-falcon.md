## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P25953
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Competence protein ComGA {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8DN86}; AltName: Full=ComG operon protein 1 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=comGA; Synonyms=comG1; OrderedLocusNames=BSU24730;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the GSP E family. .
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); ATPase_ComGA. (IPR047667); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); T2SS/T4SS_dom. (IPR001482); T2SSE (PF00437)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "comGA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'comGA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **comGA** (gene ID: comGA, UniProt: P25953) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

*Table: Concise table of evidence for ComGA (B. subtilis P25953) summarizing function, localization, pilus dynamics, interactions, regulatory roles and key experimental measurements with source citations; useful as a quick reference of experimentally supported claims.*

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: comGA encodes the competence-associated secretion/assembly ATPase of the ComG pseudopilus machinery in Bacillus subtilis. ComGA is an AAA+ P-loop NTPase homologous to type II secretion ATPases (GspE/T2SS-E). Functional Walker A/B motifs are present, and ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA binding and competence function (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2).
- Primary role in DNA uptake: ComGA powers assembly of the ComG pilus required for transport of environmental DNA across the Gram-positive cell wall. Deletion of comGA abolishes surface-exposed pilus structures and transformation-associated DNA binding/uptake (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10).
- Uptake pathway context: Recent imaging supports a two-tier uptake model in B. subtilis: dynamic ComG pili capture dsDNA across the wall all over the cell surface; DNA then accumulates in the periplasm (where ComEA can bind), with subsequent entry of ssDNA through the membrane channel ComEC, which is enriched at a single pole (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024)
- Surface-wide dynamic competence pili: High-resolution live-cell microscopy showed that B. subtilis forms true competence pili that assemble at multiple lateral and polar sites, retract within seconds–minutes, and mediate DNA capture over the entire cell surface; cytosolic entry remains polar (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
- Pilus dynamics and ComGC partitioning: Single-molecule analyses revealed two ComGC populations—diffusing membrane pool and static (pilus-incorporated) fraction—with DNA increasing the static fraction within ~10 min, consistent with substrate-engaged pili (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
- Retraction rates and biophysics: 2024 work reported two retraction populations: median slow ~3 nm/s and fast ~12 nm/s, indicating both spontaneous and ATPase-driven retraction consistent with a role for ComGA in active retraction (2024; details as reported) (zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 72-77, zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 68-72).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic and imaging tools: Functional labeling of a cysteine-engineered ComGC (e.g., ComGC S65C/E56C) with AF488-maleimide enabled direct visualization of competence pili in vivo, while merodiploid expression from amyE under IPTG control provided controlled production for live imaging and quantification (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10).
- Functional assays: Transformation assays under defined conditions (e.g., ~0.5 μg DNA to 0.5 ml cells, 1 h at 37°C in competence medium) and comGA deletion/complementation tests remain standard to probe mechanistic roles of ComGA and the ComG system (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10).

4) Expert opinions and mechanistic analyses
- Polar localization factor ComEB: Single-molecule tracking established ComEB as a moonlighting dCMP deaminase that dynamically recruits ComGA to the pole by diffusion–capture; comEB deletion delocalizes ComGA and reduces transformation, while catalytic mutation of ComEB’s active cysteine does not phenocopy the localization defect (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2, burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12).
- DNA-triggered dynamics: Addition of extracellular DNA increases ComGA turnover and polar localization probability, consistent with DNA-activated pilus activity and dynamic exchange at the competence pole (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12).
- Whole-cell uptake model update: Modern imaging argues that while the cytoplasmic translocon (ComEC) is polar, the wall-spanning step via competence pili is distributed across the cell surface, revising the earlier strictly polar DNA-capture model (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Fraction of cells with pili: 64 of 318 imaged cells displayed visible competence pili (~10–20%), consistent with expected competent subpopulation sizes under the conditions used (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10).
- Pilus lengths: Structured illumination microscopy reported pilus lengths of ~505 ± 155 nm (n=35) under full induction and ~539 ± 40 nm (n=40) at low induction (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10).
- ComGC partitioning: About 65% diffusing vs. 35% static ComGC at baseline; DNA addition increases the static fraction within ~10 min, plateauing by ~20 min (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
- ComGA turnover and localization shift: ComGA turnover rate at poles increased from 0.076 ± 0.012 s−1 to 0.131 ± 0.007 s−1 upon DNA addition, with polar localization probability shifting from ~49.9% to ~59.2% (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12).
- Retraction speeds: Median slow ~3 nm/s; median fast ~12 nm/s for competence pili, consistent with mixed spontaneous and ATPase-driven retraction (2024; details as reported) (zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 72-77, zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 68-72).

Functional and mechanistic narrative
- Primary molecular function: ComGA is an AAA+ ATPase that powers ComG pseudopilus assembly, a requirement for DNA binding at the cell surface and for subsequent uptake. Mutation of the Walker B motif abrogates DNA binding, implicating ATP hydrolysis in function. Deletion of comGA abolishes formation of surface-exposed pilus structures, establishing its essential role in pilus biogenesis (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4).
- Localization and dynamics: ComGA accumulates at a single cell pole through diffusion–capture, recruited by ComEB; DNA addition increases ComGA turnover and enhances polar localization. However, imaging shows competence pili can assemble all over the cell surface, retract dynamically, and capture dsDNA across the wall; periplasmic DNA is then directed toward the pole for translocation into the cytosol via ComEC (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
- Interactions and dependencies: The ComG machinery comprises the platform (ComGB), major pilin (ComGC), and minor pilins (e.g., ComGD/GE/GG), with ComC prepilin processing. ComGA provides the energy for assembly and likely contributes to retraction; loss of ComGA eliminates pili. Uptake into the periplasm depends on the pilus and ComEA’s DNA-binding, while entry into the cytosol depends on ComEC at the pole (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
- Regulation/physiology: ComEB functions as a polar localization factor for ComGA, acting on millisecond timescales and enabling efficient assembly/activity of the uptake complex; comEB deletion impairs competence. DNA serves as an activating signal that increases ComGA exchange at the pole, consistent with enhanced pilus activity during substrate engagement (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2, burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12).

Verification of identity and domain alignment
- Gene symbol and organism: The studies above explicitly analyze the B. subtilis competence ATPase ComGA within the ComG operon, consistent with the UniProt P25953 annotation for Bacillus subtilis 168 (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4).
- Domains/family: ComGA bears AAA+ P-loop NTPase motifs and is functionally homologous to T2SS E/GspE ATPases required for pseudopilus assembly, aligning with UniProt domain annotations (Jan 2020; Molecular Microbiology; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.14457) (burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2).

Limitations and open questions
- Retraction ATPase identity: While retraction dynamics are observed and a fast retraction class is consistent with ATPase-driven activity, whether ComGA alone powers retraction or a second factor contributes remains under investigation (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696; 2024 report) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19, zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 72-77, zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 68-72).
- Spatial coupling: The extent to which lateral wall-associated pili channel DNA exclusively to the polar ComEC or whether additional membrane translocation sites contribute remains an active area of study (Oct 10, 2023; PLOS Genetics; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010696) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).

Conclusion
Collectively, recent live-cell imaging and single-molecule studies consolidate ComGA (P25953) as the AAA+ assembly ATPase of the B. subtilis ComG system, essential for competence pilus formation and DNA binding, dynamically recruited to the pole by ComEB, and responsive to extracellular DNA. Competence pili act broadly over the cell surface to introduce dsDNA into the periplasm, with polar ComEC mediating cytosolic entry. Quantitative parameters of pilus length, population partitioning of ComGC, and DNA-activated ComGA turnover provide a calibrated framework for functional annotation and modeling of the competence machinery (Oct 10, 2023; Jan 2020; 2024) (kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 2-4, burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 1-2, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 4-5, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 8-10, burghard‐schrod2020thebacillussubtilis pages 10-12, zuke2024productiondynamicsanda pages 68-72, kilb2023uptakeofenvironmental pages 16-19).
