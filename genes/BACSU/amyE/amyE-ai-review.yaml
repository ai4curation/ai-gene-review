description: Alpha-amylase (AmyE) is a secreted glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (GH13)
  enzyme that catalyzes the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in
  starch and related alpha-glucans. The enzyme uses a retaining double-displacement
  mechanism with a catalytic nucleophile (Asp217) and proton donor (Glu249). AmyE
  is a calcium-dependent enzyme that binds two Ca2+ ions per subunit, which are essential
  for structural stability and optimal catalytic activity. The protein is synthesized
  as a 659 amino acid precursor with an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-27)
  and propeptide (residues 28-41) that are cleaved during secretion via the Sec pathway.
  The mature enzyme contains a catalytic (beta/alpha)8 barrel domain (domain A) with
  an inserted domain B, a C-terminal beta-sandwich domain (Amy_C), and a carbohydrate-binding
  module (CBM26) at the C-terminus. AmyE shows activity on various starches with substrate
  preference potato > wheat > corn > rice, producing mainly maltose and glucose as
  hydrolysis products. The amyE locus is commonly used as a neutral chromosomal integration
  site for heterologous gene expression in B. subtilis, and the AmyE signal peptide
  (SPamyE) is widely used as a secretion tag for recombinant protein production.

    label: catalytic activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: AmyE is indeed a catalytic enzyme - specifically an alpha-amylase (EC
      3.2.1.1) that hydrolyzes alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds in starch. However, GO:0003824
      (catalytic activity) is too general and does not provide informative annotation
      for this well-characterized enzyme.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the annotation is technically correct, it is uninformative. AmyE
      has been biochemically characterized with specific activity measurements (~1,280
      U/mg), crystal structure solved (PDB:1BAG, 1UA7), and catalytic residues identified
      (Asp217 nucleophile, Glu249 proton donor, Asp310 transition state stabilizer).
      The more specific term GO:0004556 (alpha-amylase activity) should be used instead.

  review:
    summary: AmyE is a well-characterized alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) that catalyzes
      the endohydrolysis of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in starch. The enzyme
      belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (GH13) and uses a retaining double-displacement

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This is the core molecular function of AmyE. The annotation is strongly
      supported by: (1) Crystal structure of AmyE complexed with maltopentaose showing
      active site architecture; (2) Enzyme classification as EC 3.2.1.1; (3) Membership
      in GH13 family with conserved catalytic residues; (4) Biochemical characterization

  review:
    summary: AmyE participates in carbohydrate metabolism by degrading starch, a storage
      polysaccharide. However, this term is quite broad and does not capture the specific
      biological process in which AmyE functions.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While carbohydrate metabolic process is not incorrect, it is overly general
      for this well-characterized starch-degrading enzyme. AmyE specifically catalyzes
      starch hydrolysis, producing maltose and glucose. More specific terms would

      annotation is correct but redundant with the more specific alpha-amylase activity
      annotation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This is a parent term of GO:0004556 (alpha-amylase activity). While technically
      correct, it provides less information than the specific alpha-amylase annotation.
      The annotation can be kept for completeness in automated inference pipelines
      but should not be considered a core annotation for this enzyme.

  review:
    summary: AmyE binds calcium ions which are required for enzyme stability and activity.
      However, cation binding is too general - the specific cofactor is Ca2+.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While AmyE does bind cations, specifically calcium ions (2 per subunit),
      the annotation should use the more specific term GO:0005509 (calcium ion binding).
      The crystal structure (PDB:1BAG) reveals specific calcium binding sites with
      coordinating residues identified by X-ray crystallography.

      be more specific.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Metal ion binding is a parent term of calcium ion binding (GO:0005509).
      Given that the specific metal is known to be calcium (with structural evidence
      from X-ray crystallography), the more specific term GO:0005509 should be the
      core annotation. This parent term can be kept for automated inference completeness
      but is redundant with the specific calcium annotation.

      stability and catalytic activity. The calcium binding sites have been determined
      by X-ray crystallography.
    action: NEW
    reason: This is a key molecular function of AmyE that is missing from the current
      annotation set. The crystal structure (PDB:1BAG, 1UA7) at 2.5 and 2.21 angstrom
      resolution clearly shows two calcium binding sites with specific coordinating
      residues. This should be annotated with experimental evidence (IDA) based on
      the structural characterization.

  review:
    summary: AmyE binds polysaccharides (starch, maltooligosaccharides) as substrates.
      The enzyme contains a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM26) and the
      crystal structure shows binding of maltopentaose.
    action: NEW
    reason: AmyE has been crystallized in complex with maltopentaose, demonstrating
      polysaccharide binding. Additionally, the protein contains a predicted CBM26
      carbohydrate-binding module at the C-terminus. This binding function is essential
      for the enzyme's starch-degrading activity and should be annotated.
