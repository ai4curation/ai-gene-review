description: SwrD (formerly YlzI) is a small (~71 aa) swarming-specific enhancer
  of flagellar motor power in Bacillus subtilis. Located in the fla-che operon 
  adjacent to fliL, SwrD increases power delivery (torque) per flagellum by 
  acting at the level of MotAB stator activity, without affecting stator 
  abundance or flagellar number. Deletion of swrD abolishes swarming motility 
  and reduces swimming speed (~2-fold) and single-flagellum torque (~6-fold). 
  These phenotypes are rescued by MotAB overexpression, demonstrating that SwrD 
  functions to enhance motor power output. SwrD homologs often co-occur with 
  motAB across diverse bacteria, suggesting a conserved role in stator-dependent
  torque enhancement for surface motility.

      label: bacterial-type flagellum-dependent swarming motility
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: This phylogenetic annotation (IBA) is well-supported by 
        experimental evidence from PMID:29061663. SwrD is specifically required 
        for swarming motility; deletion abolishes swarming on solid surfaces 
        while cells retain swimming ability (albeit reduced).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation aligns with direct experimental evidence. Hall 
        et al. (2018) demonstrated that swrD mutants completely fail to swarm on
        0.7% agar, while complementation restores swarming. The phylogenetic 
        inference is consistent with the protein's conserved function across 
        Firmicutes and other bacterial lineages where SwrD homologs co-occur 
        with motAB.

    review:
      summary: This is the primary experimental paper characterizing SwrD 
        function. Hall et al. (2018) demonstrated through deletion and 
        complementation experiments that SwrD is essential for swarming motility
        by increasing power to flagellar motors via MotAB stator activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: 'PMID:29061663 provides definitive experimental evidence for SwrD''s
        role in swarming. The study shows: (1) swrD deletion abolishes swarming on
        0.7% agar, (2) complementation restores swarming, (3) the phenotype is not
        due to reduced flagellar number or surfactant production, and (4) MotAB overexpression
        rescues swrD-related phenotypes. This directly demonstrates that SwrD is involved
        in bacterial-type flagellum-dependent swarming motility.'

    review:
      summary: This annotation is INCORRECT. PMID:25313396 (Calvo and Kearns, 
        2015) is about FlgM secretion by the flagellar export apparatus in 
        Bacillus subtilis. The paper does NOT mention swrD or ylzI anywhere. 
        This appears to be an erroneous annotation.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: PMID:25313396 is titled "FlgM is secreted by the flagellar export 
        apparatus in Bacillus subtilis" and focuses entirely on the anti-sigma 
        factor FlgM and its secretion mechanism. The paper investigates 
        flagellar structural genes required for FlgM secretion (FliF, FliG, 
        FliO, FliP, FliQ, FliR, FlhA, FlhB, FliK) but makes no mention of swrD 
        or its synonym ylzI. This annotation should be removed as it attributes 
        experimental evidence from a paper that does not study or mention SwrD.

      label: bacterial-type flagellum-dependent swimming motility
    evidence_type: IMP
    original_reference_id: PMID:29061663
    review:
      summary: SwrD affects swimming motility as well as swarming. Hall et al. 
        (2018) demonstrated that swrD deletion reduces swimming speed 
        approximately 2-fold (from ~30 um/s to ~15 um/s). This annotation 
        captures the effect on swimming that is distinct from swarming.
      action: NEW
      reason: While swrD mutants can still swim (unlike swarming which is 
        abolished), their swimming is significantly impaired. The ~2-fold 
        reduction in swimming speed and ~6-fold reduction in torque demonstrates
        that SwrD positively affects flagellum-dependent swimming motility. This
        annotation would complement the swarming annotation by capturing the 
        broader motility phenotype. Evidence is IMP based on mutant phenotype 
        analysis.

    evidence_type: IMP
    original_reference_id: PMID:29061663
    review:
      summary: SwrD functions as a positive regulator of flagellar motor power, 
        modulating motility by enhancing stator activity. This regulatory 
        function is distinct from direct involvement in motility per se.
      action: NEW
      reason: SwrD regulates the power output of the flagellar motor by acting 
        at the level of MotAB stator activity, without affecting stator protein 
        levels or flagellar number. This is a regulatory function that modulates
        the rate/extent of cell motility. The fact that MotAB overexpression 
        rescues swrD phenotypes demonstrates that SwrD acts as a positive 
        regulator of motor function. This GO term captures the regulatory aspect
        of SwrD function that the direct motility terms do not fully represent.
