## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** C0H412
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Swarming motility protein SwrD {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=swrD {ECO:0000303|PubMed:29061663}; Synonyms=ylzI; OrderedLocusNames=BSU16299;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** SwrD-like. (IPR009384); FlbD (PF06289)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "swrD" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'swrD' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **swrD** (gene ID: swrD, UniProt: C0H412) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification summary
- Identity verification: The Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) gene ylzI within the fla/che operon is renamed swrD; it encodes a ~71-aa protein required for swarming. The gene lies just upstream of fliL with a short overlap, consistent with BSU16299. These points are demonstrated in primary literature, confirming the target identity and organism for SwrD in B. subtilis 168 (Jan 2018, Journal of Bacteriology; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 9-11).

Comprehensive research report: Bacillus subtilis swrD (ylzI/BSU16299)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene and product: swrD (formerly ylzI) encodes a small protein (~71 aa) in the B. subtilis fla/che operon. Its loss abolishes swarming while leaving swimming partially intact. Complementation with swrD restores swarming, demonstrating that the phenotype is due to swrD itself rather than polar effects (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 9-11).
- Functional role: SwrD increases power delivery (torque) per flagellum by acting at the level of MotAB stator activity. It does not increase flagellar numbers and does not reduce MotA abundance, indicating a functional modulation of stator activity rather than expression or assembly (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 17-19, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 1-3, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5).
- Pathway context: Swarming in B. subtilis requires increased flagellar density and higher motor power on surfaces. SwrD belongs to the class of regulators that enhance motor power rather than those that increase flagellar number (e.g., SwrA/SwrB). Its genetic positioning overlaps with fliL, and swrD homologs often occur adjacent to motAB across diverse bacteria, supporting a conserved linkage to stator function (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 34-37, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 30-32, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- 2022 TnSeq gene compendium for swarming: A swarming selection-based TnSeq in B. subtilis recovered known swarming genes and identified additional candidates. In this framework, SwrD is cited as a factor that increases the power to individual motors, representing a torque/power-centric class of swarming determinants. This locates SwrD within contemporary gene-set views of swarming regulation (Jun 2022; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00089-22) (sanchez2022identificationofgenes pages 9-11).
- 2022 review of swarming methodology and features: A minireview on swarming techniques and behaviors references the prevalence of proteins influencing surface motility in Gram-positive bacteria, providing updated experimental context for assaying swarming phenotypes and torque-related adaptation under surface load (Feb 2022; Appl. Environ. Microbiol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01853-21) (poudel2019integratedproteomicsand pages 10-11).
- Mechanistic advances from FliL/stomatin-like systems: Although not SwrD itself, Vibrio FliL has been structurally characterized as a stomatin-like ring around the stator, providing a comparative model for torque enhancement at high load on surfaces. These 2019 data are still the leading structural insights for stator-associated torque regulators and continue to inform current models (Apr 2019; mBio; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00292-19) (takekawa2019structureofvibrio pages 8-10).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Engineering surface motility and torque tuning: Because swrD deletion decreases per-flagellum torque and abolishes swarming yet can be rescued by overexpressing MotAB stators, SwrD and stator stoichiometry are targets for engineering bacterial motility under high-load conditions (e.g., synthetic biology designs for surface transport). The finding that extra stators can compensate for loss of SwrD suggests practical strategies to tune motor output in strains that must traverse viscous or high-friction environments (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 34-37, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5).
- Comparative and translational insights: Genomic co-occurrence of swrD with motAB and adjacency to fliL invites comparative analysis across Firmicutes and other taxa (e.g., spirochaetes) to understand torque adaptation in host or environmental settings where swarming contributes to colonization or spread. Structural knowledge from FliL informs hypotheses for interface points between torque modulators and stators, which could be leveraged in microbe-microbe competition or bioprocessing on surfaces (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17; Apr 2019; mBio; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00292-19) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5, takekawa2019structureofvibrio pages 8-10).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Primary experimental conclusion: Hall et al. concluded that SwrD is required to increase flagellar power for swarming and that it operates at the level of MotAB activity. They proposed that SwrD may reduce stator dynamism by facilitating stator retention at the motor, but were unable to directly visualize stator dynamics due to nonfunctional fluorescent fusions—thus mechanistic details remain hypothetical (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 17-19).
- Relationship to FliL: In B. subtilis, fliL disruption produces a milder swarming defect and is not rescued by MotAB overexpression, suggesting SwrD and FliL act by distinct mechanisms despite genomic proximity. Across bacteria, FliL’s stomatin-like ring around the stator supports a general paradigm of torque enhancement via stator-associated scaffolds, providing a conceptual foil to SwrD’s mechanism (Apr 2019; mBio; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00292-19; Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (takekawa2019structureofvibrio pages 8-10, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 17-19).
- Contemporary integration (2022): The 2022 TnSeq study frames swarming requirements in a genome-scale context and cites SwrD’s power-enhancing role as part of the swarming toolkit, aligning with expert perspectives that swarming requires both increased flagellar density and enhanced torque at the motor (Jun 2022; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00089-22) (sanchez2022identificationofgenes pages 9-11).

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Swimming speed: Loss of swrD reduces average swimming speed about two-fold, from ~30 μm/s (WT) to ~15 μm/s (swrD), measured across ~100 cells (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 37-37).
- Torque reduction: Single-flagellum torque is reduced ~6-fold in the swrD mutant relative to WT, as measured in ~40 tethered cells (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 37-37).
- Rescue by MotAB: Overexpression of motA/motB (amyE::Physpank-motAB induced with 1 mM IPTG) restores swimming speed, torque, and swarming to near wild-type levels, correlating with elevated MotA levels by Western blot; MotA levels are not reduced in the swrD mutant itself, indicating SwrD acts on stator activity rather than abundance (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 34-37, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17).
- Swarming phenotype: swrD mutants fail to swarm on 0.7% agar; complementation and MotAB overexpression rescue swarming. Assays were designed to isolate swarming (e.g., preventing alternative spreading) and compared WT, swrD, and motAB-overexpression strains (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 3-5, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 30-32).
- Broader context: Reviews and surveys in 2022 reaffirm swarming as a high-load motility mode requiring specialized adaptations in motor function and population behavior, consistent with SwrD’s power-boosting role in B. subtilis (Feb 2022; AEM; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01853-21) (poudel2019integratedproteomicsand pages 10-11).

Mechanistic and localization notes
- Localization: Experimental localization of SwrD (e.g., membrane association or specific motor binding) remains undetermined; functional inferences point to action at the stator level without evidence for changes in MotA abundance (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 17-19, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 15-17).
- Distinction from FliL: FliL is stomatin-like and structurally forms a ring that interacts with stator subunits to enhance torque, particularly under high-load conditions such as swarming; in B. subtilis, the genetic and rescue phenotypes suggest SwrD operates via a different mechanism despite being adjacent to fliL (Apr 2019; mBio; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00292-19; Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17) (takekawa2019structureofvibrio pages 8-10, hall2018swrd(ylzi)promotes pages 17-19).

Conclusions and open questions
- SwrD in B. subtilis 168 is a small, swarming-specific enhancer of motor power that acts at the level of stator activity without altering stator abundance. Deletion abolishes swarming and reduces torque and swimming speed; increasing stator levels suffices to rescue these defects. Genetic adjacency to fliL and frequent co-occurrence with motAB across bacteria suggest a conserved functional unit centered on stator modulation. Unlike the stomatin-like FliL, SwrD’s mechanism and localization remain unresolved, and no structural domain has been assigned from the available evidence here. Recent 2022 studies integrate SwrD into broader swarming gene frameworks, while structural work on FliL continues to inform hypotheses about stator-associated torque enhancement on surfaces (Jan 2018; J. Bacteriol.; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00529-17; Jun 2022; J.
