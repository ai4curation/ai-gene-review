## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P04189
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Subtilisin E; EC=3.4.21.62 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7589571}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=aprE {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9579061}; Synonyms=apr, aprA, sprE {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6322190}; OrderedLocusNames=BSU10300;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the peptidase S8 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Peptidase_S8/S53_dom. (IPR000209); Peptidase_S8/S53_dom_sf. (IPR036852); Peptidase_S8_Asp-AS. (IPR023827); Peptidase_S8_His-AS. (IPR022398); Peptidase_S8_Ser-AS. (IPR023828)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "aprE" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'aprE' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **aprE** (gene ID: aprE, UniProt: P04189) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan and verification
We verified the target as aprE from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis strain 168 (UniProt P04189), encoding the extracellular alkaline serine protease Subtilisin E, a member of the peptidase S8 (subtilisin) family. Structural and sequence analyses confirm the canonical catalytic triad (His-Asp-Ser) and assignment to subtilases; PDB 1SCJ is referenced for Subtilisin E. These sources align with the provided UniProt metadata (family S8; catalytic triad residues; extracellular, secreted precursor with propeptide). The organism, gene symbol, and family/domain assignments are consistent with the literature and do not present ambiguity. (emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 1-3, emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 4-6)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: Subtilisin E (aprE) is an extracellular endopeptidase of the peptidase S8 family produced by Bacillus subtilis 168. The enzyme’s active site is formed by a conserved catalytic triad His125–Asp146–Ser231 (numbering per B. subtilis Subtilisin E), typical of subtilisins. It operates optimally in neutral-to-alkaline pH and is frequently stabilized by Ca2+. PDB 1SCJ and closely related models capture the subtilisin E–propeptide complex. Mar 2022; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2021.1894979 (emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 1-3, emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 3-4)
- Catalytic mechanism and specificity: Like other “true” subtilisins, catalysis proceeds through a Ser-alkoxide nucleophile assisted by His and Asp, forming and resolving an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Substrate preferences favor hydrophobic residues at P1/P4 in model peptides and casein/azocasein assays; related subtilisins exhibit PMSF sensitivity and broad alkaline activity ranges. Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13701 (falkenberg2023biochemicalcharacterisationof pages 3-6)
- Localization and secretion: Subtilisin E is synthesized as a preproenzyme with an N‑terminal Sec signal peptide (positively charged N-region, hydrophobic core, polar C-region) that directs cotranslational targeting to SecYEG via SRP/FtsY. Signal peptidase cleaves the signal peptide in the membrane, after which the protein is secreted and folds with assistance of PrsA; quality-control proteases (HtrA/HtrB, WprA) remove misfolded proteins. 2024 (review/analysis); https://doi.org/10.7488/era/4696 (astles2024novelextremophilicmetalloproteases pages 56-60)
- Maturation: The propeptide acts as an intramolecular chaperone that guides folding and is subsequently removed by autoprocessing to yield mature active subtilisin; autoproteolysis can impact observed stability and activity in vitro. Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13701; Mar 2022; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2021.1894979 (falkenberg2023biochemicalcharacterisationof pages 3-6, emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 3-4)

Regulation and pathway context
- Transcriptional control: aprE is transcribed from a housekeeping SigA (σA) promoter and is activated by the two‑component system DegS–DegU (DegU as direct positive regulator). Multiple repressors modulate expression, including AbrB, SinR, and ScoC; other factors (Hpr, TenA) were predicted in promoter scans. These regulators link aprE to differentiation/sporulation states (Spo0A controls AbrB) and competence networks (ComA). Mar 2022; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2021.1894979 (emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 7-8, emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 1-3)
- Systems-level secretion and protease network: Bacillus subtilis 168 produces a set of extracellular proteases (including AprE), and engineering often uses protease-deficient chassis to protect secreted products. Regulatory systems (Spo0A, CodY, DegS–DegU) influence extracellular protein production states. 2024; https://doi.org/10.7488/era/4696 (astles2024novelextremophilicmetalloproteases pages 56-60)

Function, substrates, and biological roles
- Primary function: Subtilisin E is a broad-specificity endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds in diverse proteins; modeling and prediction indicate an ability to cleave keratin/keratin-associated proteins, consistent with preferences for hydrophobic residues. Mar 2022; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2021.1894979 (emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 1-3, emameh2022bioinformaticsanalysisof pages 4-6)
- Biological roles: In B. subtilis, AprE contributes to extracellular proteolysis for nutrient acquisition and shapes the extracellular milieu. The extracellular protease repertoire, including AprE, is implicated in processing secreted peptides that participate in cell–cell signaling, adding complexity to quorum-associated behaviors; such roles are supported by systems analyses of B. subtilis secretion and protease networks. 2024; https://doi.org/10.7488/era/4696 (astles2024novelextremophilicmetalloproteases pages 56-60)

Recent developments (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Biochemical confirmation of subtilisin properties and Sec secretion: A 2023 biochemical study on a closely related aprE-encoded subtilisin (SPFA) expressed in B. subtilis DB104 confirmed S8 triad, high alkaline activity (pH 8.5–11.5), and PMSF sensitivity. It also illustrated recombinant secretion via the Sec pathway and highlighted autoproteolytic maturation. Sep 2023; https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13701 (falkenberg2023biochemicalcharacterisationof pages 3-6)
- Signal peptide and secretion engineering: Contemporary reviews and chassis-focused analyses emphasize signal peptide library screening, promoter optimization, PrsA modulation, and quality-control balancing to increase secreted yields in Bacillus hosts, with explicit use of AprE-derived signal peptides as benchmarks.

- Transcriptional regulator engineering: Tuning DegU activity and deleting repressors (AbrB/SinR/Hpr/ScoC) in Bacillus spp. substantially increases alkaline protease (AprE-like) production, providing a blueprint applicable to B. subtilis aprE regulation circuits. Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-023-02177-0; Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2024.1383083 (han2024geneticidentificationand pages 13-13)
- Recombinant protease production landscape: A 2024 review highlights current advances for recombinant proteases, including aprE-driven systems, maturation steps, and the importance of Sec signal peptides for high-level secretion in Bacillus. Mar 2024; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-024-03957-5 (arsov2024cloningsystemsin pages 29-31)

Current applications and implementations

*Table: Compact evidence-backed summary of aprE/Subtilisin E covering identity, catalysis, secretion/maturation, regulation, biological roles, applications, and 2023–2024 advances, with citations to the source evidence used.*

Conclusions
aprE encodes Subtilisin E, a secreted, extracellular S8 serine endopeptidase from B. subtilis 168. Its function is extracellular protein degradation with broad specificity for hydrophobic-rich substrates; it is matured by signal-peptide removal and propeptide autoprocessing after Sec-dependent secretion. Expression is driven by DegS–DegU and modulated by global regulators (AbrB, SinR, ScoC, Spo0A/ComA pathways) from a SigA promoter. Recent 2023–2024 advances emphasize secretion and regulatory engineering (signal peptide libraries, PrsA/QC balancing, DegU tuning) and confirm alkaline-active, PMSF-sensitive subtilisins suitable for industrial processes and as secretion benchmarks in Bacillus chassis.
