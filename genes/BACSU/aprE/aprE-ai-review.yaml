description: >-
  Subtilisin E (aprE) is one of the major secreted alkaline serine proteases of Bacillus subtilis,
  belonging to the peptidase S8 (subtilisin) family. The enzyme is synthesized as a preproenzyme
  with an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-29) that directs secretion via the Sec pathway,
  and a propeptide (residues 30-106) that functions as an intramolecular chaperone essential for
  proper folding of the mature protease domain. The propeptide is autocatalytically cleaved
  after folding is complete. The mature enzyme (residues 107-381) contains the canonical
  Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad (Asp138, His170, Ser327) characteristic of subtilisins and
  requires calcium ions for structural stability (two Ca2+ binding sites per subunit).
  Subtilisin E exhibits broad substrate specificity, preferentially cleaving after large
  uncharged residues, and is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors such as PMSF but not
  by metalloprotease inhibitors like EDTA. Beyond its role in extracellular protein
  degradation for nutrient acquisition, aprE participates in quorum sensing by processing
  the Phr family of signaling peptide precursors (including proCSF/PhrC and proPhrA) to
  generate active pentapeptide pheromones that regulate competence development and sporulation.
  Expression is induced during stationary phase under control of the DegS-DegU two-component
  system and modulated by global regulators including AbrB, SinR, and ScoC. Although
  subtilisin secretion is associated with the onset of sporulation, the enzyme itself is
  not required for normal sporulation. Subtilisin E is one of the most industrially
  important enzymes, widely used in detergent formulations and various biotechnological
  applications.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for serine-type endopeptidase activity is well-supported.
      Subtilisin E is a canonical member of the peptidase S8 family with the
      conserved catalytic triad (Asp138-His170-Ser327) characteristic of serine
      endopeptidases. The enzyme hydrolyzes proteins with broad specificity,
      preferring large uncharged residues at P1 (UniProt P04189).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core molecular function of Subtilisin E. The enzyme contains
      the canonical Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of the S8 subtilisin family,
      confirmed by X-ray crystallography (PMID:9811547). Biochemical studies
      demonstrate broad endopeptidase activity with preference for hydrophobic
      residues, inhibited by PMSF but not EDTA. This is the most
      specific and accurate term for the enzymatic activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for proteolysis is appropriate as a biological process
      term corresponding to the serine-type endopeptidase molecular function.
      Subtilisin E functions in extracellular protein degradation for nutrient
      acquisition and in processing signaling peptide precursors.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Proteolysis is the appropriate biological process term for a secreted
      protease. The enzyme performs extracellular protein degradation and also

      This general term appropriately captures the biological process.

    summary: >-
      IEA annotation for sporulation is questionable. While aprE expression
      is temporally associated with sporulation onset, experimental evidence
      shows that subtilisin is NOT required for normal sporulation. Disruption
      mutants show wild-type sporulation (PMID:6427178).
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is based on the UniProt keyword Sporulation, but the
      experimental evidence contradicts a direct role in sporulation. The
      disruption phenotype study (PMID:6427178) explicitly states that
      aprE mutants show wild-type sporulation. The UniProt entry also notes
      that subtilisin is not necessary for normal sporulation. The temporal
      association with sporulation onset reflects shared regulation (via
      Spo0A/AbrB pathways) rather than functional involvement in spore formation.

      Subtilisin E binds two calcium ions per subunit that are essential for

      The study demonstrates that subtilisin processes proCSF to produce the

      PMID:17666034 provides direct experimental evidence that subtilisin
