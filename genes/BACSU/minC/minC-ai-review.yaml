description: >-
  MinC is the septum site-determining protein that functions as the primary effector of the
  Min system in Bacillus subtilis. It acts as a direct inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization,
  preventing Z-ring formation at cell poles to ensure accurate midcell division. MinC has a
  bipartite domain architecture: the N-terminal domain (MinCN) binds to the H9/H10 helix
  region of FtsZ and inhibits FtsZ filament bundling/stability, while the C-terminal domain
  (MinCC) mediates dimerization, MinD binding, and targeting to FtsZ via the C-terminal
  peptide (CTP). Unlike E. coli, B. subtilis lacks MinE and instead uses the
  DivIVA-MinJ-MinCD system for spatial regulation. DivIVA senses negative membrane curvature
  at cell poles, recruits MinJ (an integral membrane protein), which in turn bridges to
  MinCD. This creates a stationary bipolar gradient that concentrates MinC at cell poles,
  preventing aberrant polar septation while allowing midcell Z-ring assembly. During
  cytokinesis, DivIVA/MinJ form double rings flanking the nascent septum, spatially
  separating MinC from the active division site. Loss of minC leads to characteristic
  minicell formation (small DNA-less polar divisions), cell elongation, and persistent
  polar FtsZ rings. MinC also contributes to disassembly of completed cytokinetic rings
  after division. The MinCD complex promotes FtsZ filament fragmentation at membranes
  through a mechanism distinct from simple sequestration.

    summary: >-
      MinC is a central player in division septum site selection in B. subtilis. It
      functions within the DivIVA-MinJ-MinCD system to spatially regulate where the
      Z-ring can form, preventing polar septation and ensuring midcell division
      (PMID:23577149).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core function of MinC. The Min system represents a site-specific
      inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization that prevents re-initiation of division at
      improper sites (PMID:23577149). Loss of Min function leads to polar divisions
      generating minicells. The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound and
      represents the primary biological process role of MinC.

          The Min system represents a site-specific inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization
          that prevents re-initiation of division immediately after a round of division
          has finished [10], [11]. In the absence of a functional Min system bacteria
          will frequently divide close to one of the cell poles and generate the so-called
          minicells, small DNA-less cells that are incapable of further reproduction [12], [13].

  review:
    summary: >-
      MinC directly inhibits FtsZ polymerization through protein-protein interaction
      rather than classical enzyme inhibition. While FtsZ has GTPase activity, MinC
      does not inhibit the GTPase activity but rather prevents higher-order polymer
      assembly (PMID:23577149).
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While this annotation captures that MinC has inhibitory activity, the term
      "enzyme inhibitor activity" (GO:0004857) is misleading. MinC inhibits FtsZ
      polymer assembly, not FtsZ enzymatic (GTPase) activity. The literature explicitly
      states that MinC did not inhibit FtsZ GTPase activity (PMID:23577149). MinC
      binds to FtsZ (a tubulin homolog) and prevents higher-order structure assembly.
      A more accurate term would be tubulin binding (GO:0015631) since FtsZ is the
      bacterial tubulin homolog, or the BP term negative regulation of protein
      polymerization (GO:0032272).

      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro domain mapping. While MinC mutants

      primary role is in division site selection/FtsZ inhibition. The morphological
      phenotypes observed in minC mutants (elongation, minicells) are secondary
      consequences of aberrant division. This annotation is not wrong but represents

      to understand how the Min system is remodeled during asymmetric sporulation division.
      This could reveal regulatory mechanisms that modulate MinC activity during developmental
      transitions.
    hypothesis: >-
      MinC localization and activity are dynamically regulated during sporulation to permit
      asymmetric division while preventing polar minicell formation.
