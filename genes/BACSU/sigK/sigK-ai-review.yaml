description: >-
  SigK (also known as spoIVCB/spoIIIC) encodes the RNA polymerase sigma-K factor, the late
  mother cell-specific sigma factor of the sigma-70 family that directs transcription of
  late sporulation genes in B. subtilis. SigK has a unique feature: in strain 168, the
  sigK gene is interrupted by a ~48 kb prophage-like "skin" element (skinBs), and the
  functional sigK is only reconstituted late in sporulation when the SpoIVCA recombinase
  excises this element under sigE/SpoIIID control in the mother cell. SigK is synthesized
  as an inactive precursor (pro-sigK) with a 20-residue propeptide that must be removed by
  the intramembrane metalloprotease SpoIVFB for activation. SpoIVFB is held inactive by
  BofA and SpoIVFA until forespore-secreted proteases SpoIVB and CtpB cleave these inhibitors,
  thereby coupling sigK activation to developmental stage. The mature sigma-K factor contains
  conserved sigma-70 regions including a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (residues 251-270)
  that recognizes sigK-dependent promoters. SigK activates the final phase of mother cell
  gene expression including coat proteins (cotA, cotB, cotD, cotE, cotH), cortex, and
  germination genes. SigK operates in a hierarchical feed-forward network with GerE, which
  both represses some sigK-activated genes and activates additional late genes.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation suggests sigK binds to transcription cis-regulatory regions independently.
      However, according to the GO definition of sigma factor activity (GO:0016987), sigma factors
      do not bind DNA on their own but when combined with the core polymerase to form the
      holoenzyme, they confer promoter specificity. This term is technically inaccurate for
      sigma factors as they require the core polymerase for DNA binding.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Sigma factors do not bind DNA independently. The GO definition of sigma factor activity
      explicitly states that "sigma does not bind DNA on its own, when combined with the core
      to form the holoenzyme, the sigma factor binds specifically to promoter elements."
      This term implies autonomous DNA binding which is misleading for sigma factors.
      The correct molecular function is GO:0016987 sigma factor activity, which is already
      annotated for sigK.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation incorrectly attributes catalytic RNA polymerase activity to sigK.
      Sigma factors are NOT enzymes and do not catalyze the polymerization reaction.
      The catalytic activity resides in the core polymerase subunits (beta, beta-prime),
      not in sigma factors.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is a clear over-annotation. GO:0003899 is defined as "Catalysis of the reaction:
      nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate + RNA(n+1)." Sigma factors do not possess
      catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of RNA polymerization is performed by the
      core enzyme subunits, not by sigma factors. SigK confers promoter specificity but does
      not catalyze nucleotide addition. UniProt describes sigma factors as "initiation factors
      that promote the attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites" - not enzymes.

      SigK regulates transcription by directing RNA polymerase to mother cell-specific promoters
      during late sporulation. The sigK regulon includes coat proteins, cortex genes, and
      germination factors. SigK operates in a feed-forward network with GerE to sculpt the

      Sigma factors inherently regulate transcription by determining which genes are transcribed.
      SigK specifically activates the late mother cell developmental program. UniProt states

      This is the primary and most accurate molecular function annotation for sigK. SigK is
      a well-characterized sigma factor of the sigma-70 family. It contains conserved sigma-70
      regions (regions 2 and 4) that mediate core RNAP binding and promoter recognition.

      SigK does contain a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (residues 251-270) as documented

      This annotation is logically inferred from sigma factor activity (GO:0016987). Since sigma

      This is a more specific version of the transcription regulation annotation that correctly

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on the physical interaction between pro-sigK and the intramembrane
      metalloprotease SpoIVFB, demonstrated in PMID:19805276. The study shows that SpoIVFB
      engages pro-sigK as its substrate for regulated intramembrane proteolysis, releasing
      active sigK.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While the annotation is not wrong (sigK does bind to SpoIVFB), "protein binding" is
      too vague to be informative. The specific interaction documented is between pro-sigK
      and its processing protease SpoIVFB. The CC term GO:1903865 (sigma factor antagonist
      complex) already captures this regulatory relationship more specifically. The protein
      binding annotation adds little value over the more specific complex annotation.
