description: >-
  NprE (bacillolysin) is a secreted zinc metalloendopeptidase of the peptidase M4 (thermolysin-like) family.
  It is one of the two dominant extracellular proteases in stationary-phase B. subtilis culture supernatants,
  along with AprE (subtilisin). NprE is synthesized as a preproenzyme with an N-terminal Sec signal peptide
  (residues 1-27), a large propeptide (residues 28-221) that assists folding and transiently inhibits activity,
  and a mature catalytic domain (residues 222-521). The active site contains the conserved HExxH zinc-binding
  motif characteristic of M4 family proteases. The enzyme binds one catalytic Zn2+ ion and four structural
  Ca2+ ions that provide stability. NprE expression is tightly regulated and restricted to post-exponential/
  stationary phase through the integrated action of repressors CodY, ScoC, and AbrB, and activator DegU~P.
  Together with AprE, deletion of nprE accounts for approximately 95% reduction in bulk extracellular protease
  activity, indicating its major contribution to extracellular proteolysis for nutrient scavenging during
  stationary phase.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation of proteolysis based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER (PTN002138658) and
      thermolysin (UniProtKB:P14756). NprE is a well-characterized metalloendopeptidase that catalyzes
      hydrolysis of peptide bonds, directly contributing to proteolysis in the extracellular milieu.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core function of NprE. The enzyme is a secreted zinc metalloprotease that hydrolyzes
      peptide bonds, directly performing proteolysis. The phylogenetic inference from thermolysin
      (a closely related M4 family member) is appropriate. Multiple reviews confirm NprE as one of
      the two dominant extracellular proteases in B. subtilis stationary phase cultures.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation from InterPro domain mapping (IPR001570, IPR013856, IPR023612). NprE contains
      the Peptidase_M4 domain and related domains characteristic of thermolysin-like metalloendopeptidases.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the most specific and accurate molecular function term for NprE. The enzyme is a
      zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes internal peptide bonds using a catalytic
      mechanism involving Zn2+-activated water. The HExxH motif characteristic of M4 metalloproteases
      is present, and the catalytic mechanism is well-established for this enzyme family.

      This is a core localization for NprE. The enzyme is secreted via the Sec pathway and functions

      Duplicate annotation with different evidence source is acceptable. The IEA annotation reinforces

      While this is a more general term than GO:0004222, it is not incorrect. The IEA annotation
      is based on a valid keyword mapping. Since the more specific term GO:0004222 (metalloendopeptidase
      activity) is also annotated, this broader term is acceptable as it provides a different evidence
      lineage and could be useful for hierarchical queries.

    reason: >-
      This term accurately describes NprE as a metal-dependent peptidase. While more general than

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While technically correct (metalloendopeptidases are hydrolases that use water as a nucleophile),
      this term is too general to be informative. The more specific terms GO:0004222 (metalloendopeptidase
      activity) and GO:0008237 (metallopeptidase activity) are already annotated and provide much more
      useful functional information. Retaining this very broad term adds little value.

      While NprE does bind metal ions, this generic term does not capture the specific and functionally
      important metal binding. The enzyme specifically binds zinc (essential for catalysis) and calcium
      (essential for structural stability). More specific terms GO:0008270 (zinc ion binding) and
      GO:0005509 (calcium ion binding) would be more informative and accurately represent the
