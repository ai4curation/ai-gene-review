description: YciC (also known as ZagA - ZTP-activated GTPase A) is a zinc 
  metallochaperone that belongs to the COG0523 subfamily of G3E P-loop GTPases 
  and directly transfers zinc cofactor to target proteins. The protein binds 
  zinc with exceptionally high affinity (K_Zn ≥ 10^11 M^-1) and transfers it 
  from its CXCC motif to specific client proteins, particularly FolE (GTP 
  cyclohydrolase IA) that is critical for de novo folate biosynthesis. This 
  represents the first demonstrated physical interaction between a COG0523 
  metallochaperone and its client protein. The zinc transfer mechanism requires 
  both GTP hydrolysis (stimulated ~5-fold by zinc binding) and activation by the
  alarmone ZTP (zinc-associated alarmone). Under zinc limitation, declining FolE
  activity leads to folate deficiency, causing ZMP accumulation and conversion 
  to ZTP, which then activates ZagA to interact with FolE and maintain folate 
  biosynthesis - a sophisticated feedback circuit. YciC/ZagA is regulated by the
  zinc-sensing metalloregulator Zur and represents a paradigm for understanding 
  metallochaperone function.
