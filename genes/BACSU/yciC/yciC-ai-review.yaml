description: YciC (also known as ZagA - ZTP-activated GTPase A) is a zinc metallochaperone that belongs to the COG0523 subfamily of G3E P-loop GTPases and directly transfers zinc cofactor to target proteins. The protein binds zinc with exceptionally high affinity (K_Zn ≥ 10^11 M^-1) and transfers it from its CXCC motif to specific client proteins, particularly FolE (GTP cyclohydrolase IA) that is critical for de novo folate biosynthesis. This represents the first demonstrated physical interaction between a COG0523 metallochaperone and its client protein. The zinc transfer mechanism requires both GTP hydrolysis (stimulated ~5-fold by zinc binding) and activation by the alarmone ZTP (zinc-associated alarmone). Under zinc limitation, declining FolE activity leads to folate deficiency, causing ZMP accumulation and conversion to ZTP, which then activates ZagA to interact with FolE and maintain folate biosynthesis - a sophisticated feedback circuit. YciC/ZagA is regulated by the zinc-sensing metalloregulator Zur and represents a paradigm for understanding metallochaperone function.
