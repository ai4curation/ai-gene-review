description: >-
  RNA polymerase sigma-G factor (also known as SpoIIIG) is the late forespore-specific sigma factor
  in Bacillus subtilis sporulation. Sigma factors are initiation factors that promote the attachment
  of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are then released after transcription begins.
  SigG becomes active only in the forespore compartment approximately 2 hours after sporulation
  starts, following the earlier action of sigF (the early forespore sigma factor). SigG is responsible
  for the expression of late sporulation-specific genes in the forespore and auto-stimulates its own
  transcription. The activity of sigG is tightly regulated during early forespore development by the
  anti-sigma-G factor Gin (CsfB) and by Lon protease. SigG interacts with Gin via its N-terminal
  region (residues 1-71), and this interaction inhibits sigG activity until the appropriate
  developmental stage. The protein contains the characteristic sigma-70 family domains including a
  helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (residues 229-248) and a polymerase core binding motif
  (residues 67-80).

      label: transcription cis-regulatory region binding
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation suggests sigG binds to transcription cis-regulatory regions.
        According to the GO definition of sigma factor activity (GO:0016987), sigma factors
        do not bind DNA on their own but when combined with the core polymerase to form
        the holoenzyme, they confer promoter specificity. This term is technically inaccurate
        for sigma factors as they require the core polymerase for DNA binding.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        Sigma factors do not bind DNA independently. The GO definition of sigma factor
        activity explicitly states that "sigma does not bind DNA on its own, when combined
        with the core to form the holoenzyme, the sigma factor binds specifically to
        promoter elements." This term implies autonomous DNA binding which is misleading
        for sigma factors. The correct molecular function is GO:0016987 sigma factor activity.

      label: DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation incorrectly attributes catalytic RNA polymerase activity to sigG.
        Sigma factors are NOT enzymes and do not catalyze the polymerization reaction.
        The catalytic activity resides in the core polymerase subunits (beta, beta-prime).
      action: REMOVE
      reason: >-
        This is a clear over-annotation. GO:0003899 is defined as "Catalysis of the reaction:
        nucleoside triphosphate + RNA(n) = diphosphate + RNA(n+1)." Sigma factors do not possess
        catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of RNA polymerization is performed by the
        core enzyme subunits, not by sigma factors. SigG confers promoter specificity but
        does not catalyze nucleotide addition. UniProt describes sigG as an "initiation factor
        that promote[s] the attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites."

      label: regulation of DNA-templated transcription
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: >-
        SigG regulates transcription by directing RNA polymerase to forespore-specific promoters
        and by auto-stimulating its own transcription. This is an appropriate biological process
        annotation for a sigma factor.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        Sigma factors inherently regulate transcription by determining which genes are
        transcribed. SigG specifically regulates the expression of late sporulation genes
        in the forespore and auto-stimulates its own transcription (per UniProt PMID:18208527).
        This is a core function of sigG.

    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: >-
        This is the primary and most accurate molecular function annotation for sigG.
        GO:0016987 is defined as the activity of sigma factors that act as promoter
        specificity subunits of bacterial RNA polymerase.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is the canonical molecular function for sigG. UniProt explicitly identifies
        sigG as "RNA polymerase sigma-G factor" belonging to the "sigma-70 factor family."
        The protein contains all characteristic sigma-70 family domains including the
        HTH DNA-binding motif (residues 229-248) and polymerase core binding motif
        (residues 67-80).

    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: >-
        SigG forms a complex with its anti-sigma factor Gin (CsfB). GO:1903865 is defined
        as "A protein complex which is capable of sigma factor antagonist activity."
        When sigG is bound by Gin, this complex inhibits sigG transcriptional activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        UniProt clearly documents that sigG interacts with anti-sigma-G factor Gin (CsfB)
        via its N-terminal region (residues 1-71). This interaction inhibits sigG activity
        (per PMID:18208527, PMID:19497328). This sigG-Gin complex represents a sigma factor
        antagonist complex that prevents premature sigG activity during early forespore
        development.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This generic DNA binding annotation is inferred from the presence of sigma-70
        family domains. While sigG does contain a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif
        (residues 229-248), sigma factors require the core polymerase for DNA binding.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        SigG contains a HTH DNA-binding motif at residues 229-248 (UniProt feature).
        However, per the GO definition of sigma factor activity, "sigma does not bind
        DNA on its own." The more precise molecular function is GO:0016987 sigma factor
        activity. This annotation is kept as non-core since it reflects domain architecture
        but is less informative than the sigma factor activity annotation.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation from InterPro domain mapping is incorrect for sigma factors.
        Sigma factors are not transcription factors in the classical sense; they are
        subunits of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme that confer promoter specificity.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        GO:0003700 is defined as sequence-specific DNA binding that modulates transcription.
        Sigma factors function differently: they are dissociable subunits of RNA polymerase
        that determine promoter recognition. The correct term is GO:0016987 sigma factor
        activity. While both involve promoter recognition, sigma factors act as part of
        the polymerase holoenzyme rather than as independent transcription factors.

    review:
      summary: >-
        SigG is involved in DNA-templated transcription as a component of the RNA
        polymerase holoenzyme. This is an appropriate general biological process
        annotation inferred from the UniProt Transcription keyword.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        As a sigma factor, sigG is essential for transcription initiation from specific
        promoters. This general process term appropriately captures sigG's role in
        transcription. The annotation is supported by UniProt keywords (Transcription)
        and the well-characterized function of sigma factors in bacterial transcription.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
    review:
      summary: >-
        This is a highly appropriate annotation for sigma factors. Sigma factors
        specifically function in transcription initiation by directing RNA polymerase
        to promoters and are released after initiation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        UniProt states that "Sigma factors are initiation factors that promote the
        attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are then released."
        The specific role of sigma factors in initiation (as opposed to elongation or
        termination) makes this a precise and accurate annotation.

        Duplicate annotation (same term as the IBA annotation above) from automated

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a duplicate of the IBA annotation for the same term. Both annotations
        are valid. Sigma factors regulate transcription by determining which genes
        are expressed. SigG specifically regulates late forespore gene expression
        and auto-stimulates its own transcription.

      reason: >-
        This is a duplicate of the IBA annotation for sigma factor activity. Both
        annotations are valid. This is the core molecular function of sigG, supported

    review:
      summary: >-
        SigG is the late forespore-specific sigma factor essential for sporulation
        in B. subtilis. This biological process annotation appropriately captures
        the developmental context of sigG function.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        SigG is specifically active in the forespore during sporulation. UniProt states
        it is "responsible for the expression of sporulation specific genes in the
        forespore" and is "Active only in the forespore" approximately "2 hours after
        sporulation starts." The Sporulation UniProt keyword correctly maps to this
        GO term.

    evidence_type: IEA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is logically inferred from sigma factor activity (GO:0016987).
        Since sigma factors specifically function at the initiation step, regulation
        of transcription initiation is an appropriate process annotation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a more specific version of the transcription regulation annotation
        that correctly reflects that sigma factors act at the initiation stage. Since
        sigma factors "promote the attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation
        sites," they specifically regulate the initiation step of transcription. This
        logical inference from GO:0016987 is valid.

    review:
      summary: >-
        SigG binds to its anti-sigma factor Gin (CsfB) via residues 1-71. This interaction
        is critical for temporal regulation of sigG activity during sporulation.
      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        UniProt documents direct interaction between sigG and anti-sigma-G factor Gin
        (PMID:18208527, PMID:19497328). The N-terminal region (residues 1-71) is annotated
        as the recognition region for Gin binding. This molecular function annotation
        would accurately capture sigG's ability to bind its cognate anti-sigma factor.

      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        UniProt clearly states that sigG is "Active only in the forespore" (PMID:18208527).
        The forespore is the compartment that will ultimately become the mature spore.
        This cellular component annotation would accurately capture the subcellular
        localization and activity context of sigG.
