  label: Bacillus subtilis (strain 168)
description: ComK is the master transcriptional regulator of genetic competence in
  Bacillus subtilis, functioning as a DNA-binding transcription activator that controls
  the expression of late competence genes required for DNA uptake, processing, and
  recombination. ComK binds to specific AT-rich motifs called K-boxes (consensus AAAA-N5-TTTT)
  in promoter regions as a tetramer (dimer-of-dimers) to activate transcription of
  target genes including the comC, comE, comF, comG operons encoding DNA uptake machinery,
  as well as recA and nucA involved in DNA processing. A critical feature of ComK
  regulation is its positive autoregulation at its own promoter (PcomK), which creates
  a bistable switch leading to bimodal population behavior where only 5-10% of cells
  enter the competent K-state. ComK protein levels are tightly controlled through
  post-translational degradation by the MecA-ClpC-ClpP protease system; the adaptor
  protein MecA targets ComK to the ClpC-ClpP protease for degradation. This proteolytic
  control is relieved by ComS, a small protein produced from the quorum-sensing regulated
  srf operon, which competes with ComK for MecA binding and thereby stabilizes ComK.
  ComK expression is also negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by multiple
  repressors including AbrB, Rok, and CodY, with Spo0A-P relieving AbrB repression
  during transition to stationary phase. The ComK regulon encompasses at least 165
  genes, making it a central hub connecting quorum sensing, nutritional status, and
  stress responses to the developmental decision to enter the competent state.

  review:
    summary: ComK is definitively a DNA-binding protein. It binds to specific AT-rich
      K-box motifs (AAAA-N5-TTTT) in promoter regions to activate transcription of
      competence genes. However, the term GO:0003677 "DNA binding" is too general
      - it does not capture the specific role of ComK as a sequence-specific DNA-binding
      transcription activator.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While ComK does bind DNA, the generic "DNA binding" term is insufficiently
      informative. ComK is specifically a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription
      factor that binds K-box regulatory elements to activate gene expression. The
      more specific term GO:0001216 "DNA-binding transcription activator activity"
      more accurately captures ComK's molecular function as it includes both the DNA
      binding and transcriptional activation aspects of its role.

    label: DNA-templated transcription
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: ComK is involved in transcription as a transcription factor, but GO:0006351
      "DNA-templated transcription" refers to the actual synthesis of RNA from a DNA
      template (the catalytic process performed by RNA polymerase). ComK is a regulatory
      transcription factor that modulates transcription but does not directly catalyze
      RNA synthesis. A more appropriate annotation would be a regulatory process term.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: GO:0006351 is the core transcription process (RNA synthesis from DNA template),
      which is carried out by RNA polymerase, not by transcription factors. ComK's
      role is to regulate transcription by binding to promoter elements and recruiting/activating
      the transcription machinery. The appropriate biological process term would be
      GO:0045893 "positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription" which accurately
      describes ComK's role in activating transcription of target genes.

    label: establishment of competence for transformation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This is the most appropriate biological process term for ComK. ComK is
      the master regulator that directly controls the establishment of competence
      for transformation in B. subtilis. ComK activates all the late competence genes
      required for DNA uptake and processing.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: ComK is definitively required for the establishment of genetic competence.
      ComK directly activates genes encoding DNA uptake machinery (comC, comE, comF,
      comG operons) and DNA processing enzymes (nucA, recA). The term accurately captures
      the biological process in which ComK participates. The deep research confirms
      ComK triggers the K-state (competent state) by upregulating late competence
      genes.

  review:
    summary: ComK is the master positive regulator of competence establishment. It
      activates transcription of all late competence genes and also positively regulates
      its own expression through an autoregulatory feedback loop.
    action: NEW
    reason: This term should be added as it specifically captures ComK's regulatory
      role in competence. ComK positively regulates the establishment of competence
      by activating transcription of late competence genes. The positive autoregulation
      at the comK promoter creates a bistable switch that controls entry into the
      competent state. This term complements GO:0030420 by specifying the regulatory
      relationship.

  evidence_type: TAS
  original_reference_id: file:BACSU/comK/comK-deep-research-falcon.md
  review:
    summary: ComK binds to specific cis-regulatory regions (K-boxes) in promoters
      of competence genes. The K-box is a well-characterized AT-rich motif (AAAA-N5-TTTT)
      that ComK recognizes as a tetramer.
    action: NEW
    reason: This molecular function term captures the specific DNA-binding activity
      of ComK at promoter regulatory regions. ComK binds K-box elements which are
      cis-regulatory regions in promoters of competence genes. This term provides
      more specific information about the nature of ComK's DNA binding activity compared
      to the generic GO:0003677.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the precise molecular mechanism by which ComK tetramer binding
    to K-boxes recruits RNA polymerase and activates transcription? While ComK binding
    to K-boxes is established, the detailed mechanism of transcription activation
    (interaction with sigma factors, RNAP recruitment) is less clear.
- question: Are there ComK-repressed genes beyond rok, and what is the mechanism of
    repression? UniProt notes ComK may repress some genes, but the extent and mechanism
    is unclear.
suggested_experiments:
- description: ChIP-seq of ComK in competent B. subtilis cells to comprehensively
    map K-box binding sites genome-wide. This would provide definitive map of direct
    ComK targets versus indirect effects.
- description: Structural studies of ComK tetramer bound to K-box DNA. This would
