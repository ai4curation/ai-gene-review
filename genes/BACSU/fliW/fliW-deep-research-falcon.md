## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P96503
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Flagellar assembly factor FliW {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01185, ECO:0000303|PubMed:16936039};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fliW {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01185, ECO:0000303|PubMed:16936039}; Synonyms=yviF; OrderedLocusNames=BSU35380;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the FliW family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** Flagellar_assembly_factor_FliW. (IPR003775); Flagellar_assmbl_FliW_dom_sf. (IPR024046); FliW (PF02623)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fliW" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fliW' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fliW** (gene ID: fliW, UniProt: P96503) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- Verified identity and scope: fliW from Bacillus subtilis (strain 168), UniProt P96503, a small cytosolic flagellar assembly factor in the FliW family (PF02623/IPR003775), regulating flagellin (Hag) homeostasis via a partner‑switch with the RNA‑binding protein CsrA and direct binding to Hag; aligns with primary literature cited below (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Protein identity and family: FliW is a small, non‑enzymatic regulatory protein in Bacillus subtilis that belongs to the FliW family (PF02623) and functions in flagellin homeostasis and flagellar assembly checkpoint control (partner‑switch module with CsrA/Hag) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Core mechanism (partner‑switch): FliW antagonizes CsrA, an RNA‑binding protein that represses hag translation by occluding the Shine–Dalgarno region; when cytosolic Hag accumulates, FliW binds Hag and is sequestered, releasing CsrA to repress hag translation again, thereby maintaining a homeostatic, low cytosolic pool of flagellin (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3).
- Physical interactions and stoichiometry: Structural work demonstrates that FliW binds directly to CsrA to allosterically block its RNA‑binding function, forming a CsrA/FliW heterotetramer; FliW also binds flagellin (Hag) directly, and together with the chaperone FliS forms a FliS–Hag–FliW heterotrimer that can dock to the cytoplasmic export gate FlhA‑C of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).
- Cellular localization: These events occur in the cytoplasm at/near the base of the flagellar export apparatus; the FliS–Hag–FliW complex can interact with FlhA‑C, coordinating translation control with chaperoning and export (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority to 2023–2024)
- While directly B. subtilis‑focused 2023–2024 reviews were limited in the retrieved corpus, recent cross‑species analyses in 2025 underscore the conservation and elaboration of the partner‑switch logic, highlighting the FliS–FliW–CsrA–flagellin circuit and its coupling to secretion and proteostasis, consistent with the B. subtilis mechanism (Molecular Microbiology, June 2025; DOI: 10.1111/mmi.15380) (sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 1-2, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 4-6, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 8-9).
- Updated references reiterate the structural and mechanistic basis: FliW allosterically inhibits CsrA (noncompetitive), excluding the 5′UTR from CsrA’s RNA‑binding site; FliW and FliS bind opposite surfaces of flagellin, and the ternary complex can engage FlhA‑C, consistent with an integrated control of synthesis and export (PNAS, Aug 2016; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1602425113; Scientific Reports, Aug 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29884-8) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 9-10).
- Transcriptome‑level work in B. subtilis (2025) frames CsrA and its protein antagonists (including FliW) within broader RNA‑protein interaction networks and suggests potential expansion of CsrA’s regulon in Gram‑positives; this contextualizes FliW’s role as a central post‑transcriptional regulator around flagellar genes (pre‑publication date 2025 noted in the retrieved text) (lawaetz2025startsstopsand pages 201-204).

3) Function, mechanism, and localization in detail
- Primary function: FliW is a flagellar assembly factor that homeostatically controls cytosolic Hag by modulating translation via CsrA antagonism and by binding Hag directly; this prevents premature accumulation of unexported flagellin and enforces a checkpoint on flagellar morphogenesis (PNAS 2016; Aug 29, 2016; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1602425113) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Mechanism and stoichiometry with CsrA: FliW interacts with CsrA to form a heterotetrameric complex and acts as a noncompetitive, allosteric inhibitor of CsrA’s RNA binding. This releases occlusion at the hag ribosome binding site, permitting translation initiation. As Hag accumulates, FliW is titrated by Hag, releasing CsrA to re‑bind and repress hag translation (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Direct binding to Hag and complex with FliS: FliW binds Hag at the N‑terminal region; hydrogen–deuterium exchange protection and SAXS indicate FliW contacts map to two Hag regions: residues 11–34 and 50–72 near the D1N domain and a second region around residues 240–260 (D1‑C). N‑terminal fragments of Hag (~N60/N72) are sufficient for FliW binding. FliW and FliS occupy opposite interfaces on Hag and co‑exist in a FliS–Hag–FliW heterotrimer that can interact with FlhA‑C, suggesting that FliW can remain bound during recruitment for export (Scientific Reports 2018; Aug 8, 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29884-8) (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 9-10).
- Cellular location of action: FliW is cytosolic, acting on CsrA and Hag pools and participating in complexes that approach or engage the cytoplasmic domain of the fT3SS export gate (FlhA‑C) at the flagellar basal body (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).

4) Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Structural analysis (PNAS 2016) concluded that FliW is an ancient regulatory protein with a minimal β‑barrel‑like fold that suppresses CsrA function allosterically, providing a quantitative, mechanistic foundation for the partner‑switch model in B. subtilis (Aug 2016; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1602425113) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Integrated export‑coupling model (Sci Rep 2018) proposes that FliS and FliW together form the molecular framework that couples flagellin production with its type III export, preventing cytosolic overaccumulation and synchronizing synthesis with secretion capacity (Aug 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-29884-8) (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 9-10).
- Cross‑system conservation (Molecular Microbiology 2025) further supports a generalized FliS–FliW–CsrA–flagellin partner‑switch among bacteria, consistent with the B. subtilis paradigm and suggesting evolutionary conservation of the logic that links translation control, chaperoning, and export (Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15380) (sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 1-2, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 4-6, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 8-9).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Stoichiometry: CsrA/FliW forms a heterotetrameric complex in which FliW binds the C‑terminal extension of CsrA, and this complex allosterically prevents CsrA from engaging the hag 5′ UTR at/near the SD sequence (PNAS 2016) (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).
- Binding site mapping on Hag: FliW–Hag contacts map to Hag residues 11–34 and 50–72 (N‑terminal D1N region) and 240–260 (D1‑C region), with N‑terminal fragments (N60–N72) sufficient for FliW binding; FliS binds the opposing (C‑terminal) Hag interface, and the FliS–Hag–FliW heterotrimer interacts with FlhA‑C (Sci Rep 2018) (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).
- Complex formation and export gate engagement: The FliS–Hag heterodimer binds FlhA‑C, and addition of FliW (forming FliS–Hag–FliW) does not preclude FlhA‑C interaction, indicating that FliW can remain associated up to export engagement (Sci Rep 2018) (altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).

6) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Synthetic biology and motility control: The partner‑switch’s homeostatic feedback provides a modular design for coupling protein synthesis to secretion capacity, suggesting translational control nodes for engineered motility or secretion programs; the structural/mechanistic basis (FliW–CsrA allostery; FliS–Hag–FliW–FlhA‑C coupling) indicates concrete molecular levers for tuning expression/export synchrony (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 6-8, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 1-3, altegoer2018flisflagellinfliwheterotrimercouples pages 3-6).
- Comparative and pathogen biology: Conservation of the FliW–CsrA–flagellin logic and ternary chaperone–substrate–regulator complexes in other bacteria supports leveraging the paradigm to understand motility/virulence coupling, with recent work providing mechanistic parallels in evolutionarily distant organisms (Molecular Microbiology 2025; Jun 2025; https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15380) (sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 1-2, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 4-6, sze2025theflagellin‐specificchaperone pages 8-9).

7) Alignment with UniProt/domain data and ambiguity check
- The gene symbol “fliW” matches the Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) flagellar assembly factor described by UniProt P96503; literature consistently uses fliW/FliW for this protein. The protein family/domains (FliW family; PF02623/IPR003775) align with the structural characterization as a small cytosolic regulator with a minimal β‑barrel‑like fold that binds CsrA and Hag, not an enzyme or transporter (altegoer2016structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). No conflicting gene symbol usage was encountered in B. subtilis for FliW in the collected literature.
