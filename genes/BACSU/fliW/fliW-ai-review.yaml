description: 'FliW is a flagellar assembly factor that functions as a partner-switching protein regulating
  flagellin (Hag) homeostasis. Its primary molecular function is as an anti-CsrA protein - it binds CsrA
  allosterically and prevents CsrA from repressing translation of hag mRNA. FliW also binds directly to
  flagellin (Hag) in a mutually exclusive manner with CsrA. This establishes a partner-switching checkpoint
  mechanism: when cytoplasmic flagellin accumulates (before hook completion or after filament assembly
  is complete), FliW binds Hag and releases CsrA to repress hag translation. When flagellin is secreted
  through the type III secretion apparatus during filament assembly, FliW is freed to bind CsrA and relieve
  translational repression, allowing flagellin synthesis. This homeostatic autoregulation ensures flagellin
  is produced only when the hook-basal body is complete and the secretion apparatus is ready. FliW adopts
  a minimal beta-barrel-like fold with a highly negatively charged surface that provides electrostatic
  repulsion against RNA binding when bound to CsrA.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: FliW is required for swarming motility. Mutants of fliW (yviF) in B. subtilis show strongly
      reduced motility (PMID:16936039). PMID:21895793 confirmed reduced swarming motility in fliW mutants.
      The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is well-supported by experimental evidence in
      B. subtilis itself and is consistent with the conserved role of FliW in flagellar assembly across
      bacteria.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported by direct experimental evidence. FliW mutants show strongly
      reduced swarming motility, which is a downstream phenotypic consequence of its role in flagellin
      homeostasis. While not the primary molecular function, it accurately describes a biological process
      FliW is involved in.

  review:
    summary: FliW functions as a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with cytoplasmic flagellin monomers
      and CsrA. UniProt indicates cytoplasmic localization based on HAMAP-Rule:MF_01185. The partner-switching
      mechanism requires FliW to be in the cytoplasm where it can bind to newly synthesized flagellin
      and regulate CsrA activity on hag mRNA.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This localization is consistent with FliW's known molecular function. The protein must be
      cytoplasmic to perform its partner-switching role between flagellin and CsrA. The IEA annotation
      from UniProtKB-SubCell is accurate and well-supported by functional evidence.

  review:
    summary: FliW regulates translation by antagonizing CsrA, the translational repressor of hag mRNA.
      This IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping is accurate but less specific than the IMP annotation
      for GO:0045727 (positive regulation of translation). FliW specifically acts as a positive regulator
      of hag translation by inhibiting CsrA's repressor activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The annotation is technically correct - FliW is involved in regulation of translation. However,
      the more specific annotation GO:0045727 (positive regulation of translation) with IMP evidence is
      also present and captures the directionality of the effect more precisely. Both annotations are
      acceptable as they are at different levels of specificity.

    summary: FliW is involved in bacterial-type flagellum assembly through its role in regulating flagellin
      homeostasis. PMID:16936039 characterized it as a conserved assembly factor of the bacterial flagellum.
      PMID:21895793 showed that fliW mutants have fewer, shorter flagella demonstrating a clear role in

      is well-supported.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately describes FliW's involvement in flagellum assembly. The protein
      is named Flagellar assembly factor FliW and experimental evidence confirms its role. While FliW's
      specific mechanism is regulatory (controlling flagellin synthesis), this contributes directly to
      assembly.

      flagellin production with assembly. This IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping (KW-1005,
      Bacterial flagellum biogenesis) is accurate. The term organization encompasses the broader cellular
      process including assembly and homeostatic control of flagellum components.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is accurate and complementary to GO:0044780 (assembly). FliW's checkpoint

  review:
    summary: FliW positively regulates translation of hag mRNA by antagonizing CsrA, the translational

      repression. PMID:27516547 further showed FliW binds CsrA at an allosteric site and non-competitively
      inhibits CsrA binding to hag RNA. The IMP evidence is well-supported by the mutant phenotype showing
      decreased flagellin levels in fliW mutants.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core function of FliW. By binding and inhibiting the translational repressor CsrA,
      FliW positively regulates translation of hag mRNA. This annotation accurately captures the regulatory
      outcome of FliW's molecular activity. The experimental evidence is strong.

      annotation for the same term but with direct experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Experimental evidence from mutant analysis directly supports FliW's involvement in swarming
      motility. While this is a downstream phenotypic effect rather than the primary molecular function,
      the annotation accurately describes a biological process affected by loss of FliW function.

  review:
    summary: This IMP annotation is based on PMID:21895793, which provides evidence for motility defects
      in fliW mutants. This paper also showed that loss of motility and flagellar assembly are suppressed
      by deletion of csrA, demonstrating that the motility defect is due to CsrA-mediated repression of
      flagellin in the absence of FliW. This is consistent with the partner-switching model.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation provides additional experimental evidence supporting FliW's role in swarming
      motility. The rescue of the phenotype by csrA deletion confirms the mechanistic basis. While a duplicate
      term with the same evidence code, it represents independent experimental validation.

  review:
    summary: FliW regulates bacterial-type flagellum-dependent cell motility through its control of flagellin
      homeostasis. PMID:16936039 showed that fliW mutants have strongly reduced motility. While this term
      is broader than swarming motility, it accurately captures FliW's regulatory role in motility. The
      term is appropriate because FliW does not directly participate in motility but regulates it through
      controlling flagellin availability.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This regulatory term is appropriate because FliW's role is indeed regulatory - it controls
      the availability of flagellin for flagellum assembly rather than directly participating in motility
      mechanics. The term distinguishes the regulatory function from direct involvement.

  review:
    summary: FliW positively regulates bacterial-type flagellum assembly by relieving CsrA-mediated translational

      have fewer, shorter flagella and this phenotype is suppressed by deletion of csrA. The positive
      regulation is mediated through antagonizing CsrA to allow flagellin synthesis.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately describes FliW's function as a positive regulator of flagellum
      assembly. The mutant phenotype (fewer, shorter flagella) and its suppression by csrA deletion directly
      support this annotation. FliW promotes assembly by enabling flagellin production at the appropriate
      time.

    label: molecular function inhibitor activity
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:27516547
  review:
    summary: FliW functions as a molecular function inhibitor by allosterically binding to CsrA and inhibiting
      its RNA-binding activity. PMID:27516547 demonstrated that FliW antagonizes CsrA RNA binding by a
      noncompetitive allosteric mechanism - FliW binds to CsrA at a site distinct from the RNA-binding
      site and induces conformational changes that prevent RNA binding. This is a core molecular function
      of FliW. A more specific child term may be warranted if one exists for translation repressor inhibitor
      activity.
    action: NEW
    reason: The existing GO annotations for FliW lack any molecular function (MF) terms. The only existing
      annotations are for cellular component (cytoplasm) and biological process terms. FliW's primary
      molecular activity is inhibiting the molecular function of CsrA (translation repressor activity).
      GO:0140678 accurately describes this inhibitory activity. This is a significant gap in the current
      annotation set that should be addressed.
