### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P37475
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Stage II sporulation protein E; EC=3.1.3.16; AltName: Full=Stage II sporulation protein H;
- **Gene Information:** Name=spoIIE; Synonyms=spoIIH; OrderedLocusNames=BSU00640;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Bact_Sigma-Reg. (IPR052016); PPM-type-like_dom_sf. (IPR036457); PPM-type_phosphatase-like_dom. (IPR001932); SpoII_E. (IPR014221); SpoIIE_N. (IPR045768)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "spoIIE" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'spoIIE' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **spoIIE** (gene ID: spoIIE, UniProt: P37475) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verify identity and organism; reconcile domain architecture with literature.
- Summarize primary biochemical function, substrates, and pathway placement (SpoIIAA/SpoIIAB/σF).
- Detail spatial/temporal localization during asymmetric septation; effects on septal architecture; relevant interacting partners.
- Provide mechanistic regulation: metal (Mn2+) dependence, oligomerization, and allosteric switching; kinetic specificity vs non-cognate STAS proteins.
- Highlight recent advances on PP2C substrate recognition and divisome modulation; include quantitative measurements (septal thickness, single-molecule stoichiometry/diffusion, etc.).
- Synthesize expert perspectives and applications, and present a compact fact table.

Verification of the research target
- Gene/protein symbol, organism, and synonyms: spoIIE (synonym spoIIH) encodes Stage II sporulation protein E in Bacillus subtilis strain 168, a membrane protein indispensable for asymmetric septation and forespore-specific activation of σF. Literature on SpoIIE in B. subtilis 168 consistently uses this name and function, matching the UniProt description (P37475). Domain structure aligns with SpoIIE’s three-domain organization reported in the primary literature (N-terminal multipass membrane domain I; central regulatory/oligomerization domain II; C-terminal PP2C-like catalytic domain III) (tunaley2013structureandactivity pages 58-62, muchova2020linkingthepeptidoglycan pages 1-3, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35).

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary function and enzyme class: SpoIIE is a PP2C-family, Mn2+-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Its primary physiological substrate is SpoIIAA-P (the phosphorylated anti-anti-σ factor). Dephosphorylating SpoIIAA-P yields SpoIIAA, which binds the anti-σ factor kinase SpoIIAB to release σF, initiating the forespore-specific transcription program. SpoIIE is therefore the dedicated phosphatase that triggers σF activation after asymmetric division (cendrowicz2017metaldependentspoiieoligomerization pages 1-2, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, tunaley2013structureandactivity pages 58-62). URL/date examples: PLoS ONE (2017) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174713; CSBJ (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.005.
- Domain architecture: Domain I (multi-pass TM) anchors SpoIIE at the septal membrane; domain II mediates oligomerization and contributes to FtsZ/complex interactions; domain III (residues roughly 590–827) is the PP2C-like catalytic domain (muchova2020linkingthepeptidoglycan pages 1-3, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35, tunaley2013structureandactivity pages 58-62). URL/date examples: IJMS (2020) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124513; CSBJ (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.005.
- Cellular process and localization: SpoIIE is sporulation-specific, relocalizing from mid-cell to polar Z-rings during the switch to asymmetric division. It accumulates at the polar septum, becomes enriched on the forespore-facing side, and is then retained in the forespore membrane after septum completion—providing compartment-specific σF activation (khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35). eLife (2021) https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62204; CSBJ (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.005.

Recent developments and latest research
- Divisome modulation by SpoIIE’s transmembrane region: New live-cell imaging and perturbation studies show that SpoIIE sequentially modulates the cytokinesis machinery to drive asymmetric division. The SpoIIE TM domain colocalizes with treadmilling divisome components, counteracts MinCD inhibition at the poles, and interacts with the core cell-division protein DivIB. TM swapping maintains Z-ring condensation but blocks constriction, revealing a checkpoint-like role of SpoIIE’s membrane domain in licensing cytokinesis and contributing to unusually short FtsZ filaments during sporulation (preprint, 2025) (ryan2025spoiiedrivesasymmetric pages 1-3). bioRxiv (2025) https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.09.658746.
- High-resolution architecture and septal asymmetry: Cryo-electron tomography resolved a thinner polar sporulation septum (~25 nm) versus vegetative septum (~80 nm) and demonstrated that FtsAZ filaments track only on the mother-cell side during sporulation. SpoIIE regulates both asymmetric divisome localization and septal thickness, linking SpoIIE’s positioning and function to polar septum morphogenesis (khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2). eLife (2021) https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62204.
- PP2C regulatory switch and substrate selectivity: Biochemical and genetic analyses reveal a conserved allosteric switch controlling metal (Mn2+) coordination and catalytic activation across B. subtilis PP2Cs, including SpoIIE. SpoIIE exhibits pronounced specificity for its cognate STAS-domain substrate, SpoIIAA-P, over non-cognate RsbV-P, with Mn2+-dependent cooperative activation kinetics (ho2019aconservedregulatory pages 32-34). bioRxiv (2019) https://doi.org/10.1101/784843; JBC (2021) follow-up summarized in the same line of work (ho2019aconservedregulatory pages 32-34).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Single-molecule quantitation in live B. subtilis: Super-resolution single-molecule imaging quantified SpoIIE stoichiometry and mobility during sporulation. SpoIIE exists as membrane-associated tetramers and assembles into larger clusters as cells progress through stage II; stage-dependent diffusion slows with larger oligomers, consistent with binding to septal complexes. Such quantitative live-cell imaging enables mechanistic dissection and provides parameters usable in computational models of sporulation (wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35). CSBJ (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.005.
- Linking SpoIIE to peptidoglycan biogenesis: Interaction and co-localization data position SpoIIE within a polar complex that includes GpsB and peptidoglycan synthesis proteins, providing a route by which SpoIIE may couple divisome organization to septal wall synthesis; these insights inform synthetic biology and antimicrobial target exploration (muchova2020linkingthepeptidoglycan pages 1-3). IJMS (2020) https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124513.

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Cryo-ET evidence integrates SpoIIE’s role with divisome asymmetry: Khanna et al. conclude SpoIIE is central to establishing asymmetry—both in divisome protein localization (FtsZ/ZA complexes) and in creating a thin polar septum—supporting a model where SpoIIE both positions and tunes divisome architecture to launch forespore-specific gene expression (khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2). eLife (2021) https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62204.
- Biochemical mechanism emphasizes metal-regulated oligomerization and FtsZ modulation: Cendrowicz et al. demonstrate that Mn2+ promotes SpoIIE oligomerization, which stabilizes FtsZ polymers and reduces FtsZ GTPase activity, explaining how SpoIIE can directly influence Z-ring assembly/stability in addition to its phosphatase role (cendrowicz2017metaldependentspoiieoligomerization pages 1-2). PLoS ONE (2017) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174713.
- Phosphatase specificity and regulatory switching: Ho and Bradshaw propose a conserved regulatory switch that coordinates substrate recognition with assembly of the catalytically essential metal-binding site, offering a general framework for SpoIIE’s high specificity toward SpoIIAA-P and tight control of σF activation (ho2019aconservedregulatory pages 32-34). bioRxiv (2019) https://doi.org/10.1101/784843.

Relevant statistics and quantitative findings
- Septal thickness and FtsAZ organization: Vegetative medial septum ~80 nm; sporulation polar septum ~25 nm; FtsAZ filaments track only on the mother-cell side during sporulation (khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2). eLife (2021) https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62204.
- SpoIIE stoichiometry and mobility in vivo: Per-focus SpoIIE stoichiometry increases from ~12 to ~150 molecules at stage IIii; diffusion coefficients in the forespore: stage IIi 0.43±0.08 μm2/s, IIii 0.67±0.19 μm2/s, IIiii 0.50±0.09 μm2/s, stage III 0.76±0.05 μm2/s; mother-cell D ≈ 0.9–1.2 μm2/s (wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35). CSBJ (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.06.005.
- Kinetic specificity: Example kcat/KM values measured in vitro indicate ≳500-fold higher catalytic efficiency for SpoIIAA-P versus RsbV-P for SpoIIE(457–827), with Mn2+-dependent cooperative activation (Hill-like behavior with ~quadratic dependence), underscoring on-pathway specificity (ho2019aconservedregulatory pages 32-34). bioRxiv (2019) https://doi.org/10.1101/784843.

Mechanistic synthesis: pathway and spatial regulation
- Pathway logic: SpoIIE’s catalytic domain (PP2C) dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P. Dephosphorylated SpoIIAA sequesters SpoIIAB (the anti-σF factor/kinase), liberating σF to initiate forespore transcription. This biochemical switch is triggered after polar septation, with SpoIIE concentrated and retained in the forespore membrane, ensuring compartment-specific σF activation (cendrowicz2017metaldependentspoiieoligomerization pages 1-2, khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35).
- Spatial control of cytokinesis: SpoIIE localizes to polar Z-rings and influences Z-ring stability and septal wall architecture. SpoIIE promotes formation and maintenance of polar Z-rings, stabilizes FtsZ filaments (reducing GTPase activity), and contributes to thin septum formation and the asymmetric distribution of division machinery. Emerging work pinpoints the SpoIIE transmembrane region as a critical determinant of these divisome-modulatory roles and suggests a direct interaction with DivIB; interaction/co-complex formation with GpsB links SpoIIE to peptidoglycan synthases (cendrowicz2017metaldependentspoiieoligomerization pages 1-2, khanna2021asymmetriclocalizationof pages 1-2, muchova2020linkingthepeptidoglycan pages 1-3, ryan2025spoiiedrivesasymmetric pages 1-3).
- Regulation by metals and oligomeric state: Mn2+ not only supports catalysis but also promotes SpoIIE oligomerization into large assemblies with distinct biophysical properties. Stage-dependent clustering and diffusion dynamics correlate with engagement of SpoIIE in divisome and intercellular channel complexes, likely tuning its access to SpoIIAA-P and timing of σF activation (cendrowicz2017metaldependentspoiieoligomerization pages 1-2, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 26-31, wollman2020singlemoleculeopticalmicroscopy pages 31-35).

Limitations and open questions
- While structural/biochemical work supports a conserved allosteric switch in PP2Cs and strong specificity for SpoIIAA-P, high-resolution co-structures of full-length SpoIIE with SpoIIAA-P or full divisome components remain to be determined. The recent divisome-modulation mechanisms involving DivIB and MinCD opposition await peer-reviewed confirmation beyond preprint status (ryan2025spoiiedrivesasymmetric pages 1-3, ho2019aconservedregulatory pages 32-34).
