description: >
  SpoIIE is a PP2C-family, Mn2+-dependent protein serine/threonine phosphatase
  that plays a central role in establishing cell-type-specific gene expression
  during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. The protein has three functional
  domains: (1) an N-terminal membrane domain with 10 transmembrane helices that
  localizes SpoIIE to the polar sporulation septum and modulates divisome
  assembly, (2) a central regulatory/oligomerization domain, and (3) a C-terminal
  PPM-type phosphatase domain (residues 594-804). The primary enzymatic function
  of SpoIIE is dephosphorylating SpoIIAA-P (phosphorylated anti-anti-sigma
  factor), which releases active SpoIIAA to sequester the anti-sigma factor
  SpoIIAB, thereby liberating sigma factor F (sigF) to initiate
  forespore-specific transcription. SpoIIE exhibits high kinetic specificity
  for SpoIIAA-P over non-cognate substrates like RsbV-P. Beyond its phosphatase
  activity, SpoIIE participates in asymmetric cell division by promoting polar
  Z-ring formation, stabilizing FtsZ filaments, and contributing to the
  formation of the characteristically thin polar septum. The protein requires
  Mn2+ both for catalytic activity and for oligomerization into functional
  assemblies. SpoIIE localizes first to polar Z-rings during asymmetric
  division, becomes enriched on the forespore-facing membrane, and is
  retained in the forespore compartment where it activates sigF in a
  compartment-specific manner.

    summary: >
      SpoIIE is a well-characterized PP2C-family phosphatase. The IBA annotation
      based on phylogenetic inference (PANTHER) is well-supported by extensive
      biochemical evidence. SpoIIE contains a PPM-type phosphatase domain
      (residues 594-804) and has been shown to dephosphorylate SpoIIAA-P in
      vitro with Mn2+-dependent activity. Crystal structures (PDB: 3T91, 3T9Q,
      5MQH, 5UCG) confirm the PP2C-like fold.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      This is a core molecular function of SpoIIE supported by biochemical,
      structural, and phylogenetic evidence. The phosphatase activity is
      essential for SpoIIE's role in activating sigF during sporulation.

      This IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping to "protein

      specifically a protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP2C family), not a
      general phosphoprotein phosphatase.

      While correct at this level, GO:0004722 (protein serine/threonine
      phosphatase activity) is more specific and also present in the
      annotations. This broader term is acceptable as it captures the general
      function without being incorrect, though the more specific term better
      represents SpoIIE's activity.

  review:
    summary: >
      SpoIIE is a polytopic membrane protein with 10 transmembrane helices in
      its N-terminal domain (residues 49-340). While "plasma membrane" is
      correct in a general sense, SpoIIE has highly specific localization to
      the polar sporulation septum during sporulation. The protein localizes
      first to polar Z-rings and becomes enriched on the forespore-facing side
      of the septum.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      The plasma membrane annotation is technically correct as SpoIIE is
      membrane-associated via its transmembrane helices. However, the more
      specific annotation GO:0042601 (endospore-forming forespore) better
      captures SpoIIE's compartment-specific localization. Both annotations
      are appropriate at different levels of specificity.

      SpoIIE is essential for sporulation, playing dual roles in asymmetric

      at stage II. The protein is required both for proper asymmetric division
      (through divisome modulation) and for activation of the forespore-specific
      transcriptional program via sigF.

  review:
    summary: >
      The IPI annotation references yeast two-hybrid and in vitro
      phosphorylation/dephosphorylation studies showing SpoIIE interacts with
      RacA and RecA. UniProt also records interactions with RacA (P45870) and
      RecA (P16971) via IntAct. However, "protein binding" is too general and
      uninformative for a protein with well-characterized specific interactions.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >
      While SpoIIE does bind proteins (RacA, RecA, SpoIIAA-P, SpoIIQ, FtsZ,
      GpsB, DivIB), the term "protein binding" (GO:0005515) is generally
      discouraged in GO curation as it provides no functional insight. The
      interaction with RacA and RecA appears to relate to SpoIIE's
      phosphatase/dephosphorylation activity toward these substrates rather
      than a distinct binding function. For the core enzymatic function, the
      phosphatase activity terms are more appropriate.

      This IDA annotation based on Campo et al. (2008) is well-supported. The
      study used co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy to show
      that SpoIIE localizes to the forespore compartment. After cytokinesis,
      SpoIIE is released from the septum and localizes to membranes in the
      forespore, then specifically re-localizes to the septal membrane on the
      forespore side during engulfment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >
      This is a well-supported localization annotation based on direct assay
      (IDA) showing SpoIIE specifically localizes to the forespore compartment.
      This localization is functionally significant as it ensures

  review:
    summary: >
      SpoIIE plays a critical role in asymmetric cell division during
      sporulation by modulating the divisome machinery. It localizes to polar
      Z-rings, stabilizes FtsZ filaments, reduces FtsZ GTPase activity, and
      promotes formation of the characteristically thin polar sporulation
      septum (~25 nm vs ~80 nm for vegetative septa). Recent work shows SpoIIE's
      transmembrane domain sequentially modulates cytokinesis machinery to
      drive asymmetric division.
    action: NEW
    reason: >
      Asymmetric cell division is a core biological process involving SpoIIE
      beyond its phosphatase activity. This function is well-documented in
      recent literature including cryo-ET studies showing asymmetric
      localization of FtsZ on the mother-cell side during sporulation.
