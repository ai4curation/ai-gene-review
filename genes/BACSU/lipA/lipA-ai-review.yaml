description: >-
  LipA (also known as yutB) is a lipoyl synthase belonging to the radical SAM superfamily
  that catalyzes the final step of de novo lipoate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis.
  The enzyme inserts two sulfur atoms into the C6 and C8 positions of protein-bound
  octanoyl groups (attached to lipoyl domains of acceptor proteins such as GcvH and E2
  subunits of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes), converting them to lipoyl cofactors.
  LipA contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters: a radical-SAM cluster for generating 5'-deoxyadenosyl
  radicals from S-adenosyl-L-methionine, and an auxiliary cluster that serves as the
  sacrificial sulfur donor. In B. subtilis, LipA functions in a pathway where LipM first
  transfers octanoyl from ACP to GcvH, LipA then inserts sulfurs to form lipoyl-GcvH,
  and LipL transfers the lipoyl moiety to E2 domains. Disruption of lipA causes lipoate
  auxotrophy and severely impairs growth in minimal medium due to defective lipoate-dependent
  enzymes, leading to impaired branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation from InterPro mapping assigns the very general term "catalytic activity"
      based on the presence of radical SAM domains. LipA is indeed a catalyst (lipoyl synthase,
      EC 2.8.1.8), but this term is far too general and uninformative.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      LipA has well-established lipoyl synthase activity (EC 2.8.1.8). The term "catalytic activity"
      is overly broad and should be replaced with the specific molecular function term
      GO:0016992 (lipoate synthase activity) which accurately describes LipA's enzymatic function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation assigns cytoplasmic localization based on UniProt subcellular location
      annotation and UniRule. In B. subtilis (a Gram-positive bacterium lacking membrane-bound
      organelles), LipA and partner enzymes function in the cytosol where they act on soluble
      lipoyl domains of central metabolic complexes.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is correct for B. subtilis LipA. The enzyme acts on
      cytosolic acceptor proteins including GcvH and E2 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase,
      2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes
      (Cronan 2024; Christensen 2011).

    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation assigns involvement in lipoate biosynthesis based on InterPro
      lipoyl synthase domain and UniRule mapping. LipA catalyzes the final step of de novo
      lipoate biosynthesis by inserting sulfur atoms into octanoyl groups.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      LipA is the key enzyme for de novo lipoate biosynthesis, catalyzing sulfur insertion
      into protein-bound octanoyl groups. This is the core biological process of the enzyme
      and is well supported by the literature (Cronan 2024; Christensen 2010).

      LipA directly modifies protein-bound octanoyl groups on lipoyl domains, converting
      them to lipoyl groups covalently attached to lysine residues.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      LipA functions specifically on protein substrates (octanoyl-GcvH, octanoyl-E2), not
      free octanoate, and its product is a protein-bound lipoyl cofactor. This annotation
      accurately reflects the enzyme's role in the post-translational lipoylation of proteins
      (Douglas 2008; Cronan 2024).

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation assigns transferase activity based on UniProt keyword mapping
      (Transferase KW-0808). LipA is classified as EC 2.8.1.8, which is a sulfurtransferase
      that transfers sulfur atoms to octanoyl groups.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      LipA is a sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.8) and thus correctly annotated as having
      transferase activity. While this is a general parent term, it is accurate and
      provides useful hierarchical information complementing the more specific lipoate
      synthase activity annotation.

      LipA is classified as EC 2.8.1.8 (sulfurtransferase class). The enzyme transfers

      LipA binds iron as part of its two [4Fe-4S] clusters. The annotation is correct
