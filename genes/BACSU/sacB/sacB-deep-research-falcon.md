## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P05655
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Levansucrase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:4206083}; EC=2.4.1.10 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14517548, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18596022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32553967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33303628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:4206083}; AltName: Full=Beta-D-fructofuranosyl transferase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6424671}; AltName: Full=Fructosyltransferase {ECO:0000303|PubMed:14517548}; Short=FTF {ECO:0000303|PubMed:14517548}; AltName: Full=Sucrose 6-fructosyl transferase; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=sacB {ECO:0000303|PubMed:6424671}; OrderedLocusNames=BSU34450;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 68 family. .
- **Key Domains:** Glyco_hydro_68. (IPR003469); Glyco_hydro_beta-prop_sf. (IPR023296); Glyco_hydro_68 (PF02435)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "sacB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sacB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sacB** (gene ID: sacB, UniProt: P05655) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Title: Functional annotation of Bacillus subtilis sacB (UniProt P05655): levansucrase identity, mechanism, localization, pathways, and applications

Plan status: We verified the gene/protein identity, gathered recent and foundational literature (prioritizing 2023–2024), compiled mechanistic and localization evidence, summarized applications, created a summary artifact, and integrated all material into this report.

Verification of identity and scope
- Gene symbol and organism: sacB from Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) encodes levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10), a secreted fructosyltransferase that synthesizes levan-type fructans from sucrose; this assignment and GH68 family membership are supported by recent genomic-operon analyses and prior work (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions
- Enzyme class and family: Levansucrase (SacB) is a glycoside hydrolase family 68 (GH68) enzyme that catalyzes both sucrose hydrolysis and transfructosylation to form β-2,6-linked levan and levan-type fructooligosaccharides (L-FOSs) (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2). GH68 levansucrases share a 5‑bladed beta-propeller fold and a retaining double-displacement catalytic mechanism (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050, Jun 2017) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2).
- Reaction and products: SacB uses sucrose as donor to form a fructosyl–enzyme intermediate and transfers fructose to water (hydrolysis) or to an acceptor sugar to elongate β(2→6)-linked fructans. Products range from L-FOS (e.g., DP3–5 and longer) to high-molecular-weight levan; branching with occasional β(2→1) linkages is described in microbial levan (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2).

Mechanism, catalytic residues, fold, and specificity
- Catalytic mechanism: GH68 levansucrases operate via a retaining double-displacement mechanism with two transition states (TS1, TS2). In Bacillus megaterium LS (close to B. subtilis SacB), the catalytic nucleophile is Asp (e.g., D95) and the acid/base is Glu (e.g., E352), and the enzyme’s open, water-accessible active site in single-domain Gram-positive levansucrases biases toward hydrolysis unless engineered to favor acceptors (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050, Jun 2017) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2).
- Engineering insights: Mutations in first-shell residues that coordinate the nucleophile or manage active-site water (e.g., S173, Y421, S422, Y439) can increase transfructosylation and shift product spectra, indicating how SacB-like enzymes may be tuned for FOS vs levan (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050, Jun 2017) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2).
- Metal-ion modulation: Although levansucrases do not require metals for catalysis, recent work identified a metal-binding loop in some bacterial levansucrases; certain divalent ions (e.g., Ca2+) increased fructosylation and levan synthesis, consistent with allosteric control of hydrolysis vs transfructosylation partitioning (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2411.11030, Feb 2025) (ko2025insightofmetal pages 7-8).

Cellular localization, processing, and physiological role
- Secretion: SacB possesses an N-terminal Sec-type signal peptide and is secreted extracellularly in Gram-positive bacteria, consistent with its role in exopolysaccharide synthesis at/near the cell surface (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 3-5).
- Physiological role: Levan functions as an extracellular polysaccharide contributing to the matrix in Bacillus spp. biofilms; earlier work catalogs EPS genes and polymers in B. subtilis, including sacB for levan synthesis (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02085.x, Dec 2010) (marvasi2010, not directly captured by pqac IDs; see contextual support in 2024 operon/source).

Genetic context and pathway
- Operon organization: In Bacillaceae, sacB often co-occurs with levB encoding an endo-levanase (GH32). levB internally cleaves levan to generate L-FOS, shaping product distributions. Genomic analyses identify a sacB–levB operon and carbohydrate transporters that feed sucrose into the pathway; in B. subtilis the levan system is linked to broader sucrose utilization loci (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2, lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 3-5).
- Substrate uptake and regulation: Carbohydrate transporters (ABC systems, PTS) and sucrose-responsive control are implicated in levan synthesis capacity; sucrose is the primary inducer/substrate for SacB activity (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2).

Recent developments (2023–2024 priority) and latest research
- High-yield whole-cell production: Priestia koreensis HL12 harboring a sacB–levB operon produced 127 g/L levan from 300 g/L sucrose (≈55% conversion) within 48 h, with both short-chain (DP3–5) and longer L-FOS detected, highlighting the potential of Bacillaceae systems for efficient levan/FOS biosynthesis (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2).
- Process integration: A fusion enzyme between B. licheniformis LevB and B. subtilis SacB expressed in Pichia pastoris enabled one-pot synthesis of monosaccharide-free L-FOS. In a 1.5 L bioreactor, yield reached 45.5% (w L-FOS/w sucrose), with DP <10 under those conditions (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-02009-7, Jan 2023) (avilafernandez2023simultaneousenzymeproduction pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic control: Active-site residue engineering continues to be a lever to favor transfructosylation over hydrolysis in Bacillus levansucrases, guiding product size distribution and acceptor usage (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050, Jun 2017) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2). Emerging 2025 evidence suggests metal-binding loops in some levansucrases can stimulate fructosylation, providing an additional tuning knob (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2411.11030, Feb 2025) (ko2025insightofmetal pages 7-8).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic counterselection: sacB expression causes sucrose-dependent lethality in many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, enabling efficient allelic exchange. Recent demonstrations include V. natriegens engineering workflows citing sacB lethality in sucrose (Microbiology Spectrum, Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03964-23) and a new sacB-based counterselection built for Fusobacterium nucleatum (Microbiology Spectrum, Jan 2025; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02066-24) (glasgo 2024 and zhou 2025 captured in evidence) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 9-10).
- Biomanufacturing: Leveraging SacB’s transfructosylation, industrially relevant processes target levan and L-FOS production. Quantitative outputs reported recently include 127 g/L levan at ≈55% sucrose conversion (2024 whole-cell) and 45.5% L-FOS yield in Pichia systems (2023), and other studies continue to optimize acceptor availability and enzyme ratios to modulate DP and reduce monosaccharides (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-02009-7) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2, avilafernandez2023simultaneousenzymeproduction pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Structural-mechanistic perspective: The prevailing view is that single-domain Bacillus GH68 levansucrases possess an open, water-accessible active site that predisposes to hydrolysis; increasing hydrophobicity or constraining water at the +1 subsite, and fine-tuning nucleophile/acid-base coordination, enhance transfructosylation and tailor product spectra. These insights inform protein engineering for FOS-rich outputs (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050, Jun 2017) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2).
- Systems perspective: Operon-level organization with levB provides endogenous capacity to generate defined L-FOS from polymeric levan, and transporter/promoter context supports sucrose-responsive production. Recent genomic and process studies emphasize strain selection and secretion optimization to increase titers and control molecular weight distributions (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043, Aug 2024) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2, lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 3-5).

Relevant statistics and data (recent)
- Levan titer and conversion: 127 g/L levan at ≈55% conversion from 300 g/L sucrose in 48 h using Priestia koreensis HL12 (2024) (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2).
- L-FOS yield and DP: 45.5% w/w L-FOS yield (bioreactor) with DP <10 using a LevB–SacB fusion expressed in Pichia pastoris (2023) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-02009-7) (avilafernandez2023simultaneousenzymeproduction pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic partitioning: Bacillus levansucrases can be hydrolysis-biased; engineering first-shell residues increases transfructosylation by 30–200% with altered product profiles (2017 reference, mechanistic basis for ongoing 2023–2024 engineering efforts) (https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050) (ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2).

Conclusion
B. subtilis sacB encodes a secreted GH68 levansucrase that catalyzes a retaining transfructosylation/hydrolysis reaction on sucrose to build β-2,6-linked levan and L-FOS. Its 5‑bladed β‑propeller active site, catalytic Asp/Glu pair, and water accessibility govern product partitioning. In Bacillaceae, sacB commonly resides with levB, facilitating conversion between levan and L-FOS. Recent 2023–2024 studies highlight high levan titers and integrated bioprocesses yielding monosaccharide-free L-FOS. sacB remains a widely adopted genetic counterselection marker due to sucrose lethality in diverse bacteria. Together, structural-mechanistic insights and operon/process engineering continue to expand sacB’s roles in biotechnology and synthetic biology (https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2404.04043; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-022-02009-7; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwx050; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03964-23; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02066-24) (lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 1-2, lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 3-5, ortizsoto2017impairedcoordinationof pages 1-2, avilafernandez2023simultaneousenzymeproduction pages 1-2, lekakarn2024exploringlevansucraseoperon pages 9-10).
