description: >-
  Levansucrase (SacB) is a secreted glycosyl hydrolase family 68 (GH68) enzyme that catalyzes
  the synthesis of levan, a beta-2,6-linked fructose polymer, by transferring fructosyl moieties
  from sucrose to a growing acceptor molecule (EC 2.4.1.10). The enzyme operates via a retaining
  double-displacement mechanism with Asp86 as the catalytic nucleophile and Glu342 as the
  acid/base catalyst. At low sucrose concentrations, the enzyme functions primarily as a hydrolase
  with water as acceptor, releasing glucose and fructose; at higher substrate concentrations, it
  adds fructosyl units to growing levan chains. The enzyme contains a signal peptide (residues 1-29)
  and is secreted to the extracellular space where it synthesizes levan as an exopolysaccharide
  component of biofilm matrix. Ca2+ binding (at residues Asn241, Asp272, Asn308, Asp310, Asp339)
  plays an important structural role promoting enzyme stability. The sacB gene is part of the
  sacB-yveB-yveA operon and is induced by sucrose. SacB is widely used as a counterselection
  marker in bacterial genetics because its expression in the presence of sucrose is lethal in
  many Gram-negative bacteria, likely due to toxic accumulation of levan or fructose metabolites.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SacB is a secreted enzyme that functions in the extracellular space. The protein contains
      an N-terminal Sec-type signal peptide (residues 1-29) that directs secretion via the
      general secretory pathway. UniProt annotation confirms "Secreted" subcellular location
      based on experimental characterization of the signal peptide (PMID:6424671).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The extracellular localization is well-established. The signal peptide has been
      experimentally characterized and the mature protein (residues 30-473) is secreted to the
      extracellular space where it synthesizes levan as part of the biofilm matrix. This is
      consistent with the enzyme's physiological role in producing extracellular polysaccharides.

    label: carbohydrate utilization
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is derived from InterPro mapping. While sacB is involved in
      carbohydrate metabolism (specifically sucrose as substrate), the primary function is
      not carbohydrate utilization for energy but rather the biosynthesis of the
      exopolysaccharide levan. The term is too general and somewhat misleading for this
      enzyme's actual function.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term "carbohydrate utilization" (GO:0009758) implies catabolism for energy or
      nutrient acquisition. While SacB does use sucrose as a substrate, its primary
      biological function is levan biosynthesis - an anabolic process producing
      extracellular polysaccharide. A more accurate biological process term would be
      GO:0010146 "fructan biosynthetic process" since levan is a type of fructan
      (beta-2,6-linked fructose polymer).

  review:
    summary: >-
      SacB is indeed a transferase - specifically a fructosyltransferase that transfers
      the fructosyl moiety from sucrose to acceptor molecules. However, this annotation
      is too general. A much more specific and informative term exists: GO:0050053
      "levansucrase activity" which is already annotated to this protein.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      While technically correct, GO:0016740 "transferase activity" is an extremely broad
      parent term. The more specific annotation GO:0050053 "levansucrase activity"
      (EC 2.4.1.10) is already present in the annotation set and fully captures the
      enzymatic function. This general term adds no information beyond what is already
      captured by the specific term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SacB is a glycosyltransferase, specifically transferring fructosyl groups from
      sucrose. This term is more specific than "transferase activity" but still less
      informative than the existing specific annotation GO:0050053 "levansucrase activity".
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      This annotation is technically correct as levansucrase is a type of glycosyltransferase.
      However, GO:0050053 "levansucrase activity" provides much more specific information
      about the enzyme's function. The hierarchy relationship (levansucrase activity is_a
      glycosyltransferase activity) means this annotation is redundant with the more
      specific term already present.

      SacB binds calcium ions which play an important structural role in enzyme stability.
      Crystal structures have identified five Ca2+ binding residues: Asn241, Asp272, Asn308,
      Asp310, and Asp339. However, Ca2+ is not required for catalytic activity per se but
      rather promotes protein stability.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct that SacB binds metal ions, specifically Ca2+. However,
      GO:0046872 "metal ion binding" is overly broad. The specific calcium ion binding
      has been extensively characterized by X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis. A more
      precise annotation would be GO:0005509 "calcium ion binding". The calcium plays a
      structural/regulatory role rather than being directly involved in catalysis.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Levansucrase activity (EC 2.4.1.10) is the precise molecular function of SacB. The
      enzyme catalyzes: sucrose + (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n -> glucose + (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n+1.
      This has been extensively characterized by kinetic studies (Km ~8-9 mM for sucrose),
      X-ray crystallography (PDB: 1OYG, 1PT2, 6VHQ), and mutagenesis of active site residues.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core molecular function of SacB and is extremely well characterized.
      Multiple publications provide direct experimental evidence including enzyme kinetics
      (PMID:4206083, PMID:18596022), crystal structures with bound substrate (PMID:14517548),
      and site-directed mutagenesis of catalytic residues (Asp86 nucleophile, Glu342 acid/base).
      The enzyme operates via a retaining double-displacement mechanism. This annotation
      should be retained as representing the primary function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Levan is a type of fructan (specifically a beta-2,6-linked fructan). SacB is
      directly responsible for fructan/levan biosynthesis as its primary biological
      function. This process annotation appropriately captures what the enzyme does
      at the cellular/organismal level.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This annotation is missing from the current GOA set and represents an important
      biological process function of SacB. The enzyme's physiological role is to
      synthesize levan (a fructan polymer) which forms part of the extracellular
      matrix in B. subtilis biofilms. While the molecular function (levansucrase
      activity) is annotated, the corresponding biological process term should also
      be included for completeness.
