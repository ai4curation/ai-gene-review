description: >-
  FliY is a bifunctional flagellar motor switch protein that acts as a CheY-P phosphatase
  localized at the flagellar C-ring. It contains three functional domains: an N-terminal
  CheY-binding region homologous to FliM residues 6-15, a middle CheC-like phosphatase
  domain with conserved Glu/Asn catalytic residues, and a C-terminal FliN-like domain
  that integrates it into the flagellar switch complex. FliY catalyzes the dephosphorylation
  of the phosphorylated response regulator CheY-P at the site of its action (the flagellar
  motor), thereby contributing to signal termination in the chemotaxis pathway. B. subtilis
  uses a three-phosphatase system (CheC, FliY, CheX) instead of the CheZ found in E. coli.
  FliY functions constitutively to maintain optimal CheY-P levels near the motor, while
  CheC responds to attractant stimuli. FliY can complement Salmonella fliN mutants,
  confirming its structural role in the C-ring.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for phosphoprotein phosphatase activity is strongly supported by
      phylogenetic analysis and experimental evidence. FliY contains CheC-like phosphatase
      domains with conserved catalytic residues and has been directly demonstrated to
      catalyze CheY-P dephosphorylation [PMID:12920116].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This IBA annotation is well-supported by the phylogenetic tree inference and is
      consistent with extensive experimental evidence. PMID:12920116 directly demonstrates
      that FliY increases the rate of CheY-P hydrolysis in vitro. The domain architecture
      (CheC-like phosphatase domain) and structural studies further support this function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for regulation of flagellum-dependent motility is well-supported.
      FliY regulates motility by controlling CheY-P levels at the flagellar motor,
      which determines flagellar rotation direction [PMID:12920116].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation accurately captures FliY's regulatory role in motility. By
      dephosphorylating CheY-P at the flagellar switch, FliY modulates the duration
      of enhanced CheY-P levels and thereby regulates switching between clockwise
      and counterclockwise flagellar rotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation based on InterPro domain IPR001172 (FliN_T3SS_HrcQb). This annotation
      is problematic because FliY is not itself a motor protein - it is a component of
      the motor switch that regulates motor activity, but does not generate force or
      movement directly.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This is an over-annotation. FliY is a component of the flagellar motor switch
      complex (C-ring) but it does not have motor activity itself. The motor activity
      is generated by the stator units (MotA/MotB) interacting with FliG. FliY's role
      is to modulate CheY-P levels, not to generate rotational force. The InterPro
      domain hit is based on FliN homology, but FliN is a switch component, not a
      motor per se. The term "cytoskeletal motor activity" implies direct force
      generation, which FliY does not perform.

      While plasma membrane association is not incorrect, a more specific and informative

      supporting_text: "Consequently, we imagine that the duration of enhanced CheY-P levels caused by activation of the CheA kinase upon attractant binding to receptors, is brief due both to adaptational processes and to phosphatase activity of FliY."

suggested_questions:
- question: >-
    What is the relative contribution of FliY vs CheC vs CheX to total
    CheY-P dephosphorylation under different chemotactic stimulation conditions?

- question: >-
    Does FliY have dual active sites like T. maritima FliY, and do both
    contribute equally to catalysis in B. subtilis?

suggested_experiments:
- description: >-
    Purify B. subtilis FliY and measure Km and kcat for CheY-P
    dephosphorylation to compare with CheC and CheX. Quantitative kinetic
    parameters would enable modeling of the three-phosphatase system.
  hypothesis: >-
    FliY kinetic parameters differ from CheC and CheX, reflecting distinct
    roles in chemotaxis signal termination

- description: >-
    Use cryo-EM or crosslinking mass spectrometry to determine the precise
    position of FliY within the B. subtilis C-ring. High-resolution structural
    information would reveal FliY integration into the switch.
  hypothesis: >-
    FliY occupies a specific position in the C-ring that places it in
    proximity to CheY-P binding sites on FliM
