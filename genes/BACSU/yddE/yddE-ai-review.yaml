description: >-
  VirB4-like ATPase (ConE) of the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1.
  Essential component of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) required for
  conjugative DNA transfer and plasmid mobilization. Contains conserved Walker A/B
  motifs and VirB4-specific motifs C, D (with arginine finger), and E required for
  ATP binding/hydrolysis. Localizes to the cell membrane with polar enrichment,
  dependent on interactions with the bitopic membrane protein ConB and membrane
  protein ConD. Interacts with the coupling protein ConQ. Belongs to the HerA/FtsK
  superfamily of ATPases.

  review:
    summary: >-
      ConE/YddE is a VirB4-family P-loop NTPase with conserved Walker A and Walker B
      motifs essential for function (PMID:19734305, Murthy et al. 2023). The term
      nucleotide binding is valid but highly generic; the more specific term ATP binding
      (GO:0005524) already captures this function more precisely.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this annotation is correct (the protein contains a P-loop NTPase domain
      with Walker A/B motifs that bind ATP/nucleotides), it is redundant with the more
      specific GO:0005524 (ATP binding) annotation also present. The IEA annotation is
      valid but generic. Accepting as non-core since the ATP binding annotation is
      more informative.

  review:
    summary: >-
      ConE contains essential Walker A and Walker B motifs required for ATP binding.
      Mutations in these motifs (K476E Walker A; D703A/E704A Walker B) abolish
      conjugation function without affecting membrane localization (PMID:19734305,
      Murthy et al. 2023).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ATP binding is a core molecular function of ConE. The Walker A (K476) and
      Walker B (D703/E704) motifs are conserved and essential for conjugation
      function. PMID:19734305 states "conjugative transfer of ICEBs1 requires a
      conserved ATPase motif of ConE" and the 2023 Murthy et al. study confirmed
      that Walker A/B substitutions abolish mating function.

  review:
    summary: >-
      ConE is required for ICEBs1-mediated unidirectional conjugative DNA transfer.
      Deletion of conE abolishes conjugation, and mutations in the ATPase motifs
      drastically reduce mating frequency (PMID:19734305, Murthy et al. 2023).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core biological process annotation. PMID:19734305 explicitly
      demonstrates that "the ICEBs1 gene conE (formerly yddE) is required for
      conjugation" using genetic deletion and complementation experiments. The
      IMP evidence code is appropriate as this was demonstrated by mutant phenotype
      analysis.

      ConE-GFP localizes to the cell membrane as demonstrated by fluorescence

      Membrane localization is clearly demonstrated in PMID:19734305. The paper

    summary: >-
      ConE is the VirB4 homolog of the ICEBs1 type IV secretion system. It interacts
      with ConB (bitopic membrane T4SS component) and ConQ (coupling protein) to form
      part of the T4SS complex (Murthy et al. 2023).
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      ConE is explicitly identified as a VirB4-family component of a type IV secretion
      system. The 2023 Murthy et al. study title is "Characterization of ConE, the VirB4
      Homolog of the Integrative and Conjugative Element ICEBs1." Bacterial two-hybrid
      assays demonstrate interactions with other T4SS components ConB and ConQ. This
      is a core cellular component annotation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      As a VirB4/HerA/FtsK family ATPase required for conjugative DNA transfer,
      ConE is predicted to function as a DNA translocase. The GO definition of
      DNA translocase activity explicitly mentions FtsK/SpoIIIE family members.
      While ATPase activity was not detected in vitro (likely requiring membrane
      context or partner proteins), the genetic requirement for ATPase motifs
      in conjugation supports this function.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      ConE belongs to the HerA/FtsK superfamily of ATPases (PMID:19734305), which
      are defined as DNA translocases in GO:0015616. The annotation is based on
      sequence similarity to characterized DNA translocases and the requirement
      for conserved ATPase motifs for conjugative DNA transfer function. This
      represents the core molecular function of ConE in driving DNA translocation
      during conjugation.

    summary: >-
      ConE is essential for ICEBs1-mediated DNA transfer, which occurs via a
      type IV secretion system mechanism. As the VirB4 ATPase homolog, ConE
      powers the DNA translocation process.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      This process annotation captures ConE's role in T4SS-mediated DNA transfer.
      PMID:19734305 shows ConE is required for conjugation (DNA transfer), and the
      protein is the VirB4 homolog of the ICEBs1 T4SS. The 2023 Murthy et al. study
      confirms ConE is essential for "ICEBs1-mediated conjugative DNA transfer."

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What are the specific conditions required to reconstitute ConE ATPase
      activity in vitro? The 2023 Murthy et al. study could not detect ATPase
      activity despite strong genetic evidence for ATPase function.
  - question: >-
      Does ConE directly contact DNA during translocation, or does it act
      indirectly through the coupling protein ConQ? VirB4 family proteins have
      variable mechanisms.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Reconstitute ConE ATPase activity using purified ConB, ConQ, and
      liposomes or nanodiscs to provide membrane context. This would directly
      test the hypothesis that membrane and partner proteins are required for
      ATPase activation.
  - description: >-
      Cross-linking mass spectrometry of ConE with ssDNA or dsDNA substrates
      in the presence of ATP analogs. This would determine whether ConE directly
      contacts DNA during the translocation cycle.
