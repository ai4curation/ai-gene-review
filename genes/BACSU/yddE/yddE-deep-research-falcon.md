## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P96642
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Uncharacterized protein YddE;
- **Gene Information:** Name=yddE; OrderedLocusNames=BSU04940;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_SAG2001_prd. (IPR016628); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); T4SS_component. (IPR051162); AAA_10 (PF12846)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "yddE" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'yddE' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **yddE** (gene ID: yddE, UniProt: P96642) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: yddE (BSU04940; UniProt P96642) in Bacillus subtilis 168

Summary
The Bacillus subtilis 168 gene yddE (ordered locus BSU04940; UniProt P96642) encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) P-loop NTPase of the VirB4 family, now commonly referred to as ConE in the context of the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1. ConE/YddE is essential for ICEBs1-mediated conjugative DNA transfer, localizes to the cell membrane with polar enrichment, and requires conserved ATPase motifs for function. Protein–protein interaction mapping places ConE in a membrane-associated T4SS subcomplex with ConB and the coupling protein ConQ. While ConE’s ATPase activity is strongly implicated by motif dependence, in vitro ATP hydrolysis was not detected under many conditions, suggesting regulation by partners/membrane or specific solution conditions. These conclusions are grounded in recent primary work from 2023 that explicitly links yddE to ConE and to VirB4/T4SS biology in B. subtilis (Journal of Bacteriology, Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 1-2, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Target identity and nomenclature: yddE (BSU04940) in Bacillus subtilis 168 corresponds to the T4SS ATPase ConE encoded by ICEBs1; the 2023 study explicitly notes the previous yddE annotation and analyzes ConE in this organism. The work leverages AlphaFold/UniProt P96642 for structural prediction context, connecting the UniProt accession provided to ConE/YddE. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (Published June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 1-2, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7)
- Protein family and domains: ConE/YddE is a VirB4-family P-loop NTPase/AAA+-like ATPase. It contains conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs and VirB4-specific motifs C, D (with arginine finger), and E required for ATP binding/hydrolysis and intersubunit communication typical of VirB4 ATPases. These features align with the P-loop NTPase and AAA+ domain assignments provided for P96642. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Biological role: ConE is required for conjugation—the ICEBs1-encoded T4SS-dependent transfer of DNA between cells—and for ICEBs1-mediated mobilization of resident plasmids in B. subtilis. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024)
- Functional mapping of catalytic motifs: Alanine substitutions in five conserved residues spanning motifs C–E (e.g., D498A, E502A, W706A, R726A (arginine finger), Q737A) drastically reduced mating/conjugation frequency without affecting ConE protein levels or membrane/polar localization, directly implicating the ATPase active site in DNA transfer. Walker A (K476E) and Walker B (D703A/E704A) variants similarly failed to support mating. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Biochemistry and oligomerization: Purified ConE behaves largely as a monomer with some oligomers by native analyses; ATP, ssDNA, or dsDNA additions did not strongly alter oligomerization in vitro. Notably, ATPase activity was not detected under numerous conditions in a coupled assay, consistent with the known difficulty of detecting VirB4 ATPase activity and suggesting regulation, partner dependence, or membrane requirements. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 7-9, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 12-13)
- Protein–protein interactions and assembly logic: Bacterial two-hybrid assays demonstrate ConE self-interaction and interactions with ConB (a bitopic membrane T4SS component required for ConE membrane localization) and ConQ (the coupling protein). Loss of conC or conD reduces cellular ConE levels, and conD/conE may be translationally coupled, supporting assembly dependencies in the ICEBs1 T4SS. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 7-9, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Subcellular localization: Fluorescent fusions show ConE localizes to the cell membrane with pronounced polar enrichment. Localization depends on the ICEBs1 transmembrane proteins ConB and ConD; ConB directly interacts with ConE. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Horizontal gene transfer and mobilization: By enabling ICEBs1 conjugative transfer and the mobilization of resident plasmids, ConE/YddE participates in real-world dissemination of genetic traits such as antibiotic resistance, metabolism, and virulence in Gram-positive bacteria. The 2023 study frames ConE as essential for these processes in B. subtilis, making it a functional node for genetic exchange applications and for dissecting T4SS assembly in Gram-positive systems. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 1-2)
- Experimental systems: The work establishes tractable in vivo assays (mating frequency readouts), live-cell localization imaging, and interaction mapping (BACTH), which can be used to evaluate engineered variants, dissect assembly dependencies, and probe partner requirements for activity in Gram-positive T4SS research and synthetic biology. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 11-12, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 12-13)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- ConE as the conserved VirB4 ATPase of ICEBs1: The 2023 Journal of Bacteriology article positions ConE/YddE as the central, conserved VirB4-family ATPase of the ICEBs1 T4SS, akin to VirB4 proteins in diverse T4SS machines. The study’s mutational and interaction data support a model where ConE’s ATPase motifs are necessary for conjugation but not for membrane targeting, and where ConB and ConD help recruit/stabilize ConE at the membrane. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 1-2, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- ATPase regulation and detection challenges: The inability to detect ATPase activity in vitro, despite strong genetic dependence on ATPase motifs, is interpreted as evidence for regulated activation requiring the membrane, oligomeric assembly, or interaction with partner proteins such as ConB/ConQ—an interpretation consistent with broader VirB4 literature as summarized by the authors. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 9-11)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Conjugation phenotypes: Multiple single-residue substitutions within/near motifs C–E (D498A, E502A, W706A, R726A, Q737A) each “drastically” reduce mating/conjugation frequency, while Walker A/B substitutions abolish function. These effects occurred without major changes in protein levels or localization, quantitatively separating catalytic function from targeting. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Localization dependencies: Loss of ICEBs1 membrane components reduces ConE levels and disrupts localization; specifically, ConB is required for ConE membrane/polar localization and directly interacts with ConE, while conC and conD deletions reduce ConE abundance (approximately twofold for conC and fivefold for conD in the reported experiments), supporting a dependency network in assembly. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 7-9, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Biochemical state: Purified ConE analyzed by native methods is predominantly monomeric with minor higher-order species; addition of ATP or DNA did not markedly shift oligomerization under tested conditions, and ATPase activity was not observed in a range of solution conditions. URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.00033-23 (June 2023). (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 7-9, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 12-13)

Functional inference and pathway placement
- Primary function: ConE/YddE is the VirB4-like ATPase of the ICEBs1 T4SS. Its primary role is to energize DNA transfer via ATP binding/hydrolysis, with essential catalytic residues in the P-loop/Walker and VirB4 motifs; loss-of-function substitutions in these motifs compromise conjugation without mislocalizing the protein. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Mechanistic partners and localization: ConE is a peripheral membrane protein recruited to and stabilized at the cell membrane—especially at poles—through interaction with the bitopic T4SS component ConB and dependencies on ConD and possibly ConC. ConE also interacts with the coupling protein ConQ, consistent with its role at the cytoplasmic face of the T4SS. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 7-9, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)
- Pathway context: ConE acts within the ICEBs1 T4SS apparatus that translocates DNA during conjugation; by extension, it also supports ICEBs1-mediated plasmid mobilization. This places ConE/YddE as a core energizing component of the conjugative DNA translocation pathway in Gram-positive B. subtilis. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)

Compliance with identification checks
- Gene symbol and organism: The 2023 Journal of Bacteriology work directly ties yddE (BSU04940) from Bacillus subtilis 168 to ConE of ICEBs1, satisfying symbol and organism verification. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 1-2, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7)
- Domains/family alignment: Reported Walker A/B and VirB4 motifs C–E match the AAA+/P-loop NTPase and VirB4/T4SS component domain expectations for P96642. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 2-4)

Limitations and open questions
- Biochemical activity remains to be robustly reconstituted in vitro; the 2023 study suggests that appropriate membrane context, partner proteins, or specific conditions may be required to observe ATP hydrolysis, as inferred from motif dependence and known VirB4 behaviors. (murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 4-7, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 9-11, murthy2023characterizationofcone pages 12-13)

Conclusion
Collectively, recent evidence demonstrates that B. subtilis yddE (ConE; P96642) is the ICEBs1 VirB4-like ATPase, essential for conjugation and plasmid mobilization, membrane/pole localized via ConB/ConD, and functionally dependent on conserved ATPase motifs. Interaction with ConB and ConQ and dependencies on other ICEBs1 components place ConE at the cytoplasmic face of the T4SS, where it likely powers DNA translocation. Open biochemical questions center on reconstituting ATPase activity in vitro under appropriate assembly or membrane conditions.
