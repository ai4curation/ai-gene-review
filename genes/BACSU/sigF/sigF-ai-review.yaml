description: >-
  SigF (also known as SpoIIAC) encodes the RNA polymerase sigma-F factor, a member of the sigma-70 family
  of alternative sigma factors that is specifically activated in the forespore compartment during Bacillus
  subtilis sporulation. SigF is the first compartment-specific transcription factor activated after asymmetric
  septation, initiating the early forespore transcriptional program. The protein contains conserved sigma-70
  regions (2, 3, and 4) including a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif that recognizes specific promoter
  sequences. SigF activity is tightly controlled by an elegant partner-switching mechanism involving the
  anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB (which binds and sequesters SigF) and the anti-anti-sigma factor SpoIIAA. Before
  septation, SpoIIAB keeps SigF inactive by direct binding and also phosphorylates SpoIIAA to prevent its
  antagonistic activity. Upon asymmetric septation, the membrane-associated phosphatase SpoIIE preferentially
  dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P in the forespore, allowing unphosphorylated SpoIIAA to bind SpoIIAB and release
  SigF for holoenzyme formation. This partner-switching mechanism ensures compartment-specific activation of
  SigF exclusively in the forespore despite the protein being present in both compartments. SigF directs
  transcription of early forespore genes including sigG (the late forespore sigma factor), csfB (an anti-sigma
  factor that reinforces cell-type specificity), and the forespore-specific promoter of rho (transcription
  termination factor). SigF also autoregulates the spoIIA operon from which it is expressed. The sequential
  activation of sigma factors (SigF in forespore, SigE in mother cell, followed by SigG and SigK) orchestrates
  the complex developmental program of sporulation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      Sigma factors bind to specific promoter sequences to position RNA polymerase for transcription initiation.
      SigF recognizes and binds to SigF-dependent promoter elements consisting of a -10 region (consensus similar
      to GGTAAAAATA) and a -35 region (GAATA) separated by an A/T-rich spacer. This has been demonstrated through
      mutational analysis of the forespore-specific rho promoter where mutations in the -35 GAATA element abolished
      forespore-specific transcription (Bidnenko et al. 2024). The helix-turn-helix motif in SigF (residues 221-240
      per UniProt) mediates DNA binding.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IBA annotation for transcription cis-regulatory region binding is well-supported by the molecular
      function of sigma factors. SigF contains a characterized helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and has
      demonstrated sequence-specific recognition of promoter elements. The 2024 work on the rho promoter
      provides direct evidence that SigF recognizes specific DNA sequences at its target promoters.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation suggests SigF has RNA polymerase catalytic activity, which is inaccurate. Sigma factors
      do not possess intrinsic polymerase activity - they are initiation factors that confer promoter specificity
      to the RNA polymerase core enzyme. The catalytic activity resides in the core RNAP subunits (alpha, beta,
      beta-prime), not in sigma factors.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Sigma factors including SigF do not catalyze RNA synthesis. They function as specificity factors that
      direct the RNA polymerase holoenzyme to specific promoters. The RNAP core enzyme provides the catalytic
      activity. This annotation conflates the function of the sigma subunit with the catalytic core. The correct
      annotation is sigma factor activity (GO:0016987), which is already present.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SigF regulates transcription by conferring promoter specificity to RNA polymerase, thereby activating
      a specific set of forespore genes during sporulation. SigF directs expression of numerous sporulation-specific
      genes including sigG, csfB, and the forespore promoter of rho. SigF also autoregulates the spoIIA operon.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      As an alternative sigma factor, SigF fundamentally regulates transcription by determining which promoters
      the RNAP holoenzyme can recognize. SigF-dependent transcription activates the early forespore program.
      This is a core function of sigma factors and is well-documented for SigF.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SigF is a well-characterized sigma factor of the sigma-70 family. It contains conserved sigma-70 regions
      (regions 2, 3, and 4) that mediate core RNAP binding and promoter recognition. Biochemical and genetic
      studies have definitively established SigF as a sigma factor that associates with RNAP core and directs
      transcription initiation at SigF-dependent promoters.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the primary molecular function of SigF. The sigma factor activity annotation accurately captures
      SigF's role in conferring promoter specificity to RNA polymerase. This is supported by extensive biochemical
      characterization, domain analysis, and genetic studies demonstrating SigF-dependent transcription.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SigF forms a complex with its anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, which inhibits SigF activity by direct binding.
      The SigF-SpoIIAB complex represents a sigma factor antagonist complex where SpoIIAB sequesters SigF and
      prevents holoenzyme formation. This complex is a central component of the partner-switching mechanism
      that controls SigF activation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The formation of a SigF-SpoIIAB inhibitory complex is well-documented and represents a key regulatory
      mechanism. SpoIIAB binds SigF through contacts at conserved sigma-70 regions 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1. This
      complex formation is essential for keeping SigF inactive in the pre-divisional cell and in the mother
      cell compartment after septation.

  review:

      SigF binds DNA as part of the RNAP holoenzyme to recognize promoter sequences. SigF contains a characterized

      SigF-dependent promoters.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this IEA annotation is more general than the IBA annotation for transcription cis-regulatory region
      binding (GO:0000976), it is not incorrect. Sigma factors do bind DNA as part of the holoenzyme. The
      presence of a characterized HTH motif in SigF supports this annotation. This can be retained as a broader
      annotation alongside the more specific term.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This term is intended for sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate transcription
      by binding to cis-regulatory elements. While sigma factors do bind DNA and regulate transcription, they
      function mechanistically differently from classical transcription factors - sigma factors confer promoter
      recognition to the RNA polymerase core rather than acting as independent regulatory factors.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term GO:0003700 is designed for classical transcription factors that independently bind DNA regulatory
      elements. Sigma factors have a distinct mechanism - they are subunits of the RNAP holoenzyme that confer
      promoter specificity. The more appropriate and specific term is GO:0016987 (sigma factor activity), which
      is already annotated. This IEA annotation from InterPro mapping may be overly broad.

    summary: >-
      SigF is specifically involved in transcription initiation - sigma factors function at the initiation
      step to position RNA polymerase at promoters and enable formation of the open complex. After initiation,
      sigma factors are typically released from the elongating polymerase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This annotation is highly appropriate for SigF. Sigma factors function specifically at the transcription
      initiation step - they enable promoter recognition and open complex formation but are released during
      the transition to elongation. This term accurately captures the specific stage of transcription where
      sigma factors act.

      This annotation correctly captures that sigma factors regulate transcription specifically at the
      initiation step. SigF enables RNAP to recognize and initiate transcription from SigF-dependent
      promoters. This is a precise characterization of sigma factor function.
