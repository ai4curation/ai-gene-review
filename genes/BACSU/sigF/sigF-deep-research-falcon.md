4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sigF' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sigF** (gene ID: sigF, UniProt: P07860) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Bacillus subtilis sigF (spoIIAC) – σF, the forespore-specific sigma factor

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: sigF (spoIIAC) encodes σF, an alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor that launches the early forespore transcriptional program in Bacillus subtilis. Sequence analyses and functional genetics established spoIIAC as a bona fide sigma factor within the σ70 family; σF contains conserved σ70 regions (e.g., regions 2/3/4) that mediate core binding and promoter recognition (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 2-4).
- Core regulatory module and partner switching: σF is held inactive by the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, which binds σF and prevents holoenzyme formation; SpoIIAB also functions as a serine kinase that phosphorylates the anti–anti-sigma SpoIIAA. Dephosphorylated SpoIIAA binds SpoIIAB, liberating σF. The PP2C-like phosphatase SpoIIE dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P at the sporulation septum, triggering σF activation specifically in the forespore (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8). Classic biochemical and genetic analyses established SpoIIAB–σF binding and mapped SpoIIAB contact sites on σF to three conserved σ70 regions (2.1, 3.1, 4.1), reinforcing the σ70-family placement (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- Compartment and timing of activity: σF protein accumulates around ~1 h after sporulation onset and is activated specifically in the forespore compartment following asymmetric septation; σF-dependent transcription is prespore-restricted even though σF protein can be detected in both compartments, indicating that activation—not localization—controls compartment specificity (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8). Septation-dependent SpoIIE action at the septum underlies this compartmental switch (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- Genetic organization: sigF resides as the third cistron in the tricistronic spoIIA operon (spoIIAA–spoIIAB–spoIIAC/sigF), which couples synthesis of the anti–anti-, anti-, and sigma factor in one unit; σF also autoregulates the spoIIA operon via an upstream promoter (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- 2024: Compartment-specific σF control of transcription termination factor Rho. A JBC study demonstrated that rho expression is reprogrammed during sporulation through dual, compartment-specific mechanisms: read-through transcription from a distal SigH- and Spo0A~P-regulated promoter drives mother-cell expression, while a genuine SigF-dependent promoter in the rho 5′ UTR drives forespore expression. A SigF-like −10 (GGTAAAAATA) and GAATA −35 separated by an A/T-rich spacer were identified; mutation of the −35 GAATA element abolished the forespore GFP burst and reduced luciferase activity, phenocopying ΔsigF. ΔsigF significantly diminishes forespore-specific rho expression, whereas ΔsigE does not, showing forespore-specific σF control. These sporulation-specific promoters compensate for silencing of the vegetative SigA-dependent rho promoter, enabling “refueling” of Rho protein in both compartments; altering this pattern impacts spore morphology and revival efficiency (JBC, 2024-12; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107905) (bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 10-11, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 3-4, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 1-2).
- 2024: Integration with DNA repair and stress-associated mutagenesis. An MMBR review synthesized recent findings that several DNA repair and maintenance factors are expressed in a compartment-specific manner during sporulation, with σF directing forespore expression of certain functions (e.g., YwjD UV endonuclease). The review details lesion-specific processing cascades in sporulating cells and shows that many repair proteins (including σF-driven or forespore-enriched proteins) are packaged in spores and become active upon germination, linking σF-dependent transcription to spore quality and resilience (MMBR, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00158-23) (pedrazareyes2024bacillussubtilisstressassociated pages 18-20).
- Refined understanding of σF discrimination by CsfB (contextual modern mechanistic work): CsfB (Gin), a dual-specificity anti-sigma, reinforces cell-type specificity by binding σG and σE but discriminating against σF and σK via specific residues in conserved σ70 region 2.1/2.3, respectively (E39 in σF vs N45 in σG; N100 in σE vs E93 in σK). This prevents ectopic σG activity in pre-divisional cells and helps the σE→σK transition; spore formation efficiency changes and surface-layer composition differences illustrate phenotypic outcomes (PLOS Genetics, 2015-04; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005104) (serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 19-20, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 2-4, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 6-7).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Live-cell and compartment-specific reporters controlled by σF. The Prho-gfp and Prho-luc fusions constructed at the native rho locus provide real-time, compartment-resolved readouts of forespore σF activity in vivo; mutational analyses of the SigF-dependent −35 element serve both as validation and as practical tools for dissecting forespore transcription circuits (bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 12-13, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 1-2).
- Forespore DNA repair engineering and spore quality: The 2024 MMBR synthesis highlights σF-controlled expression of forespore DNA repair enzymes (e.g., YwjD endonuclease) that contribute to UV damage processing and spore fitness. These insights guide strategies to optimize spore robustness for industrial or probiotic applications by tuning σF-driven repair pathway expression during sporulation (pedrazareyes2024bacillussubtilisstressassociated pages 18-20).
- Regulatory circuit design principles: The σF/SpoIIAB/SpoIIAA/SpoIIE module exemplifies a partner-switching, phosphorylation-controlled, septation-gated signal transduction circuit. It inspires synthetic compartmentalized gene-expression designs and time-locked differentiation programs in Gram-positive bacteria where asymmetric division and σF-like modules exist (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7).

4) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews defining σF and its control: The Microbiological Reviews article by Haldenwang remains a cornerstone that cataloged B. subtilis sigma factors, mapped spoIIAC as σF, described σF autoregulation, and established the logic of anti-sigma and anti–anti-sigma control (Microbiol. Rev., 1995-03; https://doi.org/10.1128/mr.59.1.1-30.1995) (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18). The 1996–1999 primary literature from Losick, Errington and colleagues elucidated compartmental activation by SpoIIE at the septum and the prespore-restricted transcriptional output of σF (Genes Dev., 1999-05; https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.13.9.1156) (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- 2024 authoritative perspective: Bidnenko et al. conclude that compartment-specific rerouting of rho expression—SigH/Spo0A~P-dependent read-through in the mother cell and direct SigF-dependent forespore transcription—is essential for generating spores with normal morphology and revival kinetics, and that σF-dependent “refueling” of Rho during morphogenesis primarily determines outgrowth quality (JBC, 2024-12; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107905) (bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 10-11).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and primary studies
- Timing and compartment: σF protein often becomes detectable ~1 h after sporulation initiation; activity is confined to the prespore even when protein is present in both compartments (immunostaining and gpr-lacZ reporters) (Genes to Cells, 1996-10; https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2443.1996.750275.x) (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- Molecular contacts: SpoIIAB–σF binding interfaces map to σ70 conserved regions 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1 (Genes Dev., 1996-09; https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.10.18.2348) (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- Anti-sigma binding and kinase activity: SpoIIAB binds σF to inhibit transcription and has serine kinase activity that phosphorylates SpoIIAA, toggling σF release via partner switching (PNAS, 1993-03; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.90.6.2325) (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18).
- Septation-coupled activation: SpoIIE at the division septum dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P, enabling compartment-restricted σF activation (Genes Dev., 1999-05; https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.13.9.1156) (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8).
- σF-dependent forespore promoter architecture and function (2024): For rho, a SigF-like −10 (GGTAAAAATA) and GAATA −35 with a 14-bp A/T-rich spacer operate in forespores; mutating the −35 element (mF-35T/A or mF-35T/C) abolishes forespore GFP bursts and reduces luciferase signals, recapitulating ΔsigF effects; ΔsigE does not impair forespore rho expression (JBC, 2024-12; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107905) (bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6).
- σF-driven regulon link: σF drives initial transcription of sigG in the forespore, coordinating the early-to-late switch in forespore gene expression; CsfB-based discrimination (E39 in σF vs N45 in σG) helps prevent premature σG activity (PLOS Genet., 2015-04; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005104) (serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 2-4, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 19-20).
- DNA repair targets under forespore control (2024): σF-dependent YwjD endonuclease incises the 5´ side of CPDs, 6–4 PDs, and DWIs in sporulating cells; subsequent lesion-specific processing enzymes (e.g., YqjH/YqjW, YpcP) act in a compartment-aware manner; multiple repair proteins are expressed in sporulation and packaged into spores (MMBR, 2024-06; https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00158-23) (pedrazareyes2024bacillussubtilisstressassociated pages 18-20).

Mechanistic pathway and localization summary
σF is synthesized from the spoIIA operon alongside SpoIIAA and SpoIIAB. Before septation, SpoIIAB binds σF and, as a kinase, keeps SpoIIAA predominantly phosphorylated (SpoIIAA-P), maintaining σF inactive. Upon asymmetric septation, SpoIIE (at the septum) dephosphorylates SpoIIAA-P preferentially in the forespore, freeing SpoIIAA to bind SpoIIAB and release σF, thereby enabling σF–RNAP holoenzyme formation and forespore-restricted transcription. σF initiates early forespore programs, including sigG transcription and σF-dependent genes such as the forespore promoter of rho, while anti-sigma factor CsfB further enforces proper timing by discriminating among sporulation σ factors to prevent ectopic σG activation (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 2-4, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 19-20, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 10-11).

Verification against the user’s CRITICAL identity checks
- Gene/protein symbol and description: The literature consistently identifies spoIIAC (sigF) as the sporulation sigma factor σF of Bacillus subtilis, matching the UniProt description for P07860 (RNA polymerase sigma-F, sporulation sigma factor, Stage II sporulation protein AC) (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18).
- Organism: All cited studies investigate σF in Bacillus subtilis; no evidence was found for a different organism under this symbol within the collected evidence, and no contradictory usage was identified. Where explicitly stated, the work is in B. subtilis (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6).
- Family and domains: σF is a σ70-family sigma factor; contact mapping with its anti-sigma (SpoIIAB) involves conserved σ70 regions 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1, consistent with σ70 architecture (lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8). We found no conflicting literature assigning different domains to sigF.
- Ambiguity check: The search returned no evidence of a different gene/protein designated “sigF” in a way that would confound Bacillus subtilis σF within this context; thus, we proceeded with the Bacillus subtilis σF literature exclusively (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6).

Conclusions
σF (SigF/SpoIIAC) is the archetypal forespore-specific σ70-family sigma factor of Bacillus subtilis that initiates the early forespore transcriptional program after septation. Its activity is gated by a partner-switching module (SpoIIAB/SpoIIAA) under the control of the septal phosphatase SpoIIE, ensuring activation exclusively in the forespore. New 2024 work shows that σF directly establishes forespore transcription of the essential factor Rho from a dedicated σF promoter, while mother-cell rho expression is supplied by SigH/Spo0A~P-driven read-through, together sustaining spore morphogenesis and fitness. These developments, together with recent syntheses linking σF to forespore DNA repair and spore quality, refine the view of σF as both a fate determinant and a coordinator of forespore physiology with consequences for spore robustness and revival (haldenwang1995thesigmafactors pages 17-18, lewis1996compartmentalizeddistributionof pages 6-8, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 4-6, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 6-7, bidnenko2024complexsporulationspecificexpression pages 10-11, pedrazareyes2024bacillussubtilisstressassociated pages 18-20, serrano2015dualspecificityantisigmafactor pages 2-4).
