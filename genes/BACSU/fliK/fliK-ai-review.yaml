description: >-
  FliK is the flagellar hook-length control protein that acts as a molecular ruler and terminator
  to control the length of the flagellar hook during assembly. FliK is intermittently exported
  through the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) during hook assembly, and its C-terminal
  domain contacts the cytoplasmic domain of FlhB (FlhBC) to trigger the substrate-specificity
  switch from rod/hook-type substrates (e.g., FlgE) to filament-type substrates (e.g., FliC, FlgK,
  FlgL, FlgM). Loss of FliK causes a polyhook phenotype where hooks overgrow because the switch
  fails to occur. In B. subtilis, both FliK and the hook are approximately 25% longer than their
  Salmonella counterparts, indicating species-specific calibration of the length-control mechanism.
  FliK belongs to the FliK family characterized by an N-terminal export/assembly-interacting region,
  a flexible linker, and a C-terminal FlhB-binding domain.

        This cellular component annotation indicates FliK is located in the flagellar hook.
        FliK is an export substrate of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) and
        is intermittently secreted through the basal body during hook assembly. However, FliK
        is not a structural component of the hook itself - the hook is composed of FlgE subunits.
        FliK transiently passes through the hook structure during secretion to sense hook length,
        but its primary localization is cytoplasmic until it is exported. The annotation is
        misleading as it suggests FliK is a stable component of the hook structure.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        FliK is not a structural component of the flagellar hook - the hook is built from FlgE
        protein. FliK is a cytoplasmic protein that is intermittently exported through the fT3SS
        during hook assembly to control hook length. While FliK transiently passes through the
        hook region during secretion, it does not permanently reside there. A more accurate CC
        annotation would be cytoplasm or the flagellar secretion apparatus. The InterPro domain
        annotation (IPR001635) correctly identifies FliK as a hook-length control protein, but
        the mapping to the hook CC term is inappropriate.

      summary: >-
        This biological process annotation indicates FliK is involved in bacterial flagellum
        assembly. This is accurate - FliK is essential for proper flagellum assembly as it
        controls the length of the hook and triggers the substrate-specificity switch that
        enables filament assembly to proceed. Without FliK, hooks overgrow (polyhook phenotype)
        and the switch to filament-type export fails, preventing completion of functional
        flagella.

      reason: >-
        FliK is a core regulator of flagellum assembly. It controls hook length and triggers
        the critical switch from rod/hook substrate export to filament substrate export.
        Loss of FliK results in polyhook formation and failure to assemble functional flagella.
        This annotation accurately captures FliK's essential role in the flagellar assembly
        process.

        This IMP (Inferred from Mutant Phenotype) annotation indicates FliK is involved in
        bacterial flagellum assembly based on evidence from PMID:25313396 (Calvo & Kearns 2015).
        This paper demonstrates that FliK is part of the minimal subset of flagellar proteins
        required for FlgM secretion, placing FliK functionally in the export apparatus pathway.
        The paper explicitly describes FliK as "the substrate specificity switch regulator,"
        confirming its role in the assembly process through triggering the substrate switch.
      action: ACCEPT

        The IMP annotation is well-supported by the cited reference. PMID:25313396 demonstrates
        that FliK is required for FlgM secretion and explicitly names it as "the substrate
        specificity switch regulator FliK." This directly supports FliK's role in flagellum
        assembly - without FliK, the switch from hook to filament substrate export fails,
        preventing proper flagellum assembly.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This IMP annotation indicates FliK is involved in bacterial swarming motility based on
        PMID:25313396. While FliK is essential for functional flagella (through its role in
        hook length control and substrate switching), and functional flagella are required for
        swarming motility, this annotation may represent an indirect/downstream effect rather
        than a direct role in swarming. FliK's primary function is in flagellum assembly
        (hook length control), not in the motility process itself. The paper's focus is on
        FlgM secretion and flagellar assembly, not specifically on swarming motility assays.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        FliK is indirectly required for swarming motility because it is essential for proper
        flagellum assembly. Without FliK, hooks overgrow and flagella are non-functional,
        which would impair swarming. However, FliK does not directly participate in the
        motility mechanism itself - its core function is hook length control and triggering
        the substrate-specificity switch. This annotation captures a downstream phenotypic
        effect rather than FliK's primary molecular function. The assembly annotation
        (GO:0044780) more directly reflects FliK's biological role.

        This IMP annotation indicates FliK is involved in bacterial swarming motility based on

        that "FliK regulated hook length" and shows that mutants affecting hook assembly result
        in reduced motility. However, like the other swarming annotation, this represents an
        indirect effect - FliK's primary function is hook length control, and the motility
        defect is a downstream consequence of faulty flagellum assembly.

        While PMID:22730131 directly demonstrates FliK's role in B. subtilis flagellum biology,
        its core finding is that "FliK regulated hook length." The swarming motility defect in
        fliK mutants is an indirect consequence of improper hook assembly rather than a direct
        role in the swarming process. The annotation is not incorrect but reflects a downstream
        phenotype rather than FliK's primary molecular function. Retaining as non-core because
        the experimental evidence does support the connection, even if indirect.

core_functions:
  - description: >-
      FliK is essential for flagellum assembly through its dual role as a hook-length
      control protein and substrate-specificity switch regulator. FliK is intermittently
      exported through the fT3SS during hook assembly, and its C-terminal domain contacts
      FlhBC to trigger the switch from rod/hook to filament substrate export. Demonstrated
      in B. subtilis by Courtney et al. (2012) who showed "FliK regulated hook length" using
      fluorescent labeling, and by Calvo & Kearns (2015) who identified FliK as "the substrate
      specificity switch regulator" required for FlgM secretion.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the precise mechanism by which FliK senses hook length in B. subtilis?
      Is it through physical spanning of the export channel (molecular ruler model)
      or through export frequency and stochastic interactions (molecular clock model)?
      Understanding this in B. subtilis, where hook and FliK are approximately 25% longer
      than Salmonella, could illuminate species-specific calibration of the length control system.
  - question: >-
      Does FliK interact with FlgD (hook cap) in B. subtilis as it does in Salmonella?
      What is the role of FlhO and FlhP (B. subtilis-specific proteins) in the FliK-mediated
      switching mechanism? B. subtilis has unique hook assembly factors not found in Gram-negative
      bacteria, and understanding how these interact with the conserved FliK-FlhB switching
      mechanism could reveal Gram-positive-specific adaptations.

suggested_experiments:
  - description: >-
      Measure hook length distributions in B. subtilis fliK deletion, overexpression, and
      truncation mutants using cryo-EM or fluorescent labeling to quantify the length
      control function. Expected outcomes: fliK deletion should produce polyhooks (elongated
      hooks), overexpression should produce shorter hooks, and C-terminal truncations should
      disrupt switching without affecting secretion.
  - description: >-
      Co-immunoprecipitation or bacterial two-hybrid to test FliK-FlhB interaction in
      B. subtilis, and test whether FlhO/FlhP affect this interaction. Expected outcome:
      Should detect FliK-FlhB interaction dependent on the FliK C-terminal domain, and
      may reveal whether FlhO/FlhP modulate the switch timing.
