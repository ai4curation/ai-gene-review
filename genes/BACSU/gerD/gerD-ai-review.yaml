description: >-
  GerD is a trimeric coiled-coil scaffold lipoprotein that is essential for efficient nutrient
  receptor-dependent spore germination in Bacillus subtilis. The protein localizes to the spore
  inner membrane where it clusters germinant receptors (GRs) into a single focus termed the
  "germinosome". This clustering enables rapid, cooperative signal transduction from nutrient-bound
  GRs to downstream ion channels (including SpoVAF/FigP) that execute germination by mediating
  Ca-DPA release and core rehydration. GerD is required for GR-dependent germination triggered
  by L-alanine or AGFK (asparagine-glucose-fructose-potassium), but is dispensable for non-nutrient
  germination pathways (e.g., Ca-DPA, dodecylamine). The crystal structure (PDB 4O8W) reveals an
  approximately 80% alpha-helical core forming a stable trimeric rod-like coiled-coil that can
  assemble into higher-order oligomers in spores.

    review:
      summary: >-
        The annotation to plasma membrane is supported by direct experimental evidence from
        PMID:19332816, which used Western blots of proteins from spore fractions with anti-GerD
        antibody to show GerD is present in the inner membrane of spores. However, for bacterial
        spores, the more specific term GO:0140549 "spore inner membrane" would be more appropriate
        and informative, as this is the actual location where GerD functions to cluster germinant
        receptors. The spore inner membrane is a specialized membrane distinct from the vegetative
        cell plasma membrane.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        While GO:0005886 (plasma membrane) is not incorrect, bacterial spore biology uses more
        specific terminology. The spore inner membrane (GO:0140549) is the precise location where
        GerD functions as a lipoprotein anchor to cluster GR complexes into the germinosome. This
        more specific term better captures the specialized nature of this membrane in dormant spores
        and is directly supported by the experimental evidence in PMID:19332816.

    review:
      summary: >-
        This annotation is supported by experimental evidence from PMID:19332816 showing GerD
        presence in spore integuments (coat, cortex and germ cell wall layers). The authors
        specifically note that GerD in outer layers is likely located in the germ cell wall,
        as it was detected in coat-defective spores and in the cell wall fraction of outgrowing
        cells. However, the functional significance of this localization is uncertain - the
        inner membrane association is considered more relevant for GerD's role in interacting
        with germinant receptors.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: >-
        The spore wall localization is experimentally supported but represents a secondary
        localization. The authors state "Which of the multiple locations of GerD is important
        for its function is not known, but the inner membrane association would be appropriate
        for any interaction with germinant receptor proteins." The core functional localization
        of GerD is at the spore inner membrane where it scaffolds GR complexes into the
        germinosome.

    review:
      summary: >-
        GerD is essential for efficient spore germination via nutrient receptors. The loss of
        GerD results in severely reduced germination rates in response to L-alanine and AGFK
        germinants (10-20-fold decrease). This biological process annotation is strongly
        supported by multiple publications demonstrating GerD's role in spore germination.

      reason: >-
        This is a core biological process annotation that should exist for GerD. The evidence

        germination in l-alanine and for germination via alternative germinant combinations.
        Additional structural-functional studies (Li et al. 2014, PMID:24530795) confirm GerD's
        essential role in nutrient-triggered germination.

      summary: >-
        GerD functions as a scaffold that clusters germinant receptors (GRs) into a single
        focus termed the "germinosome" at the spore inner membrane. GerD-GFP alone forms a
        single focus, demonstrating its scaffolding role in organizing GRs. Loss of GerD
        disrupts GR clustering and also abolishes SpoVAF/FigP ion channel foci formation
        (Gao et al. 2024, PMID:38242633).
      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        Receptor clustering is the primary molecular mechanism by which GerD enables rapid
        germination. Li et al. (2014, PMID:24530795) demonstrated through GerD-GFP localization
        studies that GerD forms a single focus and co-localizes with GR subunits. The 2024 study
        by Gao et al. (PMID:38242633) further showed that SpoVAF-GFP foci are lost in gerD null
        spores, indicating GerD is required for proper organization of downstream germination
        machinery.

        GerD functions as a protein-protein adaptor that serves as a platform for receptor
        (germinant receptor) clustering. The trimeric coiled-coil structure enables GerD to

        is defined as "a protein-protein adaptor that acts as a platform for receptor clustering,
        often serving to amplify the sensitivity of a signaling response." This matches GerD's
        characterized role in organizing GR complexes into the germinosome to enable efficient
        germination signaling. The crystal structure (PDB 4O8W) reveals the trimeric coiled-coil
        architecture that underlies this scaffolding function.

    review:
      summary: >-
        GerD positively regulates spore germination - its deletion causes 10-20-fold reduction
        in germination rates while overexpression (2x) slightly increases germination rate.
        This demonstrates GerD is a positive regulator of the germination process.
      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        The mutant phenotype evidence clearly shows GerD functions as a positive regulator of
        spore germination. Loss of gerD dramatically slows GR-dependent germination while
        leaving non-nutrient germination pathways largely unaffected. This regulatory role
        is mechanistically explained by GerD's function in clustering GRs to enable cooperative
        signaling.
