description: DivIVA is a conserved membrane-associated scaffold protein in Gram-positive
  bacteria that functions as a polar landmark by sensing negative membrane curvature
  at cell poles and division septa. The protein forms oligomeric structures through
  its N-terminal membrane-binding domain (which inserts hydrophobic and positively
  charged residues into curved membranes) and C-terminal coiled-coil regions that
  mediate tetramerization and higher-order assembly. During vegetative growth, DivIVA
  localizes to both sides of the division septum and cell poles, where it recruits
  MinJ, which in turn positions MinCD to prevent aberrant FtsZ assembly at previous
  division sites, thereby ensuring proper septum site selection. During sporulation,
  DivIVA accumulates asymmetrically at the polar septum with forespore bias, associates
  with SpoIIE phosphatase to promote compartment-specific sigma-F activation, and
  interacts with Spo0J for chromosome anchoring at the cell pole. DivIVA also recruits
  ComN to cell poles, facilitating polar localization of comE mRNA during competence
  development. Loss of DivIVA results in misplacement of division septa leading to
  minicell formation, while overexpression is lethal.

    label: peptidoglycan-based cell wall biogenesis
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: DivIVA is primarily a scaffold protein involved in spatial organization
      of cell division rather than directly participating in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
      While DivIVA localizes to sites of cell wall synthesis (septa and poles), its
      role is to position other proteins (MinCD via MinJ) that regulate where division
      occurs, not to directly contribute to peptidoglycan synthesis. In Corynebacterium
      glutamicum, DivIVA is required for polar peptidoglycan synthesis, but B. subtilis
      DivIVA localizes to septum rather than directing polar growth when expressed
      in C. glutamicum (PMID:18296522). This IBA annotation likely reflects functional
      conservation across Gram-positive bacteria where some DivIVA homologs do directly
      regulate cell wall synthesis, but in B. subtilis the connection is more indirect.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: DivIVA in B. subtilis functions as a spatial organizer for septum site
      selection through the MinCD system, not as a direct participant in peptidoglycan
      biosynthesis. The protein's role is to sense membrane curvature and recruit
      MinJ/MinCD to prevent inappropriate FtsZ assembly. While this ultimately affects
      where peptidoglycan synthesis occurs during division, DivIVA itself does not
      catalyze or directly regulate peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes. This term is
      too broad and misrepresents the mechanistic role of B. subtilis DivIVA.

    label: division septum assembly
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: DivIVA plays a critical role in regulating where division septa form
      by recruiting the MinJ/MinCD system to previous division sites and cell poles,
      thereby preventing inappropriate FtsZ assembly. This represents a core function
      of DivIVA in vegetative B. subtilis cells. Loss of DivIVA results in misplacement
      of septa and minicell formation. However, the term "division septum assembly"
      may be slightly broader than DivIVA's actual role, which is more specifically
      in septum site selection rather than the assembly process itself.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: DivIVA does not directly assemble the division septum but rather controls
      where septum assembly can occur by positioning the MinCD inhibitor system. The
      more precise term would be GO:0000918 (division septum site selection), which
      accurately captures DivIVA's role in marking sites where the septum can or cannot
      form by recruiting MinJ and MinCD.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: DivIVA is annotated to cytoplasm based on UniProt subcellular location
      mapping. However, DivIVA is specifically a membrane-associated protein that
      localizes to regions of negative membrane curvature at cell poles and division
      septa. The protein's N-terminal domain binds directly to the membrane through
      hydrophobic and positively charged residues. While technically in the cytoplasm,
      this term is too general and fails to capture DivIVA's specific localization
      to cell poles and division sites.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'The cytoplasm annotation is technically correct but too general. DivIVA
      specifically localizes to negatively curved membrane regions at cell poles and
      division septa. More specific CC terms would better capture DivIVA''s localization

    label: sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: DivIVA plays an important role during B. subtilis sporulation, where
      it accumulates asymmetrically at the polar septum with forespore bias and associates
      with SpoIIE phosphatase to contribute to compartment-specific sigma-F activation.
      DivIVA also interacts with Spo0J for chromosome anchoring at the cell pole during
      sporulation. Mutation of DivIVA causes sporulation defects. However, DivIVA
      is not a sporulation- specific protein - it functions during both vegetative
      growth and sporulation.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While DivIVA plays an important role in sporulation by positioning SpoIIE
      and anchoring chromosomes, sporulation is not its core function. DivIVA functions
      primarily as a polar landmark protein that senses membrane curvature, and its
      sporulation role is a specialized application of this general function. The
      annotation should be retained but marked as non-core.

  review:
    summary: DivIVA is essential for proper cell division in B. subtilis, where it
      controls the spatial placement of division septa by recruiting MinJ/MinCD to
      cell poles and previous division sites. Loss of DivIVA leads to aberrant septum
      placement and minicell formation. This annotation accurately captures DivIVA's
      involvement in cell division, though a more specific term like GO:0000918 (division
      septum site selection) would better describe its precise role.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Cell division is a core function of DivIVA. The protein is essential for
      proper spatial control of cell division through the Min system. While GO:0000918
      would be more specific, GO:0051301 is an appropriate parent term that accurately
      reflects DivIVA's biological role. This broad annotation should be retained
      alongside more specific annotations.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on the interaction between DivIVA and ComN demonstrated
      by yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments in PMID:22582279. DivIVA directly
      binds ComN and is required for its polar localization. However, GO:0005515 (protein
      binding) is too generic and uninformative - a more specific term describing
      the scaffold or adapter function would be preferable.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While DivIVA does bind ComN, the generic term "protein binding" fails
      to capture the biological significance of this interaction. DivIVA functions
      as a scaffold protein that recruits multiple partners to cell poles. GO:0097110
      (scaffold protein binding) would be more appropriate, or the annotation could
      be modified to reflect DivIVA's role as a scaffold that recruits other proteins.

      glutamicum demonstrates DivIVA self-interaction, and this property is conserved
      in B. subtilis DivIVA as shown by crystal structure studies.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Identical protein binding accurately describes DivIVA's homo-oligomerization,
      which is essential for its function as a membrane curvature-sensing scaffold.
      The protein forms tetramers and higher-order oligomers through its C-terminal

    summary: This annotation is strongly supported by the crystal structure of DivIVA
      reported in PMID:20502438, which definitively demonstrates that DivIVA forms
      homo-oligomers through its coiled-coil domains. The N-terminal domain forms
      parallel coiled-coils and the C-terminal domain forms curved tetramers.
    action: ACCEPT

      The protein forms dimers through its N-terminal domain and tetramers through
      its C-terminal coiled-coil region. This is a core molecular function essential

      that underlies all its biological roles. The crystal structure (PMID:20502438)
      provides structural evidence for how DivIVA binds to curved membranes, and multiple
