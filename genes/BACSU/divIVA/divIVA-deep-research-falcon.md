## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P71021
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Septum site-determining protein DivIVA; AltName: Full=Cell division initiation protein DivIVA; AltName: Full=Minicell-associated protein DivIVA;
- **Gene Information:** Name=divIVA; Synonyms=ylmJ; OrderedLocusNames=BSU15420;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the DivIVA family. .
- **Key Domains:** DivIVA_domain. (IPR019933); DivIVA_fam. (IPR007793); DivIVA (PF05103)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "divIVA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'divIVA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **divIVA** (gene ID: divIVA, UniProt: P71021) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: Bacillus subtilis DivIVA (divIVA; UniProt P71021)

Verification of target identity and family context
- Identity and organism: DivIVA in Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) is a polar/septal scaffold central to cell division topology and sporulation-associated polarity. Its study is well established in B. subtilis, matching the target gene symbol and organism specified (divIVA, BACSU). Recent overviews of B. subtilis cell biology explicitly place DivIVA as a polar scaffold in this organism (Stülke et al., 2023, Journal of Bacteriology; published May 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).
- Family and domains: DivIVA proteins are conserved coiled-coil scaffolds that oligomerize and target curved membranes in Gram-positive bacteria, consistent with the DivIVA family/domain annotations. Structural and comparative work highlights N-terminal membrane-binding elements and C-terminal coiled-coils mediating higher-order assemblies, aligning with DivIVA family/domain descriptions (Lubbers et al., 2025, bioRxiv; Chaudhary et al., 2023, Microbiology Spectrum) (lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 10-12, lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 1-3, chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary function (vegetative growth): DivIVA is a membrane-associated scaffold that localizes to both sides of the division septum and to cell poles during vegetative growth. Together with MinJ, DivIVA recruits MinCD to previously used division sites, preventing aberrant reassembly of the divisome and ensuring correct spatial control of cytokinesis (Stülke et al., 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).
- Primary function (sporulation): During sporulation, DivIVA accumulates at the polar septum and becomes biased toward the forespore side as the septum matures. DivIVA associates with the phosphatase SpoIIE, contributing to forespore-specific activation of σF and thus compartment-specific gene expression that initiates the sporulation program (Chareyre et al., 2023, bioRxiv, Aug 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 15-18, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).
- Localization principle (curvature/poles/septa): DivIVA preferentially targets regions of high negative membrane curvature, including poles and septal membranes, a property underlying its pole/septum localization and scaffolding functions (Chareyre et al., 2023; Chaudhary et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18).
- Structural features: DivIVA is a coiled-coil oligomer. Evidence indicates an N-terminal membrane-binding/dimerization region and a C-terminal coiled-coil mediating tetramers/higher-order oligomers, which together support lattice-like assemblies at curved membranes (Chaudhary et al., 2023; Lubbers et al., 2025) (chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18, lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 10-12, lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 1-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Sporulation-specific asymmetric localization and divisome coupling: Chareyre et al. (2023) showed that in B. subtilis the polar septum is thinner than vegetative septa and that DivIVA and SpoIIE exhibit forespore-biased accumulation at the polar septum, while FtsA/FtsZ show mother-cell bias. A DivIVA point mutant (R94N) diminished forespore-biased localization (DivIVAR94N-GFP ~46% forespore bias vs WT ~72%), reduced forespore-specific σF activation (~40% of cells), and impaired sporulation efficiency (~0.18× WT). Mild overproduction of both FtsA and FtsZ rescued DivIVA/SpoIIE asymmetry and septal thickness, supporting a reciprocal coupling between SpoIIE/DivIVA and the cytokinetic machinery (dual-color 3D-SIM and TEM) (bioRxiv preprint, Aug 2023; provides quantitative updates on localization dynamics) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 15-18).
- Broad context of DivIVA-family regulation and phosphorylation: While centered on D. radiodurans, Chaudhary et al. (2023) comprehensively compile foundational B. subtilis DivIVA literature (polar targeting, crystal-structure insights for membrane binding, Min system regulation), underscoring conserved principles of DivIVA curvature sensing and oligomerization. This 2023 review-style synthesis anchors DivIVA’s structure–function relationships relevant to B. subtilis (Microbiology Spectrum, Apr 2023) (chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18).
- Model organism perspective in 2023: Stülke et al. (2023) summarize B. subtilis cell biology, explicitly noting DivIVA’s role as a polar scaffold that partners with MinJ to recruit MinCD and prevent reuse of prior division sites, situating DivIVA in current B. subtilis cell-cycle frameworks (Journal of Bacteriology, May 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Cell biology imaging and localization reporters: DivIVA has been repeatedly used as a localization marker via fluorescent protein fusions (e.g., DivIVA–GFP/mCherry) to visualize poles and septa in B. subtilis. This practical implementation enables tracking of polar/septal dynamics and is widely deployed in studies of division and sporulation (Stülke et al., 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).
- Synthetic biology potential: While our gathered sources do not document engineered DivIVA-based “polarity tags” beyond microscopy reporters, the robust polar/septal localization of DivIVA fusions in B. subtilis suggests its utility as a targeting module for engineering spatially controlled processes at poles or septa. Direct engineered applications were not explicitly described in the retrieved 2023–2024 sources (Stülke et al., 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative organismal review: Stülke et al. (2023) describe DivIVA as a principal polar scaffold in B. subtilis that, with MinJ, positions MinCD to enforce topological specificity of division—an expert synthesis placing DivIVA at the core of spatial regulation of cytokinesis (Journal of Bacteriology, 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).
- Mechanistic synthesis and cross-system grounding: Chaudhary et al. (2023) discuss DivIVA family membrane targeting, structural determinants, and Min regulation, citing foundational B. subtilis work (e.g., Min activity regulation, structural determinants for membrane binding), reinforcing conserved mechanistic principles underpinning DivIVA’s role in B. subtilis (Microbiology Spectrum, 2023) (chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18).
- Sporulation-specific coupling to the divisome: Chareyre et al. (2023) provide a mechanistic model linking DivIVA/SpoIIE asymmetry to FtsA/FtsZ redeployment and septum architecture during sporulation, highlighting how divisome features drive compartment-specific gene activation via DivIVA-tethered SpoIIE (bioRxiv, 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 15-18, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Forespore-biased localization: DivIVA-GFP forespore bias at polar septa is ~72% in WT vs ~46% in DivIVAR94N mutant; SpoIIE asymmetry similarly reduced in the mutant and restored by FtsA+FtsZ overexpression (Chareyre et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).
- σF activation and sporulation efficiency: DivIVAR94N exhibits ~40% forespore-specific σF activation and ~0.18× WT sporulation efficiency; both improved substantially upon FtsA+FtsZ overproduction (Chareyre et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).
- Septum architecture: Polar septum thickness increased in DivIVAR94N (~36 nm) compared to WT (~20 nm), and was reduced toward normal (~10 nm) by FtsA+FtsZ overproduction (Chareyre et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).

Interaction partners and pathways (B. subtilis)
- MinJ/MinCD: DivIVA recruits MinJ, which positions MinCD at prior division sites to prevent FtsZ reassembly at old septa, enforcing spatial fidelity of new division events (Stülke et al., 2023) (stulke2023bacillussubtilisa pages 2-5).
- SpoIIE (sporulation): DivIVA associates with SpoIIE at the polar septum; their asymmetric distribution supports forespore-specific σF activation. Coupling to divisome components FtsA and FtsZ influences septal architecture and DivIVA/SpoIIE asymmetry (Chareyre et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 15-18, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 11-15).
- Other classic partners (RacA, Soj/ParA, ComN): Although these interactions are well known historically for B. subtilis sporulation polarity and chromosome anchoring, specific primary-source details were not captured within our gathered evidence set; thus, we refrain from citing them here to maintain strict source fidelity.

Structural biology and localization mechanism
- Coiled-coil scaffold and oligomerization: DivIVA comprises an N-terminal membrane-binding/dimer interface and C-terminal coiled-coils that assemble into higher-order oligomers, enabling scaffolding at curved membranes. Structural/crystallographic insights and modeling support this modular architecture (Chaudhary et al., 2023; Lubbers et al., 2025) (chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18, lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 10-12, lubbers2025definingtheminimal pages 1-3).
- Curvature sensing and pole/septum targeting: DivIVA’s affinity for negatively curved membranes underlies its accumulation at cell poles and septal regions, explaining its role in organizing polar/septal protein complexes (Chareyre et al., 2023; Chaudhary et al., 2023) (chareyre2023celldivisionmachinery pages 1-6, chaudhary2023divivaphosphorylationaffects pages 18-18).

Limitations and scope note
- While multiple authoritative studies describe interactions of DivIVA with proteins such as RacA, Soj/ParA, and ComN during sporulation and chromosome anchoring in B. subtilis, those specific primary references were not included among the retrieved texts in our evidence set for this report. Accordingly, we have limited claims to those directly supported by the gathered sources.
