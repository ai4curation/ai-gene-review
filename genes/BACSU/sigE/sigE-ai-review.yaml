description: SigE (also known as SpoIIGB) encodes the RNA polymerase sigma-E factor, a member of the sigma-70
  family of alternative sigma factors that is specifically activated in the mother cell compartment during
  Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SigE is synthesized as an inactive precursor (P31, 239 amino acids) and
  is proteolytically cleaved at the N-terminus by the membrane-associated protease SpoIIGA to yield the
  active sigma-29 factor (residues 30-239). This proteolytic activation mechanism differs from the partner-switching
  mechanism used to activate the forespore-specific sigma factor SigF. The protein contains conserved
  sigma-70 regions including a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (residues 206-225) that recognizes specific
  promoter sequences. As with all sigma factors, SigE functions as an initiation factor that promotes
  the attachment of RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and is then released during elongation.
  SigE directs transcription of mother cell-specific sporulation genes and is part of the crisscross signaling
  network between the forespore and mother cell compartments that orchestrates spore development. The
  sequential activation of compartment-specific sigma factors (SigF in forespore, SigE in mother cell,
  followed by SigG and SigK) coordinates the complex developmental program of sporulation.

    label: DNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: SigE binds DNA as part of the RNAP holoenzyme to recognize promoter sequences. SigE contains
      a characterized helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (residues 206-225 per UniProt) that mediates
      sequence-specific recognition of SigE-dependent promoters in the mother cell compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IEA annotation is appropriate for SigE. Sigma factors bind DNA as part of the holoenzyme
      to recognize and position RNA polymerase at specific promoters. UniProt documents an H-T-H DNA-binding
      motif in residues 206-225. While more specific terms exist (e.g., transcription cis-regulatory region
      binding), this general DNA binding annotation is not incorrect and can be retained.

    label: DNA-binding transcription factor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This term is intended for sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate
      transcription by binding to cis-regulatory elements. While sigma factors do bind DNA and regulate
      transcription, they function mechanistically differently from classical transcription factors. Sigma
      factors confer promoter recognition to the RNA polymerase core enzyme rather than acting as independent
      regulatory factors that modulate transcription of genes they are not directly transcribing.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term GO:0003700 is designed for classical transcription factors that independently bind
      DNA regulatory elements and activate or repress transcription. Sigma factors have a distinct mechanism
      - they are subunits of the RNAP holoenzyme that confer promoter specificity and enable transcription
      initiation. The more appropriate and specific term is GO:0016987 (sigma factor activity), which
      is already annotated. This IEA annotation from InterPro mapping conflates sigma factors with classical
      transcription factors.

  review:
    summary: SigE participates in DNA-templated transcription as the sigma subunit of the RNA polymerase
      holoenzyme. As a sigma factor, it enables transcription initiation at SigE-dependent promoters during
      sporulation, specifically in the mother cell compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This biological process annotation correctly captures SigE's involvement in transcription.
      As a sigma factor, SigE is directly involved in the transcription process by conferring promoter
      specificity to RNAP and enabling transcription initiation of mother cell-specific genes.

    label: DNA-templated transcription initiation
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: SigE is specifically involved in transcription initiation - sigma factors function at the
      initiation step to position RNA polymerase at promoters and enable formation of the open complex.
      After initiation, sigma factors are typically released from the elongating polymerase.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is highly appropriate for SigE. Sigma factors function specifically at the
      transcription initiation step - they enable promoter recognition and open complex formation but
      are released during the transition to elongation. UniProt explicitly states that sigma factors are
      "initiation factors" that are "then released" after promoting attachment to initiation sites. This
      term accurately captures the specific stage of transcription where sigma factors act.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: SigE regulates transcription by conferring promoter specificity to RNA polymerase, thereby
      activating a specific set of mother cell genes during sporulation. SigE directs expression of numerous
      sporulation-specific genes in the mother cell compartment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: As an alternative sigma factor, SigE fundamentally regulates transcription by determining
      which promoters the RNAP holoenzyme can recognize. SigE-dependent transcription activates the mother
      cell developmental program. This is a core function of sigma factors and is well-documented for
      SigE.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: SigE is a well-characterized sigma factor of the sigma-70 family. It contains conserved sigma-70
      regions (regions 2, 3, and 4) that mediate core RNAP binding and promoter recognition. UniProt explicitly
      classifies SigE as belonging to the sigma-70 factor family and describes its function as an initiation
      factor that promotes RNAP attachment to specific initiation sites.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary molecular function of SigE. The sigma factor activity annotation accurately
      captures SigE's role in conferring promoter specificity to RNA polymerase. This is supported by
      UniProt family classification, domain analysis showing conserved sigma-70 regions, and the functional
      description as an initiation factor.

    label: sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: SigE plays an essential role in sporulation. It is the mother cell-specific sigma factor
      activated during sporulation and initiates the mother cell transcriptional program. SigE activation
      follows SigF activation in the forespore, and together these compartment-specific sigma factors
      orchestrate the complex developmental program of spore formation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This biological process annotation appropriately captures SigE's essential role in sporulation.
      SigE is absolutely required for spore formation - it directs the mother cell developmental program
      that ultimately leads to engulfment of the forespore and completion of spore morphogenesis. UniProt
      specifically describes SigE as responsible for "the expression of sporulation specific genes."

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: SigE specifically regulates transcription at the initiation step. As a sigma factor, it enables
      recognition of specific promoters and formation of the initiation complex. This term is more specific
      than the general regulation of transcription term and accurately reflects sigma factor function
      at the initiation stage.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation correctly captures that sigma factors regulate transcription specifically
      at the initiation step. SigE enables RNAP to recognize and initiate transcription from SigE-dependent
      promoters in the mother cell. This is a precise characterization of sigma factor function.

- description: SigE is the primary mother cell-specific sigma factor that confers promoter recognition
    specificity to RNA polymerase, enabling transcription of mother cell genes during sporulation. As
    a member of the sigma-70 family, SigE binds to the RNAP core and directs the holoenzyme to SigE-dependent
    promoters characterized by specific -10 and -35 elements. SigE is activated by proteolytic cleavage
    of the P31 precursor by the membrane protease SpoIIGA, in contrast to the partner-switching mechanism
    used for SigF activation.
