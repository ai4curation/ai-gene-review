### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P06222
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=RNA polymerase sigma-E factor; AltName: Full=P31; AltName: Full=Sigma-29; AltName: Full=Stage II sporulation protein GB; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=sigE; Synonyms=spoIIGB; OrderedLocusNames=BSU15320;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the sigma-70 factor family. .
- **Key Domains:** Cro/C1-type_HTH. (IPR001387); RNA_pol_sigma-70_dom. (IPR014284); RNA_pol_sigma-E. (IPR014200); RNA_pol_sigma70. (IPR000943); RNA_pol_sigma70_r2. (IPR007627)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "sigE" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sigE' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sigE** (gene ID: sigE, UniProt: P06222) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: sigE (spoIIGB) in Bacillus subtilis (strain 168)

Mandatory verification of identity and context
- Gene/protein match: The target is Bacillus subtilis mother-cell sporulation sigma factor sigma-E (SigE), encoded by sigE (also referred to as spoIIGB) and produced as an inactive pro-sigmaE that is proteolytically activated; this aligns with UniProt P06222 and the names provided (sigma-E/sigma-29/P31). Foundational sources explicitly describe sigma-E as the mother-cell-specific sporulation sigma factor of B. subtilis (strain 168 laboratory reference) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, phillips2002bacillussubtilissporulation pages 7-9).
- Organism: All evidence cited below (unless otherwise noted as comparative) pertains to Bacillus subtilis, the model spore-former (strain 168 lineage). Reviews and primary work here specifically center on B. subtilis (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, phillips2002bacillussubtilissporulation pages 7-9).
- Family/domains: SigE is an alternative sigma factor in the sigma-70 family with canonical regions used for promoter recognition (e.g., σ2 for −10 element; σ4 HTH for −35). Recent structural analysis of B. subtilis sigma factors, including SigE, and reviews on sporulation sigma-factor regulation corroborate this family placement and domain organization (fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 7-9).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition and primary function: SigE is the mother-cell-specific RNA polymerase sigma factor that controls a large transcriptional program during early sporulation after asymmetric septation. It is produced as pro-sigmaE before septation and activated post-translationally, then directs expression of genes required for engulfment, envelope remodeling, and initiation of cortex and coat assembly in the mother cell (Journal of Molecular Biology, 17 April 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5; Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, March 2002, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-002-8431-9) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3, phillips2002bacillussubtilissporulation pages 7-9).
- Mechanism of sigma-factor action: As a σ70-family factor, SigE provides promoter specificity to RNAP. Region 2 mediates recognition of the −10 element and melting; region 4 contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) for −35 recognition. Structural analyses and reviews of B. subtilis sigma factors reinforce these mechanistic features (Microorganisms, 20 April 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11041077; Current Opinion in Microbiology, April 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 7-9, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).
- Spatial compartment: SigE acts exclusively in the mother cell, the larger compartment generated by polar division (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3).

2) Activation pathway and biochemical signaling context
- Activation mechanism and timing: Pro-sigmaE is synthesized prior to asymmetric septation but remains inactive until after polar septation. Activation requires intercellular signaling from the forespore: σF becomes active in the forespore and induces spoIIR; SpoIIR is secreted into the septal intermembrane space, where it activates the intramembrane protease SpoIIGA to cleave pro-sigmaE, releasing active SigE in the mother cell. This activation aligns temporally with the onset of engulfment and is essential for mother-cell-specific gene expression (CMLS, March 2002, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-002-8431-9; Current Opinion in Microbiology, April 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (phillips2002bacillussubtilissporulation pages 7-9, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).
- Consequences of loss-of-function: In sigE mutants, development arrests after asymmetric septation; cells commonly attempt a second polar septation (disporic phenotype), engulfment fails, and downstream sigma factors (σG in the forespore; σK in the mother cell) fail to activate appropriately (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3).

3) Regulon, promoter recognition, and downstream processes
- Regulon size and composition: Genome-wide profiling identified approximately 253 SigE-controlled genes organized in ~157 operons, with 181 genes (~121 operons) newly assigned by Eichenberger et al. The SigE regulon comprises modules for engulfment/septal peptidoglycan remodeling, cortex biosynthesis, and coat assembly; localization of several SigE-dependent proteins shows enrichment at the mother-cell membrane around the forespore and in distinct spore coat layers (J Mol Biol, 17 April 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).
- Representative functional targets: Engulfment machinery genes include spoIID and spoIIM (with spoIIP cooperating in septal peptidoglycan removal), while cortex synthesis includes spoVE and spoVD; coat morphogenesis includes cot genes such as cotE; SigE also induces the DNA-binding regulator SpoIIID that remodels the mother-cell transcriptional program (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3).
- Promoter features and σ70 family: Reviews and structural work support that SigE recognizes promoter elements consistent with σ70-family architecture, with region 2 and region 4 engaging −10/−35 elements; structural fragments of SigE map the σ2 domain, including residues implicated in −10 DNA binding (Microorganisms, 20 April 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11041077; Current Opinion in Microbiology, April 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 7-9, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).

4) Cross-regulation and pathway transitions
- SpoIIID and GerE: SigE induces SpoIIID, which subsequently modulates the transition to late mother-cell gene expression and supports activation of σK. This cascade establishes temporal control of coat and maturation genes and helps repress subsets of early genes as development proceeds (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3).
- Anti-sigma factor CsfB: The anti-sigma factor CsfB (Gin) influences the timing and cell-type specificity by binding to sporulation sigma factors, including SigE and SigG, thereby reinforcing proper compartmentalization and transitions between early/late programs. Structural considerations and review discussions link CsfB interactions to conserved residues in sigma domain 2 that mediate discrimination (Microorganisms, 20 April 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11041077; Current Opinion in Microbiology, April 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).

5) Localization and cellular context of function
- Cellular site of action: SigE functions in the mother-cell cytoplasm and at the membrane adjacent to the forespore; many SigE-regulated proteins localize to the engulfing membranes or to developing spore layers, matching their roles in envelope remodeling and coat assembly (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).

6) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Structural insights into SigE: A 2023 structural analysis reported an X-ray crystal structure covering SigE residues approximately 17–133, capturing the σ2 core features (including putative −10 recognition residues), and noted agreement with AlphaFold2 full-length models for core regions while highlighting flexibility/overprediction in loops. The study also references NMR data for σ2 and notes CsfB as an anti-sigma interacting partner. AlphaFold models for all B. subtilis sigma factors, including SigE, are publicly available and support mapping of functional motifs and interaction surfaces (Microorganisms, 20 April 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11041077) (collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 9-11, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 7-9, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 1-2).
- Ongoing expansion of engulfment gene sets: While comprehensive high-throughput additions predate 2023, recent perspectives and cumulative studies sustain the view that the SigE-controlled engulfment program integrates multiple PG hydrolases, synthesis enzymes, and envelope complex components, reinforcing the centrality of SigE to efficient engulfment (review synthesis and genetic context) (fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Reporter systems and synthetic circuits: SigE-dependent promoters serve as mother-cell/timing-specific reporters during sporulation, enabling compartment-resolved fluorescent readouts and controlled expression in the mother cell. Eichenberger et al. used GFP fusions to visualize localization of SigE-dependent proteins; such promoters are used to engineer mother-cell-specific expression (J Mol Biol, 17 April 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).
- Engineering sporulation traits: Knowledge of SigE regulon targets in cortex and coat biosynthesis informs manipulation of spore surface properties for industrial or biosurveillance applications; structural information (AlphaFold + fragment crystal structures) assists rational promoter/sigma-interface choices for transcriptional control in synthetic biology (Microorganisms, 20 April 2023, https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11041077; J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 1-2, collins2023structuralanalysisof pages 9-11, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).

8) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Authoritative consensus: Foundational genetic and genome-wide transcriptional profiling studies (Losick/Eichenberger lineage) established SigE as the mother-cell master regulator of early sporulation, with a large regulon central to engulfment and the initiation of coat/cortex synthesis. Expert reviews highlight conserved regulatory logic across spore-formers, with organism-specific rewiring of regulon content and signaling details (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5; Current Biology, 20 September 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.031; Current Opinion in Microbiology, April 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3, hoon2010hierarchicalevolutionof pages 10-11, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).

9) Relevant statistics and data from recent and classic studies
- Regulon scope: ~253 genes in ~157 operons under SigE control; 181 genes in ~121 operons newly assigned in the profiling work (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 1-2, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3).
- Localization trends: Majority of characterized SigE-dependent proteins localize to the membrane surrounding the developing spore or spore coat layers, matching functions in envelope remodeling and morphogenesis (J Mol Biol, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00205-5) (eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).
- Activation sequence: σF activity precedes and is required to trigger σE activation via SpoIIR→SpoIIGA; pro-sigmaE is made before septation but processed after asymmetric septation (CMLS, 2002, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-002-8431-9; Curr Opin Microbiol, 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2015.01.006) (phillips2002bacillussubtilissporulation pages 7-9, fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3).

10) Evolutionary and comparative context
- Conservation of regulatory logic: The sequential cascade of compartment-specific sporulation sigma factors and associated signaling is strongly conserved among Firmicutes, though regulon content can differ (Current Biology, 20 September 2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.031) (hoon2010hierarchicalevolutionof pages 10-11).

Notes on scope and limitations
- We prioritized peer-reviewed, authoritative sources for core functional annotation and supplemented with a 2023 structural study offering new SigE structural details. Some very recent genetic additions to engulfment pathways are best captured in cumulative reviews and high-throughput screens; when specific 2022–2024 primary discoveries were not available in accessible context, we refrained from over-claiming and focused on validated paradigms (fimlaid2015diversemechanismsregulate pages 1-3, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 2-3, eichenberger2003thesigmaeregulon pages 3-4).
