description: >-
  Stage V sporulation protein AD (SpoVAD) is an essential subunit of the SpoVA Ca-DPA (calcium-dipicolinic acid)
  transport machinery in Bacillus subtilis spores. Together with SpoVAC and SpoVAEb, SpoVAD forms the minimal
  transport complex required for Ca-DPA flux across the spore inner membrane. SpoVAD functions as a cytoplasmic
  "plug-like" regulator of the SpoVA channel, controlling Ca-DPA uptake during sporulation and its release during
  germination. The protein localizes to the spore inner membrane and is present at levels >50-fold higher than
  nutrient germinant receptors. Despite possessing a thiolase-like fold, SpoVAD has no enzymatic activity -
  the fold is repurposed for its structural role in the transport complex.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This IEA annotation is based on InterPro domain mapping (IPR016039 Thiolase-like fold). While SpoVAD does
      possess a thiolase-like fold as confirmed by X-ray crystallography (PDB:3LM6), it has NO enzymatic activity.
      The deep research literature is unambiguous: SpoVAD functions as a structural "plug" regulating the SpoVA
      Ca-DPA transport channel, not as an enzyme. Zhang et al. 2025 explicitly describe SpoVAD as possessing a
      thiolase-like fold but acting as a cytoplasmic plug controlling the SpoVA channel.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      SpoVAD is NOT an acyltransferase. The thiolase-like fold has been evolutionarily repurposed for a structural
      role in the Ca-DPA transport complex. Recent literature (Zhang et al. 2025 J Bacteriol, Gao et al. 2024
      Genes & Dev, Eichenberger 2024) consistently describe SpoVAD as a channel regulator, not an enzyme.
      The TCDB database classifies SpoVAD under the dipicolinic acid transporter family (9.A.11.1.1), not as an
      enzyme. This annotation represents a classic case of structural fold similarity being incorrectly used to
      infer enzymatic function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keyword mapping. SpoVAD is indeed essential for
      sporulation, specifically for Ca-DPA transport into the forespore during stage V of sporulation.
      Genetic analyses confirm that loss of spoVAD impairs Ca-DPA import during sporulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is valid. SpoVAD is a Stage V sporulation protein that is required for normal Ca-DPA
      uptake during sporulation. The deep research confirms that "SpoVAC, SpoVAEb, and SpoVAD are required
      for Ca-DPA transport" and that "Disruptions in any of these subunits impair Ca-DPA export during
      germination and/or import during sporulation, yielding severe germination defects." The UniProt
      keyword "Sporulation" is appropriate for this protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The original PMID:16077113 (Vepachedu & Setlow 2005) showed that SpoVAD localizes to the inner membrane
      of spores. The abstract states "SpoVAD is an integral inner membrane protein." However, "plasma membrane"
      is not the correct term for the spore inner membrane. In bacterial spores, the inner membrane is a
      specialized structure distinct from the vegetative cell plasma membrane. GO:0140549 (spore inner membrane)
      is the appropriate term, defined as "The membrane surrounding the spore core (endospore core) that
      separates it from its external environment."
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The localization to inner membrane is experimentally supported by PMID:16077113, but the term should
      be corrected from "plasma membrane" (GO:0005886) to "spore inner membrane" (GO:0140549). The paper
      title explicitly states "Localization of SpoVAD to the inner membrane of spores" and the abstract
      confirms "SpoVAD is an integral inner membrane protein." This is the spore inner membrane, not the
      vegetative cell plasma membrane. All recent reviews (Zhang et al. 2025, Gao et al. 2024) consistently
      describe SpoVA proteins as localized to the spore inner membrane.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation appears to be incorrect. The original publication PMID:16077113 explicitly identifies
      SpoVAD as an "integral inner membrane protein" - it localizes to the spore INNER MEMBRANE, not the
      spore wall. The spore wall is an external structure distinct from the inner membrane. The paper title
      is "Localization of SpoVAD to the inner membrane of spores of Bacillus subtilis" and the abstract
      confirms "SpoVAD is an integral inner membrane protein."
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is unsupported by the cited reference. PMID:16077113 clearly demonstrates localization
      to the spore inner membrane, NOT the spore wall. The spore wall is an external structure (coat/cortex)
      that is topologically and functionally distinct from the inner membrane where SpoVAD actually resides.
      All functional studies describe SpoVAD as part of an inner membrane transport complex. This annotation
      should be removed as it contradicts the primary literature evidence.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoVAD is essential for spore germination as part of the Ca-DPA release machinery. Genetic
      analyses show that loss of spoVAD blocks or severely impairs Ca-DPA export and consequently
      germination. GO:0009847 is defined as "The physiological and developmental changes that occur
      in a spore following release from dormancy up to the earliest signs of growth."
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      SpoVAD is required for Ca-DPA release during germination. The deep research states that
      spoVAD loss blocks or severely impairs Ca-DPA export and germination. This biological process
      annotation accurately captures SpoVAD's role in the germination pathway, downstream of
      GerA ion channels and SpoVAF/FigP amplification.

  - question: >-
      Does SpoVAD directly bind Ca-DPA or does it regulate channel gating allosterically? This would
      clarify whether SpoVAD should have a substrate binding annotation in addition to channel
      regulator activity.
