description: >-
  MinD is a septum site-determining protein and ParA-family Walker-type ATPase
  essential for correct placement of the bacterial cell division site. MinD acts
  in concert with MinC to form an inhibitory complex that blocks polar Z ring
  formation, preventing aberrant division at cell poles. The ATP-bound form of
  MinD dimerizes and recruits MinC to the membrane, where MinC directly inhibits
  FtsZ polymerization. Unlike E. coli, B. subtilis lacks MinE and instead uses
  MinJ as the topological determinant that bridges MinD/MinC to DivIVA, which
  senses negative membrane curvature at poles and septa. MinD's ATPase cycle
  controls membrane residence time and drives dynamic polar/septal enrichment
  patterns that prevent polar septum formation and promote divisome disassembly
  after cytokinesis. Loss of MinD leads to minicell formation due to aberrant
  polar division.

  review:
    summary: >-
      MinD is a ParA-family Walker-type ATPase with a well-characterized ATP
      binding site at residues 11-18 (P-loop motif). ATP binding is essential for
      MinD function and drives dimerization, which is required for MinC recruitment
      and membrane association. This is a core molecular function supported by
      extensive phylogenetic and biochemical evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      ATP binding is a core molecular function of MinD. The protein contains a
      characteristic P-loop NTPase domain (InterPro: IPR027417) with an ATP binding
      site at residues 11-18 documented in UniProt. The IBA annotation is
      well-supported by phylogenetic inference and aligns with the conserved function
      across MinD family proteins. Biochemical studies confirm ATP binding is
      essential for MinD dimerization and function.

      ATP hydrolysis is a core enzymatic function of MinD essential for its role in

      B. subtilis MinD ATPase is activated by membrane binding alone. The ATPase cycle
      drives the dynamic membrane association/dissociation that creates the spatial

      MinD is found in the cytosol as part of its dynamic cycling between cytoplasm
      and membrane. The ATP-free monomeric form of MinD is predominantly cytosolic,
      while ATP-bound dimeric MinD associates with the membrane. This dynamic

      states including a fast cytosolic fraction (D approximately 0.60 um^2/s). The

      This is a parent term of GO:0005524 (ATP binding). MinD specifically binds ATP
      through its P-loop motif. The more specific ATP binding annotation already

      This IEA annotation from UniProtKB keyword mapping is correct but less specific
      than the ATP binding (GO:0005524) annotation already present via IBA evidence.
      Since MinD is specifically an ATP-binding ATPase, this broader term is
      technically accurate but redundant with the more informative ATP binding
      annotation. Acceptable to retain as it does not contradict other annotations.

  review:
    summary: >-
      MinD is involved in the regulation of division septum assembly, specifically
      by preventing inappropriate polar septum formation and promoting divisome
      disassembly after cytokinesis. However, MinD's role is inhibitory/regulatory
      rather than directly assembling the septum.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      While MinD is clearly involved in division septum-related processes, the term
      'division septum assembly' (GO:0000917) implies direct participation in building
      the septum. MinD's actual role is to NEGATIVELY regulate septum formation at
      inappropriate sites (cell poles) and to promote disassembly of the divisome
      after septation. More appropriate terms would be 'regulation of division septum
      assembly' (GO:0032955) or 'negative regulation of division septum assembly'
      (GO:0010974), or 'division septum site selection' (GO:0000918). The MinCDJ
      system prevents polar Z-ring activity and promotes divisome disassembly.

      PtkA at the cell pole and can activate PtkA autophosphorylation in vitro.

      in B. subtilis, ensuring that cell division occurs at midcell rather than at

  - hypothesis: >-
      MinD's ATPase cycling drives the dynamic septal enrichment patterns observed
      in B. subtilis, distinct from the rapid pole-to-pole oscillation in E. coli.
    description: >-
      Quantitative live-cell imaging of MinD dynamics during the cell cycle using
      fluorescent protein fusions and single-molecule tracking to confirm gradient
      formation patterns in B. subtilis. This would validate the dynamic septal
      enrichment model proposed by recent studies and distinguish B. subtilis MinD
      behavior from E. coli oscillation.

  - hypothesis: >-
      ATPase activity is required for MinD patterning and membrane residence dynamics.
    description: >-
      Site-directed mutagenesis of MinD ATP binding site residues combined with
      localization studies to confirm the role of ATPase cycling in membrane
      association patterns. This would provide direct evidence that ATPase activity
      drives MinD patterning as proposed by biochemical studies.
