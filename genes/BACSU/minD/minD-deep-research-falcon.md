## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q01464
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Septum site-determining protein MinD; AltName: Full=Cell division inhibitor MinD;
- **Gene Information:** Name=minD; Synonyms=divIVB; OrderedLocusNames=BSU27990;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the ParA family. MinD subfamily. .
- **Key Domains:** CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA_Nub-bd_dom. (IPR002586); MinD. (IPR010223); MinD_FleN. (IPR025501); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); ParA/MinD_ATPase. (IPR050625)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "minD" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'minD' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **minD** (gene ID: minD, UniProt: Q01464) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan status: We verified the target identity (Bacillus subtilis strain 168 MinD; UniProt Q01464) and gathered recent and authoritative sources. We then extracted mechanistic function, localization, interaction partners, mutant phenotypes, and 2024 updates, and created an artifact table summarizing key facts for embedding.

*Table: A concise reference table summarizing biochemical function, localization, partners, mutant phenotypes, and 2024 updates for Bacillus subtilis MinD (UniProt Q01464), with primary evidence and DOIs for each claim.*

1) Key concepts and definitions (verified identity, functions, pathways)
- Identity and family: MinD is a ParA/MinD-family Walker-type P-loop NTPase in Bacillus subtilis strain 168 that participates in the MinCDJ/DivIVA system for division-site selection (distinct from the E. coli MinCDE oscillator) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).
- Core system architecture: DivIVA senses negative membrane curvature at poles and nascent septa, recruits the transmembrane scaffold MinJ, which in turn recruits MinC and MinD (MinCDJ). MinD recruits and activates MinC, the direct inhibitor of FtsZ polymerization, to suppress polar Z-ring formation and to promote disassembly of the divisome after septation (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31).
- Localization paradigm in B. subtilis: Instead of pole-to-pole oscillation, the B. subtilis Min system forms polar and septal enrichments that can appear as a bipolar gradient from poles/new septa toward midcell, with dynamic recruitment to ongoing division sites (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).

URLs/dates: mBio review (Apr 2021): https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00296-21 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). PLoS ONE (Mar 2010): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009850 (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).

2) Biochemical function, domains, and mechanism
- ATPase activity and membrane activation: Recent biochemical assays show B. subtilis MinD ATPase activity is strongly stimulated by membrane binding, with kcat ≈ 36.27 h−1 in liposome assays; ATP binding accelerates detachment from membranes, indicating that membrane association/dissociation is coupled to the ATPase cycle (bio-layer interferometry and SMLM/SMT support). This suggests MinD does not require a MinE-like activator in B. subtilis (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (posted Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).
- Oligomeric state and membrane binding: MinD dimerizes upon ATP binding and this dimer recruits MinC; notably, both monomeric and dimeric B. subtilis MinD can bind membranes, with measured release kinetics for specific mutants (e.g., K16A koff ≈ 2.77×10−3 s−1; D40A koff ≈ 1.76×10−3 s−1; G12V koff ≈ 47.8×10−3 s−1) (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).
- Membrane-targeting motifs: B. subtilis MinD possesses two C-terminal amphipathic α-helices, termed MTS1 and MTS-like (MTSL). Each helix can target nascent septal membranes independently in ΔminJ or ΔdivIVA cells; basic residues and intact helical structure are required for septal localization. Deleting both helices greatly reduces membrane targeting (Jun 2017) (ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1266/ggs.16-00054 (ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2).

3) Primary role in cell division and interaction network
- MinC recruitment and FtsZ inhibition: Dimerized MinD recruits MinC, which directly inhibits FtsZ polymer formation. In B. subtilis, MinJ bridges MinD/MinC to DivIVA’s curvature-sensing platform, thereby spatially restricting MinC action to poles/septa and preventing aberrant polar division (Apr 2021; Mar 2010) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).
- Divisome disassembly: In vivo genetics and microscopy show that the MinCDJ system promotes disassembly of divisome components (FtsA, FtsL, PBP-2B) at completed division sites; in Min-deficient contexts, these components persist at old septa, predisposing to minicell formation (Mar 2010) (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).

URLs/dates: mBio (Apr 2021): https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00296-21 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31). PLoS ONE (Mar 2010): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009850 (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).

4) Subcellular localization and dynamics
- Patterns in vivo: mBio imaging and modeling indicate that B. subtilis Min proteins dynamically enrich at active septa and poles rather than oscillate, leading to a time-resolved enrichment at the division site that subsequently seeds polar distributions in daughter cells (Apr 2021) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00296-21 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31).
- Single-molecule insights: 2024 single-molecule localization/tracking shows wild-type MinD forms dynamic polar/septal patterns dependent on its ATPase cycle; a dimer-locked mutant (D40A) accumulates in larger, confined membrane clusters with a high immobile fraction (~54.2%), whereas monomeric variants bind the membrane more uniformly and lose patterning (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).

5) Mutant phenotypes and cellular consequences
- Minicells and elongation: Loss of MinD or Min system function produces elongated rods and anucleate minicells, reflecting failure to restrict polar division and/or to disassemble the divisome at old septa (Apr 2021; Mar 2010) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27, baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).
- FtsZ recycling and cell size: Quantitative microfluidics plus fluorescence microscopy show that minD mutants fail to disassemble polar FtsZ rings, leading to defective recycling of FtsZ monomers, simultaneous maintenance of multiple Z-rings, and increased cell size despite similar division times (Apr 2020) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03197-19 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).
- Polar peptidoglycan remodeling: The Min system contributes to the inert nature of polar peptidoglycan; in minD mutants, polar PG becomes more remodelable, indicating a secondary role of the Min system in inhibiting polar cell wall turnover (Apr 2020) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03197-19 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).

6) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Membrane affinity versus diffusion model: A 2024 preprint argues that cyclical differences in membrane affinity between monomeric and dimeric MinD are not necessary to form the B. subtilis MinD gradient; instead, differences in diffusion rates and MinJ-mediated retention of dimers can explain observed distributions. Experimentally, monomeric and dimeric B. subtilis MinD exhibit comparable membrane affinities, and MinJ is not strictly required for MinD membrane association, although it stabilizes polar enrichment (bioRxiv Jun 2024) (bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 1-5, bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 47-49). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.11.598461 (bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 1-5, bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 47-49).
- Membrane-activated ATPase and patterning: Complementary 2024 work shows MinD’s ATPase is activated by membrane binding, with both monomer and dimer capable of membrane association. Pattern formation requires the ATPase-driven cycling that sets membrane residence times; mutants that disrupt this cycle (monomer-locked or dimer-locked) lose time-resolved gradients/patterns (bioRxiv Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).
- Amphipathic helices and targeting: Earlier B. subtilis work showed two C-terminal amphipathic helices (MTS1 and MTSL) each can drive septal targeting independently, even in ΔminJ or ΔdivIVA backgrounds, highlighting intrinsic lipid-binding features of MinD distinct from E. coli’s single MTS paradigm (Jun 2017) (ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1266/ggs.16-00054 (ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2).

Interpretation: Together, 2024 studies refine the classical stationary-gradient view by emphasizing dynamic septal enrichment, membrane-activated ATPase cycling, comparable monomer/dimer membrane affinities, and a dominant role for diffusion and MinJ-mediated retention in shaping MinD distributions (bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 1-5, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6).

7) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Quantitative live-cell platforms: Microfluidic time-lapse fluorescence microscopy has been used to quantify growth, FtsZ dynamics, and MinD-dependent disassembly/recycling in B. subtilis, enabling precise phenotyping of minD mutants (Apr 2020) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03197-19 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).
- Single-molecule imaging and biophysics: Recent implementations include single-molecule localization microscopy and single-particle tracking, and bio-layer interferometry with liposomes, to quantify MinD membrane-binding kinetics and diffusion states in vivo and in vitro (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).
- Modeling frameworks: Particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating measured diffusion, membrane residence, and MinJ retention successfully recapitulate MinD distributions, supporting a diffusion-dominant mechanism for gradient formation in B. subtilis (Jun 2024) (bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 47-49). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.11.598461 (bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 47-49).

8) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2021 mBio analysis emphasizes that, unlike E. coli, B. subtilis relies on a DivIVA–MinJ scaffold to localize MinCD to poles and nascent septa, with MinCDJ acting downstream of site selection to prevent re-initiation and to assist divisome disassembly, consistent with observed phenotypes and imaging (Apr 2021) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00296-21 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).
- The 2010 PLoS ONE study provides functional interpretation that MinCDJ’s principal role is to prevent minicells by promoting disassembly of the cytokinetic ring at recently completed septa—broadening the view beyond simple FtsZ polymer inhibition (Mar 2010) (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2). URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009850 (baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).

9) Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- ATPase kinetics: kcat ≈ 36.27 h−1 for membrane-activated B. subtilis MinD ATPase; ATP-dependent membrane release with koff values for mutants: K16A ≈ 2.77×10−3 s−1; D40A ≈ 1.76×10−3 s−1; G12V ≈ 47.8×10−3 s−1 (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30).
- Single-molecule states: Representative diffusion-state fractions for MinD populations (WT example): fast ≈ 22.3% at D ≈ 0.60 μm2 s−1; slow ≈ 50.4% at D ≈ 0.084 μm2 s−1; confined ≈ 27.3% at D ≈ 0.020 μm2 s−1, with altered distributions in ATPase-cycle mutants (Jul 2024) (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 22-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.08.602513 (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 22-27).
- Imaging-based phenotypes: minD mutants show persistent polar FtsZ rings, multiple concurrent Z-rings constrained by FtsZ supply, increased cell size, and loss of polar cell-wall inertness (Apr 2020) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27). URL: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03197-19 (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27).

10) Mandatory verification
- Gene symbol and organism: All cited studies analyze MinD from Bacillus subtilis strain 168 or directly applicable lab strains; this matches UniProt Q01464 (minD/divIVB; BSU27990) (feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27, baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2).
- Family/domains: Findings are consistent with ParA/MinD-family P-loop NTPases with membrane-targeting amphipathic helices; specific amphipathic helix evidence (MTS1/MTSL) is demonstrated in B. subtilis (ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2). No cross-species symbol confusion was used to derive functional claims.

Conclusions
B. subtilis MinD (Q01464) is a membrane-associated, Walker-type ATPase whose ATPase cycle and C-terminal amphipathic helices drive membrane binding, turnover, and recruitment of MinC to suppress polar Z-ring assembly and to promote divisome disassembly at completed septa. Recent 2024 studies refine the model, showing that membrane binding alone activates MinD ATPase, both monomers and dimers can bind membranes with comparable affinities, and MinD patterning in B. subtilis is best explained by diffusion and MinJ-mediated retention rather than large monomer/dimer affinity cycles, while preserving the core role of MinD in septal/polar enrichment and FtsZ regulation (feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 1-6, feddersen2024mechanisticinsightsinto pages 27-30, bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 1-5, bohorquez2025membraneaffinitydifference pages 47-49, baarle2010themincdjsystem pages 1-2, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 27-31, feddersen2021dynamicsofthe pages 24-27, ishikawa2017septalmembranelocalization pages 1-2).
