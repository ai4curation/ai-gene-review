    label: anti-sigma factor antagonist activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA is the anti-sigma factor antagonist for sigma F. When phosphorylated,
      SpoIIAA counteracts the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, releasing sigma F from inhibition.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the core molecular function of SpoIIAA. UniProt explicitly describes
      SpoIIAA as an anti-anti-sigma factor that counteracts SpoIIAB to release sigma F.
      This is the defining activity for SpoIIAA and aligns with the curated IBA annotation.

    label: positive regulation of DNA-templated transcription
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA indirectly promotes transcription by activating sigma F through
      antagonism of the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      SpoIIAA does not bind DNA or the RNA polymerase directly, but it positively
      regulates sigma F activity by counteracting SpoIIAB. The transcriptional effects
      are indirect, so this term is kept as a non-core downstream process.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA regulates transcription indirectly by controlling sigma F availability
      through SpoIIAB antagonism.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      This term is too general and redundant with the more specific positive regulation
      of transcription. SpoIIAA acts via sigma-factor control rather than serving as a
      direct transcriptional regulator, so this generic term overstates its role.

    label: sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA is a stage II sporulation protein required for the sigma F regulatory
      cascade that drives early sporulation gene expression.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      SpoIIAA is a core component of the sporulation regulatory network. UniProt
      explicitly annotates it as a stage II sporulation protein and tags it with
      the sporulation keyword, supporting its role in spore formation.

    label: anti-sigma factor antagonist activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA functions as an anti-sigma factor antagonist that releases sigma F
      from inhibition by SpoIIAB.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The InterPro-based IEA aligns with the experimentally supported function of
      SpoIIAA as an anti-anti-sigma factor in the sigma F pathway, which is core
      to its molecular role.

    label: antisigma factor binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAA antagonizes the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB, implying direct interaction
      with an anti-sigma factor to free sigma F.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Antisigma factor binding is consistent with SpoIIAA's anti-anti-sigma role and
      is supported by UniProt functional annotation describing SpoIIAB antagonism.
      The term is specific and appropriate for this molecular function.
