- term:
    id: GO:0005886
    label: plasma membrane
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIB is a single-pass membrane protein that localizes to the cell
      membrane and septal sites during sporulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt annotates SpoIIB as a cell membrane protein with a transmembrane
      helix and septal localization, supporting plasma membrane localization.

    label: sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIB is a stage II sporulation protein required for proper septal
      morphogenesis during spore formation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt names SpoIIB as a stage II sporulation protein and assigns the
      sporulation keyword, consistent with a role in spore formation.

    label: peptidoglycan binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIB contains a SPOR-like domain associated with septal peptidoglycan
      remodeling and is linked to septal peptidoglycan dissolution.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The SPOR-like domain is associated with peptidoglycan binding, and SpoIIB
      facilitates dissolution of septal peptidoglycan during engulfment.
    supported_by:
      - reference_id: file:BACSU/spoIIB/spoIIB-uniprot.txt
        supporting_text: "Facilitates the rapid and spatially regulated dissolution of septal peptidoglycan."
