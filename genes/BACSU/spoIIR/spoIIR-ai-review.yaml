- term:
    id: GO:0030435
    label: sporulation resulting in formation of a cellular spore
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIR is a stage II sporulation protein required for signaling that
      enables pro-sigma(E) processing during sporulation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      UniProt assigns the sporulation keyword and names SpoIIR as a stage II
      sporulation protein, supporting its role in spore formation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIR interacts with SpoIIGA to signal activation of the pro-sigma(E)
      protease in the mother cell.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      The PMID reports a SpoIIR–SpoIIGA interaction. While this supports protein
      binding, the term is generic, so it is kept as non-core.
