4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ftsZ' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ftsZ** (gene ID: ftsZ, UniProt: P17865) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and identity verification
We verified the target as Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) cell division protein FtsZ (gene ftsZ; UniProt P17865), a bacterial tubulin homolog belonging to the FtsZ family and containing the canonical FtsZ (Cell_div_FtsZ) domain architecture. The literature cited below aligns with this identity and organism, and describes the same family/domain features and functions (assembly of a midcell Z-ring, GTP-dependent polymerization, membrane anchoring via FtsA/SepF/EzrA, recruitment of the divisome). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms for the specific B. subtilis context considered in this report (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, naha2023anchorsaway pages 8-9, battaje2023modelsversuspathogens pages 19-20).

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Definition and primary role: FtsZ is a conserved tubulin-like GTPase that polymerizes into head-to-tail protofilaments and assembles at midcell into the Z-ring, which scaffolds recruitment/organization of the divisome for septal peptidoglycan synthesis and cytokinesis. GTP binding and hydrolysis control filament assembly dynamics, subunit turnover, and ring remodeling (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z, Mar 2021) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2).
- Localization: The Z-ring forms at midcell adjacent to the inner membrane. FtsZ lacks an intrinsic membrane anchor and is tethered via membrane-associated partners, notably FtsA and SepF, with EzrA also acting as a multifunctional tether/regulator in B. subtilis. Multiple partially redundant tethers optimize Z-ring architecture and divisome assembly (https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15067, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (naha2023anchorsaway pages 8-9, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- Interaction network and divisome context: Early division proteins include FtsZ with anchors/tethering/bundling factors (FtsA, SepF, EzrA, ZapA). Late division components include the transmembrane septal synthases (FtsW, Pbp2B) and the DivIB–DivIC–FtsL complex that scaffold/activate peptidoglycan synthesis. Spatial regulators position the Z-ring: the MinC/MinD/MinJ system blocks polar FtsZ assembly; nucleoid occlusion by Noc prevents division over the nucleoid; metabolic cues (e.g., UgtP) link growth status to Z-ring assembly (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Multi-anchor mechanisms and EzrA function: Recent review and mechanistic synthesis emphasize overlapping membrane tether systems. In B. subtilis, EzrA acts as a negative regulator of excessive bundling and also serves as a multifunctional Z-ring tether/scaffold that interfaces with FtsZ, FtsA, SepF, and ZapA, and contributes to PG synthase recruitment (https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15067, Apr 2023) (naha2023anchorsaway pages 8-9).
- Z-ring condensation as a prerequisite to cytokinesis: Live-cell single-molecule imaging in B. subtilis revealed that Z-binding proteins (ZBPs: EzrA, SepF, ZapA, along with FtsA) transiently bind treadmilling FtsZ subunits to condense filaments into a dense Z-ring, and that this condensation step is essential for successful septation. The divisome comprises a stationary ZBP subcomplex and a directionally moving synthase complex (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z, Mar 2021). The 2024 review integrates these findings within broader divisome regulation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- Minimal divisome configurations: A 2024 B. subtilis minimization study indicates that FtsZ together with SepF can suffice to form a functional Z-ring in engineered backgrounds lacking multiple accessory/regulatory proteins; viability was retained albeit with reduced division frequency and with suppressor mutations arising. This underscores redundancy and robustness in the anchoring/condensation network and nominates SepF as a pivotal anchor in minimal systems (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403, Jan 2024). A 2025 peer-reviewed extension similarly supports FtsZ+SepF sufficiency for ring formation and documents suppressors (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011567, Jan 2025) (gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, gulsoy2025minimizationofthe pages 2-4).
- Conceptual advances on treadmilling-mediated self-organization: A 2024 theory–experiment study linked filament treadmilling to nematic ordering via dissolution of misaligned filaments, explaining robust ring organization and rapid response to cellular biases in vivo in B. subtilis. This provides a framework for how FtsZ dynamics drive large-scale ring alignment and assembly (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-024-02597-8, Aug 2024) (vasquez2024thezringin pages 17-19).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Antibacterial targeting: FtsZ remains a high-value antibacterial target. Comparative analyses of FtsZ across species and reviews of anti-FtsZ chemotypes emphasize species-specific regulation and interaction networks that influence inhibitor action, motivating organism-tailored design and validation strategies (https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20221664, Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (battaje2023modelsversuspathogens pages 19-20, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- Synthetic biology/minimal systems: Divisome minimization in B. subtilis suggests a tractable minimal cytokinesis module (FtsZ+SepF) that can be leveraged to dissect essential mechanics of ring formation, anchor function, and anchoring–synthesis coupling in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011567, Jan 2025) (gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, gulsoy2025minimizationofthe pages 2-4).
- Advanced imaging: B. subtilis divisome studies increasingly use live-cell single-molecule and super-resolution imaging to quantify molecular lifetimes, ring condensation dynamics, and modular divisome movements, providing platforms to evaluate on-target effects of inhibitors and perturbations (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- The 2024 Nature Reviews Microbiology synthesis (Cameron & Margolin) frames the divisome as a modular, temporally controlled machine, with FtsZ’s Z-ring initiating assembly, multiple anchors/tethers (FtsA/SepF/EzrA) providing redundancy and architectural control, and late synthase complexes executing septal wall synthesis. It highlights spatial regulators (Min and Noc systems) and developmental regulators (e.g., MciZ) that tune FtsZ polymerization/positioning (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- The 2023 Molecular Microbiology review on anchors (Naha, Haeusser & Margolin) emphasizes the prevalent use of multiple overlapping membrane tethers (FtsA, SepF, EzrA) across bacteria, arguing these not only attach FtsZ to membranes but also organize higher-order structures to optimize division activity. In B. subtilis, EzrA is a central, multifunctional tether with dual regulatory roles (https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15067, Apr 2023) (naha2023anchorsaway pages 8-9).
- The 2024 minimization study (bioRxiv) and 2025 peer-reviewed follow-up argue that SepF is sufficient with FtsZ to form an active Z-ring in engineered B. subtilis, consistent with deep evolutionary conservation of SepF as an FtsZ anchor, and propose new links between cell physiology (BraB transporter) and division (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011567, Jan 2025) (gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, gulsoy2025minimizationofthe pages 2-4).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Single-molecule lifetimes and condensation: In B. subtilis cells, live-cell single-molecule imaging measured a mean FtsZ subunit lifetime of approximately 8.1 s (half-life ∼5.6 s) at the Z-ring, consistent with a dynamic steady state where ZBPs condense filaments and stationary FtsZ-binding subcomplexes coexist with moving synthase complexes (Nature Microbiology, Mar 2021; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z) (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2).
- Qualitative dependencies: Across systems, synthase complex movement and septal constriction can be tightly or loosely coupled to FtsZ treadmilling; authoritative syntheses emphasize species- and context-specific coupling and underscore Z-ring condensation as a critical, separable step prior to robust septation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x, Jul 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z, Mar 2021) (cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2).

Mechanistic synthesis for Bacillus subtilis FtsZ (P17865)
- Biochemical mechanism: FtsZ monomers bind GTP and assemble into polar protofilaments. GTP hydrolysis promotes subunit turnover, enabling treadmilling and remodeling. In B. subtilis, ZBPs (ZapA, SepF, EzrA) and FtsA transiently bind FtsZ to bundle/condense filaments into a functional Z-ring, which is essential for division. The Z-ring then recruits late divisome proteins (FtsW, Pbp2B, DivIB/DivIC/FtsL) that catalyze and regulate septal peptidoglycan synthesis (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x) (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2, gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- Spatial control and anchoring: The Z-ring’s proper placement depends on MinCD/MinJ (polar inhibition) and Noc (nucleoid occlusion). Anchoring to the membrane is achieved via FtsA and SepF, with EzrA acting as a multifunctional tether and regulator of lateral bundling. Overlapping anchoring pathways confer robustness; EzrA’s scaffolding and inhibitory effects fine-tune ring architecture and dynamics (https://doi.org/10.1111/mmi.15067; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403) (naha2023anchorsaway pages 8-9, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4).
- Pathway context and coupling to cell wall synthesis: The divisome comprises at least two dynamic modules—stationary ZBPs associated with treadmilling FtsZ and a directionally moving synthase complex (e.g., Pbp2B, FtsW with DivIB/DivIC/FtsL). In B. subtilis, Z-ring condensation by ZBPs is a decisive prerequisite; the precise quantitative coupling between FtsZ treadmilling and synthase movement may vary, but recruitment and spatial organization by FtsZ remain central (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00878-z; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x) (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22).
- Implications for antibiotics: As an essential, well-conserved organizer of bacterial cytokinesis, FtsZ is a validated antibacterial target. However, species-specific anchor networks, regulators, and coupling to synthase motion shape inhibitor responses. Reviews highlight the need to tailor inhibitors to organismal FtsZ dynamics and anchoring environments; the advent of in vivo imaging and minimal divisome systems in B. subtilis provides rigorous, mechanistically grounded assays for on-target validation (https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20221664; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00942-x; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.12.575403) (battaje2023modelsversuspathogens pages 19-20, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4).

Notes on evidence prioritization and limitations
- This report prioritized 2023–2024 sources where available and integrated foundational single-molecule/quantitative work in B. subtilis to provide kinetics. Some 2025 peer-reviewed content is cited when it consolidates 2024 preprint findings about minimal divisome sufficiency (FtsZ+SepF). Quantitative treadmilling speeds and enzyme kinetics can vary with imaging/assay conditions and were not consistently reported in the 2023–2024 B. subtilis-specific sources accessible here; we thus emphasized directly measured single-molecule lifetimes and robust qualitative coupling/condensation conclusions (squyres2021singlemoleculeimagingreveals pages 1-2, cameron2024insightsintothe pages 20-22, gulsoy2024divisomeminimizationshows pages 1-4, gulsoy2025minimizationofthe pages 2-4).
