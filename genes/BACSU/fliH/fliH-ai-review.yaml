description: >-
  FliH is a cytosolic component of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) export apparatus.
  It forms a complex with the FliI ATPase (FliH2-FliI1 stoichiometry) and acts as a negative regulator,
  inhibiting FliI ATPase activity until productive engagement with the export gate (FlhA/FlhB/FliPQR).
  FliH helps coordinate ATP hydrolysis with PMF-driven translocation of flagellar substrates and is
  essential for efficient and ordered export of flagellar proteins. Based primarily on conserved mechanism
  studies in Salmonella, with B. subtilis fliH expected to function similarly due to conserved architecture.

    review:
      summary: >-
        FliH is a soluble cytoplasmic protein that forms part of the ATPase module of the flagellar
        type III secretion system. The IBA annotation for cytosol localization is phylogenetically
        inferred and consistent with the known biochemistry of FliH across bacteria. However, this
        term is overly broad since FliH specifically localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the basal
        body at the C-ring/MS-ring interface as part of the export apparatus. A more specific cellular
        component term exists: GO:0120102 (bacterial-type flagellum secretion apparatus), which
        explicitly names FliH as a component.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: >-
        While FliH is indeed cytosolic, the term GO:0005829 (cytosol) is too broad. FliH specifically
        localizes to the flagellar secretion apparatus at the cytoplasmic face of the basal body.
        GO:0120102 (bacterial-type flagellum secretion apparatus) is a more specific and accurate
        term that explicitly mentions FliH as a component in its definition.

        This IEA annotation is derived from the UniProt keyword mapping (KW-0653 Protein transport).
        While technically correct that FliH is involved in protein transport (specifically flagellar
        protein export), this term is overly general. FliH functions specifically in the flagellar
        type III secretion system to export flagellar proteins. A more specific term exists:

      action: MODIFY

    review:
      summary: >-
        This IEA annotation is derived from UniProt keyword mapping (KW-1005 Flagellum biogenesis).
        The term GO:0044781 (bacterial-type flagellum organization) is a parent term that encompasses
        flagellar assembly. While not wrong, the term GO:0044780 (bacterial-type flagellum assembly)
        is more specific and already annotated for this gene. This annotation is acceptable but
        redundant given the more specific assembly term.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: >-
        This is a broader term that is consistent with FliH function in flagellar biogenesis.
        While GO:0044780 (assembly) is more specific and already present, the IEA mapping to the
        broader organization term is not incorrect and provides useful context from the keyword
        mapping pipeline. Acceptable as a secondary annotation.

  # Proposed new annotation based on FliH biochemistry

    evidence_type: ISS
    original_reference_id: PMID:10998179
    review:
      summary: >-
        FliH acts as a negative regulator of the FliI ATPase, inhibiting its ATPase activity until
        productive engagement with the export gate. This biochemical function has been demonstrated
        in Salmonella (PMID:10998179) and is expected to be conserved in B. subtilis based on
        sequence homology. GO:0042030 (ATPase inhibitor activity) accurately describes this core
        molecular function.
      action: NEW
      reason: >-
        This annotation is proposed based on conserved biochemistry from Salmonella FliH, which
        has been shown to inhibit FliI ATPase activity. The Minamino and Macnab 2000 paper
        demonstrates that FliH inhibits FliI ATPase activity approximately 10-fold. This is a core
        molecular function that should be annotated. Evidence code ISS (inferred from sequence
        similarity) is appropriate given the conservation of FliH function across bacteria.

            The ATPase activity of the FliH-FliI complex was about 10-fold lower than that of FliI

            We propose that FliH functions as a negative regulator to prevent FliI from hydrolysing
            ATP until the flagellar export apparatus is competent to link this hydrolysis to the
            translocation of export substrates across the plane of the cytoplasmic membrane into
            the lumen of the nascent flagellar structure.
