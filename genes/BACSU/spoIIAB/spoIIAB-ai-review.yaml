  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAB is the anti-sigma factor for sigma F, binding sigma F and blocking
      formation of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the defining molecular function of SpoIIAB. UniProt states that
      SpoIIAB binds sigma F and inhibits holoenzyme formation, consistent with
      sigma factor antagonist activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      By binding sigma F and blocking holoenzyme formation, SpoIIAB inhibits
      sigma F-dependent transcription.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      SpoIIAB directly antagonizes sigma F and prevents RNA polymerase holoenzyme
      formation, which is a direct negative regulatory effect on transcription of
      sigma F-dependent genes.

      SpoIIAB is an ATP-dependent kinase with specific ATP-binding motifs.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term "nucleotide binding" is overly broad; SpoIIAB is an ATP-binding
      protein kinase. Use the more specific ATP binding term.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SpoIIAB phosphorylates SpoIIAA on a serine residue, functioning as a
      protein serine/threonine kinase.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The generic protein kinase activity term is too broad. SpoIIAB is a
      serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1), so a more specific kinase
      term is appropriate.

      SpoIIAB is required for proper timing of sigma F activity and sporulation,

  review:
    summary: >-
      The cited study examines kinase-kinase interactions and phosphorylation
      networks in B. subtilis and includes SpoIIAB in interaction assays, but
      the specific binding partner for SpoIIAB is not clearly stated here.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: >-
      The PMID describes broad kinase interaction and cross-phosphorylation
      assays and lists SpoIIAB among the proteins tested, but it does not provide
      a clear, specific binding interaction for SpoIIAB in the accessible text.
      More direct binding evidence would be needed to accept a generic protein
      binding annotation.
