description: >-
  SecA is the essential ATP-driven motor protein of the bacterial Sec translocase
  (EC 7.4.2.8) that powers post-translational protein secretion through the SecYEG
  channel. As a P-type polypeptide translocase ATPase, SecA couples ATP binding and
  hydrolysis to mechanical translocation of preproteins bearing N-terminal signal
  peptides across the cytoplasmic membrane. The protein cycles between cytoplasmic
  and membrane-associated states, interacting with the SecYEG preprotein-conducting
  channel to drive stepwise translocation of polypeptide chains. SecA undergoes
  conformational changes upon nucleotide binding and hydrolysis that push polypeptide
  segments through SecYEG. In B. subtilis, SecA localizes to discrete membrane-proximal
  "secretion zones" during high-level secretion of proteins like alpha-amylase.
  The protein functions as part of the holotranslocon complex comprising SecYEG
  with SecDF-YajC and YidC, and cooperates with TerC family proteins (MeeF/MeeY)
  for co-translocational metalation of secreted enzymes. SecA binds zinc as a
  cofactor through a C-terminal SEC-C motif and contains helicase-like ATP-binding
  domains characteristic of the superfamily 2 helicases. The protein can exist as
  both monomers and various homodimeric forms, with a single SecA monomer interacting
  with SecY in the functional translocation channel. SecA is essential for bacterial
  viability and has been proposed as an antibiotic target.

    summary: >-
      SecA is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with the plasma membrane
      on the cytoplasmic side during active protein translocation. UniProt states
      SecA is localized to Cell membrane as a Peripheral membrane protein on the
      Cytoplasmic side with experimental evidence from PMID:27362352. The deep research
      confirms SecA binds to the inner leaflet and SecYEG at the cytoplasmic membrane
      and cycles into a membrane-inserted state during active translocation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Plasma membrane localization is well-established for SecA as part of its core
      function in protein translocation. SecA cycles between cytoplasm and membrane,
      associating with the membrane during translocation via SecYEG interaction.
      IBA annotation is appropriate and consistent with experimental evidence.

      This annotation appears to be an error or overly generic mapping from

      SecA is a protein EXPORTER, not importer. The Sec translocase moves

      function. This annotation should be removed as it is misleading.
