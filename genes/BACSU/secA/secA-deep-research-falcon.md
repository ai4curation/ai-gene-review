### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P28366
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein translocase subunit SecA {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01382}; EC=7.4.2.8 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01382, ECO:0000305|PubMed:8440733};
- **Gene Information:** Name=secA {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01382}; Synonyms=div+; OrderedLocusNames=BSU35300;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SecA family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** Helicase_ATP-bd. (IPR014001); Helicase_C-like. (IPR001650); P-loop_NTPase. (IPR027417); SEC_C_motif. (IPR004027); SecA. (IPR000185)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "secA" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'secA' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **secA** (gene ID: secA, UniProt: P28366) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: secA in Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) encodes the cytosolic/peripheral membrane ATPase motor (SecA) of the general Sec protein translocation machinery, consistent with UniProt P28366, EC 7.4.2.8. Mechanistic and structural reviews and Bacillus-focused experimental studies confirm SecA’s role at the SecYEG channel in B. subtilis and other bacteria (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2). The protein operates at the cytoplasmic membrane, cycles on/off SecYEG, and binds anionic phospholipids, in line with a peripheral membrane ATPase motor; this matches the UniProt functional annotation and family assignment (SecA) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 5-6, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5).

Comprehensive research report

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Core role of SecA: SecA is the ATP-driven motor of the bacterial Sec translocase that post-translationally drives preprotein movement through the SecYEG channel. ATP binding/hydrolysis by SecA produces conformational changes that push polypeptide segments through SecYEG; SecA’s oligomeric state (monomer/dimer) and lipid interactions modulate activity (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 13-14, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 5-6, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5).
- Translocon architecture: SecY forms the protein-conducting channel with a hydrophobic constriction and a movable plug; the lateral gate opens to accept signal peptides or transmembrane segments. Constraining the lateral gate impairs translocation and alters SecA ATPase activity, evidencing tight allosteric coupling between SecA’s catalytic cycle and SecY gating (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 5-6).
- Holotranslocon and accessory partners: The functional secretion unit in Gram-positive bacteria (holotranslocon) comprises SecYEG with SecDF–YajC and YidC; SecA powers translocation into/through SecYEG. Bacillus subtilis TerC family proteins MeeF (YceF) and MeeY (YkoY) physically associate with this complex and facilitate co-translocational metalation of secreted enzymes (Nature Communications, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41896-1, Oct 2023) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8).
- Localization: In B. subtilis, SecA localizes at discrete membrane-proximal “secretion zones” during high-level secretion; single-molecule tracking reveals multiple diffusive states, consistent with SecA cycling between substrate-bound, translocon-bound, and free states (BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Spatial secretion zones and SecA dynamics in B. subtilis: Overexpression of the secreted α-amylase (AmyE) reveals stable secretion patches within the Gram-positive cell wall that overlap SecA signals. SecA exhibits three diffusive states whose populations shift with secretion load, yet without overwhelming the translocase, refining our view of how SecA is deployed in vivo (BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- Co-translocational metalation via TerC proteins: Deletion of MeeF and MeeY impairs protein export and reduces Mn in the secreted proteome; MeeF/MeeY co-purify with Sec pathway components, indicating a SecA/SecYEG/SecDF–YajC–YidC–TerC functional unit that supports maturation of Mn-dependent extracytoplasmic enzymes (Nature Communications, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41896-1, Oct 2023) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8).
- Translational arrest-peptide regulation of Sec components: High-resolution work on arrest peptides shows how regulatory nascent chains stall translation to modulate expression of Sec machinery components. For SecM in E. coli, a 2.0 Å structure reveals stabilization of the A-site Pro-tRNA that prevents peptide bond formation; relief occurs when mechanical pulling forces (e.g., by SecA/translocon) act on the nascent chain. RAPP-motif arrest peptides were structurally defined in both B. subtilis and E. coli, demonstrating a conserved “short-circuit” of peptidyltransferase activity that likely tunes Sec-related gene expression in Firmicutes (Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46762-2, Mar 2024; Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46761-3, Mar 2024) (jensen2025incelldiscoveryand pages 25-27).
- Review integration for Gram-positives: A 2024 expert review synthesizes emerging links between Sec-dependent export and extracytoplasmic metalation, highlighting SecA and SecDF as central elements in maintaining envelope homeostasis and the function of metal-dependent exoenzymes (Annual Review of Microbiology, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-micro-041522-091507, Nov 2024) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Industrial secretion in Bacillus: Bacillus spp. are major hosts for secreted enzyme production. In a high-yield B. subtilis mutant for nattokinase, transcriptomics indicated upregulation of Sec pathway components correlating with higher extracellular enzyme titers, aligning with the concept that tuning SecA/SecDF/associated factors boosts secretion capacity (Foods, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3390/foods14050898, Mar 2025). The study reported 300.0 ± 4.7 FU/mL nattokinase activity in the engineered strain, a 1.84-fold increase over the parent (guo2025genomicandtranscriptomic pages 19-19). Complementary microscopy in B. subtilis shows secretion zones overlapping SecA signals during high amylase production, providing spatial targets for engineering secretion efficiency (BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- Accessory folding support: The lipoprotein foldase PrsA is critical for post-translocation folding and secretion of enzymes like α-amylase, indicating that SecA-driven export must be matched by extracytoplasmic folding capacity for industrial performance (BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanism: Structural-mechanistic analyses converge on a model where SecA cycles at SecYEG, with ATPase activity allosterically coupled to lateral-gate opening and polypeptide diffusion through the hydrophobic constriction. These insights provide a robust mechanistic framework for Gram-positive SecA, including B. subtilis (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 5-6).
- System-level integration: Recent expert synthesis emphasizes the holotranslocon (SecYEG–SecDF–YajC–YidC) as a dynamic secretion machine, with TerC family proteins interfacing co-translocational metalation and quality control. This positions SecA’s activity within a broader envelope homeostasis network in B. subtilis (Nature Communications, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41896-1, Oct 2023) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8).
- Regulatory logic: Structural work on SecM and RAPP-like arrest peptides illustrates a conserved feedback where force generated by SecA-dependent translocation can relieve stalls, thereby coupling translocase workload to expression of its components. This is increasingly seen as a general regulatory motif across bacteria, including B. subtilis (Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46762-2, Mar 2024; Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46761-3, Mar 2024) (jensen2025incelldiscoveryand pages 25-27).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Secretion dynamics in vivo: B. subtilis shows discrete, long-lived secretion zones during AmyE overexpression; SecA displays three distinct diffusive states whose distributions shift with secretion demand, indicating regulated allocation of SecA to translocon engagement versus free states (BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- TerC–dependent metalation: ΔmeeF ΔmeeY mutants exhibit reduced export capacity and a large reduction of Mn in the secreted proteome, providing quantitative proteomic evidence that the Sec translocase cooperates with metal-handling factors during export (Nature Communications, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41896-1, Oct 2023) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8).
- Bioprocess titers: Engineered B. subtilis for nattokinase showed 300.0 ± 4.7 FU/mL and a 1.84× increase over the starting strain; genes of the Sec pathway were broadly upregulated, consistent with increased export throughput (Foods, 2025, https://doi.org/10.3390/foods14050898, Mar 2025) (guo2025genomicandtranscriptomic pages 19-19).

Mechanism, substrates, and localization of B. subtilis SecA (functional annotation)
- Primary function and reaction: SecA is a P-type polypeptide translocase ATPase (EC 7.4.2.8) that couples ATP hydrolysis to mechanical translocation of mostly unfolded preproteins bearing N-terminal signal peptides across the cytoplasmic membrane via SecYEG (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 13-14).
- Substrate specificity: SecA recognizes preproteins with N-terminal signal peptides that engage the lateral gate of SecY; signal peptides are cleaved by signal peptidases after translocation initiation, with subsequent folding often assisted by extracytoplasmic factors (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012; BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- Localization: SecA is cytosolic but binds to the inner leaflet and SecYEG at the cytoplasmic membrane; it cycles into a membrane-inserted state during active translocation and interacts with anionic phospholipids. In B. subtilis, SecA signal overlaps discrete secretion zones near/within the cell wall during high secretion (Philosophical Transactions R. Soc. B, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0201, Apr 2012; BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 5-6, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- Pathway context and interacting partners: SecA functions with SecYEG, SecDF–YajC, and YidC; in B. subtilis, PrsA assists post-translocation folding, and TerC proteins (MeeF/MeeY) participate in co-translocational metalation and interface with envelope homeostasis (Nature Communications, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41896-1, Oct 2023; BMC Biology, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1, Oct 2023) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).
- Regulation: Translation arrest peptides (e.g., SecM-like and RAPP-type) provide feedback that can modulate SecA/Sec machinery expression by stalling elongation; mechanical pulling by translocation relieves stalling, coordinating expression with translocase workload (Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46762-2, Mar 2024; Nature Communications, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46761-3, Mar 2024) (jensen2025incelldiscoveryand pages 25-27).

*Table: Compact, evidence-linked summary of functional annotation and recent findings for Bacillus subtilis SecA (UniProt P28366), combining mechanistic, structural, regulatory, and applied (industrial/metalation) literature for rapid reference.*

Notes on antibiotic targeting
- Although SecA has long been proposed as an antibiotic target, the most directly supported, recent Bacillus-subtilis–centric advances here are indirect, via the emerging understanding of SecA’s integration in the holotranslocon and its coupling to metalation/quality control. Direct, recent inhibitor studies specific to B. subtilis SecA were not identified in the curated 2023–2024 evidence above; thus, we refrain from making specific inhibitor claims while noting the rationale (essentiality, centrality to secretion) (he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2).

Conclusion
- Collectively, the recent literature refines the functional annotation of B. subtilis SecA (P28366): a peripheral membrane ATPase motor that powers Sec-dependent protein export at SecYEG, operating within a holotranslocon that includes SecDF–YajC and YidC and interfaces with TerC-dependent metalation. New live-cell and structural studies in 2023–2024 have added spatial (secretion zones), systems (metalation/quality control), and regulatory (arrest peptides) layers to this core function, with clear implications for industrial secretion engineering in Bacillus (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 1-2, he2023tercproteinsfunction pages 6-8, jensen2025incelldiscoveryand pages 25-27, nijeholt2012thebacterialsectranslocase pages 3-5).
