## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P16336
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein translocase subunit SecY {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01465};
- **Gene Information:** Name=secY {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01465}; OrderedLocusNames=BSU01360;
- **Organism (full):** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SecY/SEC61-alpha family. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-
- **Key Domains:** SecY. (IPR026593); SecY/SEC61-alpha. (IPR002208); SecY_CS. (IPR030659); SecY_dom_sf. (IPR023201); SecY (PF00344)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "secY" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Bacillus subtilis (strain 168).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'secY' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **secY** (gene ID: secY, UniProt: P16336) in BACSU.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research plan and verification summary
- Identity verification: The target is Bacillus subtilis (strain 168) secY (UniProt P16336), encoding the core membrane-channel subunit of the SecYEG translocon, a member of the conserved SecY/SEC61-alpha family. Contemporary reviews and structural/mechanistic studies confirm SecY as the protein-conducting channel that operates with SecE and SecG in bacteria, and with SecA as the ATPase motor (Open Biology review, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166, published Aug 30, 2023) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 1-2, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13). No conflicting gene symbol usages were detected for Bacillus subtilis.

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Core role: SecY is the channel-forming subunit of the bacterial SecYEG translocon. It conducts preproteins across the cytoplasmic membrane (secretion) and supports insertion of membrane proteins, functioning with SecE and SecG as a heterotrimer and energized primarily by the SecA ATPase for post-translational transport; co-translational routes can also target substrates to SecYEG via SRP–ribosome interactions (Open Biology review, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166; published Aug 30, 2023) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 1-2, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3). SecY is homologous to the eukaryotic Sec61α subunit of the ER translocon (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 1-2).
- Transport substrate and type: Substrates are unfolded polypeptides bearing N‑terminal signal peptides (secretory proteins) or topogenic sequences (membrane protein TM helices). Bacterial secretion is largely post‑translational and driven by SecA; membrane protein insertion is typically co‑translational (Open Biology review, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 1-2, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
- Energetics: In vitro, SecA + ATP with membrane‑embedded SecYEG suffices for transport, but in vivo the proton‑motive force (PMF) accelerates export (Open Biology review, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Mechanism of SecA–SecY–substrate translocation: Cryo‑EM structures of an active complex with substrate in ADP vs ATP states show a helicase‑like translocation mechanism by SecA (two‑helix finger and clamp dynamics) that advances polypeptide through SecY; the study used B. subtilis SecA and bacterial SecYE (PNAS, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208070120; published Jan 4, 2023) (dong2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Unified mechanistic framework: A 2023 review synthesizes structural, single‑molecule, and biochemical advances to propose a unifying mechanism for bacterial SecYEG operation, cataloging the roles of SecA, SecDF (PMF‑coupled enhancer), and YidC as interacting partners with SecYEG (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166; published Aug 30, 2023) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
- Gram‑positive secretion architecture in vivo: In B. subtilis and B. licheniformis, fluorescently tagged secreted α‑amylase (AmyE‑mCherry) accumulates at discrete, low‑mobility “secretion zones” within the cell wall during overexpression; lysozyme conversion to spheroplasts removes most envelope‑associated signal, indicating wall association; these zones persist minutes and shift laterally only tens of nanometers per minute (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1; published Oct 6, 2023) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 3-7, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- SecA dynamics in B. subtilis under high secretion demand: Single‑molecule tracking in the same study shows SecA and SecDF partition into static, medium‑mobile, and free fractions; the static (translocon‑engaged) SecA fraction increases under AmyE overexpression, consistent with elevated SecYEG engagement (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Methodological progress: Single‑cell technologies to monitor secretion heterogeneity and stress responses in Bacillus and other hosts have matured, enabling quantitative and high‑throughput readouts of Sec‑dependent secretion performance (Trends in Biotechnology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2024.02.011; published Sep 2024) (hartmann2024singlecelltechnologies pages 17-17).
- Direct visualization of single SecYEG–SecA translocation events: High‑speed AFM visualized substrate translocation through single SecYEG–SecA nanodiscs, supporting one active unit sufficiency and nucleotide‑dependent SecA conformational changes (Nat. Commun., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54875-x; published Jan 23, 2025). Although 2025, this work reinforces 2023–2024 mechanistic models (kanaoka2025afmobservationof pages 9-10).

3) Current applications and real‑world implementations
- Industrial secretion in Bacillus: B. subtilis is widely used for secretion of industrial enzymes. Secretion heterogeneity and stress responses (e.g., CssRS) are operational constraints; single‑cell tools and signal peptide engineering are emphasized as levers for optimizing Sec‑dependent export and culture‑level yields (Trends in Biotechnology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2024.02.011) (hartmann2024singlecelltechnologies pages 17-17). The identification of secretion zones and SecA engagement dynamics in Bacillus informs strain/process engineering to alleviate wall passage bottlenecks and tune translocon load (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 3-7, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Antibacterial target potential: The active SecA–SecY complex shows commonalities with other antibiotic‑targeted translocation systems; structural work argues SecA/SecY as compelling antibacterial targets across Gram‑positives and Gram‑negatives (PNAS, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208070120) (dong2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2). Mechanistic syntheses underscore the pharmaceutical potential of modulating SecYEG function (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Unified mechanism and open questions: Allen & Collinson (2023) weigh evidence for power‑stroke vs Brownian ratchet components, argue for a largely complete mechanism integrating structural and single‑molecule data, and discuss the roles of accessory factors (SecDF, YidC) that modulate SecYEG performance, especially under native PMF (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
- Mechanistic details from structure: Dong et al. (2023) interpret ATP‑state cryo‑EM to support a helicase‑like driving motion by SecA that advances substrate through SecY and strengthens the case for targeting the active complex pharmaceutically (PNAS, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208070120) (dong2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2).
- Host‑level perspective on secretion: Hartmann et al. (2024) review single‑cell secretion analyses, emphasizing that process‑level optimization in Bacillus should address heterogeneity, secretion stress, and signal peptide–substrate–translocon matching (Trends in Biotechnology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2024.02.011) (hartmann2024singlecelltechnologies pages 17-17).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- B. subtilis secretion zones and kinetics: In Bacillus, secretion zones appear in a subset of cells under AmyE overexpression (e.g., ~19% of B. subtilis cells in stationary phase exhibited visible peripheral puncta), persist for minutes, and show small lateral displacements (∼70 nm per 60 s frame) in the cell wall; lysozyme treatment converted >90% of cells to spheroplasts and removed most envelope‑associated fluorescence, indicating wall association (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 3-7, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- SecA single‑molecule dynamics in B. subtilis: Diffusion coefficients partitioned as Dstatic ≈ 0.03–0.04 μm2/s, Dmobile ≈ 0.11–0.15 μm2/s, and Dfree ≈ 0.60–0.70 μm2/s; the static (putative translocon‑bound) fraction increased from ~21% (WT) to ~29% under AmyE overproduction, with bi‑exponential dwell times τ1 ≈ 0.24 s and τ2 ≈ 0.43–0.45 s (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Energetic contribution of PMF: In vivo PMF accelerates Sec‑dependent export beyond ATP‑alone reconstitutions in vitro (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
- Structural/functional visualization: High‑speed AFM directly visualized single SecYEG–SecA‑mediated translocation events and nucleotide‑dependent SecA domain changes, demonstrating sufficiency of one SecYEG–SecA unit for transport (Nat. Commun., 2025; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54875-x) (kanaoka2025afmobservationof pages 9-10).

Functional annotation for secY (B. subtilis 168)
- Primary function: Channel subunit of the SecYEG translocon that conducts unfolded polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane (secretion) and supports insertion of transmembrane segments of membrane proteins. Substrates are signal peptide–bearing preproteins (secretory) or nascent TM helices (membrane proteins) (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 1-2, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
- Partners and pathway: Operates as SecYEG with SecA ATPase, frequently in concert with accessory factors such as SecDF (PMF‑coupled enhancer) and YidC (insertase/chaperone) in bacteria (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3). In B. subtilis, SecA and SecDF dynamics increase under high secretion load, supporting increased SecYEG engagement (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Localization: Plasma (cytoplasmic) membrane of B. subtilis; organism‑specific imaging places secretion events at discrete, long‑lived zones within the Gram‑positive cell wall beyond the membrane translocation step (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 3-7, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Mechanism and energetics: Post‑translational translocation is driven by SecA ATPase cycles that advance substrate through SecY via helicase‑like motions; co‑translational insertion is mediated by SRP‑ribosome targeting. PMF enhances translocation efficiency/velocity in vivo (PNAS, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2208070120; Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (dong2023structuralbasisof pages 1-2, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).

Organism‑specific insights (Bacillus subtilis 168)
- SecA/SecDF dynamics and secretion zones during high production: Bacillus cells show heterogeneity; secretion zones are spatially discrete and long‑lived in the cell wall; SecA’s static fraction increases under load, consistent with more SecYEG engagement (BMC Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-023-01684-1) (strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 3-7, strach2023proteinsecretionzones pages 14-16).
- Process implications: Secretion heterogeneity and stress responses are key for industrial strain/process design; single‑cell analyses provide actionable levers (Trends in Biotechnology, 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2024.02.011) (hartmann2024singlecelltechnologies pages 17-17).

Limitations and open questions
- While mechanistic principles are well‑established, quantitative partitioning of ATP vs PMF contributions and accessory factor roles (e.g., SecDF, YidC) in Gram‑positive bacteria in vivo remain areas of active study, as highlighted by expert analyses (Open Biology, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.230166) (allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 12-13, allen2023aunifyingmechanism pages 2-3).
