description: >-
  SecY is the central channel-forming subunit of the bacterial SecYEG protein translocase complex.
  It forms a heterotrimeric complex with SecE and SecG that constitutes the core protein-conducting
  channel in the cytoplasmic membrane. SecY consists of 10 transmembrane helices organized into
  two halves (TMs 1-5 and TMs 6-10) that form a lateral gate, which can open to allow insertion
  of transmembrane segments into the lipid bilayer. The channel is sealed by a pore ring of
  hydrophobic residues and a plug helix on the extracellular side. SecY functions in two modes:
  (1) post-translational translocation of secretory proteins driven by the SecA ATPase, and
  (2) co-translational insertion of membrane proteins via the SRP (signal recognition particle)
  pathway. In B. subtilis, SecY localizes to the plasma membrane and is found in detergent-resistant
  membrane domains (membrane rafts), where it interacts with the flotillin homolog FloT. SecY is
  essential for protein secretion and membrane protein biogenesis in bacteria.

    summary: >-
      SecY is an integral membrane protein with 10 transmembrane helices that localizes to the
      cytoplasmic (plasma) membrane of B. subtilis. UniProt reports cell membrane localization
      based on experimental evidence from PMID:23651456, which demonstrated SecY presence in the
      B. subtilis membrane.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core annotation for SecY. The protein is an integral component of the plasma
      membrane where it forms the protein-conducting channel of the Sec translocon. The deep
      research confirms SecY is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane, and UniProt cites
      experimental evidence (PMID:23651456) for cell membrane localization. IBA inference is
      consistent with extensive biochemical and structural data across bacteria.

  review:
    summary: >-
      SecY binds to signal sequences on preproteins during translocation. The signal sequence
      interacts with the lateral gate of SecY, which can open to release transmembrane segments
      into the lipid bilayer.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a core molecular function of SecY. Signal sequence binding is integral to SecY's
      role in recognizing and translocating secretory proteins. Structural studies have shown
      that signal sequences interact with the lateral gate region of SecY between TMs 2 and 7.
      The deep research confirms that substrates are signal peptide-bearing preproteins.

    label: SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, translocation
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      SecY participates in co-translational protein targeting via the SRP pathway. The ribosome-nascent
      chain complex is targeted to SecYEG by SRP and its receptor, and SecY mediates insertion of
      transmembrane segments into the membrane.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is a well-established function of SecY. While post-translational translocation (SecA-dependent)
      is the dominant mode for secretory proteins, membrane protein insertion is typically co-translational
      and SRP-dependent. SecY functions as the translocon in both pathways. The deep research explicitly
      states that co-translational insertion is mediated by SRP-ribosome targeting.

      While SecY is involved in protein targeting as part of the translocation machinery, this
      term is quite general. The more specific terms like GO:0043952 (protein transport by the
      Sec complex) and GO:0006616 (SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting) are more
      informative. This annotation is not wrong but represents a higher-level categorization
      rather than a core specific function.

      This annotation is supported by experimental evidence in B. subtilis. UniProt cites
      PMID:23651456 which demonstrated that SecY is present in detergent-resistant membrane
      fractions (bacterial membrane rafts) and interacts with FloT. While membrane rafts are
      a secondary localization relative to plasma membrane, this is a valid specific annotation.
