description: >-
  SpoVD is a sporulation-specific class B penicillin-binding protein (PBP) that functions as a
  D,D-transpeptidase essential for spore cortex peptidoglycan synthesis during Stage V of
  sporulation. It works as a cognate pair with SpoVE (a SEDS-family glycosyltransferase) to
  polymerize and crosslink cortex peptidoglycan at the outer forespore membrane. SpoVD is
  expressed exclusively in the mother cell compartment under sigmaE control with SpoIIID repression.
  The protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane helix, a PBP dimerization domain, a catalytic
  transpeptidase domain with the conserved active-site serine, and a unique C-terminal PASTA domain.
  Disruption of spoVD results in cortex-less, heat-sensitive spores (asporogenous phenotype).
  Unlike FtsI (septum) or MrdA (elongation), SpoVD is dedicated exclusively to sporulation and
  does not participate in vegetative cell wall synthesis or cell shape regulation.

      SpoVD localizes to the cell membrane during sporulation. UniProt annotates SpoVD as a
      peripheral membrane protein associated with the cell membrane. The deep research indicates
      SpoVD accumulates at the outer forespore membrane during cortex synthesis.

      The plasma membrane annotation is correct. SpoVD is membrane-associated via its N-terminal
      transmembrane region and localizes to the outer forespore membrane during Stage V sporulation.

      This annotation derives from the "Protease" keyword in UniProt. While SpoVD has peptidase-like
      activity (cleaving D-Ala-D-Ala bonds), calling it "proteolysis" is misleading. SpoVD is a

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from the "Cell shape" keyword in UniProt. However, this annotation
      is INCORRECT for SpoVD. SpoVD is a sporulation-specific PBP that functions ONLY during
      spore cortex assembly. It does NOT participate in vegetative cell shape determination.
      Unlike MrdA (elongasome, determines rod shape) or FtsI (divisome, determines septum shape),
      SpoVD is dedicated exclusively to sporulation and has no role in vegetative cell morphology.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      SpoVD does not regulate vegetative cell shape. The "Cell shape" keyword in UniProt is
      erroneously applied based on homology to other PBPs (like MrdA/PBP2 and FtsI/PBP3) that
      do regulate cell shape. However, SpoVD is sporulation-specific and is expressed only in
      the mother cell during Stage V sporulation. It synthesizes spore cortex peptidoglycan,
      not vegetative cell wall. The disruption phenotype is asporogenous (no cortex, heat-sensitive
      spores), not cell shape defects. This represents an over-generalization from the PBP family.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from EC number mapping (EC 3.4.16.4). UniProt assigns this EC to
      SpoVD based on the catalytic mechanism. The enzyme cleaves D-Ala-D-Ala bonds via a serine
      active site as part of the transpeptidation reaction for peptidoglycan crosslinking.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This is the most specific molecular function term for the enzymatic activity. While the
      PRIMARY function is transpeptidation (crosslinking), the mechanism involves D-Ala-D-Ala
      cleavage via a serine active site. This term accurately captures the catalytic mechanism.
      Note that there is no GO term for "peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase activity" (only L,D
      exists as GO:0071972), so this carboxypeptidase term is the best available approximation.

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase activity
    proposed_definition: >-
      Catalysis of the crosslinking of peptidoglycan peptide stems via D,D-transpeptidation,
      forming peptide cross-bridges between adjacent glycan strands. The reaction involves
      cleavage of a D-Ala-D-Ala bond and formation of a new peptide bond.
    justification: >-
      Currently only GO:0071972 (peptidoglycan L,D-transpeptidase activity) exists.
      D,D-transpeptidases like SpoVD, FtsI, and MrdA are distinct enzymes with different
      substrate specificities and are major contributors to peptidoglycan crosslinking.

suggested_questions:
  - question: >-
      What is the functional significance of the PASTA domain in SpoVD, and does it contribute
      to substrate recognition or localization during cortex synthesis?
    experts: []
  - question: >-
      Are there any conditions under which SpoVD might contribute to vegetative cell wall
      synthesis, or is its function strictly limited to sporulation?
    experts: []
suggested_experiments:
  - hypothesis: >-
      The PASTA domain of SpoVD is required for proper localization to the outer forespore
      membrane or for substrate recognition during cortex synthesis.
    description: >-
      Generate PASTA domain deletion mutants of SpoVD and assess localization using GFP fusions
      and cortex formation by electron microscopy and heat resistance assays.
    experiment_type: genetic/microscopy
  - hypothesis: >-
      SpoVD has D,D-transpeptidase activity that can be demonstrated biochemically.
    description: >-
      Purify recombinant SpoVD and test for transpeptidase activity using synthetic peptidoglycan
      precursor substrates, monitoring crosslink formation by mass spectrometry.
