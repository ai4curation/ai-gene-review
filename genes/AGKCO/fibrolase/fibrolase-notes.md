# Fibrolase Research Notes

## Overview

Fibrolase is a snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead) venom that exhibits direct fibrinolytic activity. This protein has been extensively studied for its potential as a therapeutic fibrinolytic agent and was developed into a recombinant analog called alfimeprase for clinical applications.

## Core Function and Mechanism

### Metalloproteinase Activity
Fibrolase is a zinc metalloproteinase that belongs to the venom metalloproteinase (M12B) family, P-I subfamily [PMID:1304358 "Fibrolase is composed of 203 residues in a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 22,891, as determined by the sequence. Its sequence is homologous to the sequence of the hemorrhagic toxin Ht-d of Crotalus atrox venom and with the sequences of two metalloproteinases from Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom"]. The enzyme requires zinc for its catalytic activity and structural integrity [PMID:1898066 "the enzyme is a metalloproteinase since it is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline and tetraethylenepentamine (a specific zinc chelator). Metal analysis revealed 1 mol of zinc/mol of protein"].

### Direct Fibrinolytic Mechanism
Unlike many other fibrinolytic agents, fibrolase exhibits direct fibrinolytic activity and does not require activation of plasminogen [PMID:1898066 "The enzyme exhibits direct fibrinolytic activity and does not activate plasminogen. In vitro studies revealed that fibrolase dissolves clots made either from purified fibrinogen or from whole blood"]. This direct action makes it particularly attractive as a therapeutic agent because it bypasses the complex plasminogen activation cascade.

## Specific Fibrinolytic Activity

### Cleavage Specificity
Fibrolase demonstrates specific cleavage preferences characteristic of snake venom metalloproteinases. The enzyme shows preferential cleavage at X-Leu bonds [PMID:1898066 "Study of cleavage site preference of the fibrinolytic enzyme using the oxidized B chain of insulin revealed that specificity is similar to other snake venom metalloproteinases with cleavage primarily directed to an X-Leu bond"]. Specific cleavage sites include 14-Ala-|-Leu-15 in insulin B chain and 413-Lys-|-Leu-414 in the alpha-chain of fibrinogen.

### Non-hemorrhagic Properties
A remarkable feature of fibrolase is its lack of hemorrhagic activity, which distinguishes it from many other snake venom metalloproteinases [PMID:1898066 "Interestingly, unlike some other venom fibrinolytic metalloproteinases, fibrolase exhibits little if any hemorrhagic activity"]. This property makes it more suitable for therapeutic applications as it reduces the risk of bleeding complications.

### Selective Activity Profile
Fibrolase shows no activity against a series of chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrates, indicating its selective substrate specificity [PMID:1898066 "The enzyme shows no activity against a series of chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrates"].

## Clinical Applications (Alfimeprase)

### Recombinant Development
Alfimeprase is a recombinant analog of fibrolase that was developed for clinical use [PMID:11369866 "The disulfide structure of alfimeprase, a recombinant analog of fibrolase, was experimentally determined"]. This recombinant version maintains the fibrinolytic properties of the native enzyme while being produced in a controlled manufacturing environment.

### Clinical Indications
Alfimeprase was investigated as a treatment for various thrombotic conditions [PMID:18632486 "Alfimeprase, a recombinant fibrinolytic zinc metalloprotease, has shown promising clinical utility in blood clot lysis in patients with CVC occlusions and peripheral arterial occlusions"]. The agent received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency for evaluation in acute peripheral arterial occlusions [PMID:18632486 "Based on the encouraging data, alfimeprase has received orphan drug designation from the Food and Drug Administration and the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency for the evaluation of acute peripheral arterial occlusions as a potential indication"].

### Central Venous Catheter Occlusion
One of the primary clinical applications studied was the treatment of central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions, which are common in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [PMID:18632486 "Central venous catheter (CVC) occlusion occurs frequently and remains a significant clinical problem in patients with cancer receiving infusional or intravenous chemotherapy"]. Alfimeprase showed promise in dissolving these occlusive clots.

### Clinical Trial Outcomes
Despite initial promise, alfimeprase ultimately failed phase III clinical trials for the treatment of arterial occlusive disease and acute ischemic stroke. This represents a significant setback in the translation of this snake venom-derived therapeutic from bench to bedside.

## Substrate Specificity

### Primary Substrates
The primary physiological substrate for fibrolase is fibrin/fibrinogen, where it cleaves specific peptide bonds to dissolve blood clots [PMID:1898066 "In vitro studies revealed that fibrolase dissolves clots made either from purified fibrinogen or from whole blood"]. The enzyme can act on both purified fibrinogen and whole blood clots, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex biological environments.

### Cleavage Pattern Analysis
Detailed analysis using insulin B chain as a model substrate revealed the enzyme's preference for leucine at the P1' position (the amino acid immediately C-terminal to the cleavage site) [PMID:1898066 "Study of cleavage site preference of the fibrinolytic enzyme using the oxidized B chain of insulin revealed that specificity is similar to other snake venom metalloproteinases with cleavage primarily directed to an X-Leu bond"].

## Structural Features

### Primary Structure
Fibrolase is composed of 203 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain with a calculated molecular weight of 22,891 Da [PMID:1304358 "Fibrolase is composed of 203 residues in a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 22,891, as determined by the sequence"]. The N-terminus is blocked by a cyclized glutamine (pyroglutamic acid) residue [PMID:1304358 "The amino-terminus is blocked by a cyclized glutamine (pyroglutamic acid) residue"].

### Disulfide Bond Pattern
The protein contains six cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds critical for structural stability [PMID:1304358 "All six cysteine residues in fibrolase are involved in disulfide bonds"]. The disulfide connectivity was definitively established for the recombinant analog alfimeprase as Cys-116/196, Cys-156/180, and Cys-158/163 [PMID:11369866 "The three disulfide bonds were determined to be Cys-116/196, Cys-156 /180, and Cys-158/163 with the residue number system of alfimeprase"].

### Secondary Structure Prediction
Structural analysis reveals that fibrolase has very low alpha-helical content (4%) but significant beta-structure (39.5%) [PMID:1304358 "Secondary structure prediction reveals a very low percentage of alpha-helix (4%), but much greater beta-structure (39.5%)"]. This structural composition is consistent with its classification as a metalloproteinase.

### Glycosylation Status
The protein contains little or no carbohydrate and lacks asparagine-linked glycosylation sites [PMID:1898066 "contains little or no carbohydrate"]. Analysis revealed the absence of consensus N-glycosylation sequences (asparagine-X-serine/threonine) [PMID:1304358 "Analysis of the sequence reveals the absence of asparagine-linked glycosylation sites defined by the consensus sequence: asparagine-X-serine/threonine"].

### Sequence Microheterogeneity
Natural fibrolase exhibits microheterogeneity at both the N-terminus and at positions 189 and 192 [PMID:1304358 "Microheterogeneity in the sequence was found at both the amino-terminus and at residues 189 and 192"], suggesting natural variations in the venom extract.

## Inhibitors and Regulation

### Metal Chelation Inhibition
As a zinc metalloproteinase, fibrolase is sensitive to metal chelators. The enzyme is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline, and tetraethylenepentamine (a specific zinc chelator) [PMID:1898066 "the enzyme is a metalloproteinase since it is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline and tetraethylenepentamine (a specific zinc chelator)"]. This sensitivity to metal chelators is consistent with zinc being essential for both catalytic activity and structural integrity.

### Resistance to Serine Protease Inhibitors
Fibrolase is not inhibited by classical serine protease inhibitors including diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Trasylol [PMID:1898066 "is not inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, soybean trypsin inhibitor, Trasylol"]. This resistance profile confirms its classification as a metalloproteinase rather than a serine protease.

### Thiol Group Independence
The enzyme is not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate, indicating that free thiol groups are not essential for its activity [PMID:1898066 "is not inhibited by... p-chloromercuribenzoate"], suggesting that the disulfide bonds provide sufficient structural stability.

### Zinc Requirement
The absolute requirement for zinc is demonstrated by the complete loss of activity upon zinc removal and the restoration of activity upon zinc repletion. Metal analysis confirmed that fibrolase contains exactly 1 mol of zinc per mol of protein [PMID:1898066 "Metal analysis revealed 1 mol of zinc/mol of protein"].

## Medical Significance and Therapeutic Potential

### Advantages as a Fibrinolytic Agent
Fibrolase represents a unique approach to thrombolytic therapy due to several key advantages:

1. **Direct Action**: Unlike plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), fibrolase acts directly on fibrin without requiring the plasminogen activation cascade [PMID:1898066 "The enzyme exhibits direct fibrinolytic activity and does not activate plasminogen"].

2. **Non-hemorrhagic Profile**: The lack of hemorrhagic activity reduces the risk of bleeding complications that are common with other thrombolytic agents [PMID:1898066 "unlike some other venom fibrinolytic metalloproteinases, fibrolase exhibits little if any hemorrhagic activity"].

3. **Specific Substrate Recognition**: The enzyme shows selectivity for fibrin substrates over other proteins, potentially reducing off-target effects.

### Clinical Development Challenges
Despite its promising properties, the clinical development of alfimeprase faced significant challenges. The failure of phase III clinical trials highlights the complexity of translating promising preclinical results into successful clinical outcomes. Factors that may have contributed to clinical failure include:

1. **Immunogenicity**: As a foreign protein, alfimeprase may have triggered immune responses that limited its efficacy or safety.

2. **Pharmacokinetics**: The in vivo behavior of the recombinant protein may have differed from expectations based on in vitro studies.

3. **Clinical Trial Design**: The specific patient populations, dosing regimens, or outcome measures may not have been optimally designed to demonstrate efficacy.

### Historical Context in Thrombolytic Therapy
The development of alfimeprase occurred during a period when the thrombolytic therapy field was seeking alternatives to urokinase, which had been withdrawn from the market due to manufacturing issues [PMID:18632486 "Urokinase has been used as a thrombolytic agent for dysfunctional occluded CVCs, but the alterations in manufacturing practice prompted the Food and Drug Administration to suspend further production of urokinase in 1999"]. This created a clinical need for new fibrinolytic agents with improved safety profiles.

### Research Significance
From a research perspective, fibrolase has provided important insights into:

1. **Structure-Function Relationships**: The detailed structural characterization has advanced understanding of metalloproteinase catalysis and specificity.

2. **Venom Biology**: Fibrolase represents an example of how evolution has optimized enzymes for specific biological functions.

3. **Drug Development**: The alfimeprase story illustrates both the potential and the challenges of developing venom-derived therapeutics.

## Summary

Fibrolase is a fascinating example of a snake venom component that has been extensively characterized and developed for therapeutic applications. Its unique combination of direct fibrinolytic activity without hemorrhagic effects made it an attractive candidate for treating thrombotic conditions. While the clinical development of alfimeprase ultimately was unsuccessful, the extensive research on fibrolase has contributed significantly to our understanding of metalloproteinase structure and function, as well as the challenges of developing venom-derived therapeutics. The protein remains an important model system for studying fibrinolytic enzymes and continues to provide insights into the design of improved thrombolytic agents.
