description: 'Laccase enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of anthraquinone derivatives as part of the Pks1 gene cluster involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis. Functions downstream of the polyketide synthase Pks1 and dehydratase EthD to produce mature conidial pigments that provide protection against UV radiation, heat, and cold stress. Contains three plastocyanin-like domains and binds four copper ions essential for its oxidoreductase activity.'
