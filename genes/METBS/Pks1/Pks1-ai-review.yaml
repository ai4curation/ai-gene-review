  label: Metarhizium brunneum ARSEF 3297
description: Type I non-reducing polyketide synthase that produces anthraquinone-derived pigments essential for conidial pigmentation and environmental stress resistance. Contains modular domains (SAT-KS-MAT-PT-ACP-ACP-TE) that iteratively condense acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA units to form 1-acetyl-2,4,6,8-tetrahydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone, which is further processed by EthD and Mlac1 to generate mature conidial pigments that protect against UV radiation and temperature extremes.

    label: catalytic activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Too general for a multifunctional enzyme with specific polyketide synthase activity. Should use more specific molecular function terms.

    label: fatty acid synthase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: Incorrect annotation. PKS1 is a polyketide synthase, not a fatty acid synthase. While both use similar chemistry, they produce different products (aromatic polyketides vs fatty acids).
