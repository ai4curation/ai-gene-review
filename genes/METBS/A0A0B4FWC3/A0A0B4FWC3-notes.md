# MBR_10393 (A0A0B4FWC3) Notes

## Gene Overview
- **Gene**: MBR_10393
- **Protein**: Sesquiterpene synthase (BTPSL - Bacterial Terpene Synthase-Like protein)
- **Organism**: Metarhizium brunneum strain ARSEF 3297
- **UniProt**: A0A0B4FWC3

## Function Summary
Based on UniProt entry, this protein is a sesquiterpene synthase with the following characteristics:

### Enzymatic Activity
- **EC numbers**: 4.2.3.163 and 4.2.3.171
- **Substrate**: (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP)
- **Products**: 
  - Major product: corvol ether B [PMID:31239482, UniProt entry]
  - Secondary product: corvol ether A [PMID:31239482, UniProt entry]
  - Minor products: traces of epizonarene, gamma-cadinene, delta-cadinene, alpha-cadinene, alpha-cadinol, and an unidentified sesquiterpene [PMID:31239482, UniProt entry]

### Cofactor Requirements
