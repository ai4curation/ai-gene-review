description: Sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes the conversion of (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate to multiple sesquiterpene products, primarily corvol ethers A and B. This bacterial-origin enzyme was acquired through horizontal gene transfer and produces sesquiterpenes important for fungi-environment interactions.

    label: isoprenoid biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: This term is too broad. The enzyme specifically produces sesquiterpenes, not general isoprenoids.

  review:
    summary: Correct but should be more specific - this is a sesquiterpene synthase with EC 4.2.3.163 and 4.2.3.171.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: While mechanistically accurate (cleaves phosphate bonds), the specific sesquiterpene synthase term better represents this characterized enzyme.
