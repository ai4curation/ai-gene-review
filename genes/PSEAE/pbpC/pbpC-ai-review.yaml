description: >
  PbpC (also known as PBP3x or PBP3a, encoded by PA2272) is a class B high-molecular-mass
  penicillin-binding protein (HMM bPBP) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is a membrane-anchored
  protein with an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a periplasmic D,D-transpeptidase domain
  containing the conserved SXXK/SXN/KT(S)G motifs characteristic of penicillin-binding proteins.
  PbpC is a nonessential paralog of the essential septal transpeptidase PBP3 (FtsI/PbpB).
  Unlike PBP3, pbpC knockout causes no detectable growth or morphology defects under standard
  laboratory conditions. PbpC is expressed only during stationary phase and shows low/conditional
  expression. While it binds penicillin in labeling assays, there is no direct experimental
  evidence for specific enzymatic activity, and its physiological role remains unclear.
  Overexpression of pbpC does not alter beta-lactam susceptibility, in contrast to PBP3.

      This annotation is INCORRECT for PbpC. It is derived from InterPro domain mapping

      PbpC is a Class B penicillin-binding protein (monofunctional D,D-transpeptidase),
      NOT a Class A PBP. Peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase activity is characteristic
      of Class A PBPs, which are bifunctional enzymes possessing both transpeptidase

      using reporter fusions or RNA-seq
    hypothesis: pbpC expression is regulated by stationary phase sigma factors
  - description: >
      Genetic interaction analysis: Test for synthetic phenotypes when pbpC is deleted in
      combination with other nonessential PBPs
    hypothesis: PbpC has functional redundancy with other nonessential PBPs
