## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9I1K1
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Probable peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase PbpC {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.4.16.4 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080}; AltName: Full=PBP3x {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9045804}; AltName: Full=Penicillin-binding protein 3 homolog {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9045804}; Short=PBP3 homolog {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9045804};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pbpC {ECO:0000303|PubMed:9045804}; OrderedLocusNames=PA2272 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:AAG05660.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain ATCC 15692 / DSM 22644 / CIP 104116 / JCM 14847 / LMG 12228 / 1C / PRS 101 / PAO1).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the transpeptidase family. FtsI subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Bact_Transpept/Beta-Lactamase. (IPR050515); Beta-lactam/transpept-like. (IPR012338); FtsI_transpept. (IPR037532); PBP_dimer. (IPR005311); PBP_dimer_sf. (IPR036138)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pbpC" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain ATCC 15692 / DSM 22644 / CIP 104116 / JCM 14847 / LMG 12228 / 1C / PRS 101 / PAO1).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pbpC' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pbpC** (gene ID: pbpC, UniProt: Q9I1K1) in PSEAE.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research plan status: All objectives completed. We verified identity and organism, assembled primary and recent literature, collected applications and expert analyses with quantitative data, and synthesized the following report.

Gene/protein verification
- Target: pbpC (PA2272) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 encodes PBP3x/PBP3a, a class B high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein (HMM bPBP) homologous to FtsI/PBP3. It is membrane-anchored via an N‑terminal transmembrane segment with a periplasmic D,D‑transpeptidase domain harboring conserved SXXK/SXN/KT(S)G motifs, consistent with UniProt Q9I1K1 and early cloning/biochemical work (pbpC ≡ PBP3x) (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 128-133, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 133-138).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Functional class: PBP3x/PBP3a (pbpC) is a class B PBP predicted to catalyze D,D‑transpeptidation in peptidoglycan (PG) cross‑linking. In P. aeruginosa, PBP3 (ftsI/pbpB) is the essential septal transpeptidase for cell division; PBP3x is a nonessential paralog under standard conditions (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 3-5, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 128-133, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 133-138).
- Cellular localization: PBP3x is an inner‑membrane protein whose catalytic domain is periplasmic. Fractionation of recombinant pbpC supported membrane association; hydropathy analysis predicted a single N‑terminal transmembrane helix (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 128-133).
- Relationship to PBP3/FtsI: Both are PBP3‑like bPBPs; however, PBP3 (ftsI) sits in a division/PG operon and is essential for septal PG synthesis, whereas pbpC is genetically separate, low/conditional expression, and dispensable in lab growth (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 133-138, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 3-5).

2) Experimentally supported function, activity, and localization for pbpC (PBP3x)
- Enzymatic activity inference: pbpC encodes a penicillin‑binding protein containing conserved transpeptidase motifs and binds penicillin in labeling assays, consistent with a D,D‑transpeptidase. Direct kinetic substrate specificity was not reported; inference rests on domain conservation and penicillin binding (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 133-138).
- Essentiality: Chromosomal insertional inactivation of pbpC caused no detectable growth or morphology defects under assay conditions, indicating nonessentiality; physiological penicillin labeling did not detect PBP3x, consistent with low/conditional expression (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128).
- Beta‑lactam susceptibility impact: Overexpression or presence of pbpC did not alter susceptibility to PBP3‑targeting beta‑lactams in tested P. aeruginosa backgrounds, in contrast with PBP3 (pbpB) overexpression that elevated MICs 2–8× (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 143-147, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128).
- Localization: Membrane fractionation plus predicted N‑terminal TM segment indicate inner‑membrane anchor with periplasmic catalytic domain (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 128-133).

3) PBP3/FtsI in P. aeruginosa as reference for pbpC’s role
- Essentiality and septal function: Conditional deletion of ftsI/PBP3 caused filamentation and division arrest; growth required PBP3 expression, establishing it as the principal septal transpeptidase (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 14-16).
- Quantitative susceptibility shifts upon PBP3 depletion: MICs decreased by 4× (imipenem), 2× (doripenem), 8× (cefepime, cefsulodin, ceftazidime), 4× (piperacillin), 8× (aztreonam), and 32× (penicillin G) in the conditional ftsI mutant (PA14 background) (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 14-16).
- PBP3 overexpression and MICs: A 7× increase in PBP3 raised MICs by 2× (aztreonam), 4× (cefepime), and 8× (ceftazidime, cefsulodin), consistent with target titration; expression of E. coli pbpB in P. aeruginosa had similar effects (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 143-147).

4) Recent developments (2023–2024) on PBP3 targeting, structures, and occupancy
- Whole‑cell PBP occupancy profiling (PAO1): Aztreonam selectively inactivated PBP3 (~50% PBP3 occupancy at 1/2×MIC, 30 min). Cephalosporins preferentially targeted PBP1a and PBP3; AmpC hyperexpression reduced occupancy of penicillins/cephalosporins/aztreonam, while OprM efflux loss improved occupancy, aligning with MIC changes (2023) (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 95-103).
- PBP3 variants and fitness/resistance: In PAO1, specific PBP3 (ftsI) catalytic‑domain variants increased MICs to meropenem, ceftazidime, and cefepime, but not imipenem or piperacillin; many variants caused filamentation and reduced growth, implying fitness costs (2024) (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 7-8).
- Structural/kinetic insights for P. aeruginosa PBP3: Comparative inhibitor studies and crystallography revealed analogous acyl‑enzyme products for cefiderocol, ceftazidime, and cefepime with PBP3, and a relative reactivity order with PBP3 (meropenem > cefepime > ceftazidime ≈ cefiderocol) (2024) (basu2024cefiderocolsusceptibilityendows pages 1-2).
- Cefepime/zidebactam (beta‑lactam enhancer approach): Against MDR P. aeruginosa panels, cefepime/zidebactam achieved MIC90 16 mg/L; in a neutropenic murine lung model, a simulated human regimen achieved ≥1 log10 kill even for isolates with PBP2/PBP3 alterations. Zidebactam reduced cefepime’s fT>MIC requirement from 47–68% to 8–16% (2023) (hujer2023transcendingthechallenge pages 1-2).

5) Current applications and implementations
- Aztreonam-based therapy: Aztreonam selectively targets PBP3 in P. aeruginosa whole cells and achieves ~50% occupancy at sub-MIC exposure; its clinical pairing with avibactam addresses co-produced serine β‑lactamases, restoring activity against MBL‑producing pathogens (2023 profiling) (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 95-103).
- Cefiderocol: Clinically approved siderophore cephalosporin exhibiting PBP3 engagement in P. aeruginosa; structural/kinetic work details binding chemistry at PBP3 and indicates comparable PBP3 acylation to ceftazidime but less than meropenem/cefepime (2024 structural study) (basu2024cefiderocolsusceptibilityendows pages 1-2).
- Cefepime/zidebactam: Preclinical and translational data support activity against MDR P. aeruginosa, including strains with PBP alterations; PK/PD synergy lowers cefepime exposure needed for killing in vivo (2023) (hujer2023transcendingthechallenge pages 1-2).

6) Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- PBP3 as prime P. aeruginosa PBP target: Multi‑PBP knockout analysis concluded PBP3 is essential and the most attractive PBP target; other HMM PBPs were dispensable or had minor effects (2017) (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3).
- PBP‑mediated resistance in ESKAPE: Reviews emphasize the growing role of PBP alterations in Gram‑negatives and highlight PBP3’s essentiality and druggability in P. aeruginosa (2023) (sethuvel2023βlactamresistancein pages 5-7).

7) Statistics and quantitative data
- PBP3 depletion MIC decreases (fold): imipenem 4×, doripenem 2×, cefepime/cefsulodin/ceftazidime 8×, piperacillin 4×, aztreonam 8×, penicillin G 32× (PA14) (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 14-16).
- PBP3 overexpression MIC increases (fold): aztreonam 2×, cefepime 4×, ceftazidime 8×, cefsulodin 8×; pbpC overexpression or deletion had no detectable MIC effect under conditions tested (PAO4089 and derivatives) (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 143-147, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128).
- Whole‑cell PBP occupancy: aztreonam ~50% PBP3 inactivation at 1/2×MIC after 30 min; cephalosporins show PBP1a/PBP3 preference; AmpC hyperexpression reduces occupancy, OprM loss increases it—trends concordant with MICs (2023) (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 95-103).

Interpretation for pbpC (PBP3x) and knowledge gaps
- The gene symbol pbpC in P. aeruginosa PAO1 unambiguously denotes PBP3x/PBP3a (PA2272). Experimental evidence supports membrane localization and penicillin binding, but indicates low/conditional expression and nonessentiality under standard conditions, with no measurable contribution to beta‑lactam susceptibility in the reported lab assays (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 128-133).
- By contrast, the paralog ftsI/pbpB encodes essential PBP3 with central septal TPase function and strong influence on beta‑lactam susceptibility and cell division (chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-3, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 14-16, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 143-147).
- Recent 2023–2024 advances on PBP3 inhibition and resistance clarify drug–target interactions and resistance trade‑offs but provide little new pbpC‑specific physiology; thus, functional annotation of pbpC relies primarily on sequence/domain inference and historical genetic/biochemical characterization.

Conclusions
- pbpC (PA2272; PBP3x/PBP3a) is a membrane-anchored bPBP with penicillin-binding, consistent with a D,D‑transpeptidase; it is nonessential and appears conditionally expressed with no demonstrable impact on β‑lactam susceptibility in standard lab conditions. PBP3 (ftsI/pbpB) is the essential septal transpeptidase driving division and is the dominant PBP3-like determinant of β‑lactam susceptibility and a validated antipseudomonal drug target. Recent data refine PBP3 drug targeting/structures and reinforce the centrality of PBP3 over PBP3x in current clinical applications (liao1996characterizationofthe pages 119-128, liao1996characterizationofthe pages 143-147, chen2017penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 14-16, hujer2023transcendingthechallenge pages 1-2, basu2024cefiderocolsusceptibilityendows pages 1-2, glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 7-8, sethuvel2023βlactamresistancein pages 5-7).
