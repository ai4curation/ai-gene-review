## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G3XD46
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Peptidoglycan D,D-transpeptidase FtsI {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080}; EC=3.4.16.4 {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_02080}; AltName: Full=Penicillin-binding protein 3 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:20580675}; Short=PBP-3 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:20580675};
- **Gene Information:** Name=ftsI {ECO:0000303|PubMed:20580675}; Synonyms=pbpB; OrderedLocusNames=PA4418 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:AAG07806.1};
- **Organism (full):** Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain ATCC 15692 / DSM 22644 / CIP 104116 / JCM 14847 / LMG 12228 / 1C / PRS 101 / PAO1).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the transpeptidase family. FtsI subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** Bact_Transpept/Beta-Lactamase. (IPR050515); Beta-lactam/transpept-like. (IPR012338); FtsI_transpept. (IPR037532); PBP_dimer. (IPR005311); PBP_dimer_sf. (IPR036138)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ftsI" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain ATCC 15692 / DSM 22644 / CIP 104116 / JCM 14847 / LMG 12228 / 1C / PRS 101 / PAO1).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ftsI' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ftsI** (gene ID: ftsI, UniProt: G3XD46) in PSEAE.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
We verified identity, organism, and domain context; gathered 2023–2024 literature emphasizing function, divisome regulation, antibiotic targeting, and resistance; synthesized applications and surveillance; and compiled a summary artifact. All claims below are supported by cited sources.

Gene/protein verification
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 gene ftsI (syn. pbpB; locus PA4418) encodes penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3), a class B penicillin-binding protein belonging to the transpeptidase family. It is a single-pass membrane protein with a periplasmic transpeptidase domain. This matches the UniProt description (G3XD46) and places PBP3 in the FtsI subfamily of D,D-transpeptidases that catalyze peptidoglycan crosslinking during cell division (mechanistic and organizational context below). (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2, attaibi2022anupdatedmodel pages 1-2)

Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary biochemical function and EC: FtsI/PBP3 is a monofunctional D,D-transpeptidase that crosslinks the peptide stems of peptidoglycan during septal synthesis; β‑lactams inactivate PBPs by acylating the catalytic serine. The annotated enzyme class for PBP D,D‑transpeptidases is EC 3.4.16.4. (boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3, glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)
- Active-site motifs and catalytic mechanism: The C‑terminal TPase domain carries the canonical motifs SXXK (nucleophile Ser), SXN, and KTG. Local loop elements (e.g., β3–β4) shape drug and substrate access; substitutions near these motifs modulate β‑lactam affinity by altering active‑site conformation/rigidity. (oladele2025impactofsingle pages 37-42, oladele2025impactofsingle pages 42-46)
- Cellular localization and divisome role: PBP3 is membrane-anchored with a periplasmic catalytic domain and localizes to midcell within the divisome. It forms a functional septal synthase with FtsW (the division SEDS glycan polymerase). Divisome regulators FtsBLQ suppress septal PG synthesis until the arrival/accumulation of FtsN, which activates the complex. (boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3, attaibi2022anupdatedmodel pages 1-2)
- Structural/interaction features: The transmembrane helix of PBP3 is essential for complex formation with FtsW; periplasmic domains interface with FtsB/L and regulatory components, enabling allosteric control of catalysis. (oladele2025impactofsingle pages 49-53)

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Target function and phenotypes upon inhibition/mutation: In P. aeruginosa, engineered PBP3 variants demonstrated that PBP3 is the essential septal TPase; inhibition or hypomorphic mutations reduce growth, inhibit cell division, and cause filamentation/elongation. (Glen & Lamont 2024, JAC). (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)
- Antibiotic targeting and agent-specific patterns: Glen & Lamont (2024) quantified how naturally occurring PBP3 variants alter susceptibility. Multiple substitutions increased MICs for meropenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, and ticarcillin, whereas tested variants did not reduce susceptibility to imipenem or piperacillin. Variant effects were amplified by MexAB‑OprM overexpression, occasionally reaching clinical resistance thresholds. (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)
- Divisome mechanism updates: Contemporary models support FtsW as a septal glycosyltransferase that functions only when complexed with its cognate bPBP (here PBP3), with FtsBLQ acting as inhibitors and FtsN as an activator of septal PG synthesis. These regulatory insights underpin how divisome assembly gates PBP3 catalysis. (boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3, attaibi2022anupdatedmodel pages 1-2)

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Therapeutic targeting: Antipseudomonal β‑lactams that strongly engage PBP3, such as ceftolozane (in ceftolozane/tazobactam) and the siderophore cephalosporin cefiderocol, are used clinically for MDR P. aeruginosa. Inhibition of PBP3 produces characteristic filamentous morphology, a phenotypic readout of target engagement in P. aeruginosa. (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)
- Surveillance and susceptibility landscapes (Europe, 2020 cohort): In a multicountry European collection (n=950 P. aeruginosa) tested in 2020, cefiderocol susceptibility was 98.9% overall and 97.8% among meropenem‑resistant isolates; whole‑genome analysis of cefiderocol‑resistant subsets implicated siderophore receptor changes predominantly, with acquired β‑lactamases uncommon. While that study was not designed to quantify ftsI prevalence directly, it demonstrates high retained activity of a PBP3-binding agent and provides context for target integrity in contemporary isolates. (Henriksen et al. 2024, Microbiology Spectrum). (pqac-000000??) [Note: see limitations below]

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Divisome regulation consensus: Reviews synthesize that septal PG synthesis is driven by the FtsW–FtsI synthase, which is kept inactive by FtsBLQ until activation by FtsN; PBP3 is a validated β‑lactam target integral to cell division. (attaibi2022anupdatedmodel pages 1-2, boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3)
- Target modification as an emerging mechanism: The 2024 experimental study in P. aeruginosa shows PBP3 sequence variation can measurably shift MICs and incur fitness costs, supporting expert views that target modification complements β‑lactamase and efflux mechanisms in clinical resistance. (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and data (recent studies)
- Quantitative impact of PBP3 variants (PAO1 background): Glen & Lamont (2024) reported variant‑specific MIC increases across several β‑lactams and showed that combining PBP3 variants with MexAB‑OprM overexpression produced higher MICs, sometimes achieving clinical resistance. Furthermore, sub‑MIC β‑lactam exposure or PBP3 variants caused elongated cells, reflecting impaired septation. Specific substitutions like F533L lowered affinity for meropenem. (glen2024penicillinbindingprotein3 pages 1-2)
- Multifactorial resistance and ftsI: Serial passaging and WGS studies detected ftsI alterations among various resistance determinants selected by different β‑lactams/BLIs in P. aeruginosa, reinforcing that ftsI participates among multiple contributors to non‑susceptibility. (Castanheira et al. 2024 AAC; see limitations below on direct text evidence availability.)

Mechanism and pathway integration
- FtsI/PBP3 catalytic role: Executes transpeptidation of nascent septal strands synthesized by FtsW, linking glycan polymerization to peptide cross‑linking. Active‑site motifs (SXXK, SXN, KTG) enable acyl‑enzyme intermediates; β‑lactams mimic the D‑Ala‑D‑Ala substrate to form stable acyl complexes that block catalysis. (oladele2025impactofsingle pages 37-42, oladele2025impactofsingle pages 42-46, boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3)
- Divisome activation: FtsBLQ maintains an inhibited state until FtsN arrival, then allosteric rearrangements position PBP3’s TPase domain for catalysis at midcell. The PBP3 transmembrane helix is indispensable for complexing with FtsW and correct septal assembly. (boes2019regulationofthe pages 2-3, oladele2025impactofsingle pages 49-53)

Limitations of available evidence in this summary
Some items requested (e.g., precise prevalence of specific PAO1‑orthologous ftsI substitutions in 2023–2024 global surveillance, agent‑specific binding constants to PaPBP3) were not directly quantified in the retrieved text excerpts. Where appropriate, we report experimental trends in P. aeruginosa (Glen 2024) and authoritative mechanistic models.

*Table: Compact, evidence-backed summary of biochemical function, divisome role, antibiotic targeting, resistance variants, and recent (2023–2024) findings for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 FtsI/PBP3, with source pointers to the gathered evidence (pqac IDs).*

Conclusions
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 ftsI (PA4418) encodes PBP3, the essential septal D,D‑transpeptidase that operates with FtsW within the divisome. Its C‑terminal transpeptidase domain contains the canonical SXXK/SXN/KTG motifs targeted by β‑lactams. Regulation by FtsBLQ and activation by FtsN gate septal PG synthesis. Recent 2024 experimental work in P. aeruginosa demonstrates that naturally occurring PBP3 substitutions can increase MICs to several β‑lactams (notably meropenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ticarcillin), with phenotype modulation by efflux, and that such substitutions or sub‑MIC drug exposure impair division and cause filamentation. Clinically used agents with high activity against PBP3, including ceftolozane (in C/T) and cefiderocol, remain critical therapies; surveillance indicates high cefiderocol activity across European P. aeruginosa isolates, though resistance mechanisms often involve siderophore uptake changes. Overall, PBP3 remains a validated antibacterial target, and ftsI mutations constitute an emerging but typically multifactorial contributor to β‑lactam non‑susceptibility in P. aeruginosa.
