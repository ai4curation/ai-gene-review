description: 'FtsI (also known as PBP3/penicillin-binding protein 3) is a class B penicillin-binding protein

  that functions as a monofunctional D,D-transpeptidase essential for septal peptidoglycan synthesis

  during bacterial cell division. It contains a single transmembrane helix anchoring a large

  periplasmic catalytic domain with canonical transpeptidase motifs (SXXK, SXN, KTG). FtsI forms

  a functional complex with FtsW (the SEDS family glycan polymerase) to constitute the septal

  peptidoglycan synthase. Critically, FtsI/PBP3 lacks glycosyltransferase activity - this function

  is provided by FtsW in the complex. The enzyme catalyzes cross-linking of peptidoglycan peptide

  stems during septation and is a validated target of beta-lactam antibiotics. FtsI activity is

  regulated by divisome proteins FtsBLQ (inhibitory) and activated by FtsN accumulation.

- question: 'Should the incorrect GO:0008955 (peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase activity)

    annotation be corrected at the InterPro level for IPR037532? The InterPro entry

    IPR037532 appears to incorrectly associate glycosyltransferase activity with FtsI

    family proteins, propagating this error to GO annotations.

- description: 'Kinetic analysis to quantify the ratio of transpeptidase vs carboxypeptidase

    activity for purified P. aeruginosa FtsI using appropriate peptidoglycan substrate

    analogs. This would demonstrate whether transpeptidation is the predominant activity,

    supporting creation of a specific D,D-transpeptidase GO term.
