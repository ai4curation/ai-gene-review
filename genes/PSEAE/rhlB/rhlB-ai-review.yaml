description: 'ATP-dependent RNA helicase of the DEAD-box family that functions as a core component of the RNA degradosome complex in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. RhlB unwinds structured RNA using ATP hydrolysis, facilitating degradation by RNase E and the 3''-5'' exoribonuclease PNPase. It localizes to membrane-proximal cytoplasmic foci through direct interaction with RNase E via the AR1 motif. RhlB forms a functional complex with PNPase independent of RNase E, acting as the beta subunit for degradation of double-stranded RNA. Essential for mRNA turnover, post-transcriptional regulation, and bacterial virulence in P. aeruginosa.'

  - statement: RhlB deletion stabilizes mRNA by reducing RNase E cleavage activity
    supporting_text: "deleting the gene encoding RhlB stabilizes a lacZ mRNA transcribed by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase... The effect of point mutations inactivating RhlB is comparable with the effect of deleting the gene."
  - statement: RhlB's enzymatic activity is required for its role in mRNA degradation
    supporting_text: "The extent of overproduction of β-galactosidase with these mutants is the same as in the Δ rhlB strain. These results show that the effect on the T7- lacZ mRNA of point mutations that inactivate RhlB is the same as the deletion of the gene. We conclude that the enzymatic activity of RhlB is required for its role in T7- lacZ mRNA degradation."
  - statement: RhlB preferentially targets ribosome-free mRNA for degradation
    supporting_text: "The distinctive features of T7 transcription are the synthesis of long stretches of ribosome-free mRNA due to rapid elongation and the relative insensitivity of the RNA polymerase to transcription termination by Rho... If the RhlB-RNase E pathway in E. coli were involved in the degradation of ribosome-free mRNA, this function would be complementary to transcription termination by Rho."

  - statement: The C-terminal extension of RhlB is necessary and sufficient for RNase E interaction
    supporting_text: "Only RhlB416–517 was able to form a stable interaction with CcNTD1–575, indicating that the CTE of RhlB contains the interaction site for RNase E... when GST-RhlB416–517 was used as bait in a pull down experiment with C. crescentus cell lysate, the known degradosome proteins (RNase E, aconitase and PNPase) were all enriched"
  - statement: RhlB and RNase E form a 2:1 stoichiometric complex in the tetrameric degradosome
    supporting_text: "in the context of the tetrameric CcNTD1–575, it appears that the stoichiometry of this complex is altered to a 2:1 ratio. Given that the tetrameric form of RNase E is expected to be the predominant form of the enzyme in the cell, we would expect the 2:1 ratio of this complex to also be found in vivo."
  - statement: Close proximity of RhlB helicase to RNase E active site enables direct substrate transfer
    supporting_text: "Given that RhlB interacts with the S1 and 5′-sensor domains of CcNTD, the helicase and the active site of RNase E will be in close proximity within the degradosome assembly. Such a close interaction between the RNase E catalytic domain and a DEAD-box helicase has not been shown previously in any organism. It could be imagined that as structured RNA substrates are unwound by RhlB they could be passed directly to the active site of RNase E."
