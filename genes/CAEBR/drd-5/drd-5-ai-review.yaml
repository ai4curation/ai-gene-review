description: >-
  Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family enzyme containing an NAD(P)-binding
  Rossmann-like domain. The gene name "drd-5" indicates "dietary restriction down regulated."
  Based on domain architecture (adh_short PF00106, IPR002347) and phylogenetic placement
  (PANTHER subfamily PTHR43313:SF18), this protein is predicted to function as an
  NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase. The closest characterized ortholog is C. elegans dhs-16,
  which participates in dafachronic acid (steroid hormone) biosynthesis controlling
  dauer/reproductive development via the DAF-12 nuclear receptor pathway. No direct
  experimental characterization exists for this specific C. briggsae protein.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This biological process annotation is inferred from phylogenetic analysis (IBA via PANTHER).
      The annotation is supported by orthology to C. elegans dhs-16, which functions in dafachronic
      acid biosynthesis. However, GO:0008202 (steroid metabolic process) is overly generic - we know
      from the characterized ortholog DHS-16 that the direction is biosynthesis (not catabolism) and
      the product is dafachronic acids (steroid hormones). A more specific term is warranted.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term GO:0008202 (steroid metabolic process) is too generic. Based on orthology to C. elegans
      DHS-16, which specifically functions in dafachronic acid BIOSYNTHESIS (not catabolism), this
      annotation should be replaced with GO:0120178 (steroid hormone biosynthetic process). DHS-16
      contributes to production of DAF-12 ligands (dafachronic acids) that govern dauer vs reproductive
      development [Butcher 2017, Karp 2021].

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      This molecular function annotation is inferred from phylogenetic analysis (IBA via PANTHER).
      The annotation is strongly supported by the protein's domain architecture: adh_short (PF00106),
      NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-like domain (IPR036291), and SDR consensus (IPR020904). SDR family
      enzymes are characterized NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases with hallmark sequence motifs
      including glycine-rich TGxxxGxG cofactor-binding region and active-site YxxxK catalytic motif
      [Graff 2019, Gabrielli 2022]. While oxidoreductase activity is accurate, a more specific
      molecular function term such as "3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity" would be
      preferable if substrate specificity were experimentally confirmed.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is accurate and well-supported by domain architecture. All SDR family enzymes
      function as oxidoreductases catalyzing reversible carbonyl-alcohol transformations using
      NAD(P) cofactors [Graff 2019]. The term "oxidoreductase activity" (GO:0016491) is appropriately
      conservative given no direct experimental characterization of this protein's specific substrates
      or reaction mechanism. A more specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase term would require
      experimental validation.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This molecular function annotation is derived from UniProtKB keyword mapping (IEA). The
      UniProt entry for A8Y332 contains the keyword "Oxidoreductase" (KW-0560) based on domain
      analysis, which is automatically mapped to GO:0016491. This represents the same annotation
      as the IBA above but derived through a different evidence pathway (keyword mapping vs
      phylogenetic inference). The annotation is valid and consistent with domain architecture.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The IEA annotation is accurate and consistent with the IBA annotation for the same term.
      The UniProtKB keyword "Oxidoreductase" is appropriately assigned based on the SDR domain
      architecture (adh_short PF00106). While this creates a duplicate annotation with IBA, both
      evidence sources independently support the oxidoreductase activity. Retaining both is
      acceptable as they represent independent lines of evidence (sequence-based keyword mapping
      vs phylogenetic inference).

      Proposed new annotation based on synthesis of domain architecture and orthology evidence.
      GO:0016229 (steroid dehydrogenase activity) is more specific than GO:0016491 (oxidoreductase
      activity) and is supported by: (1) orthology to C. elegans DHS-16, a characterized steroid
      dehydrogenase in the dafachronic acid pathway, and (2) phylogenetic placement in PANTHER
      subfamily PTHR43313:SF18 with characterized steroidogenic SDRs. This term captures the
      inferred substrate class (steroids) while remaining appropriately broad given lack of
      direct experimental characterization.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      Synthesis of evidence supports more specific annotation than the existing GO:0016491.
      The ortholog DHS-16 in C. elegans acts on steroid substrates in dafachronic acid biosynthesis.
      ISS evidence via sequence similarity to characterized ortholog is appropriate.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Proposed new annotation based on orthology to C. elegans DHS-16. GO:0120178 (steroid hormone
      biosynthetic process) is more specific than GO:0008202 (steroid metabolic process) and
      reflects the known role of the ortholog DHS-16 in dafachronic acid (steroid hormone)
      biosynthesis. Dafachronic acids are ligands for the DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor that
      controls dauer vs reproductive development in nematodes.

      The ortholog DHS-16 functions specifically in biosynthesis (not catabolism) of dafachronic

    description: >-
      Catalyzes NAD(P)-dependent oxidation of 3-beta-hydroxysteroids to 3-oxosteroids, predicted
      to function in dafachronic acid biosynthesis based on orthology to C. elegans DHS-16.
      Dafachronic acids (CHEBI:78698) are 3-oxo cholestanoid hormones that act as ligands for the
      DAF-12 nuclear receptor. The biosynthetic reaction converts 3-beta-hydroxy steroid precursors
      to 3-oxosteroid products via NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenation at the C3 position. The SDR
      family catalytic mechanism employs a conserved Tyr residue as general acid/base and Lys in
      proton relay.
