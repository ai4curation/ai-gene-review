  label: Cereibacter sphaeroides
description: 'DorR (also known as Regulatory protein VirG) is a transcriptional regulator that controls photosynthetic gene expression in response to oxygen and light conditions. It acts as a redox-sensitive repressor of photosynthetic genes under aerobic conditions and integrates signals through interactions with the anti-repressor AppA. DorR contains response regulator and DNA-binding domains typical of two-component regulatory systems.'
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0000156
    label: phosphorelay response regulator activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: 'Based on UniProt domains (Response regulatory domain 6-119) and research showing DorR functions as a response regulator in two-component systems, this annotation is accurate. DorR receives phosphoryl groups and regulates transcription.'
    action: ACCEPT

    label: phosphorelay signal transduction system
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'DorR participates in two-component regulatory systems that respond to environmental signals (oxygen, light). Research confirms it integrates multiple signals including redox state and light through protein interactions.'

    label: transcription cis-regulatory region binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: 'Research confirms DorR binds directly to promoter regions of photosynthetic genes, recognizing specific palindromic sequences. UniProt shows OmpR/PhoB-type DNA-binding domain (132-232).'
    action: ACCEPT
- term:
    id: GO:0003677
    label: DNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Too general. DorR has specific transcriptional regulatory DNA binding activity. The more specific GO:0000976 (transcription cis-regulatory region binding) is already annotated and more informative.'

    label: cytoplasm
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: 'Supported by UniProt subcellular location data. Research confirms cytoplasmic localization appropriate for transcriptional regulator accessing nucleoid DNA.'
    action: ACCEPT
- term:
    id: GO:0005829
    label: cytosol
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: 'Cytosol is a more specific term than cytoplasm and is appropriate for a soluble transcriptional regulator. Both are acceptable but cytosol is more precise.'
    action: ACCEPT
- term:
    id: GO:0006355
    label: regulation of DNA-templated transcription
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'Core function of DorR confirmed by extensive research. Acts as transcriptional repressor of photosynthetic genes under aerobic conditions. Should be more specific about negative regulation.'
    action: MODIFY
    proposed_replacement_terms:
    - id: GO:0045892
      label: negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription
- term:

    label: protein-DNA complex
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000118
  review:
    summary: 'DorR forms complexes with DNA when binding to promoter regions. Research shows it likely functions as dimers binding to palindromic sequences, forming protein-DNA complexes.'
