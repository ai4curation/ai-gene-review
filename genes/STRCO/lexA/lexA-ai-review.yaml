  label: Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2)
description: 'LexA repressor (SCO5803) is the master regulator of the bacterial SOS response in Streptomyces coelicolor. It functions as a homodimeric transcriptional repressor that binds to specific 16-bp palindromic SOS box sequences (consensus motif: tCGAAC-N4-GNNCGa) in promoter regions to repress DNA damage response genes during normal conditions. The N-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, while the C-terminal domain harbors the autoproteolytic cleavage site. Upon DNA damage and single-stranded DNA accumulation, RecA forms nucleoprotein filaments that stimulate LexA autocatalytic cleavage at the Ala-Gly bond (EC 3.4.21.88), disrupting its DNA-binding capability and leading to derepression of the SOS regulon. LexA also responds to chromosome supercoiling stress, with expression increasing under altered topoisomerase activity. Beyond DNA repair, LexA influences secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces, serving as a master regulator that integrates environmental stress signals with developmental processes.'
