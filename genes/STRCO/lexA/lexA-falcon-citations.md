In the presence of single-stranded DNA, RecA interacts with LexA causing an autocatalytic cleavage which disrupts the DNA-binding part of LexA, leading to derepression of the SOS regulon and eventually DNA repair.\nSubunit: Homodimer.\n======================\n\nProvide a comprehensive report covering function, localization, processes, domains, disease associations, expression, conservation, and relevant GO terms.\n\nIMPORTANT: Focus specifically on the gene identified by the metadata above, particularly the UniProt ID, locus tag, and protein description if provided.\n\nSometimes different genes in the same organism have the same name.
