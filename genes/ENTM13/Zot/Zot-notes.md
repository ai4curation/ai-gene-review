# Zot/G1P Gene Review Notes

## Colleague Question
**Contact**: cholera@jhu.edu
**Key Issue**: Is this really the "zonula occludens toxin" from V. cholerae?

## Key Findings

### The Great Misannotation Story
- **NOT a toxin!** Gene 1 protein (G1P) is a phage assembly factor
- Historical confusion with V. cholerae CTXφ phage
- No toxin activity ever demonstrated for G1P
- "Zot" name persists despite being wrong

### Actual Function: Phage Assembly
1. **Membrane adhesion zones**:
   - Creates contact sites between inner/outer membranes
   - Works with G4P (Gene 4 protein)
   - Essential for phage extrusion
   - ATP-dependent process

2. **Assembly mechanism**:
   - Walker A motif for ATP binding
   - Forms membrane-spanning complex
   - Allows virion passage without lysis
   - Two isoforms (G1P and G11P from Met-300)

3. **NOT involved in**:
   - Tight junction disruption
   - Intestinal permeability
   - Diarrheal disease
   - Any toxin activity

### History of the Confusion
- 1991: CTXφ phage discovered in V. cholerae
- Gene homologous to M13 gene I called "zot"
- Assumed to have toxin function (never proven)
- Name stuck despite lack of evidence
- Real cholera toxin is ctxAB (well characterized)

## GO Annotation Review
- Accepted ATP binding (Walker A motif)
- Accepted viral extrusion process
- Accepted host cell membrane location
- NO toxin-related annotations

## Structural Biology
- Walker A nucleotide binding motif
- Membrane-spanning domains
- G4P interaction interface
- Similar to other filamentous phage assembly proteins

## Key Publications
- [PMID:6254849] - M13 genome sequence
- [PMID:1653215] - CTXφ discovery (source of confusion)
- [PMID:8901420] - Debunking toxin activity
- [PMID:19946136] - Phage assembly mechanism

## Why This Matters
- Textbook example of annotation propagation error
- Shows danger of functional inference from names
- Highlights need for experimental validation
- Important for understanding cholera pathogenesis

## Remaining Questions
- Why did toxin annotation persist so long?
- What is actual structure of G1P-G4P complex?
- Can assembly mechanism inform nanoengineering?
- Are there other misnamed "toxins" in phages?

## Applications
- Phage display technology
- Membrane protein engineering
- Continuous evolution systems
- NOT for toxin/antitoxin research!
