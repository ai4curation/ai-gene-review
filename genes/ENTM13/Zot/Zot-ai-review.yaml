description: 'Gene 1 protein (G1P) is an essential phage assembly factor, NOT a toxin
  despite historical confusion with zonula occludens toxin (Zot). This protein plays
  a crucial role in M13 bacteriophage assembly by increasing adhesion zones between
  inner and outer bacterial membranes where phage extrusion occurs. The name confusion
  arose because early Vibrio cholerae phage CTXφ research incorrectly attributed toxin
  activity to a homologous gene. G1P works with G4P to create membrane-spanning complexes
  that serve as assembly/extrusion sites. The protein has two isoforms from alternative
  initiation: full-length G1P and shorter G11P (starting at Met-300).'
