  label: Inovirus M13
description: 'Gene 1 protein (G1P) is an essential phage assembly factor, NOT a toxin despite historical confusion with zonula
  occludens toxin (Zot). This protein plays a crucial role in M13 bacteriophage assembly by increasing adhesion zones between
  inner and outer bacterial membranes where phage extrusion occurs. The name confusion arose because early Vibrio cholerae
  phage CTXÏ† research incorrectly attributed toxin activity to a homologous gene. G1P works with G4P to create membrane-spanning
  complexes that serve as assembly/extrusion sites. The protein has two isoforms from alternative initiation: full-length
  G1P and shorter G11P (starting at Met-300).'
