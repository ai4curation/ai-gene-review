description: Exoglucanase 1 (cellobiohydrolase I, CBHI) is a major secreted cellulase
  that processively hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose from chain ends, releasing cellobiose
  units. It contains a GH7 catalytic domain with a tunnel-shaped active site and a
  cellulose-binding module connected by a glycosylated linker. CBHI is the most abundantly
  produced enzyme during growth on cellulose, comprising ~50% of secreted protein,
  and is tightly regulated by XYR1 (positive) and CRE1 (negative) transcription factors.

    summary: This is a broad parent term that is correct but non-specific. The more

  review:
    summary: While technically correct, this is too general. CBHI specifically degrades
      cellulose, not polysaccharides in general. Should use GO:0030245 (cellulose
      catabolic process).

  review:
    summary: This term is appropriate as cellulose is a beta-1,4-glucan. However,
      GO:0030245 (cellulose catabolic process) is more specific and preferred for
      this enzyme.
