  label: Pectobacterium phage ZF40
description: Aca2 repressor from bacteriophage ZF40 that functions as a dual transcriptional and translational
  repressor of the acrIF8-aca2 operon. This 116 amino acid protein forms homodimers and uses its N-terminal
  helix-turn-helix domain to bind specific DNA inverted repeats in the operon promoter, blocking RNA polymerase
  access. Additionally, Aca2 binds conserved RNA stem-loops in the mRNA to inhibit ribosome access. This
  dual regulatory mechanism ensures tight control of anti-CRISPR (AcrIF8) expression during phage infection,
  preventing toxic overexpression while allowing sufficient production to evade host CRISPR-Cas immunity.
  The protein is essential for phage viability, as uncontrolled AcrIF8 expression is detrimental to both
  phage replication and host cell fitness.

    label: DNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct but too general. Aca2 is specifically a sequence-specific DNA-binding
      transcription factor that recognizes inverted repeat operator sequences in the acrIF8-aca2 promoter
      through its N-terminal HTH domain. The protein binds as a homodimer to regulate transcription.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Correct annotation supported by experimental evidence. Aca2 binds conserved RNA stem-loops
      on the acrIF8-aca2 mRNA to block ribosome access and inhibit translation. This RNA-binding function,
      mediated by the same HTH domain that binds DNA, provides a second layer of regulatory control beyond
      transcriptional repression.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation has minimal support. While crystallographic structures show Mg2+ bound at
      position 92, this appears to be a crystallization artifact rather than a functionally relevant metal-binding
      site. There is no evidence that metal binding is required for Aca2's repressor function.
