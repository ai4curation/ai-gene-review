  label: Pectobacterium phage ZF40
description: Aca2 repressor from bacteriophage ZF40 that functions as a dual transcriptional
  and translational repressor of the acrIF8-aca2 operon. This 116 amino acid protein
  forms homodimers and uses its N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain to bind specific
  DNA inverted repeats in the operon promoter, blocking RNA polymerase access. Additionally,
  Aca2 binds conserved RNA stem-loops in the mRNA to inhibit ribosome access. This
  dual regulatory mechanism ensures tight control of anti-CRISPR (AcrIF8) expression
  during phage infection, preventing toxic overexpression while allowing sufficient
  production to evade host CRISPR-Cas immunity. The protein is essential for phage
  viability, as uncontrolled AcrIF8 expression is detrimental to both phage replication
  and host cell fitness.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is correct but too general. Aca2 is specifically a sequence-specific
      DNA-binding transcription factor that recognizes inverted repeat operator sequences
      in the acrIF8-aca2 promoter through its N-terminal HTH domain. The protein binds
      as a homodimer to regulate transcription.

    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Correct annotation supported by experimental evidence. Aca2 binds conserved
      RNA stem-loops on the acrIF8-aca2 mRNA to block ribosome access and inhibit
      translation. This RNA-binding function, mediated by the same HTH domain that
      binds DNA, provides a second layer of regulatory control beyond transcriptional
      repression.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation has minimal support. While crystallographic structures
      show Mg2+ bound at position 92, this appears to be a crystallization artifact
      rather than a functionally relevant metal-binding site. There is no evidence
      that metal binding is required for Aca2's repressor function.
