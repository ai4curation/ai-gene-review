  label: Pectobacterium phage ZF40
description: >-
  Aca2 repressor from bacteriophage ZF40 that functions as a dual transcriptional and translational
  repressor of the acrIF8-aca2 operon. This 116 amino acid protein forms homodimers and uses its
  N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain to bind specific DNA inverted repeats in the operon promoter,
  blocking RNA polymerase access. Additionally, Aca2 binds conserved RNA stem-loops in the mRNA to
  inhibit ribosome access. This dual regulatory mechanism ensures tight control of anti-CRISPR (AcrIF8)
  expression during phage infection, preventing toxic overexpression while allowing sufficient production
  to evade host CRISPR-Cas immunity. The protein is essential for phage viability, as uncontrolled AcrIF8
  expression is detrimental to both phage replication and host cell fitness.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct but too general. Aca2 is specifically a sequence-specific DNA-binding
      transcription factor that recognizes inverted repeat operator sequences in the acrIF8-aca2 promoter
      through its N-terminal HTH domain. The protein binds as a homodimer to regulate transcription.

        Aca2 is a dimer that represses the expression of the acrIF8–aca2 operon, and that this autoregulation is mediated through binding to inverted repeats in the promoter region

  review:
    summary: >-
      Correct annotation supported by experimental evidence. Aca2 binds conserved RNA stem-loops
      on the acrIF8-aca2 mRNA to block ribosome access and inhibit translation. This RNA-binding
      function, mediated by the same HTH domain that binds DNA, provides a second layer of
      regulatory control beyond transcriptional repression.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation has minimal support. While crystallographic structures show Mg2+ bound at
      position 92, this appears to be a crystallization artifact rather than a functionally
      relevant metal-binding site. There is no evidence that metal binding is required for
      Aca2's repressor function.
