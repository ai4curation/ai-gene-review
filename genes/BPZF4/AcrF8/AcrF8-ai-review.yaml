description: 'Anti-CRISPR protein AcrF8 (AcrIF8) is a 92-amino acid protein encoded by temperate bacteriophage ZF40 that infects Pectobacterium carotovorum. It functions as a potent inhibitor of the host Type I-F CRISPR-Cas immune system through a unique mechanism that involves binding to both the Cas7f protein backbone and directly contacting the crRNA within the surveillance complex (Csy complex). This dual-targeting strategy physically blocks R-loop formation and prevents target DNA recognition. AcrF8 expression is tightly regulated via co-transcription with its dedicated repressor Aca2, forming a self-limiting negative feedback loop that ensures rapid deployment during infection followed by swift repression.'

  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is too general for AcrF8. While it correctly captures that AcrF8 suppresses host immunity, it misses the specific mechanism of CRISPR-Cas inhibition. A more precise term would be GO:0098672 (symbiont-mediated suppression of host CRISPR-cas system), which specifically describes the function of anti-CRISPR proteins.'

proposed_new_terms:
  - proposed_name: CRISPR RNA binding anti-CRISPR activity
    proposed_definition: A molecular function that directly binds to the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) component within a CRISPR-Cas surveillance complex, thereby preventing the crRNA from base-pairing with target DNA and blocking CRISPR-Cas-mediated immunity. This is distinct from anti-CRISPR proteins that only bind to Cas protein components.
    justification: Current GO terms for anti-CRISPR activity do not distinguish between proteins that bind only to Cas proteins versus those that directly interact with the crRNA. AcrF8 represents a unique class of anti-CRISPR proteins that directly contact the RNA component of the surveillance complex, which is mechanistically distinct and evolutionarily significant. This dual protein-RNA binding strategy provides a more robust inhibition mechanism that is harder for hosts to overcome through mutation.

- question: How does AcrF8's dual protein-RNA binding strategy provide evolutionary
    advantages over anti-CRISPRs that only target protein components?
- question: What structural features enable AcrF8 to specifically recognize and bind
    the crRNA within the Csy complex?
- question: How do phages coordinate expression of multiple anti-CRISPR proteins like
    AcrF8 and ACA2 during infection?
