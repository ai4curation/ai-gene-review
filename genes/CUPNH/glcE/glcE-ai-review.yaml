  id: NCBITaxon:381666
  label: Cupriavidus necator H16
description: GlcE encodes a subunit of the glycolate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.1.99.14)
  in Cupriavidus necator, a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium. This enzyme catalyzes
  the initial oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate, which is central to glycolate
  metabolism and phosphoglycolate salvage pathways. The protein functions as part
  of the glcDEF operon, where it operates in concert with other subunits to form a
  multi-component enzyme complex essential for carbon assimilation under autotrophic
  conditions. Deletion studies demonstrate that glcE is critical for efficient growth
  on glycolate-based substrates and maintaining metabolic homeostasis during carbon
  utilization.

- term:
    id: GO:0071949
    label: FAD binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This is a duplicate of GO:0050660 (flavin adenine dinucleotide binding)
      which refers to the same molecular function. Both terms describe FAD binding
      capability
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is redundant with GO:0050660 which covers the same FAD
      binding function. GO:0050660 (flavin adenine dinucleotide binding) is the more
      complete and descriptive term and should be retained instead
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: glcE-falcon-research
      supporting_text: Glycolate dehydrogenase subunits typically require FAD as a
        cofactor for the oxidative conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate [same function
        as GO:0050660]

    label: catalytic activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This is a very general term that provides little functional information.
      GlcE has specific glycolate dehydrogenase activity which is much more informative
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The term 'catalytic activity' is too general and uninformative. The specific
      molecular function 'glycolate dehydrogenase activity' (GO:0019154) already
      captures the precise catalytic function of glcE

    label: (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000003
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on incorrect EC number mapping (EC 1.1.3.15).
      GlcE is actually part of glycolate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.1.99.14) with
      different electron acceptor specificity
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This is a duplicate of the first annotation with the same issue - incorrect
      EC number classification. GlcE functions as glycolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.14),
      not as a 2-hydroxy-acid oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) which uses oxygen as electron
      acceptor

    label: oxidoreductase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This is a correct but general annotation. GlcE does function as an oxidoreductase
      as part of the glycolate dehydrogenase complex, but the more specific term
      is preferable
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While this is a broad term, it is factually correct - glcE is part of
      an oxidoreductase complex that catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate. This general
      term can be retained alongside the more specific glycolate dehydrogenase activity

    - reference_id: glcE-falcon-research

  review:
    summary: This annotation correctly captures the specific molecular function of
      glcE as a component of the glycolate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.1.99.14)
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the most accurate and specific molecular function annotation
      for glcE. It precisely describes the enzymatic activity of the glycolate dehydrogenase
      complex that glcE is part of, reflecting the correct EC number 1.1.99.14
