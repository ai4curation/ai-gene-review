description: Hsp14 (Saci_1665) is a 126-amino acid (14.3 kDa) small heat shock protein
  (sHSP) of the alpha-crystallin/Hsp20 family from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon
  Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In this organism, which lacks Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp100,
  Hsp14 fills a critical gap in the chaperone pathway by acting as a substrate shuttle
  between the holdase sHSPs and the group II chaperonin (thermosome/Hsp60). The Hsp14
  dimer is the active form that binds aggregation-prone substrates and forms hetero-oligomers
  with Hsp20 at elevated temperatures (50-70 degrees C). Hsp14 then directly interacts
  with Hsp60 via an enthalpy-driven mechanism to transfer captured substrates for
  ATP-dependent refolding, functionally replacing the Hsp70 system found in most other
  organisms.

  review:
    summary: Hsp14 shuttles sHSP-captured unfolded substrates to the thermosome (Hsp60)
      for ATP-dependent refolding, filling the role of the absent Hsp70. Direct physical
      interaction between Hsp14 and Hsp60 was demonstrated by ITC (enthalpy-driven).
    action: NEW
    reason: Hsp14 transfers aggregation-prone substrates from sHSPs to Hsp60 for
      refolding, which is the defining activity of GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier
      activity). This is the most distinctive function of Hsp14.

  description: Hsp14 functions as an unfolded protein carrier that shuttles aggregation-prone
    substrates captured by sHSPs (Hsp14 and Hsp20) to the group II chaperonin (thermosome/Hsp60)
    for ATP-dependent refolding. This carrier activity fills the role normally played
    by Hsp70 in organisms that possess it. Hsp14 directly interacts with Hsp60 via
    an enthalpy-driven physical interaction to accomplish substrate transfer.
