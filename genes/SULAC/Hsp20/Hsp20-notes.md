# Hsp20 (Saci_0922, Q4JA95) - Research Notes

## Overview

Hsp20 is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) of the alpha-crystallin/Hsp20 family from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon *Sulfolobus acidocaldarius*. It is 173 amino acids (19.9 kDa). Together with Hsp14 and Hsp60 (group II chaperonin/thermosome), Hsp20 constitutes the core chaperone machinery of *S. acidocaldarius*, which lacks Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp100.

2. **Lipid binding** (GO:0008289) - Interacts with membrane lipids via hydrophobic interaction, stabilizes membranes [PMID:30293966]

## Biological Processes

1. **Response to heat** (GO:0009408) - Upregulated under heat shock and other stresses [PMID:32562000, PMID:37516156]
2. **Protein folding** (GO:0006457) - Participates in the sHSP pathway preventing aggregation [PMID:30293966, PMID:34637594]
3. **Negative regulation of protein aggregation** - Prevents stress-induced protein aggregation [PMID:30293966]
4. **Membrane stabilization** - Lowers propensity of lipid phase transition, stabilizes membranes under stress [PMID:30293966]

## Cellular Component
