    15157 / NCIMB 11770)
description: Hsp20 (Saci_0922) is a 173-amino acid (19.9 kDa) small heat shock protein
  (sHSP) of the alpha-crystallin/Hsp20 family from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon
  Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. It exhibits remarkable oligomeric plasticity, existing
  as a ~24-mer at room temperature that shifts to higher oligomeric forms at elevated
  temperature and low pH, while the dimer is the functional substrate-binding conformation.
  Hsp20 protects against stress-induced protein aggregation and additionally interacts
  with membrane lipids via hydrophobic interactions to stabilize membranes by lowering
  the propensity of lipid phase transitions. Together with Hsp14 and the group II
  chaperonin (thermosome/Hsp60), Hsp20 constitutes the core chaperone machinery of
  S. acidocaldarius, which lacks Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp100.

    label: unfolded protein binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:30293966
  review:
    summary: Hsp20 binds unfolded and aggregating substrate proteins in its dimeric
      active form. The ~24-mer is a storage form and the dimer is the active substrate-binding
      conformation, with oligomeric plasticity regulated by the hydrophobic microenvironment.
    action: NEW
    reason: Hsp20 directly binds aggregating substrate proteins as demonstrated by
      in vitro chaperone activity assays showing the dimer as the functional conformation.

    label: unfolded protein binding
  description: Hsp20 binds unfolded and aggregating substrate proteins in its dimeric
    active form, preventing stress-induced protein aggregation. The hydrophobic
    microenvironment regulates its oligomeric plasticity, with the ~24-mer serving
    as a storage form and the dimer as the active substrate-binding conformation.
    Hsp20 functions primarily as a holdase, with captured substrates subsequently
    transferred via Hsp14 to the thermosome (Hsp60) for ATP-dependent refolding.

suggested_questions:
- question: What is the physiological significance of Hsp20 in secretory vesicles -
    does it stabilize vesicle membranes or protect cargo proteins?
- question: Does Hsp20 have holdase activity independent of the Hsp14-mediated transfer
    pathway, or are all captured substrates ultimately routed through Hsp14 to the
    thermosome?
