description: >-
  SlrP (Salmonella leucine-rich repeat protein) is a type III secretion system (T3SS)
  effector protein in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. It belongs to the
  LRR-containing bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligase family (IpaH-like) and contains an
  N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain that mediates target recognition and a C-terminal
  NEL (novel E3 ligase) domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase catalytic activity (Cys-546 is
  the catalytic residue). SlrP is secreted via both SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SS into host cells,
  where it ubiquitinates host thioredoxin (TXN) in the cytosol, leading to decreased
  TXN activity and increased host cell death (PMID:19690162). It also targets the ER
  lumenal chaperone ERdj3 (DNAJB11), interfering with ERdj3's binding to denatured
  substrates (PMID:20335166). SlrP is a virulence factor, not a chaperone.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IEA annotation for extracellular region from UniProt subcellular location
      mapping. SlrP is secreted via T3SS into the host cell, so it passes through
      the extracellular space during delivery.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Acceptable. SlrP is secreted via T3SS. UniProt annotates it as "Secreted"
      based on ISS evidence. The protein is translocated into host cells via the
      secretion apparatus.

      IEA annotation for transferase activity from UniProt keyword mapping. This is
      a broad parent of ubiquitin-protein transferase activity.
    action: ACCEPT

      Correct but very broad. The more specific terms GO:0004842 and GO:0061630 are

      SlrP is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm via T3SS (PMID:20335166).
    action: ACCEPT

      SlrP is annotated as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase in UniProt with EC 2.3.2.27.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-

  review:
    summary: >-
      IPI annotation for protein binding showing interaction with ERdj3 (DNAJB11,
      Q9UBS4). SlrP binds ERdj3 via its leucine-rich repeat domain and interferes
      with ERdj3's chaperone function (PMID:20335166).
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Protein binding (GO:0005515) is uninformative. The interaction with ERdj3 is
      real but the generic term does not convey the functional significance. The
      interaction is part of SlrP's virulence mechanism targeting the host ER
      chaperone ERdj3 for functional disruption.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IPI annotation for unfolded protein binding based on interaction with ERdj3
      (Q9UBS4). However, SlrP does not bind unfolded proteins itself. Rather, SlrP
      binds the chaperone ERdj3 and interferes with ERdj3's ability to bind denatured
      substrates (PMID:20335166). The "unfolded protein binding" annotation appears to
      be a misannotation -- SlrP disrupts chaperone function, it does not itself bind
      unfolded proteins in a chaperone-like manner.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. SlrP does not bind unfolded proteins. The paper
      (PMID:20335166) shows that SlrP binds ERdj3 (a chaperone) and interferes with
      ERdj3's binding to a denatured substrate. The IPI with/from column shows Q9UBS4
      (ERdj3/DNAJB11), which is a folded chaperone protein, not an unfolded protein.
      The annotation confuses SlrP's interaction with a chaperone with binding to
      unfolded proteins. SlrP is a virulence factor/E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets
      specific host proteins (thioredoxin, ERdj3) for functional disruption, not a
      protein that binds unfolded substrates.

      IDA annotation for negative regulation of protein binding. SlrP interferes
      with ERdj3's ability to bind denatured substrates (PMID:20335166). This

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This accurately describes the functional consequence of SlrP-ERdj3 interaction:
      SlrP negatively regulates ERdj3's protein binding (chaperone) activity. This is
      a documented virulence mechanism (PMID:20335166).

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: >-
      Protein binding (GO:0005515) is uninformative. The interaction with thioredoxin
      is real but the generic term does not capture the functional significance -- SlrP
      binds TXN as an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate. The ubiquitin ligase activity
      annotations already capture this function more informatively.
