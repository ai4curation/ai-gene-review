description: QsuB (Cgl2330) is a small 122-residue protein originally annotated as 'uncharacterized protein' in C. glutamicum but identified by expert analysis as a putative 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase. According to research colleague findings, this enzyme may catalyze the conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate to protocatechuate, providing an alternative route to protocatechuate production from the shikimate pathway. This represents a potentially novel enzymatic activity that bypasses the typical chorismate pathway for aromatic compound biosynthesis, though experimental validation is needed to confirm the proposed function.
