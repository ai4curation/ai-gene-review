  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: hprA encodes hydroxypyruvate reductase (EC 1.1.1.29), also known as glycerate
  dehydrogenase (GDH) or HPR-A, a NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase that plays a central
  role in the serine cycle of methylotrophy. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible reduction
  of 3-hydroxypyruvate (produced by serA) to D-glycerate, which is the second step
  of the serine cycle. HprA can utilize both NADH and NADPH as electron donors and
  functions as a homodimer in the cytoplasm. Beyond its role in the serine cycle,
  HprA may also participate in C2 metabolism by interconverting glyoxylate and glycolate
  (glyoxylate reductase activity). The enzyme belongs to the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid
  dehydrogenase family and contains NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domains. HprA has
  been extensively characterized biochemically, with protein sequencing and kinetic
  studies confirming its function as a key enzyme in formaldehyde assimilation via
  the serine pathway.

      also use NADPH). Characterized biochemically with protein purification and kinetic
      analysis. [file:METEA/hprA/hprA-uniprot.txt, "Purification and characterization

  review:
    summary: This accurately describes the enzymatic mechanism - HprA acts on the
      carbonyl group of hydroxypyruvate (which is in equilibrium with its hydrated
      gem-diol form having CH-OH groups) using NAD or NADP as electron acceptor. The
      enzyme uses both NAD and NADP. [file:METEA/hprA/hprA-uniprot.txt, "Uses both

  review:
    summary: HprA requires NAD(P) as a cofactor and contains NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold
      domains for cofactor binding. This is a valid supporting molecular function.

core_functions:
- description: HprA catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of 3-hydroxypyruvate
    to D-glycerate, the second step of the serine cycle for formaldehyde assimilation.
    This reaction follows the serA-catalyzed oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate and produces
    glycerate that is subsequently phosphorylated by gck. The enzyme functions as
    a homodimer in the cytoplasm and can utilize both NADH and NADPH as electron donors.
    HprA plays a central role in carbon assimilation during methylotrophic growth,
    channeling one-carbon units from methanol through the serine cycle into cellular
    biomass. The enzyme may also have glyoxylate reductase activity, potentially participating
    in C2 metabolism by interconverting glyoxylate and glycolate.
