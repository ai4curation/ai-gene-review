  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: Acyl-CoA ligase component (mllBC fusion) of the methylolanthanin biosynthetic
  pathway. This fusion protein combines asbD and asbE homolog functions, catalyzing
  condensation of 4-hydroxybenzoyl moieties with polyamine linkers during lanthanophore
  biosynthesis. Part of the mll gene cluster (META1p4129-4138) required for lanthanide
  acquisition via metallophore synthesis.

  review:
    summary: Incorrect - this EC assignment (6.2.1.26) is wrong. META1p4133 is not
      involved in menaquinone biosynthesis (which requires o-succinylbenzoate-CoA
      ligase). Instead, it catalyzes acyl-transfer reactions with 4-hydroxybenzoyl
      moieties during lanthanophore biosynthesis. Misprediction based on sequence
      similarity to AMP-binding enzymes [file:METEA/mllBC/mllBC-deep-research-perplexity.md]

  review:
    summary: Correct - mllBC fusion protein catalyzes ligase reactions forming amide
      bonds between activated benzoyl-CoA derivatives and polyamine acceptors during
      methylolanthanin synthesis. Homologous to AsbB from petrobactin pathway [file:METEA/mllBC/mllBC-deep-research-perplexity.md]

  review:
    summary: Correct - catalyzes formation of amide bonds between carboxyl groups
      of 4-hydroxybenzoate and amino groups of homospermidine polyamines. Part of
      IucA/IucC enzyme family involved in NRPS-independent metallophore biosynthesis

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: Analogous but not specific - mllBC synthesizes methylolanthanin, a LANTHANIDE-chelating
      metallophore (lanthanophore), not an iron-chelating siderophore. The biosynthetic
      logic and enzyme families are conserved (homologous to petrobactin pathway),
      but the product specificity is different. Shows 32-fold upregulation with poorly
      soluble lanthanides [file:METEA/mllBC/mllBC-deep-research-perplexity.md]
