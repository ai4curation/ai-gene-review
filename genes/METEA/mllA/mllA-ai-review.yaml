description: Metallophore synthetase component (mllA) belonging to the IucA/IucC family.
  Functions as an acid-amino acid ligase involved in methylolanthanin biosynthesis.
  Methylolanthanin is a lanthanide-chelating metallophore (lanthanophore) that enables
  bacteria to acquire rare earth elements from the environment, which are essential
  cofactors for lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases.

  review:
    summary: Correct molecular function - IucA/IucC family proteins catalyze ATP-dependent
      formation of amide/ester bonds during metallophore biosynthesis. Function is
      conserved whether product is iron-siderophore or lanthanide-metallophore

    label: siderophore biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: Analogous but not specific - mllA synthesizes methylolanthanin, a LANTHANIDE-chelating
      metallophore (lanthanophore), not an iron-chelating siderophore. The chemistry
      and gene family are analogous to siderophore biosynthesis, but the product chelates
      lanthanides not iron. Based on literature about mll biosynthetic gene cluster
      in M. extorquens AM1. No specific GO term exists for lanthanophore biosynthesis
      yet.
