description: Metallophore synthetase component (mllA) belonging to the IucA/IucC family
  of NRPS-independent siderophore synthetases. Functions as an acid-amino acid ligase
  that catalyzes the initial ATP-dependent condensation step in methylolanthanin biosynthesis,
  linking citrate to modified amino acid substrates. Methylolanthanin is a lanthanide-chelating
  metallophore (lanthanophore) that enables bacteria to acquire rare earth elements
  from the environment, which are essential cofactors for lanthanide-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenases. Part of the mll biosynthetic gene cluster (META1p4129-4138) that
  is highly upregulated (32-fold) in response to poorly bioavailable lanthanides.

  review:
    summary: Correct molecular function - IucA/IucC family proteins catalyze ATP-dependent
      formation of amide/ester bonds during metallophore biosynthesis. Function is
      conserved whether product is iron-siderophore or lanthanide-metallophore. As
      documented in deep research files, mllA catalyzes condensation of citrate with
      modified amino acid nucleophiles through ordered sequential mechanism with citryl-AMP
      intermediate [file:METEA/mllA/mllA-deep-research-cyberian.md]

  review:
    summary: Analogous but not specific - mllA synthesizes methylolanthanin, a LANTHANIDE-chelating
      metallophore (lanthanophore), not an iron-chelating siderophore. The chemistry
      and gene family are analogous to siderophore biosynthesis, but the product chelates
      lanthanides not iron [PMID:39078674]. Deep research confirms mllA is homologous
      to siderophore biosynthesis enzymes but produces lanthanophore for acquiring
      rare earth elements essential for XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases [file:METEA/mllA/mllA-deep-research-perplexity.md].
      No specific GO term exists for lanthanophore biosynthesis yet.
