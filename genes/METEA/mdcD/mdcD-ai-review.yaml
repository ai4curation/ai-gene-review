description: >-
  MdcD is the beta subunit of biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.88),
  a multienzyme complex that catalyzes the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate and CO2.
  Together with MdcE (gamma subunit), MdcD forms the malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase component
  (EC 4.1.1.87) which catalyzes the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP. The enzyme
  is a carboxy-lyase (EC class 4), NOT a ligase (EC class 6). MdcD shares 35% sequence
  identity with the beta subunit of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which has led to
  incorrect IEA annotations suggesting carboxylase/ligase activity. However, MdcD functions
  in malonate catabolism, not fatty acid biosynthesis. The core function is decarboxylation
  of malonyl-ACP as part of the malonate degradation pathway.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. MdcD is annotated by TreeGrafter based on homology to
      PANTHER:PTN002873918, which includes both acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunits and
      malonate decarboxylase beta subunits. MdcD has 35% sequence identity with ACC beta
      subunit but performs the opposite reaction - decarboxylation rather than carboxylation.
      Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) catalyzes ATP + acetyl-CoA + HCO3- = ADP + phosphate
      + malonyl-CoA, while MdcD as part of malonate decarboxylase catalyzes the reverse
      direction: malonate + H+ = acetate + CO2 (EC 4.1.1.88). The UniProt entry explicitly
      names this protein "Malonate decarboxylase, beta-subunit" and it is matched by
      NCBIfam TIGR03133 (malonate_beta) with high confidence [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      Incorrect function assignment due to sequence homology with acetyl-CoA carboxylase
      beta subunit. MdcD is a decarboxylase (carboxy-lyase), not a carboxylase (ligase).
      The PANTHER family PTHR42995 includes both ACC and MDC beta subunits, but the specific
      subfamily SF1 is correctly "MALONATE DECARBOXYLASE BETA SUBUNIT". The TreeGrafter
      annotation appears to have used the broader family annotation rather than the correct
      subfamily annotation.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect. Fatty acid biosynthesis requires malonyl-CoA as a
      building block, produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. MdcD functions in the opposite
      pathway - malonate catabolism - where malonate is decarboxylated to acetate.
      The malonate decarboxylase complex does not participate in fatty acid biosynthesis.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is incorrect and represents the opposite metabolic direction from
      the actual function of MdcD. Malonyl-CoA biosynthesis is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA
      carboxylase which adds CO2 to acetyl-CoA. MdcD, as part of malonate decarboxylase,
      catalyzes decarboxylation (removal of CO2) from malonyl-ACP to form acetyl-ACP.

      function in opposite directions [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: REMOVE

      MdcD catalyzes decarboxylation, not carboxylation. The malonate decarboxylase

      entry. The EC 6.4.1.3 assignment in UniProt (EMBL:ACS37998.1) is erroneous.
      Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent ligase that carboxylates propionyl-CoA
      to form methylmalonyl-CoA. MdcD has no propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity; it is
      a decarboxylase subunit. The correct EC number should be EC 4.1.1.87 (malonyl-S-ACP
      decarboxylase) or EC 4.1.1.88 (biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase) for the
      complex activity [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      The GO_REF:0000003 annotation is based on EC 6.4.1.3 mapping, but this EC number
      is incorrectly assigned to MdcD in UniProt. This is a class-level error: EC 6.x.x.x
      enzymes are ligases, while MdcD is a carboxy-lyase (EC 4.x.x.x). The iRP911 genome-scale
      metabolic model correctly identifies this as EC 4.1.1.89. The NCBIfam annotation
      TIGR03133 (malonate_beta) clearly identifies this as malonate decarboxylase beta subunit.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation comes from InterPro:IPR017556 mapping. While malonate can be
      considered a small organic acid involved in central metabolism, classifying malonate
      decarboxylase as involved in carbohydrate metabolism is somewhat imprecise. Malonate
      is a C3 dicarboxylic acid; its degradation yields acetate which enters central carbon
      metabolism. The annotation is not entirely wrong but is overly broad [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Malonate catabolism produces acetate which enters central carbon metabolism, so
      there is an indirect connection to carbohydrate metabolism. However, this is not
      the core function of MdcD. The term is kept as non-core to reflect the connection
      to general carbon/energy metabolism without implying direct carbohydrate processing.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is based on UniProtKB keyword KW-0808 (Transferase). This keyword
      appears to have been assigned due to homology with carboxyltransferase domains.
      However, MdcD does not function as a transferase; it is a decarboxylase. While the
      protein contains a CoA carboxyltransferase N-terminal domain (PROSITE:PS50980),
      the actual catalytic activity is decarboxylation, not transfer of a carboxyl group
      to an acceptor molecule [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      MdcD is a carboxy-lyase (decarboxylase), not a transferase. Carboxy-lyases remove
      carboxyl groups as CO2, while transferases transfer groups between molecules.
      The presence of a carboxyltransferase domain reflects evolutionary origin from
      carboxyltransferases but does not indicate current transferase activity.

    summary: >-
      This annotation is CORRECT. It comes from InterPro:IPR017556 (Malonate decarboxylase
      beta subunit) mapping. MdcD, together with MdcE, forms the malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase
      (EC 4.1.1.87) which is a carboxy-lyase. The EC 4.1.1 class enzymes are carboxy-lyases
      that catalyze the removal of CO2 from substrates. This correctly reflects the
      molecular function of MdcD [file:METEA/mdcD/mdcD-deep-research-falcon.md].
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Carboxy-lyase activity (GO:0016831) is the appropriate general molecular function
      term for MdcD. The specific activity is malonyl-S-ACP decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.87)
      which falls under the carboxy-lyase class. This annotation correctly captures the
      enzymatic class of MdcD.

      hydrolysis. MdcD is a carboxy-lyase (EC class 4) that catalyzes bond cleavage
