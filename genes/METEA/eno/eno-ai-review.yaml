description: 'eno encodes enolase (EC 4.2.1.11), also known as phosphopyruvate hydratase,
  a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate
  to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway. In the context
  of methylotrophy, enolase plays a critical role downstream of the serine cycle:
  2-phosphoglycerate produced by gck (glycerate kinase) is converted to PEP, which
  can then be used for biosynthesis or further metabolized to pyruvate. The enzyme
  requires two Mg2+ ions for catalysis - one structural Mg2+ that stabilizes the dimer,
  and a second Mg2+ bound via the substrate during catalysis. Enolase belongs to the
  highly conserved enolase family and functions primarily in the cytoplasm, though
  fractions of the enzyme can be found on the cell surface and secreted, where it
  may perform moonlighting functions unrelated to its catalytic activity. The enzyme
  is essential for carbohydrate degradation via glycolysis and represents a key metabolic
  branch point connecting the serine cycle to central metabolism and biosynthetic
  pathways.'

- description: 'Enolase catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent reversible dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate

    the context of methylotrophic metabolism, enolase serves as a critical junction
    connecting the serine cycle to central metabolism: 2-phosphoglycerate produced
    by gck (from the serine cycle) is converted to PEP, which can be used for biosynthesis
    (e.g., aromatic amino acids) or further metabolized to pyruvate for energy production
    and biosynthetic precursors. The enzyme functions as a homodimer in the cytoplasm
    and requires two Mg2+ ions - one for structural stability and one for catalysis.
    By channeling serine cycle output into central metabolism, enolase enables the
    efficient incorporation of C1 units from methanol into cellular biomass and energy
    metabolism.'
