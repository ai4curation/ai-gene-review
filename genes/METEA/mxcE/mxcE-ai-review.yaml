description: mxcE encodes the response regulator component of the MxcQE 
  two-component regulatory system, functioning as a DNA-binding transcriptional 
  activator positioned at the apex of the methanol dehydrogenase regulatory 
  cascade. The protein contains a conserved N-terminal receiver domain with a 
  characteristic (αβ)₅ fold that receives phosphoryl groups from the MxcQ sensor
  kinase on a conserved aspartate residue, and a C-terminal winged 
  helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. Upon phosphorylation, MxcE undergoes 
  conformational changes that promote homodimerization and enhance DNA-binding 
  affinity, enabling it to bind to the mxbDM promoter and activate transcription
  of the second-tier two-component system MxbDM. This hierarchical regulatory 
  architecture (MxcQE → MxbDM → mxa operon) allows integration of environmental 
  signals to control methanol oxidation capacity. MxcE is essential for methanol
  metabolism, as mutants lacking functional MxcE exhibit zero or severely 
  reduced methanol dehydrogenase gene expression.

core_functions:
  - description: MxcE functions as a DNA-binding transcriptional response 
      regulator that activates expression of the mxbDM two-component system 
      genes. Upon receiving a phosphoryl group from the MxcQ sensor kinase on a 
      conserved aspartate residue in its N-terminal receiver domain, MxcE 
      undergoes conformational changes that promote homodimerization and enhance
      DNA-binding affinity. The phosphorylated MxcE dimer binds to the mxbDM 
      promoter region and activates transcription, creating a regulatory cascade
      where MxcE controls the second-tier regulators (MxbDM) which in turn 
      control methanol dehydrogenase gene expression. This hierarchical 
      architecture enables integration of multiple environmental signals.
