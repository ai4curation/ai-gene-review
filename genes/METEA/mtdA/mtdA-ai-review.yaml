  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: 'mtdA encodes a bifunctional NADP-dependent dehydrogenase that catalyzes
  the oxidation of both methylene-H4MPT (EC 1.5.1.-) and methylene-H4F (EC 1.5.1.5)
  to their respective methenyl forms. The enzyme functions in step 2/5 of formaldehyde
  degradation via the H4MPT route, but with a 20-fold preference for H4MPT over H4F
  as substrate (Vmax 600 vs 30 μmol/min/mg). MtdA plays a critical regulatory role
  in controlling the segregation of C1 carbon flux between assimilation and oxidation
  pathways. While mtdB serves as the main methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase in vivo, mtdA''s
  dual substrate specificity allows it to bridge the H4MPT and tetrahydrofolate metabolic
  pools. The enzyme functions as a homotrimer in the cytoplasm with optimal activity
  at pH 6.0 and 45°C. Multiple crystal structures have been solved (PDB: 1LU9, 1LUA,
  6TGE, 6TLK, 6TM3), including complexes with NADP showing re-face stereospecificity.
  Direct protein sequencing has confirmed the N-terminal sequence.'

core_functions:
- description: MtdA is a bifunctional NADP-dependent dehydrogenase that catalyzes
    the oxidation of methylene-H4MPT to methenyl-H4MPT (step 2/5 in formaldehyde degradation)
    and also oxidizes methylene-H4F to methenyl-H4F, albeit with 20-fold lower catalytic
    efficiency (Vmax 600 vs 30 μmol/min/mg). This dual specificity allows MtdA to
    bridge the H4MPT and tetrahydrofolate metabolic pools. The enzyme functions as
    a homotrimer with optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 45°C. While mtdB serves as the
    main methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase in vivo, MtdA plays a critical regulatory role
    in controlling the segregation of C1 carbon flux between oxidation (via H4MPT)
    and assimilation (via H4F/serine cycle). Crystal structures reveal re-face stereospecificity
    for NADP binding. MtdA represents an evolutionary adaptation linking methylotrophic
    and general C1 metabolism.
