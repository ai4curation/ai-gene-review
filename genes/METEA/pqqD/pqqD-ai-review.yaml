description: pqqA (also known as pqqD) encodes the PQQ precursor peptide, a 29-amino
  acid substrate that contains the glutamate (position 16) and tyrosine (position
  20) residues that are cross-linked by the radical SAM enzyme PqqE to form pyrroloquinoline
  quinone (PQQ). The cross-linking forms a Glu-Tyr bond (positions 16-20) that is
  the core structure of PQQ. After cross-linking and excision from the peptide, this
  modified dipeptide undergoes further processing to yield mature PQQ, the essential
  cofactor for methanol dehydrogenases. Interestingly, mutational studies have shown
  that PqqA is not strictly required for PQQ biosynthesis in M. extorquens AM1, suggesting
  an alternative source or pathway for PQQ production exists in this organism. Despite
  this redundancy, PqqA represents the canonical PQQ biosynthetic substrate that is
  conserved across PQQ-producing bacteria. The protein belongs to the PqqA family
  and its small size (29 aa) is characteristic of peptide substrates processed by
  radical SAM enzymes.

  review:
    summary: Correct - PqqA is the precursor peptide substrate for PQQ biosynthesis,
      containing the Glu and Tyr residues at positions 16-20 that are cross-linked
      to form the PQQ core structure [file:METEA/pqqD/pqqD-uniprot.txt, "Required
      for coenzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis...CROSSLNK 16..20 Pyrroloquinoline
      quinone (Glu-Tyr)"].
    action: ACCEPT

- description: PqqA serves as the precursor peptide substrate for PQQ biosynthesis.
    The 29-amino acid peptide contains critical glutamate (Glu16) and tyrosine (Tyr20)
    residues that are cross-linked by the radical SAM enzyme PqqE to form the core
    structure of pyrroloquinoline quinone. After PqqE-catalyzed cross-linking, these
    residues are excised from the peptide and further processed to yield mature PQQ,
    which serves as the essential cofactor for both Ca-dependent (MxaFI) and Ln-dependent
    (XoxF) methanol dehydrogenases. Notably, pqqA deletion studies revealed that M.
    extorquens AM1 can still synthesize PQQ through an alternative pathway, though
    PqqA represents the canonical biosynthetic substrate conserved in most PQQ-producing
    bacteria.
