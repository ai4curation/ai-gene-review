description: 'pqqE encodes PqqA peptide cyclase (EC 1.21.98.4), a radical S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) enzyme that catalyzes the critical cross-linking of glutamate and tyrosine
  residues in the PqqA precursor protein during pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis.
  PQQ is the essential cofactor for both calcium-dependent (MxaFI) and lanthanide-dependent
  (XoxF) methanol dehydrogenases, making PqqE absolutely required for methylotrophic
  growth. The enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster coordinated by three cysteines and
  an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine, characteristic of the radical SAM superfamily.
  PqqE forms a ternary complex with the peptide chaperone PqqD and the substrate PqqA;
  this interaction with PqqD is necessary for PqqE activity. Crystal structure has
  been solved at 3.20 Å resolution (PDB: 6C8V). The enzyme catalyzes de novo carbon-carbon
  cross-linking within the PqqA peptide substrate, forming the E-Y cross-linked intermediate
  that is further processed to PQQ.'
