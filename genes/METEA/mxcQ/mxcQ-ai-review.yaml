description: mxcQ encodes the sensor histidine kinase component of the MxcQE two-component
  regulatory system, which functions as a master regulator positioned at the apex
  of a complex regulatory cascade controlling methanol dehydrogenase gene expression.
  The protein contains conserved catalytic domains (HisKA and HATPase) that mediate
  autophosphorylation on a conserved histidine residue and subsequent phosphotransfer
  to the MxcE response regulator. MxcQ operates in a hierarchical regulatory architecture
  where MxcQE controls expression of the second two-component system MxbDM, which
  in turn directly activates mxa operon transcription. MxcQ may integrate signals
  about lanthanide availability through proposed interactions with apo-XoxF, thereby
  playing a central role in the lanthanide switch mechanism that determines whether
  cells express calcium-dependent (MxaFI) or lanthanide-dependent (XoxF) methanol
  oxidation systems. The sensor kinase is membrane-localized and likely contains transmembrane
  helices and an extracytoplasmic sensory domain.

core_functions:
- description: MxcQ functions as the master sensor histidine kinase at the apex of
    the regulatory cascade controlling methanol dehydrogenase gene expression. Upon
    sensing environmental signals (possibly including lanthanide availability through
    interaction with apo-XoxF), MxcQ autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue
    and transfers the phosphate to the MxcE response regulator. Phosphorylated MxcE
    then activates expression of the MxbDM two-component system, which in turn directly
    controls mxa operon transcription. MxcQ thus integrates environmental signals
    to determine which methanol oxidation system (calcium-dependent MxaFI or lanthanide-dependent
    XoxF) is expressed.
