description: 'serA encodes D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95), a NAD-dependent
  oxidoreductase that catalyzes the first step of the serine cycle in methylotrophy:
  the reversible oxidation of 3-phospho-D-glycerate (from the Calvin cycle or glycolysis)
  to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate. This is the entry point into the serine cycle, which
  is the major assimilatory pathway for incorporating one-carbon units from methanol
  into cellular biomass. The enzyme is a member of the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid
  dehydrogenase family and also possesses secondary 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
  activity (EC 1.1.1.399), catalyzing the oxidation of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate to 2-oxoglutarate.
  SerA contains an ACT domain (residues 341-413) which typically functions in allosteric
  regulation by binding amino acids. The enzyme represents a critical metabolic branch
  point, channeling carbon from central metabolism into amino acid biosynthesis and
  providing the glycine and serine required for methylotrophic growth.'

    summary: This is the primary catalytic activity of SerA, converting 3-phosphoglycerate
      to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate in the first committed step of the serine cycle. Supported
      by EC 1.1.1.95 assignment and membership in the D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid

      biochemical pathway. [file:METEA/serA/serA-uniprot.txt, "Amino-acid biosynthesis;

    summary: This is a general parent term that is correct but not informative. The
      more specific term GO:0016616 (oxidoreductase activity, acting on the CH-OH
      group of donors) better describes the enzymatic mechanism.

  review:
    summary: SerA requires NAD+ as a cofactor for its dehydrogenase activity and contains
      a NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domain. This is a valid supporting molecular
      function. [file:METEA/serA/serA-uniprot.txt, "NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domains"]

core_functions:
- description: SerA catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of D-3-phosphoglycerate
    to 3-phosphonooxypyruvate, the first committed and rate-limiting step of the serine
    cycle. This reaction channels carbon from glycolysis or the Calvin cycle into
    the serine cycle, which is the major pathway for incorporating C1 units from methanol
    into biomass in methylotrophs. The enzyme contains a NAD-binding Rossmann fold
    domain for cofactor binding and an ACT regulatory domain for allosteric control.
    SerA also has secondary 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity. The serine
    cycle, initiated by SerA, generates glycine (via glyA) which feeds back into the
    cycle, and produces serine for biosynthesis.
