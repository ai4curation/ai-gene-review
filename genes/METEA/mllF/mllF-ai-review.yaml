  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: Xylose isomerase-like TIM barrel domain-containing protein (mllF) 
  involved in methylolanthanin biosynthesis. Homologous to enzymes in 
  petrobactin biosynthetic pathway. Part of mll gene cluster (META1p4129-4138) 
  showing 32-fold upregulation with poorly soluble lanthanides. Predicted to 
  catalyze isomerization or sugar-related transformation reactions during 
  lanthanophore assembly.
