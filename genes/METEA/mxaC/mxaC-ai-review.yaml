  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mxaC encodes a membrane-associated auxiliary protein of 355 amino acids
  that is essential for methanol oxidation in Methylorubrum extorquens AM1. MxaC
  contains a von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain (residues 86-259) that likely
  mediates protein-protein interactions and metal coordination, and two transmembrane
  helices (residues 51-72 and 307-325) that anchor it in the membrane. MxaC is required
  for incorporation of calcium into the active site of methanol dehydrogenase (MxaFI).
  Together with MxaS and MxaL (which also contain vWFA domains) and MxaR (a MoxR-class
  AAA+ ATPase), MxaC likely forms a MoxR/VWA complex specialized in metal cofactor
  insertion. This evolutionarily conserved prokaryotic assembly machinery facilitates
  Ca²⁺ transport and incorporation into the PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenase
  complex. MxaC is part of the COG2304 family and is conserved across methylotrophic
  bacteria that utilize the calcium-dependent methanol oxidation pathway.

- description: MxaC is an auxiliary protein essential for assembly of the calcium-dependent
    methanol dehydrogenase complex. Together with MxaS, MxaL (which also contain
    vWFA domains), and MxaR (a MoxR-class AAA+ ATPase), MxaC forms a MoxR/VWA complex
    that facilitates incorporation of Ca²⁺ into the active site of methanol dehydrogenase
    (MxaFI). The vWFA domain in MxaC likely mediates protein-protein interactions
    with other assembly factors and may coordinate calcium ions during the incorporation
    process. As a membrane-anchored protein with two transmembrane helices, MxaC
    may organize the assembly machinery at the membrane-periplasm interface where
    methanol dehydrogenase maturation occurs.
