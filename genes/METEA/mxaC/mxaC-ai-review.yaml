description: mxaC encodes a membrane-associated protein of 355 amino acids that is
  part of the mxa operon involved in calcium-dependent methanol oxidation. The protein
  contains a von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain (residues 86-259), which typically
  mediates protein-protein interactions and is found in various extracellular and
  intracellular proteins. MxaC is predicted to have two transmembrane helices (residues
  51-72 and 307-325), suggesting it spans the membrane and may function in anchoring
  or organizing components of the methanol oxidation system. While its precise function
  remains to be experimentally determined, its genomic location within the mxa operon
  and its vWFA domain suggest it may play a structural or regulatory role in the assembly
  or localization of the Ca-dependent methanol dehydrogenase system. The protein is
  part of the COG2304 family and is conserved across methylotrophic bacteria.

    domain that likely plays a structural or organizational role in the calcium-dependent
    methanol oxidation system. The vWFA domain typically mediates protein-protein
    interactions, suggesting MxaC may be involved in assembling or anchoring components
    of the MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase complex. With two transmembrane helices, MxaC
    may serve as a membrane scaffold or adaptor protein. Its genomic location within
    the mxa operon indicates it is co-regulated with other methanol oxidation genes,
    though its precise molecular function awaits experimental characterization.
