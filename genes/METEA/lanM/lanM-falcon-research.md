I. Introduction  
The lanM gene of Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 (UniProt ID: C5B164, locus tag MexAM1_META1p1786) encodes Lanmodulin, a protein that has emerged as a paradigm for high‐affinity binding of lanthanide ions in bacteria. Over the past several years, extensive biochemical, structural, and genetic studies have revealed that Lanmodulin is not merely a passive metal‐binding protein but is integral to the processes of rare earth element (REE) acquisition, transport, and homeostasis in methylotrophic bacteria. This report summarizes current experimental evidence and details the gene function, molecular mechanisms, subcellular localization, biological process involvement, protein domains and structural features, expression and regulation, evolutionary conservation, and experimental validations related to lanM. The insights provided here support Gene Ontology annotation curation and are based on multiple lines of evidence from the literature (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6).

II. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
The primary function of lanM is to encode Lanmodulin, a protein that exhibits remarkable selectivity and affinity for lanthanide ions, particularly La³⁺. Lanmodulin binds three equivalents of lanthanide ions with picomolar affinity and a fourth with roughly micromolar affinity, underpinning its role as a high-affinity lanthanide receptor (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). The protein’s binding mechanism relies on a marked conformational change upon metal binding; these structural rearrangements suggest a cooperative folding process that optimizes metal coordination under conditions where lanthanide concentration is very low. Such exquisite specificity—with an estimated 100 million-fold preference for La³⁺ over Ca²⁺—illustrates how Lanmodulin has evolved to distinguish between chemically similar metal ions in the periplasmic space (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).

At the molecular level, the binding of lanthanide ions triggers a shift in Lanmodulin’s quaternary structure, a process that is thought to activate or facilitate subsequent interactions with downstream transporters and enzymes. For instance, experimental evidence indicates that Lanmodulin participates in delivering lanthanides to target proteins such as the XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), which depend on these metals as cofactors for efficient catalytic activity (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 1-3). In this context, the protein acts as both a sensor and an intermediary transporter, coordinating the uptake and intracellular shuttling of lanthanide ions. Moreover, Lanmodulin is implicated in a regulatory cascade whereby the presence of lanthanides results in the repression of calcium-dependent pathways and the concomitant activation of lanthanide-dependent enzymes (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8). Deletion studies in some strains have shown that while the absence of lanM does not abolish methylotrophic growth, it leads to alterations in the cellular handling of metal ions, suggesting that Lanmodulin’s primary role may be to fine-tune lanthanide homeostasis rather than serve as an indispensable metabolic enzyme (chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 3-5, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 11-12).

III. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
Subcellular localization studies consistently report that Lanmodulin is situated in the periplasm of Methylorubrum extorquens AM1. This periplasmic localization is critical for its function because the periplasm serves as a strategic compartment for the initial acquisition and sorting of extracellular metals. The protein’s positioning within the periplasm allows it to mediate interactions with membrane-bound transport complexes, including TonB-dependent receptors and ABC transporters, which facilitate the import of lanthanide ions into the cytoplasm (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 2-3). Translocation to the periplasm is likely achieved via a signal peptide that directs Lanmodulin through the Sec or TAT pathway, ensuring that the mature protein is appropriately localized to intercept lanthanide ions as they traverse the outer membrane (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 11-12). Localization in the periplasm is not only fundamental for the physical acquisition of lanthanides but also for integrating the signal of metal ion abundance with the activation of specific metabolic pathways, thus underpinning a coupled regulatory mechanism (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 7-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8).

IV. Biological Processes Involvement  
Lanmodulin is central to several key biological processes in Methylorubrum extorquens. Foremost among these is its involvement in lanthanide acquisition and transport. The protein binds extracellular lanthanide ions with extraordinary specificity and is thought to serve as the primary shuttle delaying the direct delivery of these ions to the cytoplasmic enzymes that require them for activity. In this capacity, Lanmodulin acts as a mediator in the lanthanide switch—a process whereby the presence of REEs shifts the pattern of gene expression from utilizing traditional calcium-dependent MDHs (such as the MxaFI system) to lanthanide-dependent MDHs, such as the XoxF enzyme, which exhibit superior catalytic performance under lanthanide-replete conditions (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8).

Additionally, the involvement of lanM in cellular metal homeostasis extends to its putative regulatory role in maintaining intracellular ion balance. Through its high-affinity binding, Lanmodulin can sequester lanthanide ions when they are abundant, preventing potential toxicity, while also facilitating their delivery to essential enzymes when the concentration of the metal becomes limiting. This dynamic regulatory mechanism ensures that the cell maintains an optimal balance of metal ions, thereby supporting efficient central carbon metabolism and minimizing the risk of metal-induced stress (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 4-7). Furthermore, the interaction of Lanmodulin with both TonB-dependent receptors and two-component signal transduction systems (e.g., MxcQE) suggests that it may serve as a nexus that couples environmental lanthanide availability to specific transcriptional responses, thereby orchestrating adaptive metabolic changes (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 7-9, gorniak2023differentlanthanideelements pages 6-9).

V. Disease Associations and Phenotypic Effects  
While Methylorubrum extorquens is primarily an environmental bacterium and is not typically associated with human or animal pathogens, the proper functioning of lanthanide-dependent processes has broader ecological and industrial importance. Experimental deletion of lanM in M. extorquens has frequently resulted in strains that continue to grow on methanol, suggesting that although Lanmodulin enhances metal transport efficiency, its loss might be compensated by redundant pathways or alternate REE-binding proteins (chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 3-5, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 2-3). In some experiments, the absence of lanM did not impede growth; in contrast, slight improvements in growth have occasionally been reported, hinting at a complex regulatory network in which Lanmodulin modulates not only metal uptake but also overall cellular metabolism (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 12-13, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 5-7). The subtle phenotypic changes observed upon deletion indicate that Lanmodulin’s contribution to cellular fitness is most critical under conditions where lanthanide availability directly influences the activity of key enzymes. Although there is no direct implication of lanM in pathogenic disease processes, its role in metal homeostasis and potential applications in the bioremediation of environments contaminated with REEs or radioactive actinides might have indirect implications for environmental health and safety (deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2).

VI. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
The structural architecture of Lanmodulin is one of its most striking features. The protein is composed of four EF-hand motifs—structural domains that are typically associated with calcium binding in other proteins. However, in Lanmodulin these EF-hand motifs have undergone evolutionary modifications that confer a high specificity for lanthanide ions over calcium ions. This selectivity is achieved in part by a unique configuration of the metal binding loops that integrate an additional carboxylate ligand, a modification that is critical to achieving picomolar binding affinities for lanthanides such as La³⁺ (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).

Detailed structural investigations using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have revealed that lanmodulin undergoes a cooperative folding process upon binding to lanthanide ions. This process results in a significant change in the overall conformation of the protein, thereby potentially exposing or obscuring surfaces that interact with other proteins or membrane components (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 6-10). The presence of conserved aspartate residues within the EF-hand motifs is critical for coordinating the binding of lanthanide ions, while an unusually placed proline residue within each EF-hand is thought to restrict conformational flexibility in a manner that enhances binding specificity—a feature that is rare among conventional calcium-binding proteins (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 4-7).

Moreover, analyses of sequence variations between different Lanmodulin homologs, such as Mex-LanM and Hans-LanM, indicate that even subtle differences in amino acid composition can affect the protein’s metal binding affinity and specificity. Such differences likely reflect evolutionary pressures that have resulted in the fine-tuning of Lanmodulin’s binding properties to suit the specific ecological niches occupied by different methylotrophic bacteria (deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, valdes2024anovelinsilico pages 4-6). The combination of these unique structural features underpins the ability of Lanmodulin to act as a highly effective lanthanide capture protein, providing a molecular basis for its role as a REE transporter in the periplasm (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 4-7).

VII. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
The expression of the lanM gene is highly responsive to the concentration and availability of lanthanide ions in the environment. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have demonstrated that lanM expression is significantly upregulated in the presence of La³⁺ as well as other light lanthanides, indicating that its transcription is directly influenced by environmental metal levels (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2). In methylotrophic cultures, high expression levels of lanM—for instance, log₂ RPKM values nearing 9.6—underscore the importance of lanthanide uptake in supporting the metabolic processes essential for growth on methanol (wegner2019lanthanidedependentmethylotrophsof pages 10-12, wegner2019lanthanidedependentmethylotrophsof pages 9-10).

In addition to metal ion-induced transcriptional upregulation, the lanM promoter appears to be integrated into a complex regulatory network that includes two-component signal transduction systems, such as MxcQE, and TonB-dependent receptor complexes that are responsive to extracellular lanthanide levels (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 7-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8). These regulatory elements collectively ensure that the expression of lanM is finely tuned to match the cell’s requirement for lanthanides. For example, under conditions where lanthanide concentrations are high, an upregulation of lanM not only enhances the capture of these ions but may also initiate a feedback mechanism that modulates the expression of other genes involved in REE-dependent metabolic pathways (gorniak2023differentlanthanideelements pages 6-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8).

Furthermore, experimental promoter assays have revealed that even slight variations in lanthanide availability can lead to significant changes in lanM transcription, thereby underscoring the sensitivity and dynamic range of the regulatory network controlling this gene (gorniak2023differentlanthanideelements pages 6-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8). This responsiveness enables Methylorubrum extorquens to rapidly adapt to fluctuating environmental metal ion concentrations, ensuring efficient metabolic switching between different methanol dehydrogenase systems as required.

VIII. Evolutionary Conservation  
Comparative genomic analyses highlight that the lanM gene is conserved among various alphaproteobacterial methylotrophs, indicating that the capacity for high-affinity REE binding confers a significant evolutionary advantage in niches where lanthanides are accessible. Homologs of Lanmodulin, though sometimes exhibiting subtle sequence variations, retain the characteristic EF-hand motifs and structural determinants necessary for lanthanide selectivity. This conservation across species such as Methylorubrum extorquens and related methylotrophic bacteria suggests that Lanmodulin has evolved under strong selective pressure to maintain its metal binding function (chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 3-5, wegner2019lanthanidedependentmethylotrophsof pages 9-10).

In addition to sequence conservation, structural analyses comparing differing Lanmodulin variants, such as Mex-LanM versus Hans-LanM, reveal that while the overall fold is retained, variations in loop regions and key ligand-coordinating residues can modulate the binding affinity and specificity for various lanthanide ions. Such divergence likely reflects adaptations to the specific lanthanide availability in distinct ecological niches, allowing for the optimization of metal uptake pathways in response to environmental pressures (deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, valdes2024anovelinsilico pages 4-6). The conservation of critical structural features—particularly the arrangement of EF-hand motifs with their associated carboxylate residues—underscores the central role of lanM in REE biology and supports its functional annotation in the Gene Ontology framework (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, yang2025emergingroleof pages 4-7).

IX. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
A diverse array of experimental approaches has been employed to elucidate the properties of Lanmodulin. Structural studies using NMR spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography have provided clear evidence of a metal-induced conformational shift, showing that the binding of lanthanide ions induces a highly cooperative folding mechanism in Lanmodulin (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 6-10). Such experiments have established that the protein shifts from a relatively unstructured state in the absence of metal ions to a highly ordered conformation upon lanthanide binding, a phenomenon that is critical for its exceptional binding affinity and specificity (cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2).

Quantitative measurements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and absorbance spectroscopy have corroborated the high-affinity binding behavior of Lanmodulin. These studies have shown that the protein binds three equivalents of lanthanide ions at picomolar concentrations, with a fourth ion binding at a substantially lower affinity, thereby providing a nuanced mechanism for REE acquisition (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2). In addition, heterologous expression studies in Escherichia coli—employing IPTG-inducible expression systems—have successfully produced functional Mex-LanM, thereby validating its metal-binding properties and establishing its suitability for further biochemical characterization (hamilton2024crossroadsofcella pages 98-101, hamilton2024crossroadsofcella pages 93-98).

Genetic experiments have further reinforced the functional role of lanM. Targeted deletion of lanM has, in several studies, resulted in strains that continue to exhibit robust methylotrophic growth despite altered patterns of lanthanide uptake, suggesting that while Lanmodulin is not strictly essential for survival, it plays a vital role in modulating the efficiency of lanthanide-dependent metabolic pathways (chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 3-5, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 5-7). Promoter reporter assays have also shown that the transcription of lanM is markedly induced by the addition of La³⁺ and other light lanthanides, providing direct evidence of a regulatory mechanism that links environmental metal ion availability to gene expression (gorniak2023differentlanthanideelements pages 6-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8).

Recent studies have also explored the interaction of Lanmodulin with components of the lanthanide transport machinery. Co-localization experiments and genetic analyses have suggested that Lanmodulin works in concert with TonB-dependent receptors and ABC transporters to facilitate the efficient delivery of lanthanide ions to intracellular target enzymes, thereby integrating metal uptake with broader metabolic pathways (yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 7-9). Collectively, these experimental findings provide a robust foundation for the functional annotation of lanM within the framework of REE metabolism and cellular metal homeostasis (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6).

X. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the lanM gene of Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 encodes Lanmodulin, a periplasmic protein that plays a central role in the acquisition, transport, and homeostatic regulation of lanthanide ions. The protein’s function is based on a highly specialized binding mechanism that confers an extraordinarily high affinity and specificity for lanthanides, particularly La³⁺, over physiologically abundant ions such as Ca²⁺. Its structure, composed of four modified EF-hand motifs, undergoes cooperative folding upon metal binding, a property that facilitates subsequent interactions with membrane transport systems. Lanmodulin’s periplasmic localization enables it to efficiently intercept lanthanide ions as they enter the cell and to channel these metals toward critical enzymes such as the XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases, thereby orchestrating a lanthanide switch that reconfigures central metabolic pathways.

The expression of lanM is tightly regulated by the availability of lanthanide ions, with significant upregulation in the presence of La³⁺ and related metals. This dynamic transcriptional control is mediated by complex regulatory networks, including sensor kinases and response regulators, ensuring that the protein is expressed at levels that reflect the cell’s immediate metabolic requirements. Although deletion studies have shown that lanM is not absolutely essential for methylotrophic growth, alterations in lanthanide homeostasis observed in knockout strains underscore the role of Lanmodulin as a fine-tuner of metal-dependent metabolic processes.

Moreover, evolutionary analyses reveal that the lanM gene is conserved among alphaproteobacterial methylotrophs, and variations in its sequence among different species reflect adaptive responses to distinct environmental niches rich in REEs. The conservation of critical structural motifs in Lanmodulin, particularly the EF-hand domains and associated ligand-coordinating residues, further emphasizes the evolutionary importance of high-affinity lanthanide binding in these organisms.

Overall, the comprehensive body of experimental data—from structural to genetic studies—substantiates the role of Lanmodulin as a key mediator of lanthanide-dependent metabolism in Methylorubrum extorquens AM1. The insights into its binding mechanism, regulation, and evolutionary conservation not only inform our understanding of REE biology but also provide a robust framework for the Gene Ontology annotation of lanM. Future research aimed at delineating the precise interactions between Lanmodulin and other components of the lanthanide transport machinery is expected to further illuminate the sophisticated strategies that methylotrophs employ to harness the unique chemical properties of rare earth elements (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 2-3, fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 7-9, yang2025emergingroleof pages 4-7).

In summary, Lanmodulin—the product of the lanM gene—emerges as a paradigmatic example of protein evolution leading to the development of highly specialized metal-binding functions. Its ability to bind lanthanide ions with extraordinary affinity and selectivity, coupled with its strategic periplasmic localization and responsive regulation, underscores its essential role in the metabolic adaptability of Methylorubrum extorquens. The gene’s evolutionary conservation among methylotrophs highlights the broader ecological significance of REE utilization, while the detailed experimental evidence supporting its function renders Lanmodulin a crucial target for further investigation in the fields of biotechnology and environmental remediation.

This report thus provides a detailed foundation for the GO annotation of lanM, covering its molecular function, subcellular localization, involvement in key biological processes, and the structural and regulatory elements that underlie its activity. The extensive body of experimental evidence attesting to its high-affinity lanthanide binding and regulatory role in metal homeostasis in Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 emphasizes the importance of Lanmodulin in both basic microbial metabolism and potential biotechnological applications involving REE recovery and environmental adaptation (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, chistoserdova2019newpiecesto pages 3-5, yang2025emergingroleof pages 7-8, gorniak2023differentlanthanideelements pages 6-9).

Taken together, the lanM gene and its product Lanmodulin represent a significant advancement in our understanding of how microorganisms exploit the unique properties of rare earth elements. The integration of structural, functional, and regulatory data not only validates the role of lanM in lanthanide binding and transport but also offers promising avenues for future research in metal biochemistry, environmental microbiology, and bioremediation strategies aimed at harnessing the exceptional properties of REE‐binding proteins (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6, wegner2019lanthanidedependentmethylotrophsof pages 10-12, wegner2019lanthanidedependentmethylotrophsof pages 9-10).

Such comprehensive characterization of lanM therefore stands as a model for the detailed annotation of genes involved in metal homeostasis and paves the way for both academic exploration and practical applications in the recovery and recycling of rare earth elements from industrial and environmental waste streams. With ongoing research expected to reveal further nuances in its regulatory mechanisms and interaction networks, Lanmodulin is poised to continue contributing significantly to our understanding of REE biology and its biotechnological exploitation (fujitani2022aperiplasmiclanthanide pages 1-2, cook2018structuralbasisfor pages 1-2, deblonde2021characterizationofamericium pages 1-6).
