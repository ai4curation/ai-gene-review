# lanM Gene Review Notes

## Key findings from literature:

### Primary function: Lanthanide-binding protein
- **[PMID:30351021 "Lanmodulin: A Highly Selective Lanthanide-Binding Protein from a Lanthanide-Utilizing Bacterium."]**: LanM is a highly selective lanthanide(III)-binding protein with 100 million-fold selectivity for La(3+) over Ca(2+). Undergoes conformational change from disordered to ordered state in response to picomolar concentrations of all LnIII (Ln = La-Lu, Y). Contains four EF-hand motifs with unique proline residues.

### Structural insights:
- **[PMID:30352145 "Structural Basis for Rare Earth Element Recognition by Methylobacterium extorquens Lanmodulin."]**: NMR structure reveals unusual fusion of adjacent EF-hands, resulting in compact fold unique among EF-hand proteins. Features unusual N i+1-H···N i hydrogen bonds involving unique EF-hand proline residues for selective LnIII recognition.

### Biotechnology applications:
- **[PMID:32686425 "Selective and Efficient Biomacromolecular Extraction of Rare-Earth Elements using Lanmodulin."]**: Demonstrated universal selectivity for REEs against non-REEs. Retains REE binding down to pH 2.5, withstands temperatures up to 95°C, and tolerates molar amounts of competing non-REE metals. Successfully applied to industrial feedstocks (coal, electronic waste).

### Recent advances:
- **[PMID:37259003 "Enhanced rare-earth separation with a metal-sensitive lanmodulin dimer."]**: Shows Hans-LanM variant with enhanced RE separation capacity and oligomeric state sensitive to RE ionic radius. Demonstrates natural diversity of selective lanthanide recognition motifs.

## Biological context:
- Found in methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens
- Lanthanides are essential cofactors for PQQ-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases in methylotrophs
- Periplasmic protein likely involved in lanthanide transport
- Has four EF-hand domains (unusual for lanthanide vs calcium selectivity)

## Functional significance:
- Picomolar affinity for lanthanides
- Conformational sensor for rare earth elements
- Selective metal transport in periplasm
- Part of rare earth element utilization machinery in methylotrophs
