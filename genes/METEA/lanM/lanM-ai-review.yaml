description: Lanmodulin (LanM) is a highly selective lanthanide-binding protein that
  exhibits 100 million-fold selectivity for lanthanide(III) ions over calcium(II).
  This small periplasmic protein contains four EF-hand motifs with unique proline
  residues that enable selective recognition of rare earth elements. LanM undergoes
  a large conformational change from a disordered state to a compact, ordered state
  in response to picomolar concentrations of all lanthanide(III) ions (La-Lu) and
  Y(III). The protein is essential for lanthanide utilization in methylotrophic bacteria,
  where lanthanides serve as cofactors for pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent
  alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Note that current GO annotations lack biological
  process terms, despite clear evidence for roles in lanthanide transport, homeostasis,
  and metal ion response.

    id: GO:0005509
    label: calcium ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on InterPro domain prediction due to EF-hand
      motifs. However, LanM has 100 million-fold selectivity for lanthanides over
      calcium and only responds to calcium at near-millimolar concentrations versus
      picomolar for lanthanides. The annotation is technically correct but misleading
      about the protein's primary function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While LanM can bind calcium at high concentrations, this is not its physiological
      function. The primary role is lanthanide binding with exceptional selectivity.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This general term correctly describes LanM's core function as a metal
      ion binding protein, specifically for lanthanides. While not specific enough
      to capture the exceptional selectivity, it represents the fundamental molecular
      activity. A more specific 'lanthanide ion binding' term is proposed in proposed_new_terms
      to better capture LanM's unique selectivity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurately describes the core molecular function of LanM as a metal ion
      binding protein, even if it doesn't specify lanthanide selectivity. Accepted
      as best available term until more specific lanthanide binding terms are added
      to GO.

    a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore
  justification: LanM functions in periplasmic lanthanide transport, representing

    a child of metal ion transport.

    state of lanthanide ions within an organism or cell
  justification: Given the essential role of lanthanides in methylotrophic bacteria
    and the specialized machinery like LanM for their utilization, a specific homeostasis
    term would be valuable as a child of monoatomic ion homeostasis.
