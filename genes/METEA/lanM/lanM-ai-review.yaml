description: Lanmodulin (LanM) is a highly selective lanthanide-binding protein that exhibits 100 million-fold selectivity for lanthanide(III) ions over calcium(II). This small periplasmic protein contains four EF-hand motifs with unique proline residues that enable selective recognition of rare earth elements. LanM undergoes a large conformational change from a disordered state to a compact, ordered state in response to picomolar concentrations of all lanthanide(III) ions (La-Lu) and Y(III). The protein is essential for lanthanide utilization in methylotrophic bacteria, where lanthanides serve as cofactors for pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Note that current GO annotations lack biological process terms, despite clear evidence for roles in lanthanide transport, homeostasis, and metal ion response.
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0005509
    label: calcium ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is based on InterPro domain prediction due to EF-hand motifs. However, LanM has 100 million-fold selectivity for lanthanides over calcium and only responds to calcium at near-millimolar concentrations versus picomolar for lanthanides. The annotation is technically correct but misleading about the protein's primary function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While LanM can bind calcium at high concentrations, this is not its physiological function. The primary role is lanthanide binding with exceptional selectivity.

    id: GO:0042597
    label: periplasmic space
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000044
  review:
    summary: Correctly identifies the subcellular location based on signal peptide prediction and experimental evidence. UniProt indicates periplasmic localization supported by experimental data.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately represents the protein's subcellular localization in the periplasm where it likely functions in lanthanide transport.
- term:
    id: GO:0046872
    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This general term correctly describes LanM's core function as a metal ion binding protein, specifically for lanthanides. While not specific enough to capture the exceptional selectivity, it represents the fundamental molecular activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Accurately describes the core molecular function of LanM as a metal ion binding protein, even if it doesn't specify lanthanide selectivity.
