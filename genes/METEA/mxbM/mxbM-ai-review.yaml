  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mxbM encodes a DNA-binding response regulator that functions as the direct
  transcriptional activator of the mxa operon and repressor of the xox1 operon, serving
  as the molecular switch that determines which methanol oxidation system (calcium-dependent
  MxaFI or lanthanide-dependent XoxF) is expressed based on metal cofactor availability.
  The protein contains a conserved N-terminal receiver domain with (αβ)₅ fold that
  receives phosphoryl groups from the MxbD sensor kinase, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix
  DNA-binding domain. MxbM functions at the second tier of the regulatory cascade
  (MxcQE → MxbDM → mxa/xox1), where it receives signals from the upstream MxcQE system
  through MxcE-dependent transcriptional control of mxbDM. Upon phosphorylation, MxbM
  activates mxa transcription while simultaneously repressing xox1 transcription,
  creating reciprocal regulation that ensures only one methanol oxidation system is
  highly expressed at any given time. MxbM is absolutely required for mxa expression,
  as mutants exhibit below-background levels of methanol dehydrogenase transcription.

core_functions:
- description: MxbM functions as the direct transcriptional regulator that determines
    which methanol oxidation system is expressed based on metal cofactor availability.
    Upon receiving a phosphoryl group from MxbD sensor kinase, MxbM binds to the mxa
    promoter to activate transcription of the calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenase
    system, while simultaneously binding to the xox1 promoter to repress transcription
    of the lanthanide-dependent system. This reciprocal regulation creates a molecular
    switch ensuring that only one methanol oxidation system is highly expressed at
    any time. MxbM sits at the second tier of the regulatory cascade, receiving signals
    from the upstream MxcQE system and directly controlling metabolic gene expression.
