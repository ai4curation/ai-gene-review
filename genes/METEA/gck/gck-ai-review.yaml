description: 'gck encodes glycerate kinase (EC 2.7.1.31), which catalyzes the ATP-dependent
  phosphorylation of D-glycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate (which is rapidly isomerized
  to 3-phosphoglycerate by phosphoglycerate mutase). This is the third and final step
  of the serine cycle, completing the cyclic pathway by regenerating 3-phosphoglycerate,
  which can re-enter the cycle via serA. The enzyme belongs to the MOFRL (molybdopterin-binding,
  formate dehydrogenase-related) protein superfamily and contains two characteristic
  domains: a MOFRL-associated domain (residues 18-245) and a MOFRL domain (residues
  321-430). Gck functions in the cytoplasm as part of the core serine cycle machinery,
  enabling the net assimilation of one-carbon units from formaldehyde into biomass.
  The reaction: D-glycerate + ATP → 2-phospho-D-glycerate + ADP allows the serine
  cycle to operate as a true metabolic cycle, with glycerate produced from hydroxypyruvate
  (by hprA) being reconverted to phosphoglycerate to continue C1 assimilation.'

  review:
    summary: Gck is a cytoplasmic enzyme, consistent with the localization of other
      serine cycle enzymes. The serine cycle operates in the cytoplasm where formaldehyde
      assimilation occurs. [file:METEA/gck/gck-uniprot.txt, "C:cytoplasm"]

    summary: This is the primary and specific catalytic activity of Gck, phosphorylating
      D-glycerate using ATP as phosphate donor. This activity completes the serine

    summary: This is a general parent term that is correct but not informative. The
      specific term GO:0008887 (glycerate kinase activity) provides precise functional
      annotation.

core_functions:
- description: Gck catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-glycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate,
    the final step of the serine cycle that regenerates phosphoglycerate to complete
    the cyclic pathway. This reaction follows hprA's reduction of hydroxypyruvate
    to glycerate, and the resulting 2-phosphoglycerate is rapidly isomerized to 3-phosphoglycerate
    (the substrate for serA). The enzyme functions in the cytoplasm as part of the
    core serine cycle for C1 assimilation, enabling net incorporation of formaldehyde-derived
    carbon into cellular biomass. Gck contains MOFRL and MOFRL-associated domains
    characteristic of this kinase family, which use ATP to phosphorylate their substrates.
    By regenerating 3-phosphoglycerate, Gck closes the serine cycle loop, allowing
    continuous operation of the pathway during methylotrophic growth.
