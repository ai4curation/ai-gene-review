description: 'gcvT encodes aminomethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.10), also known as glycine
  cleavage system T protein, which catalyzes the final step of the glycine cleavage
  system: the transfer of the aminomethyl group from the lipoyl-bound intermediate
  (on gcvH) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), producing 5,10-methylene-THF and releasing
  ammonia. The enzyme belongs to the GcvT family and functions as a component of the
  glycine cleavage complex, working in concert with gcvP (P protein, glycine dehydrogenase),
  gcvH (H protein, lipoyl-carrier), and gcvL (L protein, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase).
  In methylotrophs, the glycine cleavage system connects the serine cycle to the THF
  one-carbon pool: glycine (produced from serine by serA) is oxidatively cleaved by
  the GCV system, generating 5,10-methylene-THF (which feeds into C1 metabolism),
  CO2, and ammonia. GcvT contains two characteristic domains: an aminomethyltransferase
  folate-binding domain (residues 25-274) and a C-terminal domain (residues 305-385).
  The enzyme is essential for glycine catabolism and for connecting amino acid metabolism
  to the THF-dependent one-carbon pool, allowing the organism to recycle one-carbon
  units between different pathways during methylotrophic growth.'

  review:
    summary: This is technically correct as GcvT transfers an aminomethyl group, but
      it's a somewhat misleading general term. The more specific term GO:0004047 (aminomethyltransferase
      activity) provides better functional annotation.
