description: mxaD encodes a periplasmic protein of 176 amino acids that is part of
  the mxa operon involved in calcium-dependent methanol oxidation. The protein contains
  an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-19) that directs it to the periplasm, where
  it likely functions in some aspect of Ca-dependent methanol dehydrogenase system
  assembly or regulation. MxaD contains a polyketide cyclase/dehydratase domain (Pfam
  PF10604) and belongs to the START-like domain superfamily, which typically bind
  lipids or other hydrophobic molecules. The precise molecular function of MxaD has
  not been experimentally determined, but its genomic location within the mxa operon
  indicates it is co-regulated with other methanol oxidation genes and likely plays
  an accessory role in the Ca-MDH system. The protein belongs to COG3832 and shows
  sequence similarity to other bacterial proteins of unknown function. Given the polyketide
  cyclase domain, MxaD may be involved in modifying or processing a cofactor or prosthetic
  group associated with the methanol oxidation machinery.

- description: MxaD is a periplasmic protein of unknown precise function that is part
    of the mxa operon for calcium-dependent methanol oxidation. The protein contains
    a polyketide cyclase/dehydratase domain and belongs to the START-like domain superfamily,
    suggesting it may bind lipids or hydrophobic molecules. Its genomic context within
    the mxa operon strongly suggests involvement in the Ca-MDH system, possibly in
    cofactor modification, prosthetic group processing, or structural organization
    of the methanol oxidation machinery. The presence of a signal peptide directs
    MxaD to the periplasm, where the MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase complex is located.
    Experimental characterization is needed to determine its precise molecular function
    and role in methanol metabolism.
