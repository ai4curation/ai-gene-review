  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mxaD encodes a 17-kDa periplasmic protein that is part of the mxa operon involved in calcium-dependent
  methanol oxidation in Methylorubrum extorquens AM1. Experimental evidence demonstrates that MxaD directly
  or indirectly stimulates the interaction between methanol dehydrogenase (MxaFI-MeDH) and cytochrome
  c(L), enhancing electron transfer efficiency in the respiratory chain. Deletion mutants lacking mxaD
  retain the ability to grow on methanol but at significantly reduced rates, indicating MxaD plays an
  accessory rather than essential catalytic role. Biochemical studies with purified proteins show that
  wild-type MDH containing MxaD proteins exhibits higher rates of interaction with cytochrome c(L) compared
  to mutant MDH lacking MxaD. The protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-19) directing
  it to the periplasm, a polyketide cyclase/dehydratase domain (Pfam PF10604), and belongs to the START-like
  domain superfamily, suggesting it may bind lipids or hydrophobic molecules to facilitate proper spatial
  organization or membrane association of the methanol oxidation machinery.

core_functions:
- description: MxaD enhances electron transfer between methanol dehydrogenase (MxaFI) and cytochrome c(L)
    in the periplasm during methanol-dependent respiration. The protein functions as an adapter or facilitator
    that stimulates protein-protein interactions between these respiratory components, thereby increasing
    the efficiency of methanol oxidation. While not absolutely essential for growth on methanol, MxaD
    deletion results in significantly reduced growth rates due to decreased electron transfer efficiency.

suggested_experiments:
- description: Determine the high-resolution crystal structure of MxaD in complex with MxaFI methanol
    dehydrogenase and/or cytochrome c(L) to reveal the molecular basis of the protein-protein interactions
    that enhance electron transfer.
  hypothesis: MxaD forms a bridge or stabilizing interface between MxaFI and cytochrome c(L), with specific
    residues mediating these interactions. The polyketide cyclase and START-like domains may have distinct
    structural roles in this assembly.
  experiment_type: structural biology
- description: Use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantify
    the binding affinities between MxaD and its interaction partners (MxaFI, cytochrome c(L)) and determine
    whether MxaD binds both proteins simultaneously or sequentially.
  hypothesis: MxaD has measurable binding affinity for both MxaFI and cytochrome c(L), and binding to
    one protein may influence binding to the other, suggesting cooperative assembly of the electron transfer
    complex.
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Perform site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the polyketide cyclase domain
    and START-like domain to identify residues critical for MxaD function, followed by complementation
    assays measuring growth rates on methanol.
  hypothesis: Specific residues in the polyketide cyclase and START-like domains are essential for MxaD's
    ability to enhance electron transfer, and mutations in these regions will reduce or eliminate the
    growth advantage conferred by MxaD.
  experiment_type: genetic manipulation
- description: Use lipid overlay assays or lipidomics to identify specific lipids or hydrophobic molecules
    that bind to the START-like domain of MxaD, and test whether these interactions are required for proper
    localization or function.
  hypothesis: The START-like domain binds specific membrane lipids that anchor or orient MxaD at the periplasmic
    face of the cytoplasmic membrane, facilitating interactions with membrane-associated components of
    the methanol oxidation machinery.
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Conduct comparative growth experiments measuring electron transfer rates and respiratory
    chain efficiency in wild-type, ΔmxaD, and complemented strains under varying methanol concentrations
    and in the presence of both calcium and lanthanides.
  hypothesis: The relative importance of MxaD may vary depending on substrate concentration and metal
    cofactor availability, with greater effects observed under suboptimal growth conditions.
