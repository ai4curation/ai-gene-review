  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mtdB encodes NAD(P)-dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase
  (EC 1.5.1.-), which catalyzes the second step in the formaldehyde degradation pathway
  via the H4MPT route. The enzyme oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (the
  product of the fae reaction) to 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin, using either
  NAD+ or NADP+ as electron acceptor to produce NADH or NADPH. The protein functions
  as a homohexamer in the cytoplasm and is essential for completing C1 metabolism
  during methylotrophic growth. The enzyme exhibits optimal activity at pH 6.0 and
  temperature of 35-40°C. MtdB is one of two methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenases in M.
  extorquens AM1 (the other being MtdA), and both are required for efficient formaldehyde
  oxidation to formate. Direct protein sequencing confirms this is one of the core
  enzymes in the methylotrophic C1 metabolic pathway.

- description: MtdB catalyzes the second step in the H4MPT-dependent formaldehyde
    degradation pathway by oxidizing 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin (produced
    by fae) to 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin. The enzyme can utilize either
    NAD+ or NADP+ as electron acceptor, producing NADH or NADPH. MtdB functions as
    a homohexamer with optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 35-40°C. This enzyme is one
    of two methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenases in M. extorquens AM1 (along with MtdA) and
    both are essential for efficient oxidation of formaldehyde to formate during methylotrophic
    growth. The enzyme directly channels the C1 unit from the fae-catalyzed formaldehyde
    activation step toward eventual oxidation to formate and CO2.
