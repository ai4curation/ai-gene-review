description: "fae encodes the formaldehyde-activating enzyme (5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin\
  \ hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.147), which catalyzes the first and critical step in formaldehyde\
  \ detoxification and metabolism. The enzyme condenses formaldehyde with tetrahydromethanopterin\
  \ (H4MPT) to form 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin, channeling formaldehyde\
  \ into the central C1 metabolic pathway. While this reaction proceeds spontaneously,\
  \ Fae catalyzes it at a substantially higher rate. The protein forms a homopentamer\
  \ in the cytoplasm and is essential for growth on methanol, as it both detoxifies\
  \ the highly reactive formaldehyde produced by methanol dehydrogenases and provides\
  \ the substrate for downstream C1 metabolism. Crystal structure has been solved\
  \ at 1.9 \xC5 resolution, revealing the mechanism of H4MPT binding and formaldehyde\
  \ activation. The enzyme exhibits optimal activity at pH 7-7.5 with a KM of 0.2\
  \ mM for formaldehyde."

core_functions:
- description: 'Fae catalyzes the critical first step in formaldehyde metabolism by
    condensing formaldehyde with tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) to form 5,10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin.
    This reaction serves dual purposes: (1) detoxifying the highly reactive formaldehyde
    produced by methanol dehydrogenases, and (2) channeling the C1 unit into central
    metabolism for biosynthesis and energy generation. The enzyme functions as a homopentamer
    and is absolutely essential for growth on methanol. While the reaction proceeds
    spontaneously, Fae accelerates it substantially, with optimal activity at pH 7-7.5
    and a KM of 0.2 mM for formaldehyde.'
