description: 'xoxJ encodes a periplasmic binding protein that plays a critical role
  in the activation of XoxF, the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase. The
  protein is part of the xox1 operon alongside xoxF (Ln-MDH) and xoxG (cytochrome
  c_L electron acceptor). XoxJ contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-26)
  targeting it to the periplasm, where it functions in enabling XoxF to catalyze methanol
  oxidation. The crystal structure (PDB: 6ONP, 2.27 Å resolution) reveals a large
  hydrophobic cleft characteristic of the periplasmic binding protein family, suggesting
  a role in substrate or cofactor binding. By analogy to MxaJ in the Ca-dependent
  system, where deletion disrupts MDH activation, XoxJ is hypothesized to facilitate
  the incorporation of PQQ and/or lanthanide cofactors into XoxF, or to maintain XoxF
  in a catalytically competent conformation. The protein contains a conserved disulfide
  bond (Cys41-Cys94) and belongs to solute-binding protein family 3. While XoxJ''s
  precise substrate and mechanism remain under investigation, it is essential for
  proper functioning of the lanthanide-dependent methanol oxidation system in the
  periplasm.'

    summary: XoxJ functions as an activator of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase
      XoxF
    action: NEW
    reason: XoxJ is essential for activation of XoxF, analogous to MxaJ's role in
      activating Ca-dependent MDH. The enzyme activator activity term is more specific
      and accurate than generic "binding" for describing XoxJ's molecular function
      in enabling XoxF catalytic activity.

  review:
    summary: XoxJ is required for activation of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase
      in one-carbon metabolism
    action: NEW
    reason: XoxJ is essential for activation of XoxF, the lanthanide-dependent methanol
      dehydrogenase, which catalyzes methanol oxidation to formaldehyde in the one-carbon
      metabolic pathway. By analogy to MxaJ deletion disrupting Ca-MDH activation,
      XoxJ likely plays an essential role in Ln-MDH activation.

core_functions:
- description: XoxJ functions as an enzyme activator essential for the activation
    of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase XoxF. It is co-transcribed
    with xoxF and xoxG in the xox1 operon and localizes to the periplasm via an N-terminal
    signal peptide. The crystal structure reveals a large hydrophobic cleft typical
    of periplasmic binding proteins, suggesting it may bind and deliver cofactors
    (PQQ and/or lanthanides) to XoxF or stabilize XoxF in an active conformation.
    By analogy to MxaJ in the Ca-MDH system, XoxJ is thought to be involved in the
    poorly understood activation process by which apo-XoxF acquires its cofactors
    and becomes catalytically competent. The protein is the most enigmatic member
    of the xox operon, and its precise substrate and mechanism await further characterization.

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: methanol dehydrogenase activator activity
  proposed_definition: Binds to and increases the activity of a methanol dehydrogenase,
    an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. This activity
    involves promoting the incorporation and/or proper positioning of the PQQ cofactor
    and metal ion cofactor (calcium or lanthanide) into the methanol dehydrogenase
    active site.
  proposed_parent:
    id: GO:0008047
    label: enzyme activator activity
  justification: There is currently no specific GO term for methanol dehydrogenase
    activator activity. XoxJ and its homolog MxaJ represent well-characterized examples
    of proteins with this specific molecular function. The term would be useful for
    annotating accessory proteins in both lanthanide-dependent (XoxJ) and calcium-dependent
    (MxaJ) methanol dehydrogenase systems, as demonstrated by evidence that deletion
    of mxaJ disrupts activation of Ca-MDH.

suggested_experiments:
- description: Co-crystallize XoxJ with potential substrates or cofactors (PQQ, lanthanides,
    small molecules) to identify its binding partner and elucidate the molecular basis
    of XoxF activation.
  hypothesis: XoxJ binds PQQ or lanthanide ions (or both) in its hydrophobic cleft
    and delivers them to apo-XoxF during enzyme maturation, with structural changes
    in XoxJ upon ligand binding revealing the activation mechanism.
  experiment_type: structural biology
- description: Perform in vitro reconstitution of XoxF activity from apo-XoxF, measuring
    the effect of purified XoxJ on the incorporation of PQQ and lanthanide cofactors

    (SPR) to measure binding affinities between XoxJ and potential ligands (PQQ, La³⁺,
    Ce³⁺, other lanthanides) and between XoxJ and apo-XoxF or holo-XoxF.
  hypothesis: XoxJ binds cofactors with measurable affinity and shows differential
    binding to apo- versus holo-XoxF, indicating its role in the maturation process.
