description: 'xoxJ encodes a periplasmic binding protein that plays a critical role
  in the activation of XoxF, the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase. The
  protein is part of the xox1 operon alongside xoxF (Ln-MDH) and xoxG (cytochrome
  c_L electron acceptor). XoxJ contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-26)
  targeting it to the periplasm, where it functions in enabling XoxF to catalyze methanol
  oxidation. The crystal structure (PDB: 6ONP, 2.27 Å resolution) reveals a large
  hydrophobic cleft characteristic of the periplasmic binding protein family, suggesting
  a role in substrate or cofactor binding. By analogy to MxaJ in the Ca-dependent
  system, where deletion disrupts MDH activation, XoxJ is hypothesized to facilitate
  the incorporation of PQQ and/or lanthanide cofactors into XoxF, or to maintain XoxF
  in a catalytically competent conformation. The protein contains a conserved disulfide
  bond (Cys41-Cys94) and belongs to solute-binding protein family 3. While XoxJ''s
  precise substrate and mechanism remain under investigation, it is essential for
  proper functioning of the lanthanide-dependent methanol oxidation system in the
  periplasm.'

- description: XoxJ functions as a periplasmic binding protein essential for activation
    of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase XoxF. It is co-transcribed
    with xoxF and xoxG in the xox1 operon and localizes to the periplasm via an N-terminal
    signal peptide. The crystal structure reveals a large hydrophobic cleft typical
    of periplasmic binding proteins, suggesting it may bind and deliver cofactors
    (PQQ and/or lanthanides) to XoxF or stabilize XoxF in an active conformation.
    By analogy to MxaJ in the Ca-MDH system, XoxJ is thought to be involved in the
    poorly understood activation process by which apo-XoxF acquires its cofactors
    and becomes catalytically competent. The protein is the most enigmatic member
    of the xox operon, and its precise substrate and mechanism await further characterization.
