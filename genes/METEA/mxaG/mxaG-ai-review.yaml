description: 'mxaG (also known as moxG) encodes cytochrome c_L, a specialized c-type
  cytochrome that serves as the dedicated electron acceptor for the calcium-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenase MxaFI. The protein contains heme c covalently attached and
  exhibits a redox potential of +256 mV at pH 7.0, substantially higher than the analogous
  XoxG cytochrome (+172 mV) that serves the lanthanide-dependent XoxF system. Located
  in the periplasm, MxaG accepts electrons from reduced MxaFI following methanol oxidation
  and transfers them to downstream components of the respiratory electron transport
  chain. The gene is part of the mxa operon and is subject to the same complex regulatory
  control as mxaFI, being activated by MxbM in the absence of lanthanides and repressed
  when lanthanides are present. Crystal structure has been solved at 1.60 Å resolution
  (PDB: 2C8S), revealing the molecular architecture of this electron transfer protein.'

core_functions:
- description: MxaG functions as the dedicated electron acceptor for the calcium-dependent
    methanol dehydrogenase MxaFI system. The c-type cytochrome accepts electrons from
    reduced MxaFI following methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and transfers them
    to downstream respiratory chain components. MxaG exhibits a redox potential of
    +256 mV at pH 7.0, which is optimized for efficient electron transfer from the
    calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenase system. This is notably higher than the
    +172 mV potential of XoxG, the analogous cytochrome serving the lanthanide-dependent
    XoxF system, reflecting the different biochemical properties of the two methanol
    oxidation pathways.
