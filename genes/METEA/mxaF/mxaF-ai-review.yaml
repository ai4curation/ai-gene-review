  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mxaF encodes the large subunit (α) of the calcium-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenase (MxaFI-MDH), a heterotetrameric (α₂β₂) quinoprotein enzyme that catalyzes
  the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in the periplasm. Each MxaF subunit contains
  one pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) prosthetic group and one catalytically essential
  Ca²⁺ ion. This enzyme represents the classical methanol oxidation system that is
  expressed when lanthanides are absent, as part of the lanthanide switch mechanism.
  The protein exhibits an eight-blade β-propeller fold with the PQQ and Ca²⁺ positioned
  in a deep active site cleft, and transfers electrons to cytochrome c_L (MxaG) as
  part of the periplasmic electron transport chain.

- description: Determine high-resolution crystal structures of MxaFI in complex with
    different substrate analogs and reaction intermediates to fully elucidate the
    catalytic mechanism of methanol oxidation.
  hypothesis: Structural snapshots of different catalytic states will reveal the precise
    coordination geometry of Ca²⁺ and PQQ during substrate binding, hydride transfer,
    and product release, clarifying the unique role of calcium in catalysis.
  experiment_type: structural biology
- description: Compare the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of MxaFI reconstituted with
    different divalent cations (Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺, Mg²⁺) to determine the specificity
    for calcium and identify what properties make Ca²⁺ optimal.
  hypothesis: Calcium's ionic radius and coordination geometry are optimally suited
    for positioning the substrate and stabilizing transition states, with other divalent
    cations showing reduced or absent activity.
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Use site-directed mutagenesis to systematically alter residues coordinating
    the Ca²⁺ ion and measure effects on metal binding affinity, substrate specificity,
    and catalytic turnover.
  hypothesis: Specific residues create a precisely tuned calcium binding site that
    is essential for both metal incorporation and catalytic function, with mutations
    disrupting either metal binding or catalysis.
  experiment_type: genetic manipulation
- description: Investigate the lanthanide switch mechanism by measuring the kinetics
    and transcriptional regulation of mxaF expression in response to varying concentrations
    of calcium and lanthanides in the growth medium.
  hypothesis: Lanthanide ions trigger downregulation of mxaF expression through a
    sensor-regulator system, with the switch occurring at environmentally relevant
    concentrations that favor XoxF over MxaFI for methanol oxidation.
  experiment_type: phenotypic analysis
- description: Perform quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations
    on the MxaFI active site to model the complete reaction mechanism including proton
    and electron transfer steps.
  hypothesis: Computational modeling will reveal how Ca²⁺ lowers the activation energy
    for C-H bond cleavage and facilitates hydride transfer to PQQ, explaining why
    this metal is catalytically essential.
