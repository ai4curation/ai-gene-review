description: mxaF encodes the large subunit (α) of the calcium-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenase (MxaFI-MDH), a heterotetrameric (α₂β₂) quinoprotein enzyme that catalyzes
  the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in the periplasm. Each MxaF subunit contains
  one pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) prosthetic group and one catalytically essential
  Ca²⁺ ion. This enzyme represents the classical methanol oxidation system that is
  expressed when lanthanides are absent, as part of the lanthanide switch mechanism.
  The protein exhibits an eight-blade β-propeller fold with the PQQ and Ca²⁺ positioned
  in a deep active site cleft, and transfers electrons to cytochrome c_L (MxaG) as
  part of the periplasmic electron transport chain.

  review:
    summary: Correct but overly general. MxaF possesses specific alcohol dehydrogenase
      (cytochrome c) activity with PQQ and Ca²⁺ as cofactors. The term is technically
      correct but does not capture the specific function [file:METEA/mxaF/mxaF-claude-deep-research.md,
