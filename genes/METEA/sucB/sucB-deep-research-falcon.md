## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):

- **Key Domains:** 2-oxoA_DH_lipoyl-BS. (IPR003016); 2-oxoacid_dehydrogenase. (IPR050537); 2-oxoacid_DH_actylTfrase. (IPR001078); Biotin_lipoyl. (IPR000089); CAT-like_dom_sf. (IPR023213)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "sucB" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Methylorubrum extorquens (strain ATCC 14718 / DSM 1338 / JCM 2805 / NCIMB 9133 / AM1) (Methylobacterium extorquens).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'sucB' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **sucB** (gene ID: sucB, UniProt: C5B053) in METEA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: Functional annotation of sucB (UniProt C5B053) from Methylorubrum extorquens AM1

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and family
  • sucB encodes the E2 dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase (also termed DLST or E2o) subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc), a member of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase superfamily. In bacteria, the OGDHc is typically encoded by sucA (E1o, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), sucB (E2o), and lpd (E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase). This organization and naming are demonstrated experimentally in closely related Alphaproteobacteria (e.g., Sinorhizobium meliloti), providing strong orthology-based confirmation of sucB’s identity and role as E2o in M. extorquens AM1 (OGDHc core-forming E2, lipoyl-lysine catalytic arm) (URL: n/a, thesis; 2014) (meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101) (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19).

- Catalyzed reaction (EC 2.3.1.61) and mechanism
  • The OGDHc converts 2-oxoglutarate + CoA + NAD+ → succinyl‑CoA + CO2 + NADH. Mechanistically: E1o (ThDP-dependent) decarboxylates 2‑oxoglutarate, transferring a succinyl moiety to the lipoyl-lysine on E2o; E2o catalyzes succinyl transfer to CoA (forming succinyl‑CoA); E3 reoxidizes the dihydrolipoyl to lipoamide with reduction of NAD+ to NADH. E2o (sucB product) is the succinyltransferase that harbors the swinging lipoyl arm central to substrate channeling (URL: n/a, thesis; 2014) (meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101) (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19).

- Domain architecture and lipoylation
  • Canonical E2o proteins are modular: an N‑terminal lipoyl domain (LD) bearing the modified lysine (lipoyl‑lysine), a flexible linker, a peripheral subunit‑binding domain (PSBD) that docks E1/E3, and a C‑terminal catalytic inner core (ICD) that oligomerizes to form the E2 core. Bacterial/archaeal E2o proteins possess a PSBD that recruits E3 via electrostatic contacts; the LD shuttles intermediates between E1 and E2 active sites (bioRxiv preprint; Oct 2022) (hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2). 
  • Lipoylation pathways: In many bacteria, LipB transfers octanoyl from octanoyl‑ACP to the E2 LD (or GcvH), and LipA (radical SAM enzyme) inserts the two sulfurs to form lipoyl-lysine; alternative relay pathways use LipM/LipL, and salvage uses LplA/LplJ to ligate lipoate/octanoate with pathway-specific determinants (e.g., a Glu three residues N‑terminal to the acceptor Lys governs ligase specificity). LipA is low-abundance (~1,100 molecules/cell in E. coli) relative to E2 substrates (~25,000 molecules), requiring in vivo reconstitution of its auxiliary Fe–S cluster by NfuA/IscU; these data underpin the catalytic nature of lipoylation in cells (MMBR review; Jun 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00005-24) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 12-14). Lipoate transport/labeling and enzymatic lipoamidase removal tools are also reviewed (MMBR; 2024) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 14-16).

- Cellular role and localization
  • The OGDHc is a central TCA cycle enzyme producing succinyl‑CoA and NADH. The E2o subunit (sucB) forms the multimeric core scaffold that organizes E1o and E3 for efficient substrate channeling (thesis background; 2012/2014) (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101). In eukaryotes OGDHc resides in mitochondria; in bacteria it operates in the cytosol as a soluble megacomplex (supported by bacterial E2 architecture and assembly data) (hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Native mammalian OGDHc architecture and E2o core
  • Cryo‑EM/cryo‑ET of native mammalian OGDHc (Sus scrofa) resolved a 24‑mer E2o cubic core (eight homotrimers) at 3.3 Å and mapped the variable, yet patterned, positions of peripheral E1o/E3 around the core. The work highlights conserved modular E2o features (LD, ICD, flexible linkers), and proposes that in mammals E1o’s dual subunit‑binding domain substitutes for a canonical bacterial‑type PSBD. Peripheral subunit numbers/positions vary among complexes, revealing dynamic assembly and suggesting regulation by subunit stoichiometry and LD mobility (Nat Commun; Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52792-7) (zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2).

- Endogenous eukaryotic OGDHc: LD dynamics, tethering, stoichiometry
  • A 4‑MDa native OGDHc from Chaetomium thermophilum showed a 24‑mer E2o core at 3.35 Å; crosslinking and modeling revealed that LDs sample peripheral E1o/E3 via electrostatic interactions and that linkers operate between “stretched” and “constricted” regimes consistent with dynamic substrate channeling. Peripheral subunits were substoichiometric (e.g., <10 E1o dimers; ~4 E3 tethered via an E3BP‑like subunit), appearing in clustered peripheral densities around the E2 core (Commun Biol; May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-04885-0) (skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 2-3, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 10-11, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 6-8).

- Bacterial/actinobacterial contrasts: fused OdhA and altered E2 architectures
  • In Actinobacteria, OGDH chemistry can be performed by OdhA, a fused “two‑in‑one” E1o–E2o enzyme that assembles as an ~800‑kDa homohexamer with a three‑blade propeller architecture rather than a 24‑mer E2 core. Structural snapshots resolved CoA/succinyl‑CoA poses in the E2o active site and described allosteric regulation via the OdhI FHA protein. These features exemplify diversity in E2 organization and E1/E2 coupling across bacteria (Nat Commun; Aug 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40253-6; bioRxiv preprint; Feb 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.23.529587) (yang2023highresolutioncryoem pages 7-8, yang2023highresolutioncryoema pages 4-7, yang2023highresolutioncryoema pages 12-14).

- Eukaryotic innovations in peripheral subunit recruitment
  • A 2022 preprint proposes that eukaryotic OGDHc lacks the canonical PSBD in E2o and recruits E3 via MRPS36 acting as an adaptor, revising stoichiometry and topology models (bioRxiv; Oct 2022; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.08.511390) (hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Lipoylation pathway engineering and chemical biology
  • Lipoylation enzymes and E2 LDs are exploited as tools: engineered LplA variants can site‑specifically install bioorthogonal tags for protein localization or interaction studies; lipoamidases remove lipoyl groups. These microbial lipoylation systems have been adapted across domains and are being extended (e.g., new lipoyl assembly routes and salvage strategies), offering routes to probe or modulate E2 function and OGDHc activity in vivo (MMBR; 2024; https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00005-24) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 14-16, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 12-14).

- Structural blueprints enabling mechanistic and therapeutic insight
  • High‑resolution E2o core structures and maps of LD dynamics/peripheral docking now provide quantitative constraints for kinetic models of substrate channeling, and may inform inhibitor design that targets E2o–E1o/E3 interfaces, LD docking grooves, or lipoylation pathways (Nat Commun 2024; Commun Biol 2023) (zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 10-11, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 2-3).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Centrality and essentiality of OGDHc, and the E2o role
  • Authoritative reviews emphasize lipoylation as essential for the activity of 2‑oxoacid dehydrogenases and highlight variations in lipoylation pathways and specificities that map to E2 domain features (MMBR; 2024) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 4-7). 
  • Structural studies underscore a conserved 24‑mer E2o core in many organisms, with dynamic, substoichiometric peripheral subunits and highly mobile LDs that likely gate flux and channeling efficiency (Nat Commun 2024; Commun Biol 2023) (zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 2-3). 
  • Bacterial diversity exists: actinobacterial OdhA fusion architectures modify E2 oligomerization logic and regulatory couplings, illustrating evolutionary plasticity at the oxoglutarate node (Nat Commun; 2023) (yang2023highresolutioncryoem pages 7-8). 

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Stoichiometry and architecture
  • E2o core: 24 subunits as eight homotrimers (3.3 Å), peripheral E1/E3 positions variable but patterned (Nat Commun; 2024) (zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2). 
  • Endogenous eukaryotic OGDHc: confirmed 24‑mer core; peripheral subunits substoichiometric with estimates of <10 E1o dimers and ~4 E3 tethered via E3BP‑like subunits, arranged in clustered peripheral densities (Commun Biol; 2023) (skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 6-8, skalidis2023structuralanalysisof pages 10-11). 

- Lipoylation system capacity
  • In E. coli, LipA abundance (~1,100 molecules) is far below that of its E2 substrates (~25,000 molecules), necessitating catalytic turnover and auxiliary Fe–S cluster repair (MMBR; 2024) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 12-14). 

Organism-specific perspective: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
- Verification and function
  • The sucB gene in Alphaproteobacteria encodes the E2o (DLST) succinyltransferase of OGDHc; genetic and biochemical work in S. meliloti demonstrates that sucB forms the OGDHc core with lipoyl‑lysine chemistry and couples to sucA and lpd for 2‑oxoglutarate oxidation to succinyl‑CoA/NADH—an arrangement conserved across related taxa, supporting the assignment for M. extorquens AM1 (thesis; 2012/2014) (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101). 

- Pathway context and localization
  • In M. extorquens, OGDHc activity (sucA–sucB–lpd) is expected to operate in the cytosol as part of the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle to supply succinyl‑CoA and NADH during growth on multi‑carbon substrates; the E2o core serves as the scaffold for E1/E3 and requires lipoylation for activity, as in other bacteria (MMBR; 2024; and bacterial E2 architecture background) (cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2).

- Domains/family
  • Based on conserved bacterial E2 architecture, the sucB product should contain an N‑terminal lipoyl domain (bearing the modified lysine), a flexible linker, a PSBD for E1/E3 docking (in bacteria), and a catalytic CAT‑family acyltransferase core forming the 24‑mer assembly (bioRxiv preprint; 2022; Nat Commun 2024) (hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2, zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2).

- Experimental implications
  • Genetic disruption of sucB in related Alphaproteobacteria reduces OGDH activity and perturbs central metabolism, underscoring E2o’s essential catalytic role and the requirement for proper lipoylation (thesis; 2014) (meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106). 

Limitations and data gaps
- Direct AM1-specific primary studies pinpointing sucB locus essentiality/localization were not retrieved here; conclusions for AM1 are drawn from conserved pathway organization in closely related Alphaproteobacteria and general bacterial OGDHc architecture and lipoylation principles (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2).

Compliance with critical verification steps
- Gene symbol and organism: The evidence base confirms that bacterial sucB encodes the E2 component of OGDHc; this is consistent with the provided UniProt entry for M. extorquens AM1 and with conserved Alphaproteobacterial organization (maleh2012geneticanalysisof pages 13-19, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 101-106, meek2014thebiochemicaland pages 91-101). 
- Protein family/domains: E2o domain composition (LD, PSBD in bacteria, catalytic core) and lipoylation requirement are supported by reviews and recent structural work (hevler2022mrps36providesa pages 1-2, cronan2024lipoicacidattachment pages 2-4, zhang2024moleculararchitectureof pages 1-2). 
- No conflicting “sucB” usage was identified in unrelated proteins within this scope.
