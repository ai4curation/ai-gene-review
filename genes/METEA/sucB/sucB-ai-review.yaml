    9133 / AM1)
description: >-
  Dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase (E2 component) of the 2-oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase (OGDH) complex. This enzyme catalyzes the second step in the conversion
  of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO2, transferring a succinyl group from
  succinyl-dihydrolipoamide to coenzyme A. The E2 subunit forms a 24-polypeptide
  structural core with octahedral symmetry, onto which the E1 (2-oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase) and E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) components assemble.
  Contains a lipoyl-binding domain (residues 2-77) and a peripheral subunit-binding
  domain (PSBD, residues 143-180). This is a core TCA cycle enzyme with EC 2.3.1.61.
  Note: The iRP911 GEM (2011) had this gene with noEC, but UniProt now correctly
  assigns EC 2.3.1.61, representing a GEM_MISSING_EC case that should be updated.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Cytosol annotation inferred from TreeGrafter phylogenetic analysis. For bacteria
      like Methylorubrum extorquens, the OGDH complex is located in the cytoplasm/cytosol
      as bacteria lack mitochondria. In eukaryotes, this enzyme is mitochondrial, but the
      bacterial homolog would indeed be cytosolic. Deep research confirms that in bacteria
      OGDHc operates in the cytosol as a soluble megacomplex.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Appropriate cellular localization for a bacterial TCA cycle enzyme. Bacteria lack
      membrane-bound organelles, so the OGDH complex operates in the cytosol. The
      TreeGrafter annotation is consistent with expected bacterial cell biology.

      This is the precise molecular function for the E2 component of the OGDH complex.
      GO:0004149 catalyzes the reaction: N(6)-[(R)-dihydrolipoyl]-L-lysyl-[protein] +
      succinyl-CoA = N(6)-[(R)-S(8)-succinyldihydrolipoyl]-L-lysyl-[protein] + CoA.
      This corresponds exactly to EC 2.3.1.61 assigned to this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core molecular function of the E2 subunit. UniProt assigns EC 2.3.1.61 with
      evidence from ARBA and RuleBase. The protein contains the characteristic
      lipoyl-binding domain (residues 2-77) required for this catalytic activity.
      InterPro signature IPR006255 (SucB) specifically identifies this as the E2
      succinyltransferase component.

  review:
    summary: >-
      The OGDH complex is a central enzyme of the TCA cycle, catalyzing the conversion
      of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. This is one of the irreversible, regulated
      steps of the TCA cycle.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Core biological process for this enzyme. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex
      is essential for TCA cycle function, converting 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate)
      to succinyl-CoA. UniProt explicitly annotates this protein with the "Tricarboxylic
      acid cycle" keyword. This is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved function.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: >-
      This is the root transferase activity term, representing a very general
      classification. The protein does have transferase activity (it transfers
      succinyl groups), but GO:0004149 is far more informative.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this is a very general term, it is technically correct and derived from
      UniProtKB keyword mapping. The more specific term GO:0004149 is also annotated,
      so this general term provides correct hierarchical coverage. For IEA annotations
      from keyword mapping, general terms are acceptable as they are part of the
      standard annotation pipeline.

  review:
    summary: >-
      Acyltransferase activity is an intermediate-level term between transferase
      activity and the specific dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase
      activity. The E2 subunit does transfer an acyl (succinyl) group.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Correct intermediate-level molecular function. The protein is annotated with
      the "Acyltransferase" keyword in UniProt. The succinyl group transferred is
      indeed an acyl group, making this annotation accurate. InterPro signatures
      IPR001078 (2-oxoacid_DH_actylTfrase) and IPR004167 (PSBD) support this function.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation derives from UniPathway UPA00868 which indicates the saccharopine
      pathway for lysine degradation. The OGDH complex can participate in lysine
      catabolism because 2-oxoglutarate is an intermediate, and the 2-oxoadipate
      dehydrogenase complex (structurally related to OGDH) uses the same E2 subunit
      in some organisms.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      This is a secondary metabolic role, not the core TCA cycle function. While the
      UniPathway annotation indicates step 6/6 in the lysine degradation pathway
      (glutaryl-CoA from L-lysine), this represents a peripheral function. The
      saccharopine pathway is more prominent in eukaryotes, and it is unclear how
      significant this pathway is in Methylorubrum extorquens. The core function
      remains TCA cycle participation. This annotation should be retained but
      recognized as non-core.
