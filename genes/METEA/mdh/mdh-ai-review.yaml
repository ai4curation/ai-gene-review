description: "mdh encodes NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), which\
  \ catalyzes the reversible oxidation of (S)-malate (L-malate) to oxaloacetate with\
  \ concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This is a critical step in the tricarboxylic\
  \ acid (TCA) cycle that regenerates oxaloacetate for continued TCA cycle operation.\
  \ The enzyme belongs to the LDH/MDH superfamily, specifically the MDH type 3 family.\
  \ In methylotrophs, Mdh plays a crucial role in completing the TCA cycle: carbon\
  \ flowing from C1 compounds through the serine cycle \u2192 glycolysis \u2192 acetyl-CoA\
  \ enters the TCA cycle via citrate synthase, and Mdh regenerates oxaloacetate from\
  \ malate (produced by fumarase), closing the cycle. The oxaloacetate product can\
  \ then react with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to continue the TCA cycle, or can\
  \ be diverted to gluconeogenesis via pckA. The enzyme is NAD-dependent (not NADP-dependent\
  \ like some other MDH isoforms) and functions in the cytoplasm. The reaction is\
  \ reversible, allowing Mdh to function in both the oxidative direction (malate \u2192\
  \ oxaloacetate during TCA cycle flux) and the reductive direction (oxaloacetate\
  \ \u2192 malate for anaplerotic or biosynthetic purposes). Mdh is essential for\
  \ both energy production through complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA and for maintaining\
  \ the supply of oxaloacetate needed for continued carbon assimilation."

  review:
    summary: This is an extremely general parent term for all enzymes. While technically
      correct, the specific term GO:0030060 (L-malate dehydrogenase activity) provides
      precise functional annotation.

  review:
    summary: This annotation is incorrect. This protein is malate dehydrogenase (EC
      1.1.1.37), not lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). The enzyme catalyzes the
      oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, not lactate to pyruvate. This appears to
      be a misannotation by TreeGrafter. [file:METEA/mdh/mdh-uniprot.txt, "Malate

  review:
    summary: This annotation is incorrect. This enzyme metabolizes malate, not lactate.
      This appears to be a misannotation by TreeGrafter, likely due to the structural
      similarity between the LDH/MDH superfamily members. [file:METEA/mdh/mdh-uniprot.txt,

  review:
    summary: This accurately describes the enzymatic mechanism - Mdh is an oxidoreductase
      that acts on the CH-OH group of malate, using NAD+ as the electron acceptor.

    summary: This is a very general parent term that is correct but not informative.
      Malate is a carboxylic acid, but more specific terms about TCA cycle would be
      more useful.
