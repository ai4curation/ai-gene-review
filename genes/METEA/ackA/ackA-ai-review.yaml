description: 'ackA encodes acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1), also known as acetokinase,
  which catalyzes the reversible Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation of acetate to acetyl
  phosphate using ATP as the phosphate donor. This is the first step of the two-step
  ack-pta pathway for acetate assimilation: acetate is first converted to acetyl phosphate
  by AckA, and then pta (phosphate acetyltransferase) converts acetyl phosphate to
  acetyl-CoA. The enzyme belongs to the acetokinase family and functions as a homodimer
  in the cytosol. AckA can use either Mg2+ or Mn2+ as a metal cofactor, though Mg2+
  is preferred. In methylotrophs, this pathway may be involved in overflow metabolism
  when acetate accumulates, or in scavenging environmental acetate as an alternative
  carbon source. The reversibility of the reaction also allows AckA to function in
  ATP generation from acetyl phosphate during overflow metabolism. The ack-pta pathway
  provides a metabolic route connecting acetate to central metabolism via acetyl-CoA,
  enabling utilization of C2 compounds for growth and energy production.'

core_functions:
- description: AckA catalyzes the ATP- and Mg2+-dependent reversible phosphorylation
    of acetate to acetyl phosphate, the first step of the two-step ack-pta pathway
    for acetate assimilation. This reaction enables M. extorquens to utilize acetate
    as an alternative carbon source by converting it to acetyl-CoA (via pta), which
    can then enter central metabolism. The enzyme functions as a homodimer in the
    cytosol and can use either Mg2+ or Mn2+ as metal cofactor. The reversibility of
    the reaction also allows AckA to function in ATP generation from acetyl phosphate
    during overflow metabolism when acetyl-CoA accumulates. The ack-pta pathway represents
    an important metabolic flexibility mechanism, allowing the organism to both assimilate
    environmental acetate and manage metabolic overflow of C2 compounds.
