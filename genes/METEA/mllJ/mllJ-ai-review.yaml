  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: DUF4142 domain-containing protein (mllJ) with TAT (twin-arginine 
  translocation) signal peptide for export to periplasm. Contains ferritin-like 
  domain. Part of mll gene cluster (META1p4129-4138) showing 32-fold 
  upregulation with poorly soluble lanthanides. Likely involved in periplasmic 
  processing or transport of metallophore.
