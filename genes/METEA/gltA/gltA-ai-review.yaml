description: 'gltA encodes citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.16), which catalyzes the first
  and committed step of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: the condensation of acetyl-CoA
  and oxaloacetate with water to form citrate and free coenzyme A. This reaction represents
  the entry point for acetyl groups into the TCA cycle and is a major regulatory step
  in central carbon metabolism. The enzyme belongs to the citrate synthase family
  and functions in the cytoplasm. In methylotrophs, gltA plays a crucial role in channeling
  carbon from C1 compounds into the TCA cycle: methanol-derived carbon flows through
  the serine cycle → glycolysis → pyruvate → acetyl-CoA, and gltA condenses this acetyl-CoA
  with oxaloacetate to initiate the TCA cycle. The enzyme catalyzes step 1/2 in the
  conversion of oxaloacetate to isocitrate, with the citrate product being subsequently
  isomerized to isocitrate by aconitase. GltA is essential for both energy production
  (through complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle) and biosynthesis (by
  generating TCA cycle intermediates as biosynthetic precursors). The reaction is
  essentially irreversible under physiological conditions, making it a key control
  point for regulating carbon flow into the TCA cycle.'
