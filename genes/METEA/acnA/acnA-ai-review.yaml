description: 'acnA encodes aconitate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.3), also known as aconitase,
  which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate to D-threo-isocitrate via
  the intermediate cis-aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This is step
  2/2 in the conversion of oxaloacetate to isocitrate, linking citrate synthase (gltA)
  to isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd). The enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster
  that is essential for catalytic activity and functions as a monomer. In methylotrophs,
  AcnA plays a crucial role in the TCA cycle when carbon flows from C1 compounds through
  the serine cycle and glycolysis into acetyl-CoA: citrate (produced by gltA) is isomerized
  to isocitrate (substrate for icd). The enzyme also participates in propionate degradation
  via the 2-methylcitrate cycle, catalyzing the hydration of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate
  to (2R,3S)-2-methylisocitrate (EC 4.2.1.99). Interestingly, the apo form of AcnA
  (lacking the iron-sulfur cluster) can function as an RNA-binding regulatory protein,
  providing a post-transcriptional iron-sensing mechanism similar to eukaryotic aconitases/IRPs.
  AcnA belongs to the aconitase/IPM isomerase family and is essential for both energy
  production through the TCA cycle and catabolism of short-chain fatty acids.'
