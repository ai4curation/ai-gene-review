description: 'pta encodes phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8), which catalyzes
  the second and final step of the ack-pta pathway for acetate assimilation: the reversible
  conversion of acetyl phosphate to acetyl-CoA using coenzyme A as the acyl acceptor.
  Working in tandem with ackA (acetate kinase), this two-step pathway enables M. extorquens
  to convert acetate into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter central metabolism via
  the TCA cycle. Pta belongs to the phosphate acetyl/butaryl transferase family and
  contains the characteristic PTA_PTB domain (residues 81-297) responsible for the
  acyltransferase activity. The enzyme can function bidirectionally: in the forward
  direction it synthesizes acetyl-CoA from acetyl phosphate (acetate assimilation),
  while in the reverse direction it can generate acetyl phosphate from acetyl-CoA
  (overflow metabolism). This metabolic flexibility allows the organism to both utilize
  environmental acetate as a carbon source and manage metabolic overflow of acetyl-CoA
  by converting it to the high-energy intermediate acetyl phosphate. The ack-pta pathway
  provides an alternative route to the more common acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs) for
  acetate activation, and may be particularly important during growth on mixed carbon
  sources or when managing metabolic imbalances.'

  review:
    summary: This is the primary and specific catalytic activity of Pta - the reversible
      transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl phosphate to CoA, producing acetyl-CoA
      and inorganic phosphate. This completes the second step of the ack-pta pathway
      for acetate assimilation. [file:METEA/pta/pta-uniprot.txt, "Phosphate acetyltransferase";

  review:
    summary: This is a very general parent term for all enzymes that catalyze the
      transfer of functional groups. While technically correct, the more specific
      terms like GO:0008959 and GO:0016746 provide much better functional annotation.

  review:
    summary: This accurately describes the enzymatic mechanism - Pta is an acyltransferase
      that transfers the acetyl group from acetyl phosphate to CoA. This is a more
      general mechanistic description than the specific GO:0008959 term. [file:METEA/pta/pta-uniprot.txt,

core_functions:
- description: Pta catalyzes the reversible transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl
    phosphate to coenzyme A, producing acetyl-CoA and inorganic phosphate. This is
    the second and final step of the ack-pta pathway for acetate assimilation, working
    downstream of ackA (acetate kinase). The complete pathway enables M. extorquens
    to utilize acetate as an alternative carbon source by converting it to acetyl-CoA
    for entry into central metabolism. The enzyme contains a phosphate acetyl/butaryl
    transferase domain and can function bidirectionally, allowing it to also participate
    in overflow metabolism by converting excess acetyl-CoA to the high-energy intermediate
    acetyl phosphate. Together with ackA, Pta provides metabolic flexibility for managing
    both acetate assimilation and acetyl-CoA homeostasis during growth on various
    carbon sources.
