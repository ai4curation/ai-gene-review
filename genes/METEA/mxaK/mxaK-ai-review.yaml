  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: mxaK encodes a membrane protein of 208 amino acids that is part of the
  mxa operon involved in calcium-dependent methanol oxidation in Methylorubrum extorquens
  AM1. The protein contains a single transmembrane helix (residues 32-52). MxaK is
  one of three genes (mxaA, mxaK, mxaL) involved in incorporation of calcium into
  methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Mutant studies demonstrate that mxaK is essential
  for production of active MDH - MDH from mxaK deletion mutants is inactive but can
  be reconstituted in vitro by incubation with Ca2+ at pH 9.5. MxaK is proposed to
  function as a molecular chaperone that stabilizes a configuration of MDH which permits
  incorporation of Ca2+ into the enzyme at physiological concentrations. Without MxaK
  (and MxaA/MxaL), MDH cannot properly incorporate the essential calcium cofactor
  required for methanol oxidation activity.

  review:
    summary: MxaK contains a predicted transmembrane helix (residues 32-52) based
      on sequence analysis, consistent with membrane localization. This structural
      feature is appropriate for a protein involved in periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase
      assembly.

core_functions:
- description: MxaK functions as a molecular chaperone required for calcium incorporation
    into methanol dehydrogenase. It stabilizes a configuration of MDH that permits
    Ca2+ insertion at physiological concentrations. MxaK is essential for producing
    catalytically active MDH - deletion mutants produce inactive enzyme that can only
    be reconstituted by high pH calcium incubation in vitro. The protein is a single-pass
    transmembrane protein, likely facilitating Ca2+ delivery or MDH assembly at the
    membrane-periplasm interface during methanol oxidation.

suggested_experiments:
- description: Determine the crystal structure of MxaK in complex with methanol dehydrogenase
    (MxaFI) to reveal the molecular mechanism of how MxaK stabilizes MDH configuration
    for calcium incorporation.
  hypothesis: MxaK interacts directly with specific regions of MDH, inducing conformational
    changes that create or stabilize the calcium binding site, with the transmembrane
    domain potentially facilitating membrane association during assembly.
  experiment_type: structural biology
- description: Perform in vitro reconstitution experiments with purified MxaK, MxaA,
    MxaL, and apoMDH to determine the order of assembly and calcium insertion, measuring
    binding affinities and kinetics of each step.
  hypothesis: MxaK, MxaA, and MxaL function sequentially or cooperatively to create
    a competent calcium binding site in MDH, with MxaK acting as the primary chaperone
    that initiates the assembly process.
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Use site-directed mutagenesis to identify critical residues in MxaK
    required for MDH interaction and calcium incorporation activity, testing mutants
    for complementation of mxaK deletion phenotype.
  hypothesis: Specific residues in the periplasmic domain of MxaK mediate direct
    contact with MDH and are essential for chaperone function, while the transmembrane
    domain positions the protein appropriately at the membrane.
  experiment_type: genetic manipulation
- description: Investigate whether MxaK has calcium binding activity itself using
    ITC or fluorescence-based calcium binding assays, and test if calcium binding
    to MxaK is required for its chaperone function.
  hypothesis: MxaK may transiently bind calcium and deliver it to the MDH active
    site, or alternatively, MxaK may create a calcium-accessible conformation in
    MDH without directly binding the metal.
  experiment_type: biochemical assay
- description: Use cross-linking mass spectrometry to map protein-protein interaction
    interfaces between MxaK, MxaA, MxaL, and MDH during the calcium incorporation
    process.
  hypothesis: MxaK forms a transient multi-protein complex with MxaA, MxaL, and MDH,
    with specific interaction interfaces that can be mapped to understand the assembly
    mechanism.
  experiment_type: proteomics
