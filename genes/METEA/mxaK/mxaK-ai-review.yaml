description: mxaK encodes a membrane-associated protein of 208 amino acids that is
  part of the mxa operon involved in calcium-dependent methanol oxidation. The protein
  contains a single transmembrane helix (residues 32-52), indicating it spans the
  membrane once and likely anchors a soluble domain to the membrane surface. Based
  on its genomic location within the mxa operon, mxaK is co-regulated with other methanol
  oxidation genes and likely plays an accessory role in the Ca-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenase system. The precise molecular function of MxaK has not been experimentally
  determined. Given its membrane-spanning topology and genomic context, MxaK may be
  involved in organizing, stabilizing, or regulating components of the Ca-MDH system
  at the membrane interface. The protein shows limited sequence similarity to other
  characterized proteins, making functional prediction challenging. Experimental studies
  are needed to elucidate its specific role in methylotrophic metabolism.

- description: MxaK is a single-pass transmembrane protein of unknown precise function
    that is part of the mxa operon for calcium-dependent methanol oxidation. The protein's
    membrane-spanning topology suggests it may anchor or organize components of the
    Ca-MDH system at the membrane. Its genomic location within the mxa operon indicates
    it is co-regulated with other methanol oxidation genes and likely contributes
    to Ca-MDH system function, though the specific molecular mechanism remains to
    be experimentally determined. MxaK may play a structural, regulatory, or assembly
    role in the methanol oxidation machinery.
