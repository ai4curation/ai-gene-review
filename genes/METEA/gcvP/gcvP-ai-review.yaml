description: 'gcvP encodes glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (EC 1.4.4.2), also
  known as glycine cleavage system P protein, which catalyzes the first step of the
  glycine cleavage system. The P protein binds the alpha-amino group of glycine through
  its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor (at Lys-699), cleaves the C-C bond to release CO2,
  and transfers the remaining methylamine moiety to the lipoamide cofactor of the
  H protein (gcvH). This initiates the oxidative decarboxylation of glycine, which
  is then completed by the T and L proteins to produce 5,10-methylene-THF, CO2, and
  ammonia. The enzyme belongs to the GcvP family and functions as a component of the
  four-protein glycine cleavage complex (P, T, L, and H). In methylotrophs, the glycine
  cleavage system connects the serine cycle to the THF one-carbon pool: glycine (produced
  from serine by serA) is oxidatively cleaved by the GCV system, generating 5,10-methylene-THF
  that feeds into C1 metabolism. GcvP is a large protein (948 AA) with three characteristic
  domains: two N-terminal glycine cleavage system P-protein domains (residues 14-438
  and 474-721) and a C-terminal domain (residues 766-887). The enzyme is essential
  for glycine catabolism and for recycling one-carbon units during methylotrophic
  growth.'
