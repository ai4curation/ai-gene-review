description: 'gcvH encodes the glycine cleavage system H protein, a small (120 AA)
  lipoyl-carrier protein that shuttles intermediates between the P, T, and L proteins
  of the glycine cleavage complex. The H protein binds one lipoyl cofactor covalently
  (at Lys-58) and functions as a mobile carrier that accepts the aminomethyl group
  from the P protein (gcvP, glycine dehydrogenase) and transfers it to the T protein
  (gcvT, aminomethyltransferase). The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative
  decarboxylation of glycine to produce 5,10-methylene-THF, CO2, and ammonia. In methylotrophs,
  this system connects the serine cycle to the THF one-carbon pool: glycine (produced
  from serine) is cleaved by the GCV system, generating 5,10-methylene-THF that feeds
  into C1 metabolism. GcvH belongs to the GcvH family and functions in the cytoplasm
  as part of the four-protein glycine cleavage complex (P, T, L, and H). The lipoyl
  group undergoes cycles of reduction and oxidation as intermediates are transferred
  between the complex components. GcvH is essential for glycine catabolism and for
  recycling one-carbon units during methylotrophic growth.'
