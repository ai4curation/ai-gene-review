description: xoxG encodes a specialized c-type cytochrome (cytochrome c_L) that 
  serves as the dedicated electron acceptor for XoxF-type lanthanide-dependent 
  methanol dehydrogenases. The protein contains heme c covalently attached via 
  the CXXCH motif and exhibits an unusually low reduction potential (+172 mV at 
  pH 7.0), substantially lower than the analogous MxaG cytochrome (+256 mV) that
  serves the calcium-dependent MxaFI system. Located in the periplasm, XoxG 
  accepts electrons from reduced XoxF following methanol oxidation and transfers
  them to cytochrome c_H in the respiratory electron transport chain. The gene 
  is organized within the xox1 operon (xoxF1-xoxG-xoxJ) and is subject to 
  lanthanide-responsive regulation as part of the lanthanide switch mechanism. 
  XoxG is absolutely essential for XoxF activity with no functional redundancy 
  from other cytochromes.
