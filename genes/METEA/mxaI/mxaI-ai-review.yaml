description: mxaI encodes the small subunit (β) of the calcium-dependent methanol
  dehydrogenase (MxaFI-MDH), a heterotetrameric (α₂β₂) enzyme. MxaI is a small protein
  of approximately 69 amino acids (~8.5 kDa) that tightly wraps around the MxaF large
  subunit, forming an essentially inseparable complex. While the precise function
  of MxaI remains unclear, it is not required for catalytic activity per se, as active
  MxaF enzymes lacking MxaI have been purified. MxaI likely plays structural, stability,
  or assembly roles rather than direct participation in catalysis. The small subunit
  can only efficiently associate with MxaF after PQQ incorporation, suggesting it
  may stabilize the properly configured active site. MxaI is unique to MxaFI-type
  calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenases and is not found in XoxF-type lanthanide-dependent
  enzymes or other quinoproteins.

  review:
    summary: Incorrect - MxaI is a non-catalytic structural subunit that does not
      possess enzymatic activity. The catalytic activity resides entirely in MxaF.
      Additionally, this term is doubly wrong because methanol dehydrogenase uses
      PQQ, not NAD+, as its cofactor [file:METEA/mxaI/mxaI-claude-deep-research.md,
      "MxaI does not directly participate in substrate binding or catalysis"].

core_functions:
- description: MxaI serves as a structural subunit of the MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase
    heterotetrameric complex. The small subunit tightly wraps around the MxaF large
    subunit, forming an essentially inseparable complex. While MxaI's precise function
    remains unclear and it is not absolutely required for catalytic activity, it likely
    plays roles in enzyme stability, proper quaternary structure organization, or
    protection from proteolysis. MxaI can only efficiently associate with MxaF after
    PQQ incorporation, suggesting it may stabilize the properly configured active
    site.

      have been purified before, suggesting that this subunit is not always essential
      for enzyme activity per se
