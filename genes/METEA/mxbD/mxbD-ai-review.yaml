description: 'Sensor histidine kinase (MxbD) component of the MxbDM two-component
  regulatory system required for methanol oxidation. Contains two transmembrane domains
  and HAMP, HisKA, and HATPase_c domains. Functions in lanthanide-dependent regulation:
  works with MxbM response regulator to control expression of methanol oxidation genes.
  Part of regulatory hierarchy where MxcQE controls MxbDM expression, and MxbDM in
  turn controls methanol oxidation genes. In lanthanide-dependent switch, MxbDM represses
  xox1 operon in absence of lanthanides.'
