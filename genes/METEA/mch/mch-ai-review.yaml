description: mch encodes methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.27),
  which catalyzes the third step in formaldehyde degradation via the H4MPT route.
  The enzyme hydrolyzes 5,10-methenyl-H4MPT⁺ (the product of mtdB) to N5-formyl-H4MPT,
  continuing the oxidation pathway from formaldehyde toward formate. Mch functions
  as a homodimer in the cytoplasm with optimal activity at pH 8.5 and 40°C, and requires
  salt for optimal activity. This enzyme is part of a conserved C1 transfer pathway
  that links methylotrophic bacteria to methanogenic archaea. Direct protein sequencing
  has confirmed the enzyme's N-terminal sequence, and it belongs to the MCH family
  of cyclohydrolases. Together with fae (step 1), mtdB (step 2), and subsequent enzymes
  in the pathway, Mch completes the essential formaldehyde detoxification and oxidation
  system in methylotrophic metabolism.

core_functions:
- description: Mch catalyzes the third step in the H4MPT-dependent formaldehyde degradation
    pathway by hydrolyzing 5,10-methenyl-H4MPT+ (the product of mtdB dehydrogenase)
    to N5-formyl-H4MPT. The enzyme functions as a homodimer with optimal activity
    at pH 8.5 and 40°C, and requires salt for optimal activity. Mch is part of a conserved
    C1 transfer pathway shared between methylotrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea,
    highlighting the evolutionary significance of this metabolic route. Direct protein
    sequencing has confirmed the enzyme's identity. The reaction continues the oxidation
    of formaldehyde toward formate, with Mch serving as the critical third enzyme
    in the five-step pathway after fae (formaldehyde activation) and mtdB (methylene-H4MPT
    oxidation).
