description: "glyA encodes serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1), a pyridoxal\
  \ 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion\
  \ of serine and glycine with tetrahydrofolate (THF). This reaction is crucial for\
  \ the serine cycle, the central assimilatory pathway in methylotrophy, where it\
  \ serves as the major source of one-carbon groups required for biosynthesis of purines,\
  \ thymidylate, methionine, and other biomolecules. The enzyme functions as a homodimer\
  \ in the cytoplasm. SHMT catalyzes: L-serine + THF \u21CC glycine + 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate\
  \ + H\u2082O. In methylotrophic metabolism, this enzyme is essential for converting\
  \ C1 units from formaldehyde oxidation (via the H4MPT pathway) into the tetrahydrofolate\
  \ pool, where they are used for serine biosynthesis from glycine, completing a key\
  \ step in the serine cycle. The enzyme also exhibits THF-independent aldolase activity\
  \ toward \u03B2-hydroxyamino acids. Genetic studies have confirmed glyA is essential\
  \ for methylotrophic growth in M. extorquens AM1."
