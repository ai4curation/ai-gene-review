description: 'pckA encodes ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK,
  EC 4.1.1.49), a Mn2+-requiring enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate
  (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with concomitant decarboxylation and ATP hydrolysis.
  This enzyme is a key control point in gluconeogenesis, enabling the synthesis of
  carbohydrates from TCA cycle intermediates. In methylotrophs, pckA plays a critical
  role in connecting the serine cycle to biosynthetic pathways: carbon from the serine
  cycle flows through glycolysis to pyruvate and the TCA cycle, and pckA enables the
  reverse flow from oxaloacetate back to PEP for biosynthesis of sugars and other
  metabolites. The enzyme functions in the cytoplasm and binds one Mn2+ ion per subunit,
  which is essential for catalysis. Unlike the GTP-dependent PEPCK found in many eukaryotes,
  bacterial pckA uses ATP as the phosphate donor. This enzymatic activity represents
  a crucial anaplerotic/cataplerotic node that allows the organism to balance carbon
  flow between energy production (glycolysis/TCA) and biosynthesis (gluconeogenesis)
  during methylotrophic growth. PckA is essential for growth on C1 compounds as it
  enables the regeneration of biosynthetic precursors from central metabolism.'

    to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a key rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. This
    reaction enables M. extorquens to synthesize carbohydrates and other biosynthetic
    precursors from TCA cycle intermediates during methylotrophic growth. In the context
    of C1 metabolism, carbon from methanol flows through the serine cycle → glycolysis
    → pyruvate → TCA cycle, and pckA enables the crucial reverse flow from oxaloacetate
    back to PEP for biosynthesis. The enzyme functions in the cytosol, binds one Mn2+
    ion per subunit for catalysis, and uses ATP (not GTP) as the phosphate donor,
    distinguishing it from eukaryotic PEPCKs. PckA represents a critical anaplerotic/cataplerotic
    control point that balances carbon flow between energy production and biosynthesis,
    and is essential for growth on C1 compounds.
