  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: Response regulator (MxaB) that functions as additional regulator required
  for mxa operon expression alongside the MxcQE and MxbDM two-component systems. Contains
  response regulatory domain (residues 17-134) with conserved aspartate phosphorylation
  site (D67) and HTH luxR-type DNA-binding domain (residues 156-221). Part of complex
  regulatory network controlling lanthanide-dependent metal switch between calcium-dependent
  (MxaFI) and lanthanide-dependent (XoxF) methanol dehydrogenases. MxaB is required
  for expression of calcium-dependent methanol oxidation system.

core_functions:
- description: MxaB functions as a response regulator essential for transcriptional
    control of the mxa operon encoding the calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenase
    system. It contains an N-terminal response regulatory domain (residues 17-134)
    with a conserved aspartate phosphorylation site (D67) and a C-terminal HTH luxR-type
    DNA-binding domain (residues 156-221). MxaB is part of the complex regulatory
    network controlling the lanthanide-dependent metal switch between Ca2+-dependent
    (MxaFI) and Ln3+-dependent (XoxF) methanol oxidation systems. As an "orphan" response
    regulator (lacking a cognate sensor kinase), MxaB likely receives phosphorylation
    signals from other components in the regulatory cascade, particularly the MxcQE
    and MxbDM two-component systems. MxaB is absolutely required for expression of
    the mxa operon and thus for calcium-dependent methanol oxidation.
