description: GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (mllH) that acetylates homospermidine
  linkers during methylolanthanin biosynthesis. Structural analysis of methylolanthanin
  identified acetylated homospermidine moieties as key components. Part of mll gene
  cluster showing 32-fold upregulation with poorly soluble lanthanides.

  review:
    summary: Correct - mllH encodes GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase that acetylates
      homospermidine linkers during metallophore biosynthesis. Methylolanthanin contains
      acetylated homospermidine moieties as structural components [file:METEA/mllH/mllH-deep-research-perplexity.md]
