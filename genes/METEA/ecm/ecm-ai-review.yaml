description: >-
  Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (Ecm) is a radical enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion
  of (2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA to (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA using adenosylcobalamin (vitamin B12)
  as a cofactor. This enzyme is a key component of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for
  acetyl-CoA assimilation, which is essential for Methylorubrum extorquens growth on
  one-carbon (methanol, methylamine) and two-carbon (ethanol, ethylamine) compounds as
  sole carbon sources. Unlike organisms that use the glyoxylate cycle for acetyl-CoA
  assimilation, M. extorquens lacks isocitrate lyase and instead employs this alternative
  pathway. Ecm acts as a metabolic control point, allowing efficient restoration of
  metabolic balance when challenged with sudden changes in growth substrate. The enzyme
  is assigned EC 5.4.99.63 based on characterization by Good et al. (2015). Disruption
  of ecm abolishes growth on C1 and C2 compounds but can be rescued by glyoxylate or
  glycolate addition, confirming its role in converting acetyl-CoA to glyoxylate.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is technically correct but overly broad. Ecm has a well-defined
      catalytic activity as an ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.63), which is an
      intramolecular transferase that interconverts (2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA to
      (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA. A more specific term should be used.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      The term "catalytic activity" is too general for a well-characterized enzyme.
      While there is no specific GO term for "ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity", the
      most appropriate existing term is GO:0016866 (intramolecular transferase activity),
      which accurately describes the mechanistic class of this enzyme. This is preferable
      to the overly broad "catalytic activity" and avoids the incorrect implication of
      "methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity" which involves different substrates.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. GO:0004494 (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity) is
      defined as catalyzing "(R)-methylmalonyl-CoA = succinyl-CoA". However, Ecm
      catalyzes a distinct reaction: "(2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA = (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA"
      (EC 5.4.99.63). These are chemically different reactions with different substrates
      and products. The annotation appears to have been transferred based on sequence
      similarity to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase family, but the substrate specificity
      of Ecm is different.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: >-
      Ecm is an ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase, not a methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The substrates
      are different: ethylmalonyl-CoA vs methylmalonyl-CoA. UniProt clearly assigns
      EC 5.4.99.63 (ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase) to this enzyme based on PMID:25448820.
      There is no specific GO term for ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, so the best
      option is to use the parent term GO:0016866 (intramolecular transferase activity)
      which is mechanistically accurate. A new GO term for ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase
      activity should be proposed.

    label: isomerase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase is an isomerase that catalyzes
      an intramolecular rearrangement, converting (2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA to
      (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA. The "isomerase" classification aligns with the enzyme's
      EC number (5.4.99.63) where class 5 corresponds to isomerases.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The isomerase activity annotation correctly captures the enzyme class. Mutases are
      a subclass of isomerases that catalyze the intramolecular transfer of groups. The
      EC classification 5.4.99.63 places this enzyme under isomerases (class 5),
      intramolecular transferases (subclass 4), specifically transferring other groups
      (sub-subclass 99). This IEA annotation appropriately reflects the broad enzymatic
      class.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct and represents the most appropriate molecular function
      term for Ecm given current GO term availability. Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes
      an intramolecular rearrangement involving transfer of a group from one position
      to another within the same molecule, which is the defining feature of intramolecular
      transferases (EC 5.4).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The intramolecular transferase activity annotation accurately describes the
      mechanistic class of this enzyme. Given that there is no specific GO term for
      "ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity", GO:0016866 is the most informative and
      accurate term available. The enzyme belongs to EC 5.4.99.63, where 5.4 represents
      intramolecular transferases.

    label: cobalamin binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct. Ecm requires adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B12) as a
      cofactor. UniProt entry Q49115 documents the cofactor requirement with evidence
      from PMID:25448820. The protein contains a B12-binding domain (residues 530-659)
      with the characteristic axial His543 residue that coordinates the cobalt in the
      cobalamin cofactor.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The cobalamin binding annotation is well-supported by both computational domain
      analysis (B12-binding domain, PROSITE PS51332) and experimental evidence
      (PMID:25448820 demonstrated adenosylcobalamin cofactor requirement). The binding
      site annotation at His543 indicates the axial binding residue for the Co atom
      of the cobalamin cofactor.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is correct but could be more specific. Ecm binds cobalt indirectly
      through the adenosylcobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor. The cobalt ion is
      coordinated by His543 as the axial ligand.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      While this annotation is somewhat general, it is accurate. The metal ion binding
      occurs through coordination of the cobalt center of the cobalamin cofactor.
      UniProt indicates the binding site at position 543 coordinating the Co ligand
      part of adenosylcob(III)alamin. Given that GO:0031419 (cobalamin binding) is
      also annotated, which is more specific, this general term provides complementary
      but redundant information. However, it is not incorrect and can be retained.

# Proposed new annotation for the biological process

    label: acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:25448820
  review:
    summary: >-
      Ecm is a key enzyme in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway, which serves as the acetyl-CoA
      assimilation pathway in M. extorquens. This organism lacks isocitrate lyase and
      uses this alternative pathway to convert acetyl-CoA to glyoxylate. Knockout studies
      show that ecm mutants cannot grow on C1 or C2 compounds, and growth can be rescued
      by glyoxylate addition, confirming Ecm's essential role in this pathway.
    action: NEW
    reason: >-
      GO:0019681 (acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway) is directly applicable to Ecm's
      function. UniProt states: "Is involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for
      acetyl-CoA assimilation required for M.extorquens growth on one- and two-carbon
      compounds." Disruption phenotype studies (PMID:8704985) show loss of ability to
      convert acetyl-CoA into glyoxylate, which is rescued by glyoxylate addition.
      This provides strong evidence for involvement in the acetyl-CoA assimilation
      pathway.

      Catalysis of the reaction: (2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA = (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA.

    justification: >-
      Ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (EC 5.4.99.63) is a distinct enzyme from methylmalonyl-CoA
      mutase (EC 5.4.99.2). The substrates are different: ethylmalonyl-CoA vs
      methylmalonyl-CoA. Currently, ecm is incorrectly annotated with GO:0004494
      (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity) due to sequence similarity, but this
      annotation is biochemically incorrect. A specific term for ethylmalonyl-CoA
      mutase activity would enable accurate annotation of this enzyme and others
      in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway.
