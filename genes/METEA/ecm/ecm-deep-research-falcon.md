- **Gene Information:** Name=ecm {ECO:0000303|PubMed:25448820}; Synonyms=meaA {ECO:0000303|PubMed:8868443}; OrderedLocusNames=MexAM1_META1p0180;
- **Organism (full):** Methylorubrum extorquens (strain ATCC 14718 / DSM 1338 / JCM 2805 / NCIMB 9133 / AM1) (Methylobacterium extorquens).
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase family.
- **Key Domains:** Acid_CoA_mut_C. (IPR006159); Cbl-dep_enz_cat. (IPR016176); Cobalamin-bd. (IPR006158); Cobalamin-bd_sf. (IPR036724); MeMalonylCoA_mutase_a/b_cat. (IPR006099)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "ecm" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Methylorubrum extorquens (strain ATCC 14718 / DSM 1338 / JCM 2805 / NCIMB 9133 / AM1) (Methylobacterium extorquens).
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'ecm' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **ecm** (gene ID: ecm, UniProt: Q49115) in METEA.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report

1) Identity and key definitions
- Nomenclature and organism: The gene ecm (also historically meaA) in Methylorubrum (formerly Methylobacterium) extorquens AM1 encodes ethylmalonyl‑CoA mutase, a core enzyme of the ethylmalonyl‑CoA pathway (EMCP) used by isocitrate lyase–negative methylotrophs for glyoxylate regeneration that feeds the serine cycle (Anthony 2011; Korotkova et al. 2002). The equivalence of ecm and meaA in this organism is explicitly described (Anthony 2011) and meaA mutant phenotypes in AM1 establish its EMCP role (Korotkova et al. 2002) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17, korotkova2002glyoxylateregenerationpathway pages 6-8).
- Enzyme class and reaction: Ethylmalonyl‑CoA mutase catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement of (2R)‑ethylmalonyl‑CoA to (2S)‑methylsuccinyl‑CoA; it is mechanistically distinct from methylmalonyl‑CoA mutase (which interconverts methylmalonyl‑CoA and succinyl‑CoA) (Anthony 2011; foundational EMCP biochemistry: Erb et al. 2007) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 13-20). This mutase requires coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin), classifying it as a cobalamin‑dependent mutase (Anthony 2011) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17).

2) Biological role and pathway integration
- Pathway context: The EMCP converts acetyl‑CoA and CO2 into glyoxylate and succinate to replenish the serine cycle in organisms lacking the glyoxylate shunt; pathway resolution and unique steps, including Ecm, were established by Erb et al. (2007) and earlier methylotrophy work in AM1 (Korotkova et al. 2002) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 13-20, korotkova2002glyoxylateregenerationpathway pages 6-8). Within EMCP, upstream steps generate (2S)-ethylmalonyl‑CoA via crotonyl‑CoA carboxylase/reductase; an epimerase supplies the (2R) isomer that Ecm converts to methylsuccinyl‑CoA, continuing toward propionyl‑/succinyl‑CoA and glyoxylate regeneration (Anthony 2011; Good 2015) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 13-20).
- Interplay with serine cycle: The EMCP’s glyoxylate output must be tightly balanced due to glyoxylate toxicity at millimolar levels; Ecm sits at a key node that modulates flux to match downstream assimilation capacity in the serine‑cycle network (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 46-53).

3) Regulation, flux control, and genetic evidence
- Flux control point: Multiple experimental switchover studies show that Ecm is a metabolic control point. During a succinate→ethylamine shift in AM1, cells exhibited a ~9 h growth lag with accumulation of ethylmalonyl‑derived degradation products; ecm transcripts and Ecm activity rose by ~9 h, ethylmalonyl‑CoA fell, and growth resumed. Overexpressing ecm prevented ethylmalonyl‑CoA accumulation, shortened the lag, and yielded faster growth, directly demonstrating that Ecm limits EMCP flux under these conditions (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 74-83). In the same context, a minimal Ecm activity of ~12 nmol·min⁻¹·mg⁻¹ was estimated to support growth (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 74-83).
- Overexpression metabolomics: Targeted metabolomics of ecm overexpression strains revealed decreased 3‑hydroxybutyryl‑CoA and altered mesaconate and propionyl‑CoA dynamics consistent with increased EMCP throughput, supporting the control‑point conclusion (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 96-103).
- Deletion phenotype and functional rescue: Δecm mutants cannot grow on methanol, establishing ecm as essential for methylotrophic growth; growth is rescued by external glyoxylate (5 mM), consistent with the EMCP’s role as the glyoxylate‑regenerating route in AM1 (Sonntag et al. 2015) (sonntag2015highlevelproductionof pages 204-209). This aligns with broader EMCP use in AM1 as an alternative to the absent glyoxylate shunt (Sonntag et al. 2015) (sonntag2015highlevelproductionof pages 94-95).
- Cellular localization: Ecm functions in central carbon metabolism and EMCP in bacteria; while direct localization data were not identified here, EMCP enzymes in AM1 are soluble metabolic enzymes and Ecm is inferred to be cytosolic based on pathway biochemistry and experimental overexpression in the cytosolic milieu (inference; see growth and metabolite dynamics upon plasmid‑based overexpression) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 96-103). 

4) Substrate specificity and distinction from methylmalonyl‑CoA mutase
- Specific substrate and stereochemistry: Ethylmalonyl‑CoA mutase operates on (2R)‑ethylmalonyl‑CoA to form (2S)‑methylsuccinyl‑CoA, whereas methylmalonyl‑CoA mutase catalyzes the methylmalonyl‑CoA ↔ succinyl‑CoA step later in the EMCP/TCA interface; these are distinct cobalamin‑dependent mutases with different physiological roles and substrates (Anthony 2011) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17). Earlier AM1 labeling and mutant work mapped the mutase step to precede decarboxylation, with accumulation of methylsuccinyl‑derived acids in mutants (Korotkova et al. 2002) (korotkova2002glyoxylateregenerationpathway pages 6-8).

5) Recent developments and expert perspectives (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Coordination of EMCP and glyoxylate cycle: In Paracoccus denitrificans Pd1222, RamB links EMCP status to expression of the glyoxylate cycle and binds EMCP CoA‑esters, revealing a metabolite‑sensing regulatory axis between two acetyl‑CoA assimilation routes (Kremer et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology; published June 15, 2023; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00238-23). This supports a general principle of EMCP‑linked regulation in Alphaproteobacteria relevant to AM1’s control logic (kremer2023functionaldegeneracyin pages 1-2).
- Biotechnological applications leveraging EMCP/Ecm: EMCP engineering in AM1 enabled high‑level EMCP‑derived dicarboxylic acid production and clarified constraints such as cobalt (cobalamin) availability and PHB pathway interplay (Sonntag et al. 2015) (sonntag2015highlevelproductionof pages 94-95). Ecm overexpression has been used to alleviate flux limitations and improve growth transitions, a strategy applicable to production hosts (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46).

6) Data and statistics
- Growth control by Ecm: ~9 h growth lag during succinate→ethylamine transition in wild type; ecm overexpression shortens the lag and ultimately yields higher growth rates (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 74-83). Minimal Ecm activity estimated: ~12 nmol·min⁻¹·mg⁻¹ to support observed growth (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 74-83).
- Essentiality and rescue: Δecm is methanol‑negative; growth restored by 5 mM glyoxylate supplementation (Sonntag et al. 2015) (sonntag2015highlevelproductionof pages 204-209).

7) Notes on gene model and domains
- Gene symbol ambiguity: In AM1, ethylmalonyl‑CoA mutase is encoded by ecm, historically also referred to as meaA; these denote the same functional gene in this organism (Anthony 2011; Korotkova et al. 2002) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17, korotkova2002glyoxylateregenerationpathway pages 6-8). 
- Protein family and cofactor: Ecm belongs to the cobalamin‑dependent mutase family; explicit cobalamin dependence is supported by biochemical descriptions (Anthony 2011) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17). Specific domain architecture and the precise ordered locus tag (e.g., MexAM1_META1p0180) were not recovered in the gathered literature excerpts; these are consistent with database annotations but are not directly cited here.

Current applications and implementations
- AM1 as a cell factory: EMCP provides a rich set of CoA‑ester intermediates amenable to rerouting for dicarboxylic acids and other chemicals; strain engineering (including modulation of cobalt supply and PHB pathway, and employing thioesterases) enables high titers (Sonntag et al. 2015) (sonntag2015highlevelproductionof pages 94-95). 
- Control‑point engineering: ecm overexpression serves as a practical lever to increase EMCP throughput during dynamic conditions (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46).
- Broader regulatory insight: The RamB study in P. denitrificans (2023) suggests a generalizable strategy where EMCP metabolites regulate alternate anaplerotic routes, informing control strategies in AM1 (Kremer et al. 2023; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00238-23) (kremer2023functionaldegeneracyin pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- Foundational perspective: The EMCP filled long‑standing gaps in understanding C1/C2 growth in methylotrophs, with Ecm among the “new” key steps; its B12 dependence and distinct substrate scope underscore specialized control within central metabolism (Anthony 2011) (anthony2011howhalfa pages 13-17). 
- Control theory in AM1: Ecm’s positioning near the EMCP’s convergence point makes it an effective buffer and control valve for glyoxylate regeneration, preventing toxic accumulation while enabling rapid resetting of metabolic flux after substrate shifts (Good 2015) (good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 46-53, good2015metaboliccontrolof pages 41-46).
