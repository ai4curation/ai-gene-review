description: Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.10) that catalyzes
  the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in the periplasm. Unlike the calcium-dependent
  MxaFI enzyme, XoxF1 specifically requires lanthanide ions (La³⁺, Nd³⁺, Ce³⁺, Pr³⁺)
  as cofactors and uses pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as its prosthetic group. Forms
  a homodimer and transfers electrons to XoxG (cytochrome cL). Essential for lanthanide-dependent
  methylotrophy and is highly upregulated in the presence of lanthanides.

  review:
    summary: INCORRECT. XoxF1 binds LANTHANIDES (La³⁺, Nd³⁺, Ce³⁺, Pr³⁺), not calcium.
      When calcium is bound in the absence of lanthanides, the enzyme is inactive.
      This is a fundamental misannotation - likely from automated annotation that
      failed to recognize lanthanide specificity. XoxF1 has a diagnostic aspartate
      residue (Asp320) unique to lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases that
      is essential for lanthanide but not calcium coordination.

    summary: CORRECT - CORE FUNCTION. XoxF1 catalyzes the first committed step in
      methanol metabolism by oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde. Genetic studies show
      deletion of both xoxF paralogs prevents methanol utilization under lanthanide-rich
      conditions. This is the primary biological role of the enzyme and represents

      structure reveals lanthanide coordination site with diagnostic Asp320 residue

      should be proposed.

    summary: NEW - STRUCTURAL PROPERTY. XoxF1 functions as a homodimer (α2) with a
      native molecular weight of ~117 kDa. Each subunit is ~61 kDa. This is in contrast
      to the heterotetrameric (α2β2) structure of the calcium-dependent MxaFI methanol
      dehydrogenase. Homodimerization appears essential for catalytic function, as
      both lanthanide and PQQ binding sites are present in each subunit of the functional
      dimer.

  description: XoxF1 catalyzes the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in the bacterial

    homodimer with Km ~1.4-44 μM for methanol depending on which lanthanide is bound.
    Binds ~1 lanthanide per subunit and 1 PQQ per subunit. Essential for lanthanide-dependent
    methylotrophy. The diagnostic Asp172 residue is unique to XoxF1-type enzymes and
