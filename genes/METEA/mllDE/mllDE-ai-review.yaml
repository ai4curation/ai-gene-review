  label: Methylorubrum extorquens AM1
description: Bifunctional carrier domain-containing protein (mllDE) that 
  functions as a fusion of aryl carrier protein (AsbD-like) and ligase 
  (AsbE-like) domains. The ACP domain requires post-translational modification 
  with 4'-phosphopantetheine to transfer acyl intermediates, while the ligase 
  domain catalyzes adenylation and condensation reactions during 
  methylolanthanin biosynthesis. Part of mll cluster showing 32-fold 
  upregulation in response to poorly soluble lanthanides.
