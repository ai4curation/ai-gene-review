description: 'icd encodes NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), a
  metalloenzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of D-threo-isocitrate
  to 2-oxoglutarate (also known as alpha-ketoglutarate) with concomitant reduction
  of NADP+ to NADPH and release of CO2. This is a key regulatory step in the TCA cycle,
  generating both a biosynthetic precursor (2-oxoglutarate for amino acid synthesis)
  and reducing power (NADPH for anabolic reactions). The enzyme belongs to the isocitrate
  and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases family and requires a divalent metal cation (preferentially
  Mg2+ or Mn2+), binding one metal ion per subunit. In methylotrophs, Icd plays a
  crucial role in oxidizing isocitrate produced by the TCA cycle when carbon flows
  from C1 compounds through the serine cycle and glycolysis into acetyl-CoA. The enzyme
  also functions in the glyoxylate cycle (glyoxylate bypass), allowing the organism
  to grow on acetate or other two-carbon compounds by bypassing the CO2-releasing
  steps of the TCA cycle. Icd represents a critical metabolic branch point: the NADPH
  it generates supports biosynthetic reactions, while 2-oxoglutarate feeds into amino
  acid biosynthesis and can be further oxidized for energy production.'

    summary: This annotation is incorrect. Icd is an NADP-dependent enzyme that uses
      NADP+ as cofactor, not NAD+. The reaction clearly shows NADP(+) → NADPH. A more

- description: Icd catalyzes the NADP-dependent, Mg2+/Mn2+-requiring oxidative decarboxylation
    of D-threo-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate), with concomitant
    reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and release of CO2. This is a key regulatory step
    in both the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate cycle, representing a critical metabolic
    branch point in M. extorquens. In methylotrophy, carbon flows from C1 compounds
    through the serine cycle → glycolysis → acetyl-CoA → TCA cycle, and Icd oxidizes
    the resulting isocitrate. The enzyme generates both biosynthetic reducing power
    (NADPH for anabolic reactions) and a key metabolic intermediate (2-oxoglutarate
    for amino acid biosynthesis and further energy production). The enzyme binds one
    divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) per subunit for catalysis and belongs to the
    isocitrate/isopropylmalate dehydrogenases family.
