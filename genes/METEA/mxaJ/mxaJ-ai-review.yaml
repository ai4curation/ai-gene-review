description: mxaJ (also known as moxJ) encodes a periplasmic binding protein that
  is essential for activation of the calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenase MxaFI.
  The protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-25) that targets it
  to the periplasm, where it functions in the assemblage of active methanol dehydrogenase
  and/or incorporation of the PQQ cofactor. MxaJ belongs to the solute-binding protein
  family 3 and is analogous to XoxJ, which performs a similar activation function
  for the lanthanide-dependent XoxF enzyme. Deletion of mxaJ disrupts Ca-MDH activity,
  confirming its essential role in enzyme activation. The protein likely facilitates
  PQQ and/or calcium cofactor incorporation into the MxaFI complex, or maintains MxaFI
  in a catalytically competent conformation. MxaJ is co-transcribed with other mxa
  operon genes and is specifically required for the Ca-dependent methanol oxidation
  system.

core_functions:
- description: MxaJ is a periplasmic binding protein essential for activation of the
    calcium-dependent methanol dehydrogenase MxaFI complex. It functions in the assemblage
    of catalytically active MxaFI and/or facilitates incorporation of the PQQ cofactor
    and calcium ion required for enzymatic activity. MxaJ is analogous to XoxJ in
    the lanthanide-dependent system, where deletion of the corresponding gene disrupts
    MDH activity. By extension, MxaJ is presumed to play an equivalent role in Ca-MDH
    activation, potentially delivering cofactors or maintaining the enzyme in a proper
    conformation. The protein is secreted to the periplasm via an N-terminal signal
    peptide and belongs to solute-binding protein family 3. MxaJ is part of the mxa
    operon and is specifically required for the Ca-dependent branch of methylotrophic
    metabolism.
