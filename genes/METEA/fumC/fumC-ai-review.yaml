description: 'fumC encodes fumarate hydratase class II (EC 4.2.1.2), also known as
  fumarase C, an iron-independent enzyme that catalyzes the stereospecific and reversible
  hydration of fumarate to (S)-malate (L-malate) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  This is step 1/1 in the conversion of fumarate to malate, a critical reaction in
  central carbon metabolism. The enzyme belongs to the class-II fumarase/aspartase
  family and functions as a homotetramer in the cytoplasm. Unlike class I fumarases
  (FumA/FumB), fumC is iron-independent and represents the aerobic fumarase form.
  In methylotrophs, FumC plays an important role in the TCA cycle when carbon flows
  from C1 compounds through the serine cycle and glycolysis into acetyl-CoA, which
  is then oxidized via the TCA cycle. The enzyme has two substrate-binding sites:
  the catalytic A site and a non-catalytic B site that may function in substrate/product
  transfer or allosteric regulation. The reversible nature of the reaction allows
  FumC to function in both the oxidative (fumarate → malate) and reductive (malate
  → fumarate) directions of the TCA cycle, depending on metabolic needs. FumC is essential
  for both energy production through complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA and for generating
  biosynthetic precursors from TCA cycle intermediates.'
