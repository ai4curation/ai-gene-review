description: >-
  Cds1 (Rv3684) is an L-cysteine desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.1) that catalyzes the
  PLP-dependent beta-elimination of L-cysteine to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S),
  pyruvate, and ammonia. It is a major source of endogenous H2S in M. tuberculosis.
  The H2S produced stimulates respiration primarily via cytochrome bd, modulates
  the balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, contributes to
  redox homeostasis by affecting ergothioneine (EGT) and mycothiol (MSH) levels,
  and influences drug susceptibility. The enzyme likely also functions to eliminate
  toxic levels of cysteine. Kinetic parameters: KM = 11.26 mM for cysteine,
  kcat = 78.71 sec(-1). Activity is inhibited by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA),
  a PLP inhibitor, but NOT by DL-propargylglycine (PAG), a cystathionine gamma-lyase
  inhibitor, confirming its identity as a cysteine desulfhydrase rather than a
  cystathionine gamma-lyase. Part of the Rv3682-Rv3683-cds1 operon.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is INCORRECT. Cds1 is an L-cysteine desulfhydrase that
      catalyzes L-cysteine CATABOLISM, not biosynthesis. The enzyme degrades
      cysteine to produce H2S, pyruvate, and ammonia (PMID:34439535). The IBA
      annotation derives from GO:0019344 being annotated at the root node
      (PTN000034104) of PANTHER family PTHR10314 and propagated to all descendants,
      including subfamily SF135 (Cds1) which has the opposite function.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      IBA propagation error from PANTHER family PTHR10314. GO:0019344 is annotated
      at the root node but SF135 (Cds1 subfamily) underwent neo-functionalization:
      (1) Active site motif differs: SF135 has ASSGST vs PTSGNTG in synthases;
      (2) Only 24% sequence identity with cysteine synthases (vs 43% between CysK/CysM);
      (3) Longest branch length (0.528) from root indicates greatest divergence;
      (4) Different EC: 4.4.1.1 (desulfhydrase) vs 2.5.1.47 (synthase);
      (5) Opposite reaction: L-cysteine → H2S + pyruvate (catabolism), not biosynthesis.

      Lyase activity is correct but very general. Cds1 is indeed a lyase (carbon-sulfur
      lyase) that catalyzes a beta-elimination reaction. However, there is a much more

    reason: >-
      While technically correct, this term is too general. The specific molecular

      instead, which precisely describes the catalyzed reaction: L-cysteine + H2O =
