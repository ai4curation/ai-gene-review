gene_symbol: Rv0311
taxon:
  id: NCBITaxon:83332
  label: Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
description: 'A conserved hypothetical protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
  that is essential for growth in minimal media and during infection. Contains a protein
  splicing signature motif suggesting intein-like or autoproteolytic activity. Localizes
  to the cell envelope and is exported via a signal peptide. Required for bacterial
  virulence, particularly in central nervous system infections. Despite being well-conserved
  across mycobacteria, its precise molecular function remains unknown.
