description: MEG-4 (maternal-effect germline defective 4) is an intrinsically disordered
  protein (IDP) that functions redundantly with its homolog MEG-3 in P granule assembly
  and segregation in C. elegans embryos. MEG-4 contains multiple disordered regions
  enriched in polar and low-complexity sequences, consistent with its role as a scaffold
  for biomolecular condensates. MEG-4 localizes to P granules and is regulated by
  MBK-2/DYRK phosphorylation, which controls P granule dynamics through phase separation.
  While meg-4 single mutants have mild phenotypes, meg-3 meg-4 double mutants fail
  to segregate P granules to the posterior of the zygote, and meg-1 meg-3 meg-4 triple
  mutants are 100% sterile. MEG-4 is essential for RNA recruitment to germ granules
  and proper small RNA homeostasis.

  review:
    summary: High-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen identified interactions with
      atz-1 and klc-1. The PMID:12445390 publication describes an integrated interactome
      mapping approach for C. elegans germline proteins. While the interaction data
      is valid, the generic term "protein binding" does not provide functional insight
      for a scaffold protein whose core function is phase separation-mediated granule
      assembly.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The protein binding annotation from high-throughput Y2H screening is technically
      correct but uninformative. MEG-4 functions as a scaffold protein for P granule
      assembly through phase separation, and its biologically relevant interactions
      (e.g., with MEG-3) involve molecular condensate scaffold activity. Generic "protein
      binding" does not capture this functional context. The specific interactors
      (atz-1, klc-1) from this screen have not been validated for functional relevance
      to P granule biology.

    summary: Large-scale worm interactome mapping study identified MEG-4 interaction
      with ikb-1. This is a high-throughput Y2H screen with independent co-affinity
      purification validation.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While the Y2H interaction is experimentally supported, the generic "protein
      binding" term lacks functional specificity. MEG-4 is an IDP scaffold protein
      whose meaningful interactions involve condensate assembly. The interaction with
      ikb-1 (IKK binding protein) has not been shown to be relevant to MEG-4's core
      function in P granule biology. A more informative MF annotation would capture
      the molecular condensate scaffold activity.

    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This annotation comes from a rigorous high-throughput Y2H study with empirical
      quality control. However, "protein binding" remains an uninformative term for
      MEG-4, whose function depends on its ability to scaffold molecular condensates
      through multivalent interactions mediated by its intrinsically disordered regions.
      The annotation does not capture the functional significance of MEG-4's protein
      interactions.

  review:
    summary: Wang et al. (2014) demonstrated that MEG proteins regulate P granule
      dynamics through phosphorylation-controlled phase separation. MEG-4 functions
      redundantly with MEG-3 in localizing P granules to the posterior of the embryo
      (PMID:25535836).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'This annotation accurately captures MEG-4''s role in P granule localization.
      The Wang et al. study provides direct mutant phenotype evidence that MEG proteins
      are required for proper organelle localization: "MEG (maternal-effect germline
      defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly
      for fertility." P granule segregation to the posterior involves MEG-regulated
      condensation/dissolution dynamics controlled by MBK-2/DYRK kinase and PP2A phosphatase.'

    summary: MEG-3 and MEG-4 are required together (genetic interaction) for proper
      P granule assembly. The Wang et al. study shows MEGs stabilize the condensed
      phase of P granules through regulated phase separation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core annotation for MEG-4 function. The IGI evidence code is
      appropriate as meg-3 meg-4 double mutants show synergistic defects in P granule
      assembly not seen in single mutants. MEG proteins localize to a dynamic domain
      surrounding P granules and are direct regulators of granule condensation dynamics
      through their intrinsically disordered, serine-rich regions that undergo phosphorylation-dependent
      phase transitions.

  review:
    summary: MEG proteins are required for germ cell viability and proliferation.
      The meg-1 meg-3 meg-4 triple mutant is 100% sterile, indicating MEGs contribute
      redundantly to germline function.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While MEG-4 is involved in germ cell proliferation, this represents a
      downstream consequence of its primary function in P granule assembly rather
      than a direct mechanistic role in cell proliferation. The sterility phenotype
      of triple mutants reflects failed germline development due to defective P granule
      function. This is a valid annotation but should be considered non-core compared
      to the direct molecular function in granule assembly.

    action: MODIFY
    reason: While the IPI evidence from PMID:25535836 is more functionally relevant
      than the high-throughput Y2H studies (demonstrating interactions with MEG-3
      and kinase/phosphatase regulators), "protein binding" still fails to capture
      MEG-4's molecular function. MEG-4 functions as a scaffold for molecular condensate
      assembly through its intrinsically disordered regions. The term GO:0140693 "molecular
      condensate scaffold activity" would more accurately describe MEG-4's molecular
      function.

    action: NEW
    reason: This annotation captures MEG-4's core molecular function as a scaffold
      that promotes the assembly of molecular condensates (P granules) through phase
      separation. MEG-4's long N-terminal intrinsically disordered region with serine-rich,
      polar residue composition (as documented in UniProt features) is characteristic

    action: NEW
    reason: MEG-4 is explicitly described as a germ plasm component. The germ plasm
      is the specialized cytoplasm inherited by germline precursor cells, and P granules
      are the defining feature of C. elegans germ plasm. This cellular component annotation
      complements the P granule annotation by placing MEG-4 in the broader context
