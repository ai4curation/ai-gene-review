description: HSP-4 is the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident HSP70 family
  chaperone in C. elegans, orthologous to mammalian BiP/GRP78. It functions as 
  an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that assists protein folding and quality 
  control in the ER lumen. HSP-4 is a classical transcriptional target of the 
  unfolded protein response (UPR), primarily induced via the IRE-1/XBP-1 
  pathway, with partial redundancy from the ATF-6 branch. The hsp-4::GFP 
  reporter is the standard marker for ER stress in C. elegans. HSP-4 plays 
  specialized roles in interorganellar signaling, ER-phagy regulation via 
  Sec-62, and stress tolerance, representing functionally diversified activities
  compared to its paralog HSP-3.

    review:
      summary: IBA annotation from phylogenetic inference. While mammalian 
        BiP/GRP78 has been reported in nuclear compartments under certain stress
        conditions, HSP-4 in C. elegans is primarily characterized as an ER 
        lumen chaperone. The UniProt record and deep research consistently 
        describe HSP-4 as ER-localized. Nuclear localization may reflect 
        conservation of potential regulatory functions but is not a primary 
        localization in C. elegans.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: While phylogenetically conserved from mammalian BiP, nuclear 
        localization is not a well-documented aspect of HSP-4 function in C. 
        elegans. The protein contains an ER retention signal (HDEL) and is 
        primarily ER-localized according to UniProt and functional studies. This
        annotation may represent an ancestral or minor localization pattern.

        specific role in ER proteostasis.

    review:
      summary: ISS annotation based on sequence similarity. HSP-4 functions in 
        ER chaperone complexes similar to mammalian BiP.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: HSP-4 is orthologous to mammalian BiP, which functions in ER 
        chaperone complexes. The functional conservation is supported by rescue 
        experiments and pathway conservation.

    review:
      summary: IPI annotation based on physical interaction. Glover-Cutter et 
        al. (2013) showed that SKN-1/Nrf transcription factor regulates hsp-4 
        during ER stress. This annotation may reflect interaction data from ChIP
        or co-IP experiments.
      action: UNDECIDED
      reason: This annotation suggests HSP-4 physically interacts with 
        transcription factors. While SKN-1 regulates hsp-4 transcription, HSP-4 
        is an ER lumen protein and direct binding to transcription factors would
        be unexpected. The annotation may reflect a database error or indirect 
        interaction. Further review of the original paper is needed to verify 
        the specific interaction claimed.

  - description: HSP-4/BiP is the major ER-resident HSP70 chaperone that assists
      protein folding in the ER lumen. It uses ATP-dependent cycles of binding
