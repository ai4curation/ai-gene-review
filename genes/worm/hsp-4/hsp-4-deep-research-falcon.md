### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsp-4" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-4' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-4** (gene ID: hsp-4, UniProt: P20163) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Gene/protein verification and scope
- Identity and organism: hsp-4 (UniProt P20163) encodes the Caenorhabditis elegans endoplasmic reticulum (ER) HSP70-family chaperone best known as BiP/GRP78. Recent work explicitly treats HSP-4 as one of two C. elegans BiP orthologs (with HSP-3), validating the gene/protein mapping in worm (BiP/HSP70 family; ER-resident chaperone) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10).
- Family/domains: As an HSP70/BiP ortholog, HSP-4 possesses the canonical HSP70 nucleotide-binding domain and peptide-binding domain architecture that underpins ATP-dependent chaperone cycles; contemporary C. elegans studies reference HSP-4 in this well-established functional context (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Primary molecular role: HSP-4 is an ER-resident HSP70 (BiP/GRP78) molecular chaperone central to ER proteostasis. Across recent studies, HSP-4 is consistently positioned as an ER chaperone whose expression is induced by the unfolded protein response of the ER (UPRER) and that participates in organismal physiology (growth, reproduction, stress resistance, autophagy) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11).
- Enzymatic activity concept: HSP-4, as a BiP ortholog, operates through an ATPase-driven chaperone cycle that binds and releases unfolded client polypeptides in the ER lumen; these activities are the hallmark of ER HSP70s and are invoked in recent worm literature when defining HSP-4’s role in ER proteostasis (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- Localization: HSP-4 is ER-localized. Contemporary analyses use fluorescently tagged endogenous reporters to visualize HSP-4 distribution in vivo, confirming ER association and tissue-specific expression (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25).
- UPRER integration: hsp-4 is a classical UPRER target gene. It is transcriptionally upregulated by the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch, and under some stress modalities, its induction can additionally require ATF-6 and show partial independence from IRE-1/XBP-1, highlighting branch redundancy (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- XBP-1s target and disease-modifying capacity: Transcriptomic analysis in a tauopathy model identified hsp-4 among 116 genes upregulated by constitutively active XBP-1s. Genetic tests showed that upregulation of HSP-4 partially rescues tauopathy, whereas loss of ATF-6 prevents XBP-1s-mediated rescue, demonstrating cross-branch co-dependence for neuroprotective effects (Communications Biology, July 2024; doi:10.1038/s42003-024-06570-2) (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- Replication stress and UPRER crosstalk: Depletion of DNA primases (pri-1/pri-2) activates UPRER with strong germline hsp-4 induction. Notably, hsp-4 activation is partly independent of canonical IRE-1/XBP-1 and requires ATF-6 in this context; IRE-1 and PEK-1 are also activated by primase depletion, indicating multi-branch engagement and functional redundancy (G3, Jan 2024; doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkae017) (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1).
- Functional diversification versus paralog HSP-3 (latest mechanistic insights): New work distinguishes HSP-4 from HSP-3. HSP-3 exhibits canonical ER folding roles, while HSP-4 is more specialized in interorganellar signaling and ER-stress mitigation, including regulation of ER-phagy via Sec-62 (C18E9.2) and crosstalk with IRE-1. HSP-4’s effects on autophagy and stress tolerance can occur independently of spliced XBP-1 (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; bioRxiv preprint Jan 2025) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 29-33, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25). Although 2025 publications, these findings synthesize and extend prior views.

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Disease model modulation: HSP-4 upregulation contributes to rescue in C. elegans tauopathy models under XBP-1s activation, indicating potential translational angles for ER proteostasis tuning in neurodegeneration (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- ER stress and autophagy control: Manipulating HSP-4 alters ER-phagy and proteostasis outcomes; HSP-4 loss increases ER-phagy via C18E9.2/Sec-62 and modulates protein-misfolding paralysis. Such genetic manipulations establish HSP-4 as a handle to steer ER homeostasis, with measurable effects on organismal phenotypes (body growth, fecundity, lifespan) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25).
- Reporter usage in vivo: Endogenous CRISPR reporters (HSP-4::wrmScarlet) and classical hsp-4::GFP reporters are widely used to monitor ER stress and tissue-specific UPRER activation in live animals, enabling pathway-dissection and drug/genetic screens (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25, xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Coordinated UPRER branch control: Communications Biology (2024) concludes that robust proteostatic rescue in tauopathy requires ATF-6 alongside IRE-1/XBP-1, placing hsp-4 at the intersection of UPRER branches and emphasizing combinatorial control over ER chaperone gene expression (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- Branch redundancy and context dependence: G3 (2024) demonstrates that the branch logic governing hsp-4 induction depends on stress type and tissue (germline under replication stress), supporting a nuanced model where ATF-6 can drive hsp-4 when IRE-1/XBP-1 is insufficient (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1).
- Functional specialization of BiP paralogs: Nature Communications (2025) synthesizes a model in which HSP-3 and HSP-4 have overlapping yet distinct roles, with HSP-4 coupling ER stress to autophagy and signaling via IRE-1/Sec-62 interactions, expanding canonical BiP paradigms in metazoans (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- 116 UPRER targets: Constitutively active XBP-1s upregulated 116 putative targets in C. elegans, with hsp-4 among validated candidates required for tauopathy suppression; loss of function in any one of five selected targets (including hsp-4) disrupted XBP-1s-mediated protection (Communications Biology, 2024; doi:10.1038/s42003-024-06570-2) (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- Tissue/age expression dynamics: Endogenous HSP-4::wrmScarlet reporter analyses reveal low larval expression with increased abundance into adulthood; distinct tissue peaks (e.g., spermatheca) and age-dependent increases were observed, complementing differential dynamics seen for HSP-3 (Nature Communications, 2025; bioRxiv, 2025) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25).
- UPRER branch requirements under replication stress: Genetic dissection shows hsp-4 induction requires ATF-6 when IRE-1/XBP-1 is partly dispensable; IRE-1 and PEK-1 are activated by primase depletion, and their loss sensitizes animals to hydroxyurea (G3, 2024) (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1).

Functional detail: biochemical activity, clients, and pathways
- Chaperone mechanism: As an HSP70/BiP ortholog, HSP-4 participates in ATP-dependent binding/release of unfolded or nascent client polypeptides in the ER lumen, assisting folding and quality control. Contemporary worm studies invoke this canonical mechanism in framing HSP-4’s ER proteostasis role (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- Client scope and pathway interfaces: While client-specific biochemistry is not comprehensively catalogued in the 2023–2024 worm literature, recent work implicates HSP-4 in controlling IRE-1 availability and ER-phagy via Sec-62 (C18E9.2), demonstrating that HSP-4 influences UPR sensor coupling and downstream autophagy beyond classical folding (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11).
- Developmental and physiological roles: Genetic depletion or mis-expression of hsp-4 alters body growth, fecundity, and lifespan; intestine-specific loss provokes severe phenotypes, while whole-organism loss shortens lifespan. In protein-misfolding models, hsp-4 loss can delay paralysis, whereas overexpression can exacerbate it, underscoring context-specific proteostatic roles (bioRxiv 2025; Nature Communications 2025) (urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11).
- Stress resistance and disease models: hsp-4 induction is a hallmark of ER stress across modalities. In neurodegeneration models, hsp-4 contributes to XBP-1s-mediated rescue of tau toxicity, consistent with its protective chaperone function when appropriately engaged by UPRER programs (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).

Experimental tools and localization evidence
- Reporters and localization: hsp-4p::GFP translational reporters and endogenous HSP-4::wrmScarlet fusion alleles demonstrate ER-associated, tissue-specific expression and dynamic induction under stress. Germline-biased induction under replication stress and adult-enriched expression have been documented (G3 2024; Nature Communications 2025; bioRxiv 2025) (xu2024theunfoldedprotein pages 1-1, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 1-2, urban2025functionallydiversifiedbip pages 21-25).

Open questions and implications
- Branch logic and therapeutics: The requirement for ATF-6 alongside IRE-1/XBP-1 to achieve robust disease rescue suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting ER proteostasis may need to co-activate or modulate multiple UPRER branches to realize full benefit, with hsp-4/BiP as a central effector (waldherr2024endoplasmicreticulumunfolded pages 1-3).
- BiP paralog specialization: The emerging division of labor between HSP-3 and HSP-4 raises questions about their differential clienteles, tissue programs, and signaling interfaces (e.g., IRE-1/Sec-62), warranting biochemical and structural investigation in worm systems (urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 8-10, urban2025functionallydiversifiedcaenorhabditis pages 10-11).
