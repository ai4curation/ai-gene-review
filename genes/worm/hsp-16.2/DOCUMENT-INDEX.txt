================================================================================
                       CURATION DECISIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

ANNOTATION ACTIONS:

ACCEPT (7 annotations):
  ✓ GO:0005737 - cytoplasm [IBA, IEA, IDA] - Multiple evidence support
  ✓ GO:0005634 - nucleus [IBA] - Phylogenetic inference from orthologs
  ✓ GO:0009408 - response to heat [IBA, IEA, IEP×2] - Core function, well-supported
  ✓ GO:0051082 - unfolded protein binding [IBA, ISS] - Primary molecular function

MODIFY (1 annotation):
  ⚠ GO:0042026 - protein refolding [IBA]
    CHANGE TO: GO:0036506 (maintenance of unfolded protein)
    REASON: sHSPs do NOT catalyze refolding (ATP-independent holdases only)
    ALTERNATIVE: Remove as redundant with GO:0051082

NEW ANNOTATION (Recommended):
  + GO:0044183 - protein folding chaperone [ISS]
    ADDS: Captures "assist" role without implying direct refolding
    REASON: More accurate description of chaperone function
    EVIDENCE: Sequence similarity of conserved domain
