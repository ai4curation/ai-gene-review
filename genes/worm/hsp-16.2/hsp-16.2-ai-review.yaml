description: HSP-16.2 is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) belonging to the 
  alpha-crystallin/HSP20 family. It functions as an ATP-independent molecular 
  chaperone with holdase activity, binding to unfolded or misfolded proteins to 
  prevent their aggregation under stress conditions. The protein is strongly 
  induced by heat shock and other stressors, and is expressed in multiple 
  tissues including pharynx, muscle, hypodermis, and intestine. HSP-16.2 
  maintains client proteins in a refolding-competent state until ATP-dependent 
  chaperones (like HSP70) can catalyze their refolding. It is part of a family 
  of four hsp16 genes in C. elegans arranged in divergently transcribed pairs at
  two loci.

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: Cytoplasmic localization is well-supported for sHSPs across 
        species. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from 
        multiple orthologs including mammalian alpha-crystallins and 
        HSP27/HSPB1. Direct experimental evidence in C. elegans also confirms 
        cytoplasmic localization (PMID:11001875).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Small heat shock proteins are predominantly cytoplasmic, where 
        they function as holdase chaperones to prevent protein aggregation. This
        is consistent with phylogenetic inference and direct experimental 
        evidence.

      label: nucleus
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: Nuclear localization has been reported for some mammalian sHSPs 
        such as HSPB1 and alpha-crystallins under stress conditions. The IBA 
        annotation propagates this from orthologs. However, direct evidence for 
        nuclear localization of hsp-16.2 specifically in C. elegans is limited.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: While the primary localization is cytoplasmic, nuclear 
        translocation of sHSPs under stress is a conserved feature across 
        species. The phylogenetic inference from mammalian orthologs is 
        reasonable, though direct C. elegans data would strengthen this 
        annotation.

      summary: Heat shock inducibility is a defining characteristic of the hsp16
        gene family. Multiple studies confirm that hsp16 genes are 
        transcriptionally induced by heat shock through heat shock elements in 
        their promoters regulated by HSF-1.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Response to heat is a core, conserved function of the hsp16 
        family. This is supported by extensive phylogenetic data and direct 
        experimental evidence in C. elegans (PMID:1550963, PMID:28198373).

    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: This annotation is mechanistically INCORRECT. Small heat shock 
        proteins like hsp-16.2 do NOT catalyze protein refolding. They function 
        as ATP-independent holdases that bind unfolded proteins to prevent 
        aggregation, maintaining substrates in a refolding-competent state. 
        Actual protein refolding requires ATP-dependent chaperones like HSP70 
        (DnaK) working with co-chaperones. The sHSP acts upstream, sequestering 
        substrates until the refolding machinery becomes available. This 
        annotation incorrectly describes sHSP function.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: sHSPs are ATP-independent holdases, not foldases. They prevent 
        aggregation and maintain proteins in a refolding-competent state, but do
        not directly catalyze refolding. The molecular function GO:0051082 
        (unfolded protein binding) and the biological process contributions to 
        heat stress response already capture the accurate functional role. The 
        "protein refolding" annotation should be removed as it is 
        mechanistically inaccurate.

    review:
      summary: Unfolded protein binding is the core molecular function of small 
        heat shock proteins. sHSPs bind to partially unfolded or misfolded 
        proteins through hydrophobic interactions, preventing their aggregation.
        This is a well-conserved function across the alpha-crystallin/HSP20 
        family.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: GO:0051082 is proposed for obsoletion. HSP-16.2 is an sHSP holdase
        that binds unfolded proteins to prevent aggregation in an ATP-independent
        manner. GO:0140309 (unfolded protein carrier activity) is not appropriate
        because it is carrier-specific (per go-ontology#30552). Retain until a

      summary: Sequence similarity-based annotation. The hsp16 genes belong to 
        the well-characterized small heat shock protein family with conserved 
        alpha-crystallin domain. While PMID:3017958 primarily describes gene 
        structure and expression, the annotation is based on sequence similarity
        to proteins with established unfolded protein binding activity.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: ISS annotation is appropriate given the highly conserved 
        alpha-crystallin domain that defines this protein family. The molecular 
        function is well-established for the family and sequence conservation 
        strongly supports this activity.

    review:
      summary: Small heat shock proteins act as ATP-independent protein folding 
        chaperones (holdases). The alpha-crystallin domain is highly conserved 
        and defines the molecular function of binding unfolded proteins to 
        prevent aggregation.
      action: NEW
      reason: This term accurately captures the chaperone function of sHSPs. 
        While they do not actively refold proteins (unlike ATP-dependent 
        chaperones like HSP70), they do assist the protein folding process by 
        preventing aggregation of unfolded intermediates. GO:0044183 is defined 
        as "Binding to a protein or a protein-containing complex to assist the 
        protein folding process" which accurately describes holdase function.
