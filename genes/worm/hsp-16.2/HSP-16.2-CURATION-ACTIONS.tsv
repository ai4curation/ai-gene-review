GO:0005737	cytoplasm	IBA	is_active_in	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	Phylogenetic inference from mammalian orthologs. Small heat shock proteins function in cytoplasm as holdase chaperones. Supported by IDA and IEA annotations.	-	PMID:11001875
GO:0005634	nucleus	IBA	is_active_in	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	Nuclear translocation of sHSPs under stress is conserved across species. Phylogenetic inference from mammalian orthologs reasonable. Deep research confirms hsp-16.2 promoter relocalization to nuclear pores.	-	-
GO:0009408	response to heat	IBA	involved_in	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	Heat shock inducibility is core defining characteristic of hsp16 family. Multiple studies confirm transcriptional induction by heat shock via HSF-1.	-	PMID:1550963;PMID:3017958
GO:0042026	protein refolding	IBA	involved_in	GO_REF:0000033	MODIFY	CRITICAL ISSUE: sHSPs do NOT catalyze protein refolding. They function as ATP-independent holdases preventing aggregation, maintaining substrates in refolding-competent state. Actual refolding requires ATP-dependent chaperones like HSP70.	GO:0036506 (maintenance of unfolded protein); or retain GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding)	-
GO:0051082	unfolded protein binding	IBA	enables	GO_REF:0000033	ACCEPT	Core molecular function of small heat shock proteins. Binding to unfolded/misfolded proteins through hydrophobic interactions prevents aggregation. Well-conserved function across alpha-crystallin/HSP20 family. Directly supported by protein structure.	-	-
GO:0005737	cytoplasm	IEA	located_in	GO_REF:0000117	ACCEPT	ARBA machine learning prediction consistent with IBA and IDA annotations. Cytoplasmic localization well-established for protein family. Redundant but correct.	-	-
GO:0009408	response to heat	IEA	involved_in	GO_REF:0000117	ACCEPT	ARBA machine learning prediction consistent with experimental evidence. Redundant with IBA and IEP annotations but correct. Heat shock response core function.	-	-
GO:0009408	response to heat	IEP	involved_in	PMID:28198373	ACCEPT	Expression pattern data from hormetic heat shock study showing marked induction of hsp-16.2 by heat stress for improved survival and proteostasis. IEP appropriate for biological process annotation.	-	PMID:28198373
GO:0009408	response to heat	IEP	involved_in	PMID:1550963	ACCEPT	Classic foundational study demonstrating heat-shock dependent expression via transgenic hsp16-lacZ reporters. Shows spatial and temporal expression patterns following heat shock.	-	PMID:1550963
GO:0051082	unfolded protein binding	ISS	enables	PMID:3017958	ACCEPT	Sequence similarity annotation based on conserved alpha-crystallin domain defining small heat shock protein family. Well-characterized family with established unfolded protein binding activity. Molecular function well-supported by sequence conservation.	-	PMID:3017958
GO:0005737	cytoplasm	IDA	located_in	PMID:11001875	ACCEPT	Direct experimental evidence from immunohistochemistry. Study examined tissue distribution of multiple sHSPs in C. elegans using antibodies. Provides strongest support for cytoplasmic localization and anchors other cytoplasm annotations.	-	PMID:11001875
GO:0044183	protein folding chaperone	ISS	enables	GO_REF:0000033	NEW	Proposed new annotation. Accurately captures chaperone function of sHSPs. While not actively refold (unlike HSP70), they assist protein folding by preventing aggregation of unfolded intermediates. GO definition: binding to protein/complex to assist folding process. Supported by Bushman 2023.	-	-
