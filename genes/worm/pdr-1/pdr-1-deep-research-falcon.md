### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9XUS3
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00029536, ECO:0000256|PIRNR:PIRNR037880}; EC=2.3.2.31 {ECO:0000256|ARBA:ARBA00012251, ECO:0000256|PIRNR:PIRNR037880};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pdr-1 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CAB04599.2, ECO:0000313|WormBase:K08E3.7a}; ORFNames=CELE_K08E3.7 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CAB04599.2}, K08E3.7 {ECO:0000313|WormBase:K08E3.7a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the RBR family. Parkin subfamily.
- **Key Domains:** E3_UB_ligase_RBR. (IPR031127); IBR_dom. (IPR002867); Parkin. (IPR003977); Parkin-like_IBR. (IPR054694); Parkin_Znf-RING. (IPR041565)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pdr-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pdr-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pdr-1** (gene ID: pdr-1, UniProt: Q9XUS3) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: C. elegans pdr-1 encodes the nematode ortholog of human Parkin (an RBR-family E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase). Recent experimental work that engineered a functional mCherry::PDR-1 reporter explicitly describes canonical Parkin domain architecture (Ubl followed by RING0/RING1/IBR/RING2) and validates rescue of pdr-1 mutant mitochondrial phenotypes, confirming correct gene/protein identity and organism context (Caenorhabditis elegans) and alignment with the RBR Parkin subfamily (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; published Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12).

Comprehensive research report
Title: Functional annotation of C. elegans pdr-1 (parkin; UniProt Q9XUS3)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein: pdr-1 (Parkinson’s disease-related-1) encodes the C. elegans ortholog of human Parkin. Parkin/PDR-1 is an RBR (RING-between-RING) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and C-terminal RING0–RING1–IBR–RING2 domains that catalyze ubiquitin transfer to substrates. A functional mCherry::PDR-1 transgene shows the reporter can rescue pdr-1 mutant mitochondrial phenotypes, supporting its role as the endogenous Parkin ortholog (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12).
- Core biochemical function: E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is activated by PINK1-dependent phosphorylation events. In the conserved PINK1–Parkin cascade, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin (and the Parkin Ubl domain) to allosterically activate Parkin/PDR-1, which then ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins, promoting mitophagy (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 14-15, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 4-5).
- Pathway: PINK-1–PDR-1-dependent mitophagy in C. elegans. Genetic loss of pdr-1 impairs mitophagy, alters mitochondrial quality control, and modifies organismal stress responses and longevity phenotypes (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-021-00894-7; Nov 2021. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024) (markaki2021mitophagymechanismsin pages 7-8, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15).

2) Primary function, substrates, and cellular localization
- Enzymatic reaction and specificity: PDR-1 functions as a RBR E3 ligase, transferring ubiquitin to mitochondrial and other substrates following PINK1-mediated activation, analogous to mammalian Parkin. Reporter-based screens and proteomics in worms identified candidate mitochondrial targets/regulators (e.g., ANT-1.1/ATP-1/ATP-2, VDAC-1) and chaperone HSP-1, consistent with OMM protein ubiquitination during mitophagy (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 4-5).
- Localization: Endogenous PDR-1 is primarily cytosolic but shows enriched association with autophagy–lysosomal compartments and can be recruited to mitochondria upon mitophagy induction. The mCherry::PDR-1 reporter colocalizes with lysosomal markers (e.g., LMP-1::Venus), and its overabundance perturbs lysosomal dynamics (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4).

3) Role in the PINK-1–PDR-1 mitophagy pathway and phenotypes
- Canonical role: PDR-1 acts downstream of PINK-1 in mitophagy; PINK-1 accumulation on damaged mitochondria leads to PDR-1 activation and recruitment, ubiquitylating OMM proteins to trigger mitophagic engulfment. In C. elegans, PDR-1 cooperates with receptors such as DCT-1 and components of the mitophagy machinery to ensure mitochondrial quality control (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-021-00894-7; Nov 2021. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024) (markaki2021mitophagymechanismsin pages 7-8, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15).
- Cellular and organismal phenotypes: Loss of pdr-1 leads to mitochondrial depolarization, reduced ATP production, increased ROS, and altered Ca2+ homeostasis in worm models; genetic interactions with pink-1 and dct-1 indicate pathway dependence. Mitophagy impairment via pdr-1 knockdown shortens lifespan in longevity paradigms and compromises stress resilience. Conversely, functional PDR-1 contributes to control of mitochondrial DNA quality, fusion dynamics, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (URLs: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-021-00894-7; Nov 2021. https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15, markaki2021mitophagymechanismsin pages 7-8, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 4-5).

4) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Live reporter and abundance regulation (2023): A rescue-competent mCherry::PDR-1 reporter revealed predominantly cytosolic distribution with enrichment in lysosomal-like compartments, limited colocalization with LGG-1::GFP, and sensitivity of lysosomal dynamics to PDR-1 abundance. Genetic and proteomic screens implicated ant-1.1 (adenine nucleotide translocator), ubq-2 (UBA52 ortholog), ubl-1 (RPS27A ortholog), VDAC-1, HSP-1, and ATP-1/ATP-2 as interactors/regulators that modulate PDR-1 abundance and/or function. Elevated PDR-1 abundance altered α-synuclein processing, suggesting a dosage-sensitive role in proteostasis (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023; Zenodo dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.594006533) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 12-14, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 4-5).
- Small-molecule modulator (2024): Spautin-1 unexpectedly promotes PINK1–PRKN/PDR-1-dependent mitophagy by binding TOMM complex components (notably TOMM70), stabilizing full-length PINK1 at the OMM and enabling PRKN/PDR-1 translocation. In C. elegans neurons, pink-1 or pdr-1 knockdown abolished spautin-1-induced mitophagy; spautin-1 improved associative learning in an AD worm model (URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2383145; Aug 2024) (yi2024spautin1promotespink1prkndependent pages 6-9).
- Disease and ageing relevance (2024): Review of C. elegans models highlights that pharmacological mitophagy stimulation can reverse Aβ- and tau-related cognitive deficits via PINK-1/PDR-1 pathways; spermidine’s neuroprotective effects also require pink-1/pdr-1, further underscoring pathway conservation and therapeutic relevance (URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024) (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Experimental tools: The mCherry::PDR-1 reporter line (dmaIs48) enables visualization of PDR-1 localization and abundance, screening for genetic regulators, and studying autophagy–lysosomal dynamics in vivo. It functionally rescues pdr-1 mutant mitochondrial defects, making it suitable for pathway dissection and drug/genetic screens (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12).
- Therapeutic proof-of-concept: Spautin-1 acts upstream of PINK-1/PDR-1 to stimulate mitophagy and ameliorate associative learning deficits in a worm AD model, establishing a chemical-genetic paradigm for modulating PINK1–PDR-1 mitophagy in vivo (URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2383145; Aug 2024) (yi2024spautin1promotespink1prkndependent pages 6-9).

6) Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- Reviews synthesize that pdr-1 is essential for canonical mitophagy in C. elegans and that its loss impairs mitochondrial quality control, healthspan, and neuroprotection in models of proteinopathy. They further place pdr-1 alongside pink-1 and dct-1 within integrated mitochondrial quality control circuits, including mito-UPR and receptor-mediated mitophagy (URLs: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-021-00894-7; Nov 2021. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024) (markaki2021mitophagymechanismsin pages 7-8, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15).

7) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Reporter functional rescue: mCherry::PDR-1 reporter rescues mitochondrial phenotypes of pdr-1 mutants and reduces levels of mutated mtDNA, indicating retained E3 ligase functionality in vivo (Open Research Europe; Sep 2023). The reporter localizes to cytosol with enriched autophagy–lysosomal compartmentalization and limited colocalization with LGG-1::GFP; overabundance disrupts lysosomal dynamics (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4).
- Genetic regulation of abundance: RNAi against ant-1.1, ubq-2, and ubl-1 increases PDR-1 abundance and perturbs lysosomal morphology, linking mitochondrial nucleotide transport and ubiquitin supply to PDR-1 turnover; co-IP/MS identified VDAC-1 and HSP-1 among interactors (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 12-14).
- Pharmacology in vivo: Spautin-1 at 1 μM induces neuronal mitophagy in C. elegans; RNAi-mediated depletion of pink-1 or pdr-1 eliminates this effect. Mechanistically, spautin-1 interacts with TOMM complex proteins and stabilizes full-length PINK1 at the OMM, enabling PRKN/PDR-1 activation; drug treatment improves learning in a worm AD model (URL: https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2383145; Aug 2024) (yi2024spautin1promotespink1prkndependent pages 6-9).

8) Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- The symbol pdr-1 can be ambiguous across species; in C. elegans, pdr-1 unequivocally refers to the Parkin ortholog described above. The identity is supported by domain architecture, functional rescue with mCherry::PDR-1, and genetic epistasis with pink-1, aligning with UniProt Q9XUS3 annotations (URL: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 15, 2023) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 4-5).

*Table: Concise, cited summary table of key evidence for C. elegans pdr-1 (Parkin, UniProt Q9XUS3), covering identity, biochemistry, localization, pathway role, phenotypes, interactors, recent 2023–2024 findings, small-molecule modulators, and links to aging/neurodegeneration.*

Conclusions
- pdr-1 in C. elegans encodes an RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase orthologous to human Parkin that functions in the conserved PINK-1–PDR-1 mitophagy pathway. It is primarily cytosolic with dynamic association to autophagy–lysosomal compartments and mitochondria during mitophagy. Recent 2023–2024 studies established a functional fluorescent reporter and identified genetic regulators of PDR-1 abundance, and revealed a small molecule, spautin-1, that promotes PINK1–PDR-1-dependent mitophagy and improves learning in an AD worm model. These findings consolidate pdr-1’s central role in mitochondrial quality control, proteostasis, and neuroprotection in vivo and provide concrete experimental tools and pharmacological entry points for future applications (URLs: https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.14235.2; Sep 2023. https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2024.2383145; Aug 2024. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343; Nov 2024. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-021-00894-7; Nov 2021) (vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 1-4, vozdek2023fluorescentreporterof pages 10-12, yi2024spautin1promotespink1prkndependent pages 6-9, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15, markaki2021mitophagymechanismsin pages 7-8).
