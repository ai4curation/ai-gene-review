description: PDR-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of human Parkin, an RBR-family E3 ubiquitin-protein
  ligase that functions in the conserved PINK-1/PDR-1 mitophagy pathway. The protein
  contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and C-terminal RING0-RING1-IBR-RING2
  domains characteristic of RBR E3 ligases. PDR-1 is activated by PINK-1-mediated
  phosphorylation events and translocates to damaged mitochondria where it ubiquitinates
  outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to target them for mitophagic degradation.
  PDR-1 is primarily cytosolic but shows enriched association with autophagy-lysosomal
  compartments and is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane during mitophagy.
  Beyond mitophagy, PDR-1 also ubiquitinates CED-10/Rac1 to regulate apoptotic cell
  engulfment and cell migration. Loss of pdr-1 impairs mitochondrial quality control,
  increases sensitivity to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, and affects lifespan
  and proteostasis in models of neurodegeneration.

  review:
    summary: PDR-1 is primarily cytosolic/cytoplasmic as demonstrated by multiple
      studies. The mCherry::PDR-1 reporter showed predominantly cytosolic distribution
      with enrichment in lysosomal-like compartments (Vozdek et al. 2023, pdr-1-deep-research-falcon.md).

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from mammalian Parkin orthologs where synaptic
      function has been studied more extensively. While pdr-1 is expressed in neurons
      and loss causes proteotoxic stress sensitivity, direct evidence for synaptic
      transmission modulation in C. elegans is limited.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The annotation is phylogenetically reasonable based on mammalian Parkin
      studies, but represents a downstream consequence rather than a core molecular
      function of PDR-1. The core function is E3 ligase activity in mitophagy.

    label: response to toxic substance
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:16239214
  review:
    summary: Ved et al. 2005 showed that pdr-1 deletion increases sensitivity to mitochondrial
      complex I inhibitors (rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, stigmatellin) but
      not to paraquat or sodium azide.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Experimental evidence supports role in toxin response, but this is a consequence
      of mitochondrial quality control function rather than a primary function. Vulnerability
      to complex I inhibitors reflects mitochondrial dysfunction.
