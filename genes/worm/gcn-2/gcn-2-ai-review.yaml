description: GCN-2 is the sole C. elegans homolog of yeast/mammalian GCN2, a serine/threonine
  protein kinase that phosphorylates eIF2alpha at Ser49 in response to amino acid
  deprivation, mitochondrial stress, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress. It is the
  primary sensor for the integrated stress response (ISR) in C. elegans alongside
  PEK-1 (PERK homolog). GCN-2 functions to attenuate global translation while enabling
  selective translation of stress-responsive mRNAs such as atf-5, pha-4, and gpdh-1.
  It is required for lifespan extension associated with dietary restriction and TOR
  inhibition, and protects against mitochondrial dysfunction through translational
  control complementary to ATFS-1-mediated chaperone induction.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation inferred from phylogenetic analysis. While GCN-2 primarily
      functions in the cytosol at ribosome-associated sites, studies in other organisms
      show GCN2 can localize to nucleus. However, direct localization data for C.
      elegans GCN-2 in the nucleus was not found in retrieved literature (Tatara et
      al. 2024).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Phylogenetic inference is reasonable given conservation of GCN2 across
      eukaryotes. Nuclear localization is plausible though not directly demonstrated
      in C. elegans. Accept as IBA represents well-curated phylogenetic evidence.

    id: GO:0004694
    label: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha kinase activity
  directly_involved_in:
  - id: GO:0034514
    label: mitochondrial unfolded protein response
  locations:
  - id: GO:0005829
    label: cytosol
proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
- question: Does C. elegans GCN-2 have substrates other than eIF2alpha that contribute
    to dietary restriction-induced lifespan extension?
- question: What is the mechanism by which ROS activate GCN-2 in C. elegans?
- question: Is there tissue-specific expression or function of GCN-2 in C. elegans?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Direct localization studies of endogenous GCN-2 in C. elegans tissues
    using CRISPR-tagged GCN-2 or specific antibodies
  hypothesis: GCN-2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in association with ribosomes
- description: Phosphoproteomics analysis of gcn-2 mutants to identify potential non-eIF2alpha
    substrates of GCN-2
  hypothesis: GCN-2 may have additional substrates beyond eIF2alpha that contribute
    to stress responses
- description: Tissue-specific rescue experiments in gcn-2 mutants to determine site
    of action for lifespan and stress resistance phenotypes
  hypothesis: GCN-2 function in specific tissues (e.g., intestine, neurons) is critical
    for organismal stress responses
