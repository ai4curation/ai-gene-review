### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** D0Z5N4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase gcn-2 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22719267}; EC=2.7.11.1 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q19192}; AltName: Full=General control nonderepressible kinase 2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y81G3A.3b};
- **Gene Information:** Name=gcn-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y81G3A.3b}; ORFNames=Y81G3A.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y81G3A.3b};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. Ser/Thr protein
- **Key Domains:** aa-tRNA-synth_II/BPL/LPL. (IPR045864); CC_SR_Kinase. (IPR050339); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719); Protein_kinase_ATP_BS. (IPR017441)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "gcn-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'gcn-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **gcn-2** (gene ID: gcn-2, UniProt: D0Z5N4) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: The target matches Caenorhabditis elegans gcn-2 (Y81G3A.3), UniProt D0Z5N4, encoding the conserved serine/threonine eIF2α kinase GCN-2 that activates the integrated stress response (ISR). Canonical domain features (RWD regulatory region, protein kinase catalytic domain, and HisRS-like/aaRS-related domain) and activation by uncharged tRNA via the GCN1 complex are conserved and concordant with recent reviews (Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.3389/fragi.2024.1447370; IJMS, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25052998). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found for C. elegans (gcn-2) in the retrieved literature (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).

Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and enzymatic function: C. elegans gcn-2 encodes the eIF2α kinase GCN-2, a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates eIF2α at Ser51, reducing ternary complex formation to globally attenuate translation while enabling preferential translation of uORF‑containing mRNAs (e.g., ATF‑5, the worm ATF4 homolog). Activation occurs upon amino-acid insufficiency when uncharged tRNAs bind the GCN-2 HisRS-like domain, with the ribosome-associated factor GCN-1 facilitating activation on stalled/collided ribosomes (Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024; IJMS, Mar 2024; conceptual ISR framing also in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Aug 2023) (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, rath2023pkractivationin pages 2-4).
- Domain architecture: Reviews synthesize a conserved multi-domain GCN-2 architecture: N-terminal RWD domain (interaction with GCN1/IMPACT family), a kinase/pseudokinase module, a canonical protein kinase catalytic domain, a HisRS-like domain that binds uncharged tRNA, and C-terminal regions modulating activity; this aligns with the UniProt domain annotations provided (Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024; IJMS, Mar 2024) (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).
- Cellular site of action: GCN-2 functions in the cytosol at ribosome-associated sites; GCN1/ABCF complexes bind polyribosomes and stalled/disome ribosomes to couple uncharged tRNA sensing to GCN-2 activation. While worm-specific localization microscopy was not retrieved here, the ribosome-associated cytosolic localization of the GCN1–GCN2 axis is consistently described and inferred to be conserved in C. elegans (IJMS, Mar 2024; Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024) (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Dietary restriction (DR) vs ER stress: In C. elegans, DR/fasting increases eIF2α phosphorylation via GCN‑2; however, eIF2α phosphorylation is not required for DR‑associated early translational attenuation, NMD changes, or lifespan extension. In contrast, ER stress requires PERK/pek‑1 and eIF2α phosphorylation for translational attenuation and survival. Strikingly, double loss of gcn‑2 and pek‑1 abolishes DR‑mediated lifespan extension, suggesting complementary or alternative substrates or noncanonical roles of these kinases (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, Dec 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1263344) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 1-2, ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).
- Mitochondrial stress and ISR: Multiple 2024 reviews synthesize that mitochondrial proteostatic stress (UPRmt) can engage the ISR/eIF2α phosphorylation through GCN2 and other kinases, with ROS and nucleic acid signals implicated upstream; these reviews include worm perspectives on mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling and innate immunity (J Cell Biol., Feb 2024, https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202310005; Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., May 2024, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1405393; Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Aug 2023, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1270341) (rath2023pkractivationin pages 2-4).
- GCN1 advances: 2024 review highlights GCN1 as a hub for ribosome-collision sensing and co‑translational quality control, with relevance to GCN‑2 activation; worm data indicate GCN1 roles in apoptosis independent of GCN‑2 (IJMS, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25052998) (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).

Pathways, organismal phenotypes, and genetic interactions in C. elegans
- ISR branch and DR: GCN‑2 is the eIF2α kinase induced by amino‑acid scarcity in worms. Under DR/fasting, GCN‑2‑dependent eIF2α phosphorylation occurs, yet ISR signaling via eIF2α‑P is dispensable for early translation reduction and NMD changes under DR; however, combined loss of gcn‑2 and pek‑1 eliminates DR lifespan extension, implying broader roles (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 1-2, ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).
- ER stress interplay with PERK/pek‑1: PERK/pek‑1 is essential for eIF2α‑P and translational attenuation during ER stress in worms; eIF2α‑P is required for ER stress survival. This positions gcn‑2 as a DR/AA-sensing ISR arm and pek‑1 as the ER ISR arm, with combined function influencing longevity outcomes (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 1-2, ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).
- Mitochondrial stress and immunity: Reviews summarize that ISR kinases, including GCN‑2, are engaged during mitochondrial proteostasis stress and can influence innate immunity and proteostasis networks in C. elegans; explicit worm experiments tying gcn‑2 to UPRmt in 2023–2024 were not detailed in the retrieved texts, but mechanistic links are established conceptually (J Cell Biol., Feb 2024; Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., May 2024; Aug 2023) (rath2023pkractivationin pages 2-4).
- Genetic interactions with impt-1 (IMPACT homolog): impt‑1 is a conserved GCN2 inhibitor. In C. elegans, impt‑1+/– mutants show ~1.82× higher eIF2α phosphorylation and impt‑1 RNAi increases ATF‑5 expression by ~40%, consistent with ISR activation. impt‑1 knockdown extends lifespan (~16–21%) and enhances stress resistance in a gcn‑2‑dependent manner; lifespan extension requires gcn‑1 and atf‑5, and engages SKN‑1 (larval) and DAF‑16 (adult) in a temporal sequence (BMC Biology, Oct 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0301-2; summarized in Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024) (ferraz2016impactisa pages 2-5, ferraz2016impactisa pages 5-7, ferraz2016impactisa pages 9-10, ferraz2016impactisa pages 7-9, ferraz2016impactisa pages 1-2, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 2-3).
- Genetic interactions with gcn-1/ABCF-3: GCN1 is the ribosome-associated activator of GCN‑2. In worms, GCN1 also promotes developmental and irradiation-induced apoptosis independently of GCN‑2; ABCF‑3 mutants phenocopy the apoptosis defect, whereas gcn‑2 mutants do not, indicating GCN1 has GCN‑2–independent functions in apoptosis (IJMS, Mar 2024) (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).

Catalytic reaction and substrate specificity
- Reaction: ATP-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51 by GCN‑2 to reduce ternary complex formation and initiate ISR translational reprogramming; this is conserved and explicitly invoked in worm ISR studies during DR/fasting (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023; Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024; IJMS, Mar 2024) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).
- Substrate specificity and potential alternatives: eIF2α is the canonical substrate. Ma et al. (2023) suggest that the loss of DR lifespan extension in gcn‑2; pek‑1 double mutants despite dispensability of eIF2α‑P for DR‑driven translation changes raises the possibility of additional substrates or noncanonical roles for these kinases in longevity, but specific alternative substrates were not identified in worms (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 1-2, ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).

Subcellular localization where GCN-2 acts
- Evidence supports cytosolic, ribosome-associated action through GCN1/ABCF complexes binding to polyribosomes and collided ribosomes, enabling uncharged tRNA-mediated activation of GCN‑2. This mechanism is conserved and inferred to apply to C. elegans gcn‑2 (IJMS, Mar 2024; Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024) (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Targeting GCN2: Reviews in 2024 discuss GCN2 as a therapeutic target across age-related diseases (neurodegeneration, inflammation, cancer), with small-molecule modulators under investigation; model organisms including C. elegans are used to probe healthspan and stress-resilience effects of modulating ISR activity (Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.3389/fragi.2024.1447370) (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2).
- Worm as a platform: In C. elegans, genetic modulation of impt‑1/gcn‑2 and DR paradigms are deployed to dissect ISR-longevity crosstalk, using assays such as polysome profiling, SUnSET, eIF2α‑P immunoblotting, ATF‑5 reporter induction, and lifespan/stress survival, illustrating practical implementation of GCN‑2 pathway readouts (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023; BMC Biology, Oct 2016) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7, ferraz2016impactisa pages 2-5, ferraz2016impactisa pages 5-7, ferraz2016impactisa pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- 2024 and 2023 reviews converge that GCN‑2 is a conserved ISR sensor for amino-acid insufficiency, activated on ribosomes by uncharged tRNA via GCN1, culminating in eIF2α‑P and selective translation of stress-responsive mRNAs. They also highlight emerging inputs (ribosome collisions, oxidative stress, proteasome inhibition) and cross-talk with mitochondrial proteostasis and innate immunity, indicating that GCN‑2 integrates multiple stress modalities beyond amino acid starvation (Frontiers in Aging, Sep 2024; IJMS, Mar 2024; J Cell Biol., Feb 2024; Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Aug 2023/May 2024) (altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, rath2023pkractivationin pages 2-4).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- DR/fasting in C. elegans: Polysome profiling and SUnSET revealed translation attenuation upon food withdrawal that persists in gcn‑2 and eif‑2α(S49A) phospho‑null backgrounds, indicating ISR‑independent components of DR translation control. Loss of DR lifespan extension in gcn‑2;pek‑1 double mutants supports functional redundancy/parallelism (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).
- impt-1 genetic modulation: impt‑1+/– increases eIF2α‑P ~1.82±0.11‑fold; impt‑1 RNAi increases ATF‑5 ~40%; lifespan increases by ~16–21% depending on allele/RNAi. Longevity requires gcn‑2, gcn‑1, and atf‑5; SKN‑1 (larval) and DAF‑16 (adult) contribute temporally (BMC Biology, Oct 2016) (ferraz2016impactisa pages 2-5, ferraz2016impactisa pages 5-7, ferraz2016impactisa pages 9-10, ferraz2016impactisa pages 7-9, ferraz2016impactisa pages 1-2).
- GCN1 apoptosis roles: In worms, 12–13% survival of normally doomed pharyngeal sister cells in gcn‑1 mutants, and requirement for irradiation-induced gonadal apoptosis; these effects are not observed in gcn‑2 mutants, indicating GCN‑2–independent GCN1 functions (IJMS, Mar 2024) (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5).

Open questions and gaps
- Alternative substrates/noncanonical roles: The DR findings (ISR dispensable for translation attenuation; double mutant abolishes longevity) suggest GCN‑2 and PERK may have substrates beyond eIF2α or scaffold roles affecting longevity; specific alternative substrates in C. elegans remain to be identified (Frontiers in Cell and Dev. Biol., Dec 2023) (ma2023theintegratedstress pages 1-2, ma2023theintegratedstress pages 4-7).
- Direct localization in worm tissues: Ribosome-associated cytosolic function is clear from mechanism, but high-resolution localization of endogenous C. elegans GCN‑2 in vivo is not provided in the retrieved 2023–2024 sources and would benefit from targeted studies (tatara2024emergingroleof pages 17-18, tatara2024emergingroleof pages 4-5, altintas2024generalcontrolnonderepressible pages 1-2).
