## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5EGF0
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=CHE-2 protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CAB38019.1}; SubName: Full=WD_REPEATS_REGION domain-containing protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD61758.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=che-2 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD61758.1, ECO:0000313|WormBase:F38G1.1}; ORFNames=CELE_F38G1.1 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCD61758.1}, F38G1.1 {ECO:0000313|WormBase:F38G1.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Beta-prop_IFT80_2nd. (IPR056456); TPR_IFT80_172_dom. (IPR056157); WD40/YVTN_repeat-like_dom_sf. (IPR015943); WD40_repeat_dom_sf. (IPR036322); WD40_rpt. (IPR001680)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "che-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'che-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **che-2** (gene ID: che-2, UniProt: G5EGF0) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
Objective 1 verified the target identity and domain context; Objectives 2–4 gathered and extracted recent structural and classical C. elegans evidence; Objective 5 assembled an evidence table; Objective 6 synthesizes a comprehensive, well‑cited report prioritizing 2022–2024 sources.

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans che-2 (UniProt G5EGF0)

Identity, nomenclature, and domain architecture
• Gene/protein identity: che-2 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of intraflagellar transport protein 80 (IFT80), an established subunit of the IFT-B complex. Allelism and identity were determined genetically (ks68 is allelic to che-2) and by assignment to IFT complex B in C. elegans sensory cilia (IFT-B) (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 5-6, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).  
• Domain context and placement: Recent in situ structural work places IFT80 as a central scaffold within the IFT-B2 lobe of the IFT-B complex. IFT80 contains tandem WD (WD40/β‑propeller) domains followed by C‑terminal TPR motifs; within the IFT train polymer, its WD domains and TPR region form extended lateral interfaces that stabilize neighboring repeats, organizing the core architecture of IFT‑B2 (cryo‑ET/AlphaFold‑guided modeling) (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2).  
• Mandatory verification: The target organism is C. elegans, and the protein’s predicted domains (WD40/TPR) align with the UniProt domain listing and with structural placements in modern IFT‑B reconstructions (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2).

Primary molecular function and pathway role
• Role: CHE‑2/IFT80 is a core structural subunit of the anterograde IFT-B complex, specifically the IFT‑B2 subcomplex, which forms one lobe of the polymeric IFT trains that traffic axonemal building blocks and signaling proteins required for ciliogenesis and cilium maintenance (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4).  
• Architectural contribution: IFT80 lies at the center of IFT‑B2, in proximity to IFT172 and the IFT54/20 coiled‑coil pair; its lateral interfaces contribute to IFT‑B polymer stability and train assembly during anterograde transport (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4).  
• Pathway: CHE‑2 functions in the conserved intraflagellar transport pathway, where IFT‑B trains are driven anterogradely by kinesin‑2 motors and couple to retrograde dynein‑2 at the ciliary tip for return transport (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).

Cellular and subcellular localization; transport behavior
• Localization in C. elegans neurons: CHE‑2::GFP localizes to basal bodies and along the ciliary axoneme of amphid/phasmid sensory neurons; robust IFT movement is observed by live imaging (jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8). CHE‑2 also localizes near the transition zone and along axonemes, a pattern perturbed in certain background mutants (see BBS section below) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 5-7).  
• Quantitative IFT velocities in vivo: In C. elegans sensory cilia, CHE‑2::GFP exhibits anterograde IFT velocities close to the canonical rates measured for IFT components: approximately 0.7 μm/s in the middle segment (cooperation of kinesin‑II and OSM‑3) and approximately 1.2 μm/s in distal segments (OSM‑3‑dominated) (jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8). These values align with motor‑specific rates reported in C. elegans: kinesin‑II ≈ 0.5 μm/s, OSM‑3 ≈ 1.2 μm/s, and a combined intermediate ≈ 0.7 μm/s, supporting CHE‑2’s bona fide IFT‑B cargo behavior (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).

Phenotypes of che-2 mutants and functional readouts
• Ciliogenesis/sensory phenotypes: che‑2 mutants (IFT‑B) are dye‑filling defective (Dyf), display truncated or missing cilia, and exhibit chemotaxis defects, reflecting essential roles for IFT‑B in sensory ciliogenesis and function (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 5-6, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).  
• BBS genetic context: In bbs-7/8 mutant backgrounds, CHE‑2::GFP shows abnormal accumulation at mid/distal axonemal regions, despite preserved bidirectional IFT motility; ciliary length measurements in this study provide quantitative context (axoneme length 1.77 ± 0.71 μm, n = 50) (blacque2004lossofc. pages 5-7). These data emphasize how perturbations in IFT-associated complexes alter CHE‑2 distribution and cilia morphology but do not necessarily abolish transport dynamics.

Structural biology: 2022–2024 advances resolving CHE‑2/IFT80 in IFT‑B
• 2022 biochemically validated IFT‑B model: A 15‑subunit IFT‑B model integrated AlphaFold predictions with crosslink‑MS, SAXS, crystallography, and mutational binding assays to rationalize IFT‑B1/B2 architecture; IFT80 is placed within the IFT‑B assembly in positions consistent with cryo‑ET reconstructions (The EMBO Journal, Nov 2022) (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 12-18).  
• 2023 in situ IFT‑B architecture: High‑resolution cryo‑ET/AlphaFold‑guided modeling of anterograde trains in Chlamydomonas cilia produced molecular models for IFT‑A and IFT‑B (EMDB/PDB accessions). IFT80 is at the center of IFT‑B2, providing extended lateral contacts that stabilize flexible regions upon polymerization; IFT‑B repeats show one autoinhibited dynein‑2 bound every third repeat, mapping how motors align on the IFT‑B lattice (Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Jan 2023) (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4).  
• 2024 dynein‑2 tethering mechanism: An integrative cryo‑EM/cell biology study shows the dynein‑2 intermediate chain WDR60 uses a long N‑terminal extension to tether dynein‑2 to IFT‑B via interactions with the IFT80 TPR domain and the IFT54 CH domain; the IFT80:IFT172 interface is non‑overlapping with the WDR60 interface, consistent with simultaneous binding in assembled trains (The EMBO Journal, Mar 2024) (mukhopadhyay2024structureandtethering pages 9-11). Together, these studies converge on a mechanistic picture where CHE‑2/IFT80 serves as a scaffold in IFT‑B2 and participates in dynein‑2 engagement/tethering within anterograde trains.

Current applications and real‑world implementations
• Genetic and imaging markers: che‑2 loss‑of‑function (Dyf/chemotaxis) is widely used in C. elegans as a genetic handle for ciliogenesis screens and as a benchmark for IFT‑B integrity; CHE‑2::GFP is a routine marker for IFT particle dynamics and ciliary localization in vivo (ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 5-6, jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8).  
• Translational relevance by conservation: The conserved structural placement and interfaces of IFT80 within IFT‑B (2022–2024 structures) provide a framework to interpret human IFT80 variants implicated in ciliopathies by mapping mutations onto the IFT‑B2 scaffold and into potential dynein‑2 tethering surfaces, although those human genotype–structure links are beyond the scope of the C. elegans–focused sources used here (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 12-18, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, mukhopadhyay2024structureandtethering pages 9-11).

Expert perspectives and synthesis
• Authoritative consensus from recent structural biology (2022–2024) is that IFT80 (CHE‑2) is a central organizing element of IFT‑B2 in anterograde trains. Its WD40‑TPR architecture forms lateral polymer interfaces essential for IFT‑B cohesion and provides a docking/tethering context for dynein‑2 via WDR60’s N‑terminal extension, thereby aligning motor engagement with the structural repeat of the IFT‑B polymer (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 12-18, mukhopadhyay2024structureandtethering pages 9-11). In vivo C. elegans imaging corroborates that CHE‑2 behaves as a canonical IFT component moving at expected anterograde rates and localizing to basal bodies and axonemes; genetic loss produces hallmark Dyf/chemotaxis phenotypes consistent with disrupted ciliogenesis (jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8, ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 5-6, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).  
• Collectively, these data satisfy the mandatory verification criteria: che‑2 in C. elegans encodes the IFT80 ortholog with WD40/TPR domains; it functions within the IFT‑B2 subcomplex, localizes to sensory cilia, and is essential for ciliary assembly and function.

Relevant quantitative statistics and data
• IFT velocities (C. elegans, CHE‑2/IFT80 reporters): ≈ 0.7 μm/s (middle segment; kinesin‑II+OSM‑3), ≈ 1.2 μm/s (distal segment; OSM‑3) (jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8).  
• Motor reference velocities (C. elegans): kinesin‑II ≈ 0.5 μm/s; OSM‑3 ≈ 1.2 μm/s; intermediate ≈ 0.7 μm/s (inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).  
• Cilium length context (BBS background): 1.77 ± 0.71 μm (n = 50), with CHE‑2::GFP accumulations at mid/distal axoneme in bbs-7/8 mutants (blacque2004lossofc. pages 5-7).  
• Structural resources (IFT-A/IFT-B trains): Cryo‑ET maps/models deposited (EMDB: EMD‑15977/15978/15979; PDB: 8BD7/8BDA) underscoring IFT‑B2 placement of IFT80 and overall architecture (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
• Intraflagellar transport (IFT): Bidirectional trafficking system that builds and maintains cilia. IFT‑B mediates anterograde cargo delivery with kinesin‑2; IFT‑A and dynein‑2 mediate retrograde return. Trains are polymeric assemblies of IFT‑A/IFT‑B subunits repeated along the axonemal microtubules (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).  
• IFT‑B subcomplexes: IFT‑B is divided into IFT‑B1 and IFT‑B2 lobes; IFT80 (CHE‑2) is central to IFT‑B2 and interfaces with IFT172 and IFT54/20, contributing to train stability and motor coupling (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2).  
• WD40/TPR scaffolds: WD40 β‑propellers provide rigid platforms for multiprotein assembly; TPR motifs furnish elongated helical scaffolds for partner engagement. In IFT80 these domains together create lateral polymer interfaces and docking surfaces implicated in dynein‑2 tethering (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, mukhopadhyay2024structureandtethering pages 9-11).

Conclusion
All mandatory verification criteria are satisfied. CHE‑2 in C. elegans is the IFT80 ortholog with WD40/TPR domains, positioned centrally in the IFT‑B2 lobe where it scaffolds IFT‑B polymerization and contributes to dynein‑2 tethering. In vivo, CHE‑2 localizes to basal bodies and axonemes and moves with canonical anterograde IFT velocities; che‑2 loss causes Dyf and chemotaxis defects consistent with a primary role in sensory ciliogenesis and IFT (lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 3-4, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 1-2, lacey2023themolecularstructure pages 12-18, jensen2010localizationofa pages 5-8, ou2007sensoryciliogenesisin pages 5-6, inglis2009intraflagellartransportin pages 28-33).
