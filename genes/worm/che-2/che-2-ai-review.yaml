description: CHE-2 is the C. elegans ortholog of vertebrate IFT80, a WD40 repeat-containing
  protein that is a core component of the intraflagellar transport particle B (IFT-B)
  complex. CHE-2 is essential for the assembly and maintenance of sensory cilia in
  C. elegans. The protein localizes to sensory cilia where it participates in anterograde
  intraflagellar transport, carrying cargo proteins from the base to the tip of cilia.
  che-2 mutants exhibit severely truncated cilia, chemotaxis defects, and dye-filling
  defects characteristic of cilium structure mutants. The protein acts cell-autonomously
  in ciliated sensory neurons for proper cilium formation and sensory function.

  review:
    summary: CHE-2 is essential for cilium assembly. PMID:10518500 demonstrates that
      che-2 mutants have extremely short cilia with abnormal posterior projection,
      and that cilium extension fails during development in these mutants. The IBA
      annotation based on phylogenetic inference from the IFT80 orthology group is
      well-supported by direct experimental evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core function strongly supported by literature. PMID:10518500 shows che-2
      mutants have severely defective cilia that remain short throughout development.
      Expression of che-2 can rescue cilium morphology even at adult stage, demonstrating
      its essential role in cilium assembly.

  - statement: Cilium structure mutants including che-2 exhibit small body size
    supporting_text: The body size of Caenorhabditis elegans is thought to be controlled
      by sensory inputs because many mutants with sensory cilium structure defects
      exhibit small body size
  - statement: Body size regulation depends on cGMP signaling in sensory cilia
    supporting_text: the cGMP level is precisely controlled by GCY-12 and PDE-2 to
      determine body size through EGL-4
  - statement: Cilium defects disturb balanced control of cGMP levels
    supporting_text: the defects in the sensory cilium structure may disturb the balanced
      control of the cGMP level

  title: Dynein-Driven Retrograde Intraflagellar Transport Is Triphasic in C. elegans
    Sensory Cilia.
  findings:
  - statement: IFT-B complex is required for dynein-2 ciliary localization
    supporting_text: Disruption of the dynein-2 tail domain, light intermediate chain,
      or intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex abolishes dynein-2's ciliary localization,
      revealing their important roles in ciliary entry of dynein-2
  - statement: IFT-A and IFT-B function in ciliary transport
    supporting_text: our affinity purification and genetic analyses show that IFT-A
      subunits IFT-139 and IFT-43 function redundantly to promote dynein-2 motility

  title: Multiple chemosensory defects in daf-11 and daf-21 mutants of Caenorhabditis
    elegans.
  findings:
  - statement: daf-11 and daf-21 mutants have chemosensory defects including in chemotaxis
    supporting_text: daf-11 and daf-21 mutants are not defective in avoidance of certain
      non-volatile repellents, but are defective in taxis to non-volatile attractants
