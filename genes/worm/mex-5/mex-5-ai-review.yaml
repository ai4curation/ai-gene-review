description: MEX-5 is a CCCH-type tandem zinc finger RNA-binding protein that is essential
  for establishing soma/germline asymmetry in early C. elegans embryos. MEX-5 forms
  an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient in the one-cell embryo, with high
  concentrations at the anterior, driven by PAR-1-dependent phosphorylation that increases
  its diffusion rate in the posterior. MEX-5 functions by binding mRNA with high affinity
  (Kd ~10 nM) but low sequence specificity, recognizing tracts of 6+ uridines. This
  high-affinity mRNA binding allows MEX-5 to compete with PGL-3 (which binds RNA ~20-fold
  weaker) for mRNA, thereby dissolving P granules in the anterior cytoplasm and promoting
  their posterior localization through an mRNA competition mechanism. MEX-5 works
  redundantly with the nearly identical protein MEX-6. MEX-5 is also regulated by
  polo kinases (PLK-1, PLK-2) through binding to phosphorylated T186 (primed by MBK-2/DYRK2),
  which is important for its function in embryonic polarity.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MEX-5 is a CCCH tandem zinc finger protein homologous to tristetraprolin
      (TTP/ZFP36) family members that bind AU-rich elements. However, MEX-5 has diverged
      from mammalian TZF proteins in its RNA specificity. While TTP binds UUAUUUAUU
      elements with high specificity, MEX-5 recognizes poly-uridine tracts (6+ U residues)
      with high affinity but low specificity (PMID:17264081). The IBA annotation may
      be based on phylogenetic inference from the TTP family, but MEX-5 has distinct
      binding specificity.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: MEX-5 does not bind AU-rich elements with the specificity typical of TTP/ZFP36
      family members. PMID:17264081 demonstrates the minimal binding site is a tract
      of six or more uridines and that mutation of a single amino acid in each MEX-5
      zinc finger confers tristetraprolin-like specificity. The divergence of the
      discriminator residue in MEX-5 results in different binding specificity from
      mammalian TZF proteins. A more appropriate term would be poly-pyrimidine tract
      binding (GO:0008187) which is already annotated with IDA evidence.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This annotation is derived from phylogenetic inference based on homology
      to TTP/ZFP36 family members, which are well-established to promote mRNA deadenylation.
      However, there is no direct evidence that MEX-5 promotes poly(A) tail shortening
      in C. elegans. MEX-5's primary function appears to be competing with PGL-3 for
      mRNA binding to regulate P granule formation, not mRNA decay.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: While MEX-5 is homologous to TTP/ZFP36 family members that promote mRNA
      deadenylation, the literature on MEX-5 focuses on its role in P granule dissolution
      via mRNA competition (PMID:27594427) and embryonic polarity (PMID:10882103),
      not mRNA decay. MEX-5 has divergent RNA binding specificity from its mammalian
      homologs. Without direct experimental evidence for deadenylation activity, this
      represents an over-annotation based on family function.

  review:
    summary: MEX-5 binds mRNA and is involved in regulating translation of germline
      proteins through its localization to the anterior. The IBA annotation suggests
      translation repressor activity based on phylogenetic inference. MEX-5 does affect
      expression of germline proteins in the anterior, but the mechanism involves
      mRNA competition with PGL-3 and P granule dissolution rather than direct translation
      repression.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: While MEX-5 inhibits expression of germline proteins in the anterior (PMID:10882103),
      the mechanism by which it does so is primarily through competing with PGL-3
      for mRNA to dissolve P granules (PMID:27594427), rather than direct translation
      repression. MEX-5 may contribute to translation regulation indirectly, but there
      is no direct evidence that it functions as a translation repressor. This annotation

    summary: This annotation suggests MEX-5 functions as an adaptor between specific
      RNA sequences and proteins. While MEX-5 binds mRNA and interacts with proteins

    reason: MEX-5 does not have sequence-specific RNA binding. PMID:17264081 clearly
      demonstrates that MEX-5 recognizes linear RNA sequences with high affinity but
      low specificity. The term "sequence-specific" in GO:0160134 does not apply to

  review:
    summary: MEX-5 is essential for establishing anterior/posterior asymmetry in early
      C. elegans embryos, functioning downstream of PAR proteins to distribute germline
      determinants.
    action: NEW
    reason: A/P axis specification is a core biological process for MEX-5. The protein
      links PAR polarity to downstream protein asymmetries (PMID:10882103).

    label: P granule organization
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:27594427
  review:
    summary: MEX-5 regulates P granule organization through its mRNA competition mechanism,
      controlling when and where P granules assemble in the embryo.
    action: NEW
    reason: P granule organization is a core process regulated by MEX-5. The MEX-5
      gradient drives P granule segregation to the posterior.
    supported_by:
    - reference_id: PMID:27594427
      supporting_text: We conclude that gradients of polarity proteins can position
        RNP granules during development by using RNA competition to regulate local
        phase separation.

  title: Molecular basis of RNA recognition by the embryonic polarity determinant
    MEX-5.
  findings:
  - statement: MEX-5 binds RNA with high affinity but low specificity
    supporting_text: Here we show that the TZF protein MEX-5, a primary anterior determinant,
      is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes linear RNA sequences with high affinity
      but low specificity.
  - statement: Minimal binding site is 6+ uridine tract within 9-13 nucleotide window

      and regulate the activity of two key polarity proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6.
  - statement: T186 is phosphorylated by MBK-2 (DYRK2 kinase)
    supporting_text: We also show that MBK-2, a developmentally regulated DYRK2 kinase
      activated at meiosis II, primes T(186) for subsequent polo kinase-dependent
      phosphorylation.
  - statement: T186 phosphorylation is essential for polo kinase binding
    supporting_text: We identify an amino acid of MEX-5, T(186), essential for polo
      binding and show that T(186) is important for MEX-5 function in vivo.

  title: Polar Positioning of Phase-Separated Liquid Compartments in Cells Regulated
    by an mRNA Competition Mechanism.
  findings:
  - statement: P granules are liquid-like phase-separated compartments
    supporting_text: P granules are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein compartments that
      are involved in germline development in C. elegans. They are liquids that condense
      at one end of the embryo by localized phase separation
  - statement: PGL-3 alone can form P granule-like droplets in vitro
    supporting_text: We reconstitute P granule-like droplets in vitro using a single
      protein PGL-3.
  - statement: MEX-5 competes with PGL-3 for mRNA binding
    supporting_text: we show that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can
      regulate the formation of PGL-3 droplets.
  - statement: Competition mechanism drives P granule dissolution in anterior
    supporting_text: In this model, MEX-5 influences the demixing of PGL-3 and mRNA
      by depleting the local free mRNA concentration.
  - statement: MEX-5 gradient regulates local phase separation of P granules
    supporting_text: We conclude that gradients of polarity proteins can position
      RNP granules during development by using RNA competition to regulate local phase
      separation.
core_functions:
- description: MEX-5 dissolves P granules in the anterior of early embryos by competing
    with PGL-3 for mRNA binding. MEX-5's high affinity for mRNA compared to PGL-3
    depletes the free mRNA needed for P granule assembly, causing dissolution through
    altered phase separation dynamics.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does MEX-5 directly repress translation, or is its effect on germline
    protein expression entirely through P granule dissolution?
- question: What is the structural basis for MEX-5's low sequence specificity compared
    to its TTP homologs?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Perform ribosome profiling/Ribo-seq to determine if MEX-5 directly
    affects translation. This would distinguish between MEX-5's proposed translation
    repression activity and its documented mRNA competition function.
  hypothesis: MEX-5 affects germline protein expression through P granule dissolution
    rather than direct translation repression
- description: Perform CLIP-seq to identify MEX-5 RNA targets genome-wide. This would
    validate the low-specificity binding model and identify which mRNAs MEX-5 competes
    for with PGL-3.
  hypothesis: MEX-5 binds promiscuously to most mRNAs containing poly-U tracts
