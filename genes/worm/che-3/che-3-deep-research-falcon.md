4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'che-3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **che-3** (gene ID: che-3, UniProt: Q19542) in worm.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: che-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the dynein-2 (IFT-dynein) heavy chain, the ortholog of human DYNC2H1, matching UniProt Q19542. It is a dynein heavy chain family member with AAA+ ATPase modules, consistent with the listed domains. Organism: C. elegans. Stop criteria for symbol ambiguity not triggered; literature consistently assigns che-3 to dynein-2 heavy chain in C. elegans (non-motile sensory cilia) (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2, vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).

Executive summary
CHE-3 is the core heavy chain motor of the dynein-2 complex that powers retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) in C. elegans sensory cilia. It localizes to cilia and is essential for cilium maintenance, transition zone (TZ) gating, and clearance of periciliary and membrane proteins from the axoneme. Temperature-sensitive che-3 enables reversible, adult-onset perturbations revealing roles for dynein-2 in TZ assembly and ciliary homeostasis. Recent work “hot-wiring” dynein-2 by disabling autoinhibition shows IFT-A promotes dynein-2 coupling and initiation of retrograde motility. Quantitatively, che-3 loss reduces retrograde IFT frequency and velocity and shortens cilia; translationally, the human ortholog DYNC2H1 is a major skeletal ciliopathy gene (e.g., Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy), underscoring conserved function (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2, goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3, vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Intraflagellar transport (IFT): Bidirectional movement of large “train” assemblies composed of IFT-B (anterograde) and IFT-A (retrograde-associated) complexes with cargoes along axonemal microtubules; kinesin-2 drives anterograde, dynein-2 drives retrograde transport. The BBSome stabilizes trains and contributes to membrane protein trafficking in the retrograde direction (JCS “At a glance” review) (vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).
- Dynein-2 (IFT dynein): A cytoplasmic dynein specialized for cilia; its heavy chain (CHE-3 in C. elegans) contains AAA+ ATPase modules and generates force for retrograde IFT. Autoinhibition keeps dynein-2 inactive during anterograde carriage until activation at/near the ciliary tip initiates retrograde motility (vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2, goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3).
- Transition zone (TZ): The ciliary gate at the ciliary base that controls entry/exit and maintains compartmentalization. IFT integrity influences TZ assembly and gating; dynein-2-mediated retrograde transport contributes to clearing mislocalized proteins from cilia (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Hot-wiring dynein-2 (2023): CRISPR-engineered mutations that disable the conserved autoinhibitory “closed” conformation of CHE-3 in vivo reinstated retrograde movement even in IFT-A–deficient cilia, revealing that IFT-A promotes dynein-2 coupling to retrograde trains and initiation at the tip, and that multiple mechanisms restrain dynein-2 during anterograde IFT. Cilia length remained near wild type, indicating hot-wiring did not impair ciliogenesis (bioRxiv, May 2023) (goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3).
- Transition zone–retrograde IFT interplay (preprint 2025, complements 2018 EMBO reports): Disrupting TZ components (e.g., mks-5 or nphp-4) can reduce accumulation of IFT/dynein-2 in retrograde-defective cilia and partially restore axoneme length by enabling passive diffusion and EV shedding as alternative clearance routes, indicating that a restrictive TZ exacerbates retrograde IFT failure. These findings refine the earlier 2018 discovery that IFT-dynein is required for proper TZ assembly and gating (bioRxiv, Oct 2025; EMBO reports, 2018) (decastro2025removalofthe pages 1-4, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7).
- Mechanistic perspective (2024): Synthesis of dynein-2 regulation highlights that the TZ barrier limits IFT train transit; weakening TZ (loss of NPHP-4 or MKS-5) increases IFT velocities across the TZ and can aid trains with reduced dynein-2 power, but complete TZ removal does not rescue nonmotile dynein-2 heavy chain mutants, indicating a minimal force requirement for retrograde IFT across the gate (2024 analysis) (rodrigues2024uncoveringthemechanisms pages 69-72, rodrigues2024uncoveringthemechanisms pages 112-115).

3) Primary function, localization, and pathways
- Primary function: CHE-3 (dynein-2 heavy chain) is the retrograde IFT motor. It carries IFT-A/IFT-B complexes and associated cargoes from the ciliary tip back to the base, clearing turnover products and maintaining ciliary composition and length. Dynein-2 works within polymeric IFT trains; the BBSome contributes to retrograde trafficking of membrane proteins (vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2). Disruption of che-3 impairs retrograde transport while variably sparing anterograde IFT, producing stalled accumulations within cilia (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).
- Cellular localization: CHE-3 localizes to non-motile sensory cilia in C. elegans and functions on axonemal microtubules within the ciliary compartment, with critical roles at the tip (retrograde initiation) and at the transition zone (gate maintenance and clearance) (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).
- Pathway coupling and activation: During anterograde IFT, dynein-2 is carried in an autoinhibited conformation; at the ciliary tip, it is activated and coupled to retrograde trains. IFT-A promotes dynein-2 coupling and retrograde initiation. Disabling autoinhibition (“hot-wiring”) reenables retrograde movement in IFT-A–deficient cilia, indicating multiple restraints prevent premature activation during anterograde transport (goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3).
- Transition zone and gating: Using a temperature-sensitive che-3 allele, dynein-2 was found essential for assembly of a functional TZ and for gating that prevents periciliary proteins from entering cilia. Restoring dynein-2 function in adults reverses ciliary structure, TZ protein localization, and gating defects, although reversibility declines with age (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).

4) Mutant phenotypes, quantitative data, and statistics
- Ciliary structure and IFT dynamics in ts-che-3: At restrictive temperature, ts-che-3 animals develop short, bulbous cilia with electron-dense, vesicle-like accumulations and abnormal membrane–microtubule connections. Quantitatively, cilia shorten over time: using BBS-7 as a reporter, cilium length decreased to ~3.8 µm after 18 hours and ~3.4 µm after 24 hours at restrictive temperature. Retrograde IFT is selectively reduced: the detectable retrograde-to-anterograde particle ratio fell to 0.273 in che-3(nx159ts) vs 0.926 in wild type (P < 0.001); retrograde velocities were slower while anterograde IFT could remain near wild type under some conditions (EMBO reports, 2018) (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7).
- Dye-filling and sensory phenotypes: The ts allele che-3(nx159ts) (Gly→Glu near the essential AAA2 Asp) shows a Dyf (dye-filling defective) phenotype upon upshift, consistent with disrupted ciliary function (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).
- Autoinhibition/activation metrics: In hot-wired CHE-3, cilia lengths remained close to wild type (e.g., ~7.4 ± 0.61 µm vs 7.3 ± 0.64 µm), and retrograde motility occurred in IFT-A–deficient cilia without tug-of-war, indicating specific roles for IFT-A in coupling and initiation rather than basic motor function (bioRxiv, 2023) (goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3).
- Transition zone modulation of retrograde defects: Removing TZ components reduces IFT/dynein-2 accumulation in retrograde-defective cilia and permits partial axoneme length rescue by passive diffusion and EV release; this emphasizes how gating strength shapes the outcome of dynein-2 dysfunction (bioRxiv, 2025; complements EMBO reports 2018) (decastro2025removalofthe pages 1-4, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Temporal control of dynein-2: The che-3(nx159ts) allele enables reversible adult-onset inhibition and restoration of dynein-2 function to dissect maintenance vs developmental roles in cilia, TZ assembly, and cargo gating (EMBO reports, 2018) (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).
- Mechanistic hot-wiring: Disabling dynein-2 autoinhibition in vivo provides a tool to probe stepwise coupling to IFT-A and turnaround at the tip, revealing checkpoints that prevent premature activation and suggesting strategies to modulate retrograde transport in disease models (bioRxiv, 2023) (goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3).
- TZ manipulation: Genetic weakening of the TZ barrier illustrates potential avenues to mitigate retrograde IFT defects by enhancing diffusion/EV-based clearance, with caveats that full rescue requires sufficient dynein-2 force production (bioRxiv, 2025; EMBO reports, 2018) (decastro2025removalofthe pages 1-4, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7).

6) Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- The Journal of Cell Science “At a glance” review emphasizes dynein-2’s essential role in ciliary assembly/function, the coordination of IFT-A/B with kinesin-2 and dynein-2, and outstanding mechanistic issues around dynein-2 activation and regulation—all directly addressed by the 2018 and 2023–2024 C. elegans studies (vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).
- EMBO reports (2018) provided a paradigm shift by showing that retrograde IFT (dynein-2) supports not only retrograde transport but also TZ assembly and ciliary gating, revealing cross-talk between IFT and the ciliary gate (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).
- 2024 analysis underscores the concept of a “force threshold” for retrograde IFT across the TZ and the modulatory role of TZ composition (NPHP/MKS modules), reconciling phenotypes across IFT-A, dynein-2, and TZ mutants (rodrigues2024uncoveringthemechanisms pages 69-72, rodrigues2024uncoveringthemechanisms pages 112-115).

7) Translational relevance to human disease
- DYNC2H1 mutations cause skeletal ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and related short-rib polydactyly syndromes; the C. elegans che-3 studies illuminate conserved mechanisms—retrograde transport, autoinhibition/activation, IFT-A coupling, and TZ gating—that likely underlie pathogenesis when disrupted in humans (vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2).

8) Limitations and open questions
- Outstanding issues include the precise molecular steps of dynein-2 tip activation, full composition of the worm dynein-2 complex and accessory chains in vivo, and how BBSome interfaces with dynein-2 under different signaling states. Preprints provide hypotheses (e.g., TZ removal enabling diffusion/EV-based clearance), but peer-reviewed confirmation and quantitative in vivo kinetics across neuron types remain needed (decastro2025removalofthe pages 1-4, goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3, vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).

Conclusion
CHE-3 encodes the dynein-2 heavy chain motor that powers retrograde IFT in C. elegans sensory cilia. It localizes to cilia and is essential for maintaining ciliary length and composition, for proper transition zone assembly and gating, and for clearing ciliary cargoes. Recent advances using temperature-sensitive che-3 and autoinhibition-disabling “hot-wiring” reveal mechanistic roles for IFT-A in dynein-2 coupling and initiation and for the transition zone in modulating outcomes of retrograde defects. Quantitative analyses document reductions in retrograde IFT frequency/velocity and time-dependent cilium shortening upon che-3 impairment. These conserved mechanisms link directly to human DYNC2H1 ciliopathies and provide a foundation for in vivo mechanistic and therapeutic exploration (jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 5-7, jensen2018roleforintraflagellar pages 1-2, goncalvessantos2023hotwiringdynein2uncovers pages 1-3, decastro2025removalofthe pages 1-4, vuolo2020cytoplasmicdynein2at pages 1-2).
