description: CHE-3 is the C. elegans cytoplasmic dynein 2 heavy chain 1, 
  orthologous to human DYNC2H1 and Chlamydomonas DHC1b. It is an AAA+ ATPase 
  motor protein that powers retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) within 
  sensory cilia, moving IFT particles and cargo from the cilium tip back to the 
  base. CHE-3 is essential for the formation and maintenance of sensory cilia 
  structure in chemosensory neurons. Loss-of-function mutations cause 
  progressive developmental defects of chemosensory cilia, leading to defects in
  chemotaxis, osmotic avoidance, dye-filling capacity, and dauer formation. The 
  protein contains multiple AAA domains with P-loop nucleotide-binding motifs 
  and a stalk region for microtubule binding. CHE-3 specifically drives 
  retrograde transport in cilia but not in dendrites, where a different dynein 
  may function.

      label: cilium movement involved in cell motility
    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: CHE-3 is expressed in sensory cilia which are non-motile (9+0 
        structure) in C. elegans. The IBA annotation appears to derive from 
        phylogenetic inference from motile cilium orthologs in other species 
        (e.g., Drosophila, mouse). However, C. elegans sensory cilia lack the 
        outer dynein arms required for ciliary beating and cell motility.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: C. elegans sensory cilia are non-motile primary cilia-like 
        structures (PMID:10790327). CHE-3 functions in retrograde IFT, not in 
        ciliary motility. This annotation represents incorrect phylogenetic 
        transfer from organisms with motile cilia.

    review:
      summary: C. elegans sensory cilia have a modified non-motile structure, 
        not a 9+2 motile cilium. CHE-3 localizes to non-motile sensory cilia in 
        chemosensory neurons. The IBA annotation is based on orthologs that 
        localize to motile cilia in other organisms.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: CHE-3 is localized to non-motile sensory cilia in C. elegans 
        (PMID:10790327). The annotation to 9+2 motile cilium is incorrect for 
        this species. The IDA annotation to GO:0097730 (non-motile cilium) from 
        the same paper accurately captures the localization.

    review:
      summary: Dynein heavy chains are known to interact with intermediate 
        chains to form functional dynein complexes. CHE-3 as a cytoplasmic 
        dynein 2 heavy chain would be expected to bind intermediate chains as 
        part of its role in the cytoplasmic dynein 2 complex. UniProt indicates 
        CHE-3 forms a homodimer and associates with light intermediate chains.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound. Dynein heavy chains 
        characteristically bind intermediate chains to form the complete dynein

        from the cilium tip back to the base. This is directly demonstrated by

      reason: The phenotype is real but represents an indirect consequence of 
        ciliary defects disrupting chemosensory signaling required for normal 
        dauer induction. This is a pleiotropic effect, not a core function of 
        CHE-3.

      reason: Consistent with IBA and IEA annotations for the same term. CHE-3

    evidence_type: IGI
    original_reference_id: PMID:11677050
    review:
      summary: The annotation reflects genetic placement of che-3 between daf-11
        and daf-7 (TGF-beta) in the dauer signaling pathway. However, this is an
        indirect effect of ciliary defects on sensory signaling, not a direct 
        role in TGF-beta regulation.
      action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
      reason: The genetic interaction is real but the annotation implies a more 
        direct role in TGF-beta signaling than warranted. CHE-3's effect on 
        TGF-beta signaling is indirect, mediated through its essential role in 
        cilium structure and chemosensory function. The paper states che-3 is 
        "placed between daf-11 and daf-7" but this reflects sensory pathway 
        architecture, not direct regulation of TGF-beta signaling.

    review:
      summary: CHE-3 is required for proper localization of IFT proteins within 
        cilia. In che-3 mutants, IFT particles accumulate at cilium tips. This 
        reflects its role in retrograde transport of proteins.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: While not incorrect, the term is too general. CHE-3's role is 
        specifically in retrograde IFT, which is a specialized form of 
        intracellular transport. The term GO:0035721 (intraciliary retrograde 
        transport) is more precise and already annotated.

        dysfunction.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The phenotype is well-documented but represents an indirect 
        consequence of ciliary defects. CHE-3 does not directly participate in 
        chemosensory signal transduction; rather, its role in maintaining cilium
        structure is required for proper chemosensory function.
