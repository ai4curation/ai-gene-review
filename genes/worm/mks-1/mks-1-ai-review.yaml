description: 'MKS-1 (also known as XBX-7) is a B9 domain-containing protein that localizes
  to the ciliary transition zone in C. elegans sensory neurons. It is the ortholog
  of human MKS1, which is mutated in Meckel-Gruber syndrome. MKS-1 is a component
  of the MKS complex (also called the MKS module), which works together with the NPHP
  complex to establish and maintain the ciliary gate at the transition zone. The B9
  domain is structurally related to C2 domains and may be involved in membrane association.
  MKS-1 functions redundantly with other B9 proteins (MKSR-1/TZA-1 and MKSR-2/TZA-2)
  and the nephrocystins (NPH-1, NPH-4). Single mutants show no overt ciliary defects,
  but combined mutations with nphp genes result in severe ciliogenesis and dendrite
  formation defects in amphid and phasmid neurons.

    summary: 'MKS-1 is a well-established component of the MKS complex (MKS module)

      with MKSR-1, MKSR-2, MKS-3, MKS-5, and MKS-6 (PMID:21422230). This annotation
