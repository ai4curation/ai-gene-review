description: >-
  C. elegans HSP-12.3 is a 12.3 kDa member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP/HSP20)
  family. It contains an alpha-crystallin domain (SHSP domain) but has an unusually
  short N-terminal region and lacks a C-terminal tail, making it one of the smallest
  known sHSPs. Recombinant HSP-12.3 forms tetramers rather than the large oligomeric
  complexes typical of other sHSPs, and critically, it lacks detectable in vitro
  chaperone-like activity (PMID:9744800). This distinguishes it from canonical sHSPs
  that function as holdase chaperones. HSP-12.3 physically interacts with HSP-12.2
  (PMID:9744800). The protein is associated with reproductive tissues including vulva
  and spermatheca (PMID:11001875). Despite lacking chaperone activity in vitro, C.
  elegans 12 kDa sHSPs play roles in dauer formation, longevity, and reproduction
  in vivo. The PMID:9744800 study concludes that tetramers are the building blocks
  of sHSP complexes and that higher multimer formation, mediated through the N-terminal
  domains, is a prerequisite for chaperone-like activity.

    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for cytoplasmic localization, inferred phylogenetically from
      a large set of sHSP orthologs across fly, worm, mouse, rat, human, and
      zebrafish species. The inference is phylogenetically well-supported. sHSPs
      are generally cytoplasmic proteins, and immunohistochemical data in C. elegans
      shows HSP12 proteins in vulva and spermatheca tissue (PMID:11001875).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      Cytoplasmic localization is well-established for sHSP family proteins. The
      IBA inference from multiple orthologs is phylogenetically sound and consistent
      with immunohistochemical localization data in C. elegans (PMID:11001875).

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for nuclear localization based on phylogenetic inference from
      mammalian sHSP orthologs including CRYAA, CRYAB, HSP27/HSPB1 that have been
      reported to translocate to the nucleus under stress conditions. Nuclear
      localization is not the primary compartment for sHSPs and has not been
      specifically demonstrated for C. elegans HSP-12.3.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      Nuclear localization has been reported for some mammalian sHSP orthologs. The
      IBA inference is phylogenetically supported but represents a secondary or
      stress-dependent localization. Not the primary compartment for sHSP function.
      Retained as non-core.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for involvement in heat stress response, inferred
      phylogenetically from a large set of sHSP orthologs across fly, worm, and
      zebrafish. HSP-12.3 is classified as a heat shock protein (HSP20 family),
      and while its in vivo response to heat has not been specifically characterized,
      its classification as an sHSP and the IBA inference from well-characterized
      orthologs support this annotation.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      HSP-12.3 is a member of the sHSP/HSP20 family which is fundamentally involved
      in heat stress response. The IBA inference from multiple sHSP orthologs is
      phylogenetically well-supported. Response to heat is a core function of the
      sHSP family even if the mechanism differs from canonical chaperone activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IBA annotation for protein refolding, inferred phylogenetically primarily from
      Drosophila sHSP orthologs. However, HSP-12.3 has been experimentally demonstrated
      to lack chaperone-like activity in vitro (PMID:9744800). Kokke et al. showed that
      recombinant HSP-12.3 forms tetramers and is devoid of in vitro chaperone-like
      abilities. The authors concluded that higher multimer formation, mediated through
      the N-terminal domains that HSP-12.3 lacks, is a prerequisite for chaperone-like
      activity. This annotation is therefore incorrect for HSP-12.3.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: >-
      HSP-12.3 has been directly demonstrated to lack chaperone-like activity in vitro
      (PMID:9744800). It forms tetramers rather than the large oligomeric complexes
      required for chaperone function. The IBA inference from Drosophila sHSP orthologs
      does not apply because HSP-12.3 has divergent structural properties (very short
      N-terminal region, no C-terminal tail) that preclude holdase/chaperone activity.
      There is also a NOT annotation for GO:0051082 (unfolded protein binding) from the
      same publication confirming this.

          both appear devoid of in vitro chaperone-like abilities. This supports the
          notion that tetramers are the building blocks of sHSP complexes, and that
          higher multimer formation, mediated through the N-terminal domains, is a
          prerequisite for chaperone-like activity.

  review:
    summary: >-
      IPI annotation for heat shock protein binding based on Kokke et al. 1998
      (PMID:9744800). The study demonstrated physical interaction between HSP-12.3
      and HSP-12.2 (WB:WBGene00002011), both of which are 12 kDa sHSPs that form
      tetramers. This represents homotypic interaction within the sHSP family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The physical interaction between HSP-12.3 and HSP-12.2 is directly demonstrated
      by experimental evidence (PMID:9744800). Heat shock protein binding accurately
      captures this interaction between sHSP family members. This is a core molecular
      function for HSP-12.3.

  review:
    summary: >-
      NOT annotation (negated IDA) for unfolded protein binding based on Kokke et al.
      1998 (PMID:9744800). The study directly tested recombinant HSP-12.3 for
      chaperone-like activity and found it devoid of the ability to prevent aggregation
      of denaturing substrate proteins. This negative result is consistent with the
      structural analysis showing that HSP-12.3 forms tetramers rather than the large
      oligomeric complexes required for chaperone function. GO:0051082 is proposed for
      obsoletion, but the negation is still informative as it indicates this protein
      does not have holdase activity.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      This NOT annotation is an important negative result directly demonstrated by
      experimental evidence (PMID:9744800). HSP-12.3 lacks chaperone-like activity
      and does not bind unfolded proteins in the functional sense despite being an
      sHSP family member. The negation correctly documents this experimentally
      determined absence of function.

    description: >-
      HSP-12.3 is an atypical sHSP that forms tetramers and physically interacts
      with HSP-12.2 (PMID:9744800). Unlike canonical sHSPs, it lacks chaperone-like
      activity in vitro due to its very short N-terminal region and absence of
      C-terminal tail, which prevents higher-order oligomerization required for
      holdase function (PMID:9744800). Its role in the heat stress response may
      involve protein-protein interactions with other sHSP family members rather
      than direct substrate holdase activity.
