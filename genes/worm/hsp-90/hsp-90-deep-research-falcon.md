## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q18688
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock protein 90; AltName: Full=Abnormal dauer formation protein 21;
- **Gene Information:** Name=hsp-90 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAA99793.1}; Synonyms=daf-21 {ECO:0000312|EMBL:CAA99793.1}; ORFNames=C47E8.5;
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 90 family. .
- **Key Domains:** HATPase_C_sf. (IPR036890); HSP90_C. (IPR037196); Hsp90_fam. (IPR001404); Hsp90_N. (IPR020575); Ribosomal_Su5_D2-typ_SF. (IPR020568)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsp-90" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-90' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-90** (gene ID: hsp-90, UniProt: Q18688) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report on C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 (UniProt Q18688)

Key concepts and definitions
- Identity and family: daf-21 encodes the sole cytosolic Hsp90 ortholog in C. elegans, commonly referred to as HSP-90; it is a highly conserved ATP-dependent molecular chaperone of the Hsp90 family with the canonical N-terminal ATP-binding domain, middle domain, and C-terminal dimerization domain separated by a charged linker (E292 lies within a conserved region). Birnby et al. mapped and rescued daf-21 with genomic fragments and identified p673 as an E292K missense in the Hsp90 coding region; a large internal deletion (nr2081) is larval lethal, establishing essentiality (Genetics, 2000; DOI: 10.1093/genetics/155.1.85). In embryos and larvae, RNAi corroborates essential roles; germline-predominant expression is observed (Development, 2003; DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-169x.2003.00706.x) (birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 12-13, birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 14-16, inoue2003caenorhabditiselegansdaf‐21 pages 5-7).
- Biochemical function: DAF-21/Hsp90 is an ATPase chaperone that cycles through nucleotide-dependent conformations; its ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by the cochaperone Aha1 and inhibited by STI-1/HOP. It binds multiple TPR-domain cochaperones (STI-1, PPH-5) and the myosin co-chaperone UNC-45; purified DAF-21 suppresses aggregation of client proteins, demonstrating canonical chaperone activity (PLoS ONE, 2011; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 3-5, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and latest research
- Transcellular chaperone signaling (TCS, 2023): Tissue-specific knockdown of hsp-90 in the intestine induces hsp-70 in muscle through TXT genes (txt-1, ceh-58) and is HSF-1–independent, conferring heat-stress resistance and extending lifespan. This defines a cell-nonautonomous stress pathway where altered Hsp90 levels serve as a trigger (PLOS Biology, 2023; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001605) (horikawa2015cochaperonep23regulates pages 4-7).
- Neurodegeneration model (2024): In a C. elegans TDP-43 proteinopathy model of ALS, genetic or pharmacologic reduction of HSP-90 activity decreased total and phosphorylated TDP-43 and protected against neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, implicating Hsp90 in TDP-43 proteostasis and toxicity in vivo (PLOS Genetics, 2024; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011518) (garciatoscano2024decreasedhsp90activity pages 19-21, garciatoscano2024decreasedhsp90activity pages 2-4).
- Broad organismal context (2023 review): A 2023 review highlights that C. elegans uniquely has a single cytosolic Hsp90 (DAF-21), and synthesizes organismal roles of Hsp90 including inter-tissue proteostasis regulation (Biomolecules, 2023; DOI: 10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 10-11, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 10-11).

Primary function and pathway roles
- Chaperone/ATPase mechanism and co-chaperones: DAF-21 ATPase is activated by CeAha1 and modulated by STI-1; DAF-21 forms complexes with UNC-45 for myosin folding, with TPR cofactors mediating client transfer and regulation. Biochemical assays confirm suppression of aggregation of model clients and cochaperone-dependent ATPase modulation (PLoS ONE, 2011; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 3-5, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Dauer formation and chemosensation (cGMP signaling): daf-21 functions with the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase daf-11 to control chemosensory behaviors and dauer decisions. The daf-21(p673) E292K allele is dauer-constitutive (Daf-c) and shows epistasis consistent with actions at the sensory/cGMP level; 8-bromo-cGMP suppresses chemosensory defects in daf-11 and daf-21 (Genetics, 2000; DOI: 10.1093/genetics/155.1.85). Neuronal daf-21 knockdown enhances dauer formation via inhibition of daf-11 (PLoS Genet., 2015; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005023; Sci. Rep., 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 9-12, horikawa2015cochaperonep23regulates pages 4-7, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 3-5, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 1-2).
- Insulin/IGF-1 signaling and FOXO/DAF-16A: DAF-21 is required for the daf-2 longevity program through isoform-specific promotion of DAF-16A activation/nuclear translocation and gene induction; DAF-21 silencing shortens wild-type and daf-2(e1370) lifespans, with partial suppression by daf-16 loss. DAF-21 is dispensable for DAF-16D/F-dependent longevity (Sci. Rep., 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 3-5, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).
- Muscle proteostasis and sarcomere assembly: DAF-21 transiently localizes to I-band and M-line regions in body-wall muscle. Reduction of daf-21 yields myosin (MYO-3) aggregates, muscular stress response induction, ~60% myofibrillar disorganization, and motility defects; UNC-45 knockdown phenocopies and interacts genetically/biochemically with DAF-21 (PLoS ONE, 2011; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Germline function and development: DAF-21 is predominantly expressed in germline cells; loss compromises oocyte meiotic progression and embryogenesis, and p673 shows reduced brood size. RNAi causes early embryonic lethality, consistent with essentiality (Development, 2003; DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-169x.2003.00706.x) (inoue2003caenorhabditiselegansdaf‐21 pages 5-7).

Subcellular and tissue localization
- Muscle: YFP-DAF-21 localizes dynamically to sarcomeric I-band and M-line and is not stably anchored; co-chaperone UNC-45 is stably associated at A-band (PLoS ONE, 2011; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Germline: Predominant germline expression by promoter::GFP and anti-DAF-21 staining; oogenesis requirement (Development, 2003; DOI: 10.1046/j.1440-169x.2003.00706.x) (inoue2003caenorhabditiselegansdaf‐21 pages 5-7).
- Neurons and sensory cilia: Genetic evidence places DAF-21 in chemosensory neurons alongside DAF-11, regulating cGMP-dependent sensory behaviors and dauer choice (Genetics, 2000; DOI: 10.1093/genetics/155.1.85) (birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 9-12, birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 12-13).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic tools and tissue-specific perturbations: Tissue-restricted hsp-90 RNAi enables interrogation of cell-nonautonomous proteostasis (TCS), establishing gut-to-muscle signaling logic via txt-1 and ceh-58 and enabling lifespan modulation without canonical HSF-1 (PLOS Biology, 2023; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001605) (horikawa2015cochaperonep23regulates pages 4-7).
- Disease-relevant proteostasis modulation: Reduced Hsp90 activity mitigates TDP-43 proteotoxicity in vivo, pointing to therapeutic logic for modulating Hsp90-cochaperone systems in ALS-like states (PLOS Genetics, 2024; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011518) (garciatoscano2024decreasedhsp90activity pages 19-21, garciatoscano2024decreasedhsp90activity pages 2-4).

Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- The Biomolecules 2023 review integrates organismal roles of Hsp90 and emphasizes the unique single cytosolic Hsp90 in C. elegans, underscoring its suitability for dissecting cell-nonautonomous proteostasis and aging pathways (Biomolecules, 2023; DOI: 10.3390/biom13020251) (oostenhawle2023organismalrolesof pages 10-11, oostenhawle2023organismalrolesofa pages 10-11).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Essentiality: homozygous deletion (nr2081) removing aa32–287 is larval lethal; p673/Df is nearly sterile and non-Daf-c, indicating dosage/allelic complexity; p673 homozygotes are Daf-c with reduced fertility (Genetics, 2000; DOI: 10.1093/genetics/155.1.85) (birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 12-13, birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 14-16).
- Muscle phenotypes: daf-21 RNAi yields ~60% of animals with muscular disorganization and MYO-3 aggregation; motility defects and hsp-70 reporter induction are observed after daf-21 knockdown (PLoS ONE, 2011; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025485) (gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 3-5, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 13-13).
- Lifespan impact: daf-21(RNAi) from hatching significantly reduces WT and daf-2(e1370) longevity; DAF-21 specifically supports DAF-16A-mediated gene induction and nuclear translocation upon IIS reduction and heat shock (Sci. Rep., 2018; DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-30592-6) (somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 3-5, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 8-10).

Mandated identity verification (passed)

Conclusion
DAF-21/HSP-90 in C. elegans is an essential ATP-dependent chaperone that supports proteostasis and signaling in specific cellular contexts. It acts with cochaperones to fold key clients (e.g., myosin via UNC-45), integrates with sensory cGMP signaling to regulate dauer, and modulates insulin/IGF-1 longevity via DAF-16A. Recent work establishes a central role for Hsp90 levels in orchestrating cell-nonautonomous stress responses and suggests that calibrated Hsp90 reduction can be neuroprotective in TDP-43 proteinopathy models. Together, these findings define daf-21 as a nodal regulator of development, stress adaptation, and longevity in the worm and a valuable system to probe Hsp90-targeted interventions (birnby2000atransmembraneguanylyl pages 12-13, gaiser2011downregulationofthe pages 3-5, horikawa2015cochaperonep23regulates pages 4-7, somogyvari2018daf21hsp90isrequired pages 3-5, garciatoscano2024decreasedhsp90activity pages 19-21).
