description: C. elegans HSP-90 (also known as DAF-21) is the sole cytosolic 
  HSP90 homolog in nematodes. It functions as an ATP-dependent molecular 
  chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance, and regulation
  of specific client proteins, particularly those involved in signal 
  transduction (kinases, guanylyl cyclases) and steroid hormone receptor 
  signaling. HSP-90 undergoes an ATP-dependent conformational cycle and works 
  with co-chaperones including STI-1/Hop, CDC-37, AHA-1, and PPH-5. The protein 
  is essential for larval development, chemosensory behavior, dauer formation, 
  germline development, muscle maintenance, and organismal proteostasis. It is 
  predominantly expressed in germline cells under normal conditions but is 
  induced throughout the body under heat stress via the transcription factor 
  PQM-1. HSP-90 plays a key role in transcellular chaperone signaling, where its
  expression in one tissue can protect against proteotoxic stress in distant 
  tissues.

  review:
    summary: HSP-90 is a core component of protein folding machinery in C. 
      elegans. The IBA annotation is well-supported by extensive experimental 
      evidence showing HSP-90's role in chaperoning client proteins including 
      myosin, kinases, and signaling receptors (PMID:21980476, PMID:11809970, 
      PMID:24012004).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Protein folding is a core function of HSP-90 chaperones. Multiple 
      experimental studies demonstrate that DAF-21/HSP-90 is required for proper
      folding of client proteins including myosin and signaling proteins 
      (PMID:21980476, PMID:11809970).
