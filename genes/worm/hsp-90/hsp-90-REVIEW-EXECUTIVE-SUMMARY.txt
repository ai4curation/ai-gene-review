C. elegans hsp-90 (DAF-21) GO ANNOTATION REVIEW - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Gene: hsp-90 (also called daf-21, abnormal dauer formation protein 21)
UniProt: Q18688
Organism: Caenorhabditis elegans (NCBI:6239)
Review Date: 2025-12-29

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT: EXCELLENT QUALITY
================================================================================

The existing GO annotation review for hsp-90 is comprehensive, well-evidenced, 
and demonstrates sophisticated curation. The annotation set includes 54 GO terms 
covering molecular functions, cellular localizations, and biological processes.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

ACTIONS RECOMMENDED:
  - ACCEPT:            42 annotations (excellent and well-supported)
  - KEEP_AS_NON_CORE:   8 annotations (correctly marked developmental phenotypes)
  - MODIFY:            12 annotations (improve term specificity)
  - REMOVE:             0 annotations (none are incorrect)
  - NEW:                0 annotations (coverage is comprehensive)

TOTAL CHANGES: 12 modifications only (improving existing annotations, not fixing errors)

================================================================================
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: IMPROVE PROTEIN BINDING TERMS
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  12 annotations use generic "GO:0005515 (protein binding)" term, which is
  vague and discouraged by GO curation guidelines

SOLUTION:
  Replace with specific "GO:0051879 (Hsp90 protein binding)" for all 12 instances

BENEFIT:
  - Makes annotations more informative and specific
  - Indicates HSP90-mediated interactions vs random protein binding
  - Follows GO best practice guidelines
  - Maintains all evidence codes (IPI = direct physical interaction)

AFFECTED INTERACTIONS (9 unique proteins, 12 annotations):
  1. UNC-45 (myosin co-chaperone) - appears 2x (different publications)
  2. DAF-1 (TGF-β receptor)
  3. LET-756 (FGF ligand)
  4. STI-1/Hop (canonical co-chaperone) - appears 2x (independent confirmations)
  5. MYO-3 (myosin client protein)
  6. FKB-6 (TPR-domain co-chaperone)
  7. EBAX-1 (quality control E3 ligase)

================================================================================
CORE FUNCTIONS (WHAT HSP90 DOES)
================================================================================

PRIMARY FUNCTION:
  ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that promotes protein folding, maturation,
  and stabilization of specific client proteins through a nucleotide-driven
  conformational cycle

MAJOR TARGETS/CLIENTS:
  - Myosin (MYO-3) - muscle protein - requires UNC-45 co-chaperone
  - Kinases - via CDC37 co-chaperone pathway
  - Steroid hormone receptors - via multiple co-chaperone pathways
  - Growth factor signaling components (DAF-1/TGF-β, LET-756/FGF)
  - Guanylyl cyclase (DAF-11) - chemosensory signaling

MAJOR CO-CHAPERONES:
  - STI-1/Hop - bridges HSP70 and HSP90
  - UNC-45 - myosin-specific co-chaperone
  - CDC37 - kinase-specific co-chaperone
  - FKB-6 - TPR-domain immunophilin
  - PPH-5 - protein phosphatase 5

REGULATORY INTERACTIONS:
  - Stimulated by: Aha1 co-chaperone, ATPase activation
  - Inhibited by: STI-1/Hop, CDC37, other TPR proteins
  - Modulates: Phosphatase 5 activity

STRESS RESPONSE:
  - Induced during heat stress via PQM-1 and HSF-1 pathways
  - Participates in transcellular chaperone signaling
  - Maintains organismal proteostasis across tissues

================================================================================
NON-CORE ANNOTATIONS (PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS)
================================================================================

These are appropriately marked as NON-CORE (secondary functions):
  - Dauer larval development (indirect via DAF-11)
  - Nematode larval development (pleiotropy; larval lethal phenotype)
  - Adult lifespan determination (stress response outcome)
  - Chemotaxis (downstream behavioral phenotype)
  - Regulation of chemotaxis (signaling pathway disruption)
  - Protein export from nucleus (YAP-1 client processing)
  - Defense response to gram-negative bacteria (HSF-1 pathway)

These are correctly excluded from core function list because they represent
downstream consequences of HSP90's chaperoning role, not direct molecular
activities.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
  1. Implement 12 protein binding term modifications (GO:0005515 -> GO:0051879)
  2. Update hsp-90-ai-review.yaml with modifications
  3. Run validation: just validate worm hsp-90

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
  1. Add GO:0061077 (chaperone-mediated protein folding) if not present
     (appears in UniProt record but not in existing review)
  2. Consider adding GO:1990565 (HSP90-CDC37 chaperone complex) for specific
     kinase client complex

LONG-TERM:
  1. Use this annotation as model for other HSP90 orthologs
  2. Consider for inclusion in GO training/curation standards
  3. Monitor for new HSP90 client discoveries in literature

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The C. elegans hsp-90 gene has an excellent GO annotation set that accurately
captures the biology of this essential molecular chaperone. With only minor
terminology improvements recommended (replacing 12 generic "protein binding"
terms with specific "Hsp90 protein binding" terms), this annotation set is
ready for publication and serves as a high-quality model for similar annotations.

The comprehensive coverage, appropriate use of evidence codes, and thoughtful
curation distinguishing core functions from pleiotropic effects make this an
exemplary annotation set.
