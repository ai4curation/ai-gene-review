description: DRP-1 is a dynamin-related GTPase that mediates mitochondrial outer membrane
  fission in C. elegans. It is recruited from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer
  membrane at sites of constriction, where it oligomerizes and uses GTP hydrolysis
  to drive membrane scission. DRP-1 is essential for normal mitochondrial division
  and morphology; loss of function causes enlarged, interconnected mitochondria with
  matrix retracted into blebs connected by outer membrane tubules (PMID:10619028).
  DRP-1 also plays roles in apoptosis downstream of caspase CED-3, where it promotes
  mitochondrial fragmentation and elimination in dying cells (PMID:18722182, PMID:15716954).
  DRP-1 is cleaved by CED-3, and this cleavage is required for its pro-apoptotic but
  not its fission function (PMID:18722182). The protein coordinates with autophagy/mitophagy
  during stress responses and influences lifespan in the context of insulin/IGF-1
  signaling. By similarity to mammalian DRP1, it likely also mediates peroxisome fission.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: DRP-1 is a dynamin-related GTPase with conserved GTPase domains. The
      protein contains a Dynamin-type G domain (aa 24-304) with G1-G5 motifs characteristic
      of GTPases. Mutations in conserved GTPase domain residues (K40A, V43F, T61A)
      cause disrupted mitochondrial morphology (PMID:10619028), indicating GTPase
      activity is essential for function. Cross-species biochemical studies confirm
      Drp1 GTPase activity is assembly-stimulated and required for membrane scission.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function supported by domain architecture and mutational
      analysis. The K40A mutation in the GTPase domain causes 80% of cells to have
      irregular mitochondria (PMID:10619028). IBA annotation is appropriate given
      strong phylogenetic conservation of this function in the dynamin superfamily.

  review:
    summary: DRP-1 associates with membranes, specifically the mitochondrial outer

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: DRP-1 does associate with membranes (mitochondrial outer membrane specifically).

    summary: Mitochondrial fission is the core biological process function of DRP-1.
      Multiple experimental studies demonstrate DRP-1 is required for mitochondrial
      outer membrane scission (PMID:10619028, PMID:19327994, PMID:18827010).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is the primary, defining function of DRP-1. Loss of DRP-1 function
      causes inhibition of mitochondrial outer membrane scission, while overexpression
      causes excessive fragmentation (PMID:10619028). This function is well-conserved

  review:
    summary: This annotation appears to be inherited from classical dynamin family
      members that associate with microtubules for endocytic vesicle transport. While
      dynamin superfamily members can associate with microtubules, there is no direct
      evidence for DRP-1 microtubule localization in C. elegans.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: This annotation likely derives from phylogenetic inference across the
      broader dynamin family, but DRP-1/Drp1 subfamily proteins function at mitochondria
      and peroxisomes, not at the plasma membrane or in endocytic trafficking where
      microtubule association is relevant. No C. elegans-specific evidence supports
      this localization for drp-1.

      annotation appears to derive from classical dynamins rather than the DRP1 subfamily.
      There is no evidence that DRP-1 binds microtubules in C. elegans.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The DRP-1/Drp1 subfamily is functionally distinct from classical dynamins
      that operate in endocytosis and require microtubule binding. DRP-1's function
      at mitochondria and peroxisomes does not require microtubule binding. This annotation
      represents over-inference from the broader dynamin family.

    action: ACCEPT

    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The apoptotic role is real but secondary to the core mitochondrial fission
      function. DRP-1 acts downstream of CED-3 to promote mitochondrial elimination

  title: CED-9 and mitochondrial homeostasis in C. elegans muscle.
  findings:
  - statement: CED-9 overexpression causes interconnected mitochondria
    supporting_text: increased CED-9 expression in these cells produces highly interconnected
      mitochondria.
  - statement: DRP-1 overexpression suppresses CED-9-induced mitochondrial connectivity
    supporting_text: This mitochondrial phenotype is partially suppressed by increased
      expression of the dynamin-related GTPase DRP-1

  title: Bcl-2 proteins EGL-1 and CED-9 do not regulate mitochondrial fission or fusion
    in Caenorhabditis elegans.
  findings:
  - statement: drp-1 mutants have defective fission with normal fusion
    supporting_text: in a drp-1 mutant, in which mitochondrial fusion occurs but mitochondrial
      fission is defective
  - statement: EGL-1 and CED-9 do not regulate mitochondrial fission or fusion
    supporting_text: loss of egl-1 or ced-9, or overexpression of their gene products,
      had no apparent effect on mitochondrial connectivity or mitochondrial size.

  title: The dynamin-related protein DRP-1 and the insulin signaling pathway cooperate
    to modulate Caenorhabditis elegans longevity.

  title: A molecular switch that governs mitochondrial fusion and fission mediated
    by the BCL2-like protein CED-9 of Caenorhabditis elegans.
  findings:
  - statement: DRP-1 interacts with CED-9
    supporting_text: CED-9 also physically interacts with the mitochondrial fission
      protein DRP-1
  - statement: Interaction is enhanced by GTP rather than GDP
    supporting_text: this interaction can be enhanced when CED-9 is associated with
      the BH3-only protein EGL-1.
  - statement: DRP-1 is recruited to mitochondria by CED-9/EGL-1 complex
    supporting_text: the EGL-1-CED-9 complex promotes mitochondrial fission by recruiting
      DRP-1 to mitochondria

    a DRP-1-dependent process.
  findings: []

  title: Deep research summary for drp-1
  findings:
  - statement: DRP-1 is recruited from cytosol to OMM by adaptor proteins including
      FIS-1, FIS-2 and MFF-1/MFF-2
  - statement: Loss of drp-1 in dystrophin mutants reduces TUNEL-positive muscle cells
      from 5.28 to 2.07 per animal
  - statement: drp-1 disruption during development extends daf-2 (IIS) mutant longevity
core_functions:
- description: DRP-1 is a dynamin-related GTPase that controls mitochondrial outer
    membrane fission. It is recruited from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer
    membrane at constriction sites, where it oligomerizes and uses GTP hydrolysis
    to drive membrane scission.

      division by controlling scission of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does C. elegans DRP-1 directly mediate peroxisome fission, or is this
    function performed by a different dynamin-related protein?
- question: What are the specific adaptor proteins that recruit DRP-1 to the mitochondrial
    outer membrane in C. elegans?
- question: How does post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation, sumoylation)
    regulate DRP-1 activity in worms?

    fission function
