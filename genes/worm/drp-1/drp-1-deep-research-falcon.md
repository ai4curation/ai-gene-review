### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q8WQC9
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Dynamin-1-like protein drp-1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.6.5.5 {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O00429}; AltName: Full=Dynamin-related protein drp-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:10619028, ECO:0000312|WormBase:T12E12.4b};
- **Gene Information:** Name=drp-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T12E12.4b}; ORFNames=T12E12.4 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T12E12.4b};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the TRAFAC class dynamin-like GTPase
- **Key Domains:** Dynamin. (IPR022812); Dynamin_GTPase. (IPR001401); Dynamin_GTPase_CS. (IPR019762); Dynamin_N. (IPR045063); Dynamin_stalk. (IPR000375)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "drp-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'drp-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **drp-1** (gene ID: drp-1, UniProt: Q8WQC9) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan summary and verification
- Identity verification: We confirm that the target is C. elegans drp-1 (UniProt Q8WQC9), a TRAFAC class dynamin-like GTPase. In C. elegans, drp-1 encodes the sole, canonical mitochondrial fission GTPase; loss-of-function alleles such as drp-1(tm1108), deleting part of the GTPase domain, are widely used for functional studies (e.g., mitochondrial morphology, organismal phenotypes) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2). Mechanistic properties of Drp1/dynamin-related proteins, including GTPase-driven assembly and membrane scission, are conserved and established in cross-species studies (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2). The organism is confirmed as Caenorhabditis elegans in all C. elegans primary sources cited below (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 3-5, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 5-6, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms in the evidence set; thus, we proceed with C. elegans drp-1.

Key concepts and definitions
- Protein class and domains: DRP-1 is a dynamin-related, large GTPase. Like other Drp1 orthologs, it oligomerizes into spirals at mitochondrial constriction sites and hydrolyzes GTP to power membrane constriction and scission. Drp1 lacks the classical dynamin PH domain but contains a variable B-insert implicated in adaptor/lipid interactions; these features underlie membrane binding, self-assembly, and catalysis (cross-species) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07543-w, Dec 2018) (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2). In C. elegans, the tm1108 allele removes 407 bp within the GTPase domain, yielding a strong loss-of-function (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Primary function: DRP-1 catalyzes mitochondrial (and peroxisomal, by inference) fission by binding the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), oligomerizing, and coupling GTP hydrolysis to membrane constriction and scission (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07543-w, Dec 2018) (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2). In C. elegans, DRP-1 governs mitochondrial network morphology; reducing DRP-1 activity causes enlarged, interconnected mitochondria, while overexpression increases fragmentation (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 3-5).

Biochemical reaction and substrate specificity
- Reaction: DRP-1 is a P-loop NTPase that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP + Pi; assembly-stimulated GTPase activity drives conformational changes that constrict and sever membranes. In reconstitution, Drp1 alone can sever tubes up to ~250 nm radius, with scission requiring membrane binding, self-assembly, and GTP hydrolysis (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07543-w, Dec 2018) (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2). Substrate specificity is membrane contextual: DRP-1 binds mitochondrial/peroxisomal membranes via adaptors and lipid interactions; it does not require dynamin-2 for fission in reconstitution and cell systems (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2).

Cellular and subcellular localization and recruitment
- Localization: DRP-1 resides largely in the cytosol and is recruited to the OMM at fission sites. In metazoans, recruitment involves OMM adaptors such as Mff and MiD proteins; worm literature supports roles for worm FIS-1/FIS-2 and MFF-1/MFF-2 in recruiting/organizing DRP-1 at constriction sites (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019) (traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2). Cross-species mechanistic studies confirm Drp1’s assembly at membrane contact sites and scission sufficiency (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2).

Pathways and roles in apoptosis, mitophagy, stress, development, and lifespan
- Apoptosis: C. elegans DRP-1 promotes apoptosis-linked mitochondrial fragmentation and can act downstream of the caspase CED-3. In a dystrophin-deficient model, DRP-1 is cleaved by CED-3, and this cleavage is required for dystrophin- and age-dependent muscle degeneration; loss of drp-1 reduces TUNEL-positive muscle cells from 5.28 ± 0.26 to ~2.07 ± 0.19 per animal (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018) (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 5-6, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11). Earlier embryonic work showed drp-1 overexpression triggers mitochondrial fragmentation independent of caspase activation but requires egl-1, ced-4, and ced-3 to induce cell death; ced-9 gain-of-function blocks DRP-1-induced fragmentation, positioning CED-9 upstream in controlling mitochondrial morphology during cell death signaling (https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.4281, 2005) (jagasia2005mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 110-116).
- Mitophagy and stress responses: Toxicant stress (CoCl2) upregulates drp-1 and induces DRP-1–dependent mitochondrial fragmentation; genetic or pharmacologic DRP-1 inhibition reduces ROS, ameliorates growth defects, and improves survival, linking DRP-1 activity to oxidative stress and toxicity outcomes (https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa105, Jun 2020) (zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14). In insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) mutant daf-2, developmental drp-1 disruption increases mitophagy and stress resistance and contributes to lifespan extension (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025) (traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3).
- Development, behavior and lifespan: Systematic analysis shows loss of fission or fusion regulators yields progressive, age-dependent defects in movement and neuromuscular function; fusion loss causes more severe defects, whereas fission becomes particularly important later in life to mitigate aging-related stress. Disruption of either process reduces median lifespan without altering maximal lifespan (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2). In an IIS-long-lived background, drp-1 disruption during development further extends longevity and enhances OXPHOS and ATP levels while increasing mitochondrial/peroxisomal connectedness; mitophagy contributes to the lifespan benefit (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025) (traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3).

Interacting partners and upstream regulation in C. elegans
- Apoptotic network: DRP-1 intersects the canonical apoptosis pathway. Evidence points to DRP-1 cleavage by CED-3, with roles for CED-9 (BCL2-like), and downstream nucleases/apoptosis factors such as CPS-6 (EndoG), WAH-1 (AIF), NUC-1, CRN-2/6 and engulfment genes (ced-1, psr-1) shaping cell death and muscle degeneration phenotypes (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018; https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.4281, 2005) (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11, jagasia2005mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 110-116). Quantitatively, RNAi against apoptosis/engulfment factors reduces abnormal cell counts and modifies mitochondrial morphology metrics in dystrophin mutants (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11).
- Mitochondrial fission apparatus: Worm DRP-1 operates with OMM adaptors. Cross-species work identifies Mff and MiD proteins as direct recruiters; worm studies implicate FIS-1/FIS-2 and MFF-1/MFF-2 as functional analogs contributing to DRP-1 recruitment (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07543-w, Dec 2018; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025) (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2, traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3).

Recent developments and latest research
- While the most detailed mechanistic biochemistry remains from 2018–2020 cross-species work, organismal C. elegans studies through 2019–2020 and a 2025 study continue to resolve the interplay between DRP-1-mediated fission, stress responses, mitophagy, and lifespan in defined genetic backgrounds (IIS), including quantitative links to OXPHOS and ATP levels, and the requirement for developmental timing (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019; https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa105, Jun 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14, traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3). We did not identify C. elegans-specific drp-1 primary literature explicitly dated 2023–2024 in the available evidence; this likely reflects limited worm-specific publications in those years, though adjacent fields reported methodological and review advances.

Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Mitochondrial morphology in dystrophin mutants: Circularity index increases from ~0.52 ± 0.009 (WT) to ~0.75 ± 0.014; drp-1 loss reduces circularity in the dystrophic background to ~0.65 ± 0.014, indicating partial rescue of fragmentation (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018) (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 5-6).
- Apoptosis readouts: TUNEL-positive muscle cells decrease from 5.28 ± 0.26 (dys-1;hlh-1) to ~2.07 ± 0.19 with drp-1 deletion; drp-1 overexpression in embryos increases cell corpses to an average of 55.4 (vs ~7.3 WT), showing potent pro-death consequences when DRP-1 is hyperactive (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018; https://doi.org/10.5282/edoc.4281, 2005) (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 5-6, jagasia2005mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 110-116).
- Lifespan and healthspan: Loss of fission or fusion regulators reduces median lifespan without changing maximal lifespan; drp-1 disruption specifically during development extends longevity in daf-2 IIS mutants and increases stress resistance and mitophagy; precise magnitude depends on protocol but the effect is described as drastic in extending the already long daf-2 lifespan (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-024-01276-z, Jul 2025) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3).
- Stress toxicity: Under CoCl2 exposure, drp-1 upregulation and DRP-1–dependent fragmentation mediate increased ROS and decreased survival; inhibition of drp-1 suppresses ROS and rescues growth and survival defects (https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa105, Jun 2020) (zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- Experimental tools: C. elegans drp-1(tm1108) null and dominant-negative mutants, mitochondrial matrix GFP reporters (e.g., ccIs4251), dystrophin-deficient models (dys-1;hlh-1), and toxicology paradigms (CoCl2) enable quantitative dissection of DRP-1 function in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25727-8, May 2018; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5, Mar 2019; https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa105, Jun 2020) (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 3-5, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14).
- Cross-species biochemical inference: Reconstitution of Drp1 membrane fission provides mechanistic constraints—Drp1 alone can constrict and sever membranes in a GTP-dependent manner, and Dnm2 is dispensable—informing interpretation of worm phenotypes and adaptor dependence (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07543-w, Dec 2018) (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and analysis
- The integrated view from organismal and biochemical studies is that DRP-1’s principal role is to execute mitochondrial fission, with context-dependent roles in apoptosis and stress adaptation. In C. elegans, DRP-1’s apoptotic function appears to be regulated by caspase CED-3 cleavage and constrained by CED-9, while its homeostatic role coordinates with mitophagy to rebuild or cull mitochondria under stress. The developmental timing of drp-1 disruption is critical for lifespan effects in IIS mutants, highlighting a systems-level coupling between mitochondrial dynamics, cellular quality control, and organismal aging (scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3, zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14).

Conclusion
C. elegans drp-1 (Q8WQC9) encodes the conserved dynamin-like GTPase governing mitochondrial fission. DRP-1 is recruited from the cytosol to the OMM by adaptors, oligomerizes at constriction sites, and uses assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis to constrict and sever mitochondrial (and peroxisomal) membranes. In worms, DRP-1 shapes mitochondrial networks across tissues, contributes to apoptosis downstream of CED-3, coordinates with autophagy/mitophagy during stress, and, depending on developmental context and genetic background (IIS), modulates lifespan. Quantitative evidence links DRP-1 to mitochondrial fragmentation metrics, apoptosis indices, stress resistance, and lifespan distributions. Together, cross-species biochemical mechanisms and worm in vivo genetics provide a coherent functional annotation for drp-1 in localization, mechanism, and pathway integration (kamerkar2018dynaminrelatedprotein1 pages 1-2, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 10-11, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 5-6, zheng2020drp1dependentmitochondrial pages 14-14, traa2025developmentaldisruptionof pages 1-3, scholtes2018drp1mediatedapoptosisinduces pages 3-5, jagasia2005mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 110-116).
