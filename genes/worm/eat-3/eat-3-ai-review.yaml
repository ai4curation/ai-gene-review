description: EAT-3 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian OPA1 and yeast Mgm1, 
  a dynamin-family large GTPase required for mitochondrial inner membrane fusion
  and cristae organization. The protein contains a mitochondrial targeting 
  sequence, a conserved GTPase domain, a middle domain, and a GED/assembly 
  domain characteristic of dynamin family members. EAT-3 is localized to the 
  mitochondrial inner membrane and intermembrane space where it mediates inner 
  membrane fusion. Loss of eat-3 function causes mitochondrial fragmentation 
  with characteristic inner membrane septae dividing the matrix, a phenotype 
  specifically indicative of defective inner membrane fusion. eat-3 mutants show
  reduced cristae content, slow growth, small body size, reduced brood size, and
  hypersensitivity to oxidative stress (paraquat), with compensatory induction 
  of mitochondrial SOD-2. The gene was originally identified in feeding behavior
  screens (Eating defective), likely reflecting the metabolic consequences of 
  mitochondrial dysfunction affecting pharyngeal muscle function.

    review:
      summary: EAT-3 is a dynamin-like GTPase with a conserved GTPase domain 
        containing G1-G4 motifs. The primary eat-3(ad426) mutation affects a 
        residue near the G2 motif, and intragenic suppressors cluster around 
        GTPase domain residues (PMID:18454199).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: GTPase activity is the core enzymatic function of EAT-3. The 
        protein contains canonical dynamin GTPase, middle, and GED domains. 
        Mutations in the GTPase domain cause loss of function, and second-site 
        suppressors restore GTPase function (PMID:18454199).

    review:
      summary: eat-3 mutants are hypersensitive to paraquat and show induction 
        of SOD-2. This is a stress response consequence of mitochondrial 
        dysfunction.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: eat-3 mutants show hypersensitivity to paraquat (superoxide) and 
        compensatory induction of SOD-2, but this is a consequence of 
        mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased ROS production, not a 
        primary function in oxidative stress response.

      summary: EAT-3 is essential for proper mitochondrial organization,

      action: ACCEPT
      reason: EAT-3 is required for proper mitochondrial morphology and 
        organization. Loss of EAT-3 leads to fragmented mitochondria with 
        disorganized inner membranes and reduced cristae. This is a direct

      action: NEW
      reason: The existing GO:0008053 (mitochondrial fusion) annotation is 
        correct but GO:1990627 (mitochondrial inner membrane fusion) is more 
        specific and accurately describes the precise function of EAT-3. The

        defects.
