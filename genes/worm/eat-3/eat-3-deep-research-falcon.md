Research report: Functional annotation of C. elegans eat-3 (UniProt Q18965)

Identity verification and gene/protein definition
- Gene/protein identity: eat-3 (WormBase locus D2013.5) in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the ortholog of mammalian OPA1 and yeast Mgm1, a dynamin-family large GTPase required for mitochondrial inner membrane (IMM) fusion and cristae organization. The EAT-3 protein contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence and the canonical dynamin GTPase, middle, and GED/assembly domains, consistent with a membrane-remodeling GTPase mechanism (UniProt Q18965 context supported by Kanazawa et al., 2008). Domain location and orthology match the UniProt note on Dynamin_GTPase and OPA1_C domains (IPR001401; IPR045817) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 2-3, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2).
- Organism: Caenorhabditis elegans (confirmed in PLoS Genetics foundational study) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2).

Key concepts and current understanding
- Molecular function: EAT-3/OPA1 is a dynamin-like GTPase that catalyzes IMM fusion and remodels cristae. In C. elegans, eat-3 loss causes mitochondrial fragmentation with inner membrane septation, indicating a specific defect in IMM fusion. Mechanistically, conserved GTP-binding motifs in EAT-3 underpin GTPase-driven membrane remodeling; intragenic suppressors cluster near the GTPase G2 loop, supporting functional importance of nucleotide-coupled conformational changes (Kanazawa et al., 2008). Recent human OPA1 structural work elucidates how OPA1 assemblies remodel membranes, reinforcing the conserved mechanistic paradigm relevant to EAT-3 (von der Malsburg et al., 2023 Nature) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4, malsburg2023structuralmechanismof pages 1-4).
- Subcellular localization: EAT-3 is a mitochondrial protein with an N-terminal leader that targets to the intermembrane space/IMM, consistent with its role in IMM fusion/cristae organization (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2).
- Biological processes and pathways: EAT-3 functions in mitochondrial dynamics—coordinated with FZO-1/mitofusin (outer membrane fusion) and DRP-1 (fission)—to maintain tubular networks and cristae architecture that support oxidative phosphorylation and mtDNA maintenance. Disruption of eat-3 impacts organismal physiology (growth, brood size, stress resistance) and oxidative metabolism (Kanazawa et al., 2008; Byrne et al., 2019). Reviews emphasize OPA1’s pleiotropic roles in cristae shaping, bioenergetics, and stress signaling (Caron & Bertolin, 2024 J Cell Sci; Wai, 2024 Trends Endocrinol Metab) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 9-10, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, caron2024cristaeshapingand pages 1-4, wai2024ismitochondrialmorphology pages 1-4).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- Structural mechanism and in situ architecture: High-resolution structural and in situ cell studies reveal how the balance of OPA1 forms controls cristae architecture. Cryo-ET in mammalian cells shows increased long-form OPA1 (l-OPA1) promotes crista stacking and elongated mitochondria, whereas elevated short-form OPA1 (s-OPA1) correlates with irregular crista packing and round mitochondria; l/s imbalance compromises respiration, linking OPA1 state to function (Fry et al., 2024 EMBO J; published online Jan 15, 2024; DOI: 10.1038/s44318-024-00027-2) (fry2024insituarchitecture pages 1-2). Complementary structural work delineates human OPA1 membrane-remodeling assemblies (von der Malsburg et al., 2023 Nature; Aug 2023; DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06441-6) (malsburg2023structuralmechanismof pages 1-4).
- Proteolytic regulation and stress signaling: Reviews synthesize evidence that OMA1/YME1L/Parl-mediated processing of OPA1 regulates fusion competence. Acute loss of mitochondrial membrane potential activates OMA1, cleaving fusion-active l-OPA1 to s-OPA1, reducing fusion and favoring DRP1-mediated fragmentation; this positions OMA1 upstream of apoptosis, autophagy, and integrated stress response cascades (Gilkerson et al., 2024 Int J Mol Sci; Apr 22, 2024; DOI: 10.3390/ijms25084566). These regulatory insights generalize to OPA1 orthologs, informing interpretation of EAT-3 function under stress (gilkerson2024oma1mediatedmitochondrialdynamics pages 1-2).
- Nucleoid distribution and mtDNA: OPA1 loss decreases mtDNA and nucleoid abundance, and both OPA1 loss and disease-causing mutants perturb nucleoid distribution relative to cristae; OPA1 isoform-specific rescue partially restores defects (Macuada et al., 2024 Cell Death & Disease; Nov 2024; DOI: 10.1038/s41419-024-07165-9). These findings mechanistically connect cristae remodeling by OPA1-family GTPases to genome organization, supporting observations that eat-3 affects oxidative capacity and mitochondrial integrity (macuada2024opa1anddiseasecausing pages 1-2).
- Worm implementations for resilience and aging: In C. elegans, ubiquitous overexpression of eat-3 (and of fzo-1/drp-1) unexpectedly increases mitochondrial fragmentation yet extends lifespan and enhances stress resistance, indicating that boosting dynamics machinery can induce pro-resilience programs independent of maintaining youthful morphology (Traa et al., 2024 Aging Cell; Jul 2024; DOI: 10.1111/acel.14262) (traa2024overexpressionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).

Primary function, substrates, and specificity
- Enzymatic activity: EAT-3 is a large dynamin-like GTPase (EC 3.6.5.5) that hydrolyzes GTP to drive IMM fusion and cristae membrane remodeling. Substrate: GTP; functional substrate context: juxtaposed inner mitochondrial membranes enriched in cardiolipin (inferred from OPA1 literature) and crista junction regions; specificity derives from IMM localization and proteolytic state (l- vs s-EAT-3/OPA1) (Kanazawa et al., 2008; von der Malsburg et al., 2023; Fry et al., 2024) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4, malsburg2023structuralmechanismof pages 1-4, fry2024insituarchitecture pages 1-2).

Cellular localization and site of action
- EAT-3 localizes to the IMM/IMS and acts at inner boundary membranes and crista junctions to mediate IMM fusion and maintain cristae ultrastructure, consistent with the observed inner-septation phenotype upon loss (Kanazawa et al., 2008; Fry et al., 2024) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2, fry2024insituarchitecture pages 1-2).

Pathways and mechanistic integration
- Mitochondrial dynamics: EAT-3 acts in concert with FZO-1 (outer membrane fusion) and is balanced against DRP-1-driven fission. Genetic interactions in worms show that reducing fission (drp-1 loss) can suppress some eat-3 oxidative-stress phenotypes, illustrating network-level compensation (Kanazawa et al., 2008; Byrne et al., 2019) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 8-9, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).
- Stress signaling and proteolysis: OMA1 activation under Δψm loss cleaves l-OPA1 to s-OPA1, limiting IMM fusion and promoting fragmentation, coupling EAT-3/OPA1 to apoptosis/autophagy/ISR readiness. This regulation explains stress-dependent morphology transitions seen across models (Gilkerson et al., 2024) (gilkerson2024oma1mediatedmitochondrialdynamics pages 1-2).
- Genome maintenance: OPA1-family function maintains cristae organization that positions nucleoids; loss or mutant OPA1 disrupts nucleoid arrays and reduces mtDNA, linking membrane remodeling to genetic stability. This underpins observations that eat-3 mutants have respiration-linked defects (Macuada et al., 2024) (macuada2024opa1anddiseasecausing pages 1-2).

Organismal phenotypes and quantitative data in C. elegans
- Mitochondrial ultrastructure: In eat-3 mutants, internal IMM septa are frequent (~63% of mitochondria) versus ~0.5% in wild type. Total cristae length per mitochondrion is reduced to 1.21 mm (n=20, SD=0.78) from 7.34 mm in WT (n=16, SD=3.80); inner boundary membrane length is reduced to 2.62 mm (n=20, SD=0.91) from 5.38 mm in WT (n=16, SD=2.64), indicating ~66–70% loss of cristae content (Kanazawa et al., 2008; PLoS Genet; Feb 2008; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000022) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 4-5).
- Oxidative stress and compensation: eat-3(ad426) animals are hypersensitive to paraquat; Fe/Mn-SOD is induced >2-fold, largely via mitochondrial SOD-2. sod-2 RNAi or sod-2(gk257) exacerbates eat-3 phenotypes, while reducing fission (drp-1 RNAi or nonsense alleles) suppresses SOD induction and paraquat sensitivity (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 8-9, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 9-10).
- Growth, fertility, and rescue: eat-3 mutants are small, slow-growing, and have reduced brood size. Transgenic rescue increases progeny reaching L4 from mean 10 (SD=8, n=28) to 30 (SD=22, n=26), confirming causality (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4).
- Behavior and lifespan context: Disruption of fusion (EAT-3/FZO-1) versus fission (DRP-1) produces distinct, progressive deficits in locomotion and tissue function; fusion disruption tends to be more severe. Median lifespan is reduced, while maximum lifespan remains unchanged in dynamics mutants, implicating mitochondrial dynamics in lifespan variance (Byrne et al., 2019; CMLS; Mar 2019; DOI: 10.1007/s00018-019-03024-5) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations in C. elegans research
- Genetic models: eat-3 null/strong loss-of-function (tm1107, ad426) and transgenic rescue lines are standard tools to dissect IMM fusion, cristae formation, and oxidative stress responses in vivo. Quantitative EM, paraquat survival, SOD induction, and brood/fitness assays are routinely used readouts (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 4-5, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 8-9, kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4).
- Aging and resilience: Overexpression of eat-3 and fzo-1 or drp-1 is used to probe how augmenting dynamics machinery modulates stress resistance and lifespan; despite increased fragmentation, both fission and fusion gene overexpression extend lifespan and increase stress resistance, indicating a mitohormetic mechanism and network-level remodeling of stress pathways (Traa et al., 2024) (traa2024overexpressionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative analyses
- Reviews synthesize that OPA1’s role in crista maintenance is mechanistically distinct from IMM fusion per se, with proteolytic regulation by OMA1 central to stress-adaptive remodeling (Gilkerson et al., 2024; review) (gilkerson2024oma1mediatedmitochondrialdynamics pages 1-2). Broader expert analyses emphasize cristae as dynamic compartments whose protein and lipid composition—including OPA1—govern bioenergetic capacity and signaling, reframing morphology-function relationships (Caron & Bertolin, 2024; Wai, 2024) (caron2024cristaeshapingand pages 1-4, wai2024ismitochondrialmorphology pages 1-4).

Relevant statistics and data (selected)
- Cristae metrics in eat-3 vs WT: total cristae length 1.21 mm vs 7.34 mm; inner boundary membrane 2.62 mm vs 5.38 mm (per mitochondrion; electron tomography quantitation). IMM septation frequency ~63% vs ~0.5% WT (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 4-5).
- Stress markers: Fe/Mn-SOD induction >2-fold in eat-3(ad426); paraquat hypersensitivity assays show strong sensitivity of eat-3 compared to WT and to fzo-1 mutants (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 8-9).
- Genetic rescue: Progeny reaching L4 increased from mean 10 to 30 upon eat-3 cDNA rescue (Kanazawa et al., 2008) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 3-4).
- Dynamics and lifespan: Disruption of fusion/fission yields progressive motor/tissue deficits; reduced median but unchanged maximal lifespan indicates altered longevity distribution (Byrne et al., 2019) (byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2).

Verification against potential symbol ambiguity
- The literature consistently identifies eat-3 in C. elegans (D2013.5) as the OPA1 ortholog encoding a mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase with canonical dynamin domains, matching the UniProt Q18965 entry. No conflicting gene symbol usage was identified in other organisms within the evidence base consulted (Kanazawa et al., 2008; Byrne et al., 2019; reviews 2024) (kanazawa2008thec.elegans pages 1-2, byrne2019disruptionofmitochondrial pages 1-2, caron2024cristaeshapingand pages 1-4, wai2024ismitochondrialmorphology pages 1-4).
