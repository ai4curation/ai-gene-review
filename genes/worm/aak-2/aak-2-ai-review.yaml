description: AAK-2 is the alpha catalytic subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) complex in C. elegans, functioning as a critical energy sensor that couples
  cellular energy status to lifespan and metabolic regulation. It is activated by
  increased AMP:ATP ratio and phosphorylation at Thr-243 by the LKB1 homolog PAR-4.
  AAK-2 plays central roles in lifespan extension under conditions of reduced insulin
  signaling or energy stress, response to oxidative stress, regulation of dauer development,
  germline stem cell quiescence, axon regeneration, maintenance of glycogen stores
  for osmotic stress resistance, and regulation of serotonergic signaling pathways
  that control lipid metabolism. In neurons, AAK-2 regulates FLP-7 neuropeptide secretion
  via CRTC-1 phosphorylation, linking nutrient sensing to peripheral fat metabolism.
  It is expressed in the pharynx, ventral cord, neurons, body wall muscles, vulva,
  excretory canal, and weakly in the intestine.

    label: protein serine/threonine kinase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: AAK-2 is the catalytic alpha subunit of AMPK, a serine/threonine kinase
      that phosphorylates substrates on serine and threonine residues. The kinase
      domain is well-characterized and the protein has demonstrated kinase activity
      (PMID:15574588, PMID:29414769).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function annotation. AAK-2 contains a protein
      kinase domain (InterPro IPR000719) and demonstrates serine/threonine kinase
      activity. The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference from
      characterized AMPK alpha subunits.

  review:
    summary: AMPK alpha subunits are known to translocate to the nucleus in other
      systems. However, direct experimental evidence for nuclear localization of AAK-2
      in C. elegans was not provided in the available literature.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is based on conserved localization patterns across
      AMPK alpha orthologs. AMPK is known to phosphorylate nuclear substrates. While
      the primary literature (PMID:18408008) shows cytoplasmic, axonal, and neuronal
      cell body localization, nuclear localization is consistent with AMPK function
      in regulating transcription factors.

    label: positive regulation of autophagy
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: AMPK is a well-established positive regulator of autophagy across eukaryotes,
      functioning by phosphorylating ULK1 and inhibiting mTORC1. This function is
      conserved based on phylogenetic inference from characterized AMPK orthologs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This represents a conserved core function of AMPK. The IBA annotation
      is supported by extensive literature on AMPK-autophagy connections in other
      systems and by C. elegans studies showing AAK-2's role in stress resistance
      and metabolic homeostasis.

      This is supported by Reactome pathway R-CEL-380972 (Energy dependent regulation

    label: protein localization to lipid droplet
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: AMPK has been implicated in lipid metabolism regulation in C. elegans
      (PMID:28128367). While the specific function of localizing proteins to lipid
      droplets is conserved in mammalian AMPK, direct evidence for this specific annotation
      in AAK-2 is limited.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While AAK-2/AMPK clearly regulates lipid metabolism in C. elegans, the
      specific function of protein localization to lipid droplets is inferred from
      mammalian orthologs. This should be retained but considered as a secondary/inferred
      function rather than a demonstrated core function.

      UniProt indicates it forms a complex with regulatory subunits and interacts

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core annotation. AAK-2 functions as part of the AMPK heterotrimeric
      complex with beta (aakb-1, aakb-2) and gamma subunits. The complex is activated
      by nucleotides (AMP/ADP).

    reason: This is a core conserved function. AMPK activation by energy stress (reflected

  review:
    summary: This annotation appears contradictory to GO:0050709. However, the study
      shows that 5-HT signaling de-represses CRTC-1 (by inhibiting AAK-2), which then
      stimulates FLP-7 secretion. The loss of AAK-2 activity leads to increased secretion.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: This annotation is misleading. AAK-2 is a negative regulator of protein
      secretion (GO:0050709). The 'positive regulation' effect observed is actually
      the consequence of AAK-2 loss or inhibition leading to de-repression of secretion.
      The annotation GO:0050709 (negative regulation of protein secretion) correctly
      captures AAK-2's function. This annotation confuses the phenotype of loss-of-function
      with the gene's actual function.

    supporting_text: loss of aak-2, the C. elegans orthologue of the AMP kinase alpha
      subunit (AMPK) led to a reduction in body fat stores
  - statement: AMPK phosphorylates CRTC-1 to keep it inactive, restraining FLP-7 secretion

    supporting_text: loss of aak-2, the C. elegans orthologue of the AMP kinase alpha
      subunit (AMPK) led to a reduction in body fat stores
  - statement: Links nutrient sensing to peripheral fat metabolism
    supporting_text: FLP-7 is secreted as a neuroendocrine peptide in proportion to
      fluctuations in neural serotonin circuit functions, and its release is regulated
      from secretory neurons via the nutrient sensor AMPK
  - statement: aak-2 mutants have approximately 60% reduction in body fat
    supporting_text: loss of aak-2, the C. elegans orthologue of the AMP kinase alpha
      subunit (AMPK) led to a reduction in body fat stores, to approximately the same
      extent as 5-HT treatment
