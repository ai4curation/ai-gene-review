## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q95ZQ4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=5'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-2; Short=AMPK subunit alpha-2; EC=2.7.11.1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=aak-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T01C8.1b}; ORFNames=T01C8.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T01C8.1b};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CAMK Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** AMPK_C. (IPR032270); KA1/Ssp2_C. (IPR028375); Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); PRKAA1/2_AID. (IPR049020); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "aak-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'aak-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **aak-2** (gene ID: aak-2, UniProt: Q95ZQ4) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
We verified identity and context before research. aak-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the catalytic alpha-2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), consistent with UniProt Q95ZQ4 (Ser/Thr kinase; EC 2.7.11.1). Literature confirms AAK-2 is one of two C. elegans AMPK α subunits (with aak-1), with conserved activation and functions in energy stress responses, diapause, and lifespan regulation (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836; https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521). No conflicting gene symbol usage was found in other organisms for this context (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56).

Comprehensive research report on aak-2 (UniProt Q95ZQ4)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and domains: aak-2 encodes the catalytic α subunit of AMPK in C. elegans. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of α (catalytic), β, and γ regulatory subunits; in C. elegans there are two α genes (aak-1, aak-2) and multiple γ isoforms (aakg-1 to aakg-5), enabling AMP-sensitive and AMP-insensitive heterotrimers (kinase domain and regulation are conserved with mammals) (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56).
- Catalytic function: AAK-2 is a serine/threonine kinase that transfers the γ-phosphate of ATP to target proteins at Ser/Thr residues. Activation requires phosphorylation at the conserved activation-loop threonine (Thr243 in C. elegans; equivalent to Thr172 in mammals) and is enhanced by AMP/ADP allosteric binding to the γ subunit, conferring protection from dephosphorylation and increased catalytic activity (up to ~100-fold upon phosphorylation by the upstream kinase PAR-4/LKB1) (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56).
- Upstream activation: The main upstream kinase is PAR-4 (the worm ortholog of LKB1), which phosphorylates AAK-2 at Thr243; AMP/ADP sensing via γ subunits further modulates activity. C. elegans harbors γ isoforms lacking AMP-binding residues (e.g., AAKG-4/5), suggesting distinct AMP-insensitivity in some complexes, while AAKG-1/2/3 retain AMP sensitivity (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56).

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 prioritized)
- Neuronal AAK-2a isoform couples glucose-restriction to longevity: A 2023 Nature Communications study identified AAK-2a, a neuronal isoform of AMPK α2, as necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension under glucose-restricted (GR) diets generated by glucose-depleted E. coli. AAK-2a acts in head neurons and excretory cells to signal non-cell autonomously via neuropeptides; downstream, PAQR-2 (AdipoR), NHR-49 (PPARα), and Δ9 desaturases remodel peripheral membrane lipids to increase membrane fluidity. GR enhanced stress resistance and reduced Aβ42 proteotoxicity without significantly reducing fecundity. aak-2(ok524) mutants abrogate GR-longevity, establishing causality (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z; accepted 10 Jan 2023) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z) (jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6).
- Energy-stress and lifespan programs via AMPK/IIS/TOR: Recent syntheses (2021) emphasize conserved AMPK regulation by PAR-4/LKB1 and AMP/ADP in C. elegans, integration with insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), and mTOR suppression to promote autophagy and stress resistance, with quantitative demonstrations that aak-2 is required for certain stress-induced longevity paradigms (e.g., high-temperature pulses) (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56). Although outside 2023–2024, these remain current mechanistic anchors.
- Chromatin and nuclear pore connections to AMPK are emerging in the field; within our vetted sources here, neuronal autophagy and proteostasis connections remain the most directly evidenced in C. elegans, with AMPK dosage affecting neuronal autophagy in ageing (Cells 2021) (https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030694) (ahmadi2016ampkdependentregulationof pages 53-58).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Dietary interventions and neuronal AMPK: GR diets implemented via engineered E. coli with depleted intracellular glucose provide a tractable, real-world organismal intervention to extend lifespan in C. elegans through neuronal AAK-2a, while sparing fecundity. This model is being used to study neuroendocrine communication, membrane biophysics, and stress resistance in vivo (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z) (jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6).
- Stress preconditioning paradigms: Transient high-temperature pulses extend lifespan in wild type but not aak-2 mutants, pointing to practical use of AMPK-dependent hormetic paradigms to probe energy-stress resilience in vivo (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64).
- Genetic circuitry for germline protection: Tissue-specific rescue and RNAi screens in diapause highlight the AMPK–TORC1 axis as a targetable module to maintain germline quiescence and fertility after stress, with implications for quiescence biology and stem cell protection (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006276) (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 2-3).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Mechanistic integration: AAK-2 functions as a central energy sensor, integrating AMP/ADP allostery and PAR-4/LKB1 phosphorylation to reprogram metabolism, antagonize TORC1, and induce autophagy. Expanded γ-subunit diversity in C. elegans provides nuanced control over AMP sensitivity and signaling specificity, with AMP-sensitive γ1/2/3 conferring classic energy-stress responses and γ4/5 enabling IIS-dependent and context-specific outputs (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 175-178).
- Neuronal control of systemic metabolism: Multiple sources converge on neuronal AAK-2 as a driver of systemic metabolic adaptation—regulating dense-core vesicle secretion of peptide hormones (e.g., insulin-like signals) and peripheral lipolysis (atgl-1), and, in 2023 research, instructing peripheral membrane lipid desaturation via neuropeptide/AdipoR/PPAR-like pathways to extend lifespan. This positions neuronal AAK-2 at the apex of organismal energy-state communication (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z) (bouagnon2019neuralregulatorymechanisms pages 29-33, jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6).
- Quiescence and fertility preservation: Foundational work demonstrates that AMPK (aak-2) enforces germline mitotic quiescence during L1 arrest and dauer, in part via TORC1 suppression; failure leads to hyperplasia and sterility post-stress. This consolidates AAK-2’s role in coupling energy status to stem-cell cycle control (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836) (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 2-3).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Glucose restriction (GR) via glucose-depleted E. coli: GR diets extended lifespan and improved health metrics; reported P-values indicate robust effects on delaying age-associated paralysis (P < 1e-10) and increasing heat-stress resistance at day 5 (P < 1e-10) with no significant reduction in fecundity (P ≈ 0.05–0.065). aak-2(ok524) mutants abolished GR-induced longevity. AAK-2a expression is neuronal/excretory, while AAK-2c shows multi-tissue expression; neuronal AAK-2a suffices for GR-longevity via peripheral membrane fluidity changes (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z) (jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6).
- Stress preconditioning: Short-term high-temperature pulse (35°C for 2 h) increased lifespan by ~30% in wild type, but not in aak-2 mutants, indicating an AMPK-dependent benefit (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64).
- Diapause/germline phenotypes: aak-1;aak-2 double mutants show markedly reduced L1 diapause survival, failure of germline mitotic quiescence, and sterility upon refeeding. aak-2 plays tissue-specific roles in intestine and neurons for L1 survival; AMPK and daf-18/PTEN maintain quiescence by suppressing TORC1 (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836) (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 2-3, fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2).

Functional roles, pathways, and localization
- Core reaction and regulation: AAK-2 phosphorylates serine/threonine motifs on downstream targets. Activation requires PAR-4/LKB1 phosphorylation at Thr243; AMP/ADP binding to γ subunits modulates activation and dephosphorylation resistance; γ isoform composition dictates AMP sensitivity (https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521) (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56).
- Pathways: AAK-2 enforces energy-stress programs, antagonizes TORC1 to promote quiescence and autophagy, and interfaces with IIS/DAF-16 programs affecting lifespan and stress responses (e.g., gamma isoform regulation by DAF-16 in IIS mutants). It also engages lipid metabolism, influencing ATGL-1 lipase outputs and, under GR, instructing membrane desaturation pathways via neuronal signals (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836; https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-35952-z) (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64, jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2).
- Localization and tissue-specific roles: AAK-2 functions in intestine and neurons to support L1 survival and germline quiescence; in dauer, hypodermal aak-2 strongly impacts longevity; broadly, AMPK/AAK-2 is expressed in neurons, intestine, muscle, reproductive tissues, and excretory canal. The 2023 report refines isoform-specific expression: AAK-2a in neurons/excretory cells; AAK-2c in intestine, pharynx, muscle, hypodermis. Neuronal AAK-2 controls systemic metabolism via neuropeptides and insulin-like signals, modulating peripheral lipolysis and membrane properties (https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.2012836; https://doi.org/10.22024/unikent/01.02.87521; Jeong 2023) (fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, ahmadi2016ampkdependentregulationof pages 53-58, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6, bouagnon2019neuralregulatorymechanisms pages 29-33).

*Table: Concise summary table of key primary and review sources for C. elegans aak-2 (UniProt Q95ZQ4), listing year, focus, tissue localization, main findings, mechanistic placement, and DOIs/URLs with source citations to the evidence IDs. Useful for rapid reference to the experimental evidence underlying AAK-2 function and recent 2023 developments (neuronal AAK-2a).*

Conclusions
C. elegans aak-2 (UniProt Q95ZQ4) encodes the catalytic α2 subunit of AMPK, a central energy sensor. Its activation by PAR-4/LKB1 at Thr243 with AMP/ADP allostery is conserved, and it orchestrates organismal responses to nutrient and energetic stress by suppressing TORC1, promoting autophagy, and reprogramming lipid metabolism. Foundational studies establish its requirement for germline quiescence and survival during L1 arrest/dauer, with tissue-specific action in intestine, neurons, and hypodermis. Recent 2023 work defines a neuronal AAK-2a isoform that transduces glucose-restriction into systemic longevity via neuropeptide signaling to membrane lipid desaturation pathways, increasing membrane fluidity while preserving fecundity. Together, these findings position AAK-2 as a master integrator of cellular energy status with organismal longevity, stress resilience, and reproductive health in C. elegans (scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 53-56, fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 1-2, fukuyama2012c.elegansampks pages 2-3, scanlon2021investigatingthecontribution pages 61-64, jeong2023anewampk pages 1-2, jeong2023anewampk pages 6-6, ahmadi2016ampkdependentregulationof pages 53-58, bouagnon2019neuralregulatorymechanisms pages 29-33).
