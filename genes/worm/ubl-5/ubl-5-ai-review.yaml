description: 'UBL-5 is a small ubiquitin-like protein (73 aa) that functions as an
  atypical, non-enzymatic regulator acting through non-covalent protein-protein interactions.
  Unlike typical ubiquitin-like proteins, UBL-5/Hub1 lacks the C-terminal di-glycine
  motif required for covalent conjugation. UBL-5 has two main functional roles: (1)
  as a spliceosome-associated cofactor that promotes proper pre-mRNA splicing through
  specific interactions with HIND-containing spliceosomal proteins (SART-1/Snu66,
  PRP-38), and (2) as a positive regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
  (UPR-mt) where it forms a complex with DVE-1 to activate transcription of mitochondrial
  chaperone genes (hsp-6, hsp-60). Under mitochondrial stress, UBL-5 accumulates in
  the nucleus. Loss of ubl-5 causes L3 larval arrest and splicing defects.'

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from Hub1/UBL5 orthologs.
      Recent direct experimental evidence in C. elegans (Kolathur et al., 2023) demonstrates
      that UBL-5 binds HIND-containing spliceosomal proteins SART-1 and PRP-38, co-immunoprecipitates
      with spliceosomal components, and is essential for splicing. Loss of ubl-5 causes
      accumulation of unspliced transcripts and defects in both cis- and trans-splicing
      (PMID:16816413, Kolathur et al. 2023).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is strongly supported by recent C. elegans-specific experimental
      data. Kolathur et al. (2023) showed UBL-5 binds HIND-containing splicing factors,
      associates with spliceosome components via co-IP/MS, and ubl-5 mutants accumulate
      unspliced RNAs. The splicing role is now considered the primary molecular function
      of UBL-5, with UPR-mt effects potentially being downstream of its nuclear RNA
      processing role.

      This is directly supported by experimental evidence in C. elegans showing UBL-5-GFP
      accumulates in nuclei under mitochondrial stress (PMID:16816413).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Nuclear localization is well-supported by direct experimental evidence.
      Benedetti et al. (2006) showed that "Induction of mitochondrial stress promotes
      accumulation of GFP-tagged UBL-5 in nuclei of transgenic worms." The nuclear
      localization is consistent with UBL-5's role in both splicing (spliceosome is

    action: REMOVE
