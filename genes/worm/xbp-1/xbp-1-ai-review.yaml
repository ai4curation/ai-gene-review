description: XBP-1 is a bZIP transcription factor that functions as the primary 
  effector of the IRE-1 branch of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein 
  response (UPR-ER). The xbp-1 mRNA undergoes unconventional cytoplasmic 
  splicing by the ER transmembrane endoribonuclease IRE-1 during ER stress, 
  producing the active spliced isoform (XBP-1s) that induces transcription of 
  UPR target genes including hsp-3, hsp-4 (BiP homologs), and other ER 
  chaperones via binding to the UPR element (UPRE). XBP-1 is essential for 
  maintaining ER homeostasis, particularly during physiological demands such as 
  innate immune activation, heat stress, and developmental secretory capacity. 
  XBP-1 functions redundantly with PEK-1 (PERK) and ATF-6 pathways; loss of 
  xbp-1 combined with either pek-1 or atf-6 causes synthetic larval lethality. 
  XBP-1s also functions cell-nonautonomously from neurons to activate UPR in 
  distal tissues, regulate lipid metabolism, and extend lifespan.

    review:
      summary: XBP-1 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds to specific DNA 
        sequences including the UPR element (UPRE) to activate transcription of 
        ER stress genes. This annotation is phylogenetically inferred and 
        consistent with the conserved DNA-binding activity of XBP1 family 
        members across species (PMID:11779465).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The IBA annotation is well-supported. XBP-1 contains a conserved 
        bZIP domain (residues 61-117) and functions as a transcriptional 
        activator of UPR genes. The spliced form binds to UPRE sequences in 
        promoters of target genes like hsp-4. This is consistent with direct 
        experimental evidence in PMID:24068940 showing XBP-1 ChIP occupancy at 
        target gene promoters.

    review:
      summary: XBP-1s is a potent transcriptional activator during ER stress, 
        inducing expression of UPR target genes through binding to UPRE 
        elements. This core molecular function is conserved from yeast to humans
        (PMID:11779465).
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a core molecular function of XBP-1. The spliced isoform 
        (XBP-1s) functions as a stress-inducible transcriptional activator, 
        directly binding DNA and inducing transcription of ER stress response 
        genes. Evidence from multiple publications demonstrates that XBP-1 
        activates transcription of hsp-3, hsp-4, and other UPR genes 
        (PMID:11779465, PMID:16184190).

        as a transcription factor. UniProt (G5EE07) annotates nuclear 
        localization based on the bZIP domain (PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00978). The

    review:
      summary: Brokate-Llanos et al. (2014) found interactions between gale-1 
        (galactosemia model) and the UPR, with xbp-1 involved in the response to
        glycosylation defects.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: Supports the core function of XBP-1 in UPR. The paper shows 
        genetic interactions between the UPR and galactose 
        metabolism/glycosylation, consistent with XBP-1's role in responding to 
        ER stress caused by glycosylation defects.

suggested_questions:
  - question: What is the exact mechanism by which neuronal XBP-1s signals to 
      distal tissues to activate UPR cell-nonautonomously? Taylor and Dillin 
      (2013) showed neurotransmitter release is required, but the identity of 
      the secreted ER stress signal (SERSS) remains unknown.
  - question: Are there specific DNA sequences (UPREs) that XBP-1 binds in C. 
      elegans, and do they differ from mammalian XBP1 binding sites? While ChIP 
      evidence exists, the specific binding motifs for C. elegans XBP-1 have not
      been comprehensively characterized.
suggested_experiments:
  - description: ChIP-seq of XBP-1s to comprehensively map DNA binding sites 
      across the genome during ER stress. This would provide genome-wide 
      identification of direct XBP-1 target genes and binding motif 
      characterization.
  - description: Tissue-specific rescue experiments to determine which tissues 
      require XBP-1 for different phenotypes (development, immunity, lifespan). 
      This would clarify the cell-autonomous vs cell-nonautonomous requirements 
      for XBP-1 function.
