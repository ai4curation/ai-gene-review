description: NIPI-3 is a conserved Tribbles family pseudokinase that serves as an
  adapter protein regulating innate immune signaling and larval development in C.
  elegans. Despite containing a protein kinase domain, NIPI-3 lacks key catalytic
  residues and is predicted to be catalytically inactive. It functions primarily in
  epidermal immunity against fungal pathogens (D. coniospora) by acting upstream of
  the PMK-1/p38 MAPK cascade to induce antimicrobial peptide genes (nlp-29, nlp-31).
  In the intestine, NIPI-3 mediates defense against Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa)
  and Gram-positive bacteria by negatively regulating the C/EBP transcription factor
  CEBP-1, which in turn controls VHP-1 phosphatase levels and PMK-1 phosphorylation
  status. NIPI-3 directly interacts with CEBP-1 and represses its transcription. Loss
  of nipi-3 causes larval arrest at L2-L3, demonstrating its essential role in development
  beyond immunity. The protein localizes to nuclei in epidermis, intestine, and neurons.

    summary: NIPI-3 localizes predominantly to nuclei in epidermis, intestine, and
      neurons, as demonstrated by GFP knock-in studies (PMID:27927209). This nuclear
      localization is consistent with its role in transcriptional regulation of cebp-1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation is well-supported by experimental evidence. PMID:27927209
      demonstrates nuclear localization of NIPI-3 using a GFP knock-in strain. This
      localization is also consistent with the functional role of NIPI-3 in transcriptional
      repression of cebp-1. The IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is
      supported by direct experimental evidence in C. elegans.

  review:
    summary: NIPI-3 functions upstream of the p38 MAPK cascade in epidermal immunity.
      While genetic interactions between NIPI-3 and SEK-1 (MAPKK) are well-documented
      (PMID:18394898, PMID:27927209), direct physical binding to SEK-1 has not been
      demonstrated in C. elegans. The IBA annotation is based on mammalian Tribbles
      proteins which do interact with MAPK pathway components.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is phylogenetically reasonable. Mammalian Tribbles
      proteins interact with MAPK pathway components. In C. elegans, NIPI-3 genetically
      acts upstream of the SEK-1/PMK-1 cascade, though the molecular mechanism may
      differ from direct binding. PMID:27927209 shows that loss of sek-1 suppresses
      nipi-3 null lethality, indicating functional interaction. The annotation appropriately
      captures the conserved relationship between Tribbles and MAPK signaling.

  review:
    summary: Mammalian Tribbles proteins (TRIB1, TRIB2) promote C/EBP protein degradation
      via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In C. elegans, NIPI-3 regulates CEBP-1
      at the transcriptional level rather than through proteasomal degradation (PMID:27927209).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The IBA annotation is phylogenetically inferred from mammalian Tribbles
      which do promote C/EBP degradation. However, in C. elegans, NIPI-3 appears to
      regulate CEBP-1 primarily at the transcriptional level. PMID:27927209 states
      that a translational reporter showed no detectable differences in GFP expression
      in a nipi-3(0) background, indicating post-translational regulation is not the
      primary mechanism. The annotation may still apply to some extent given the conserved
      Tribbles-C/EBP interaction but is not a core function in C. elegans.

  review:
    summary: NIPI-3 contains a protein kinase domain with predicted ATP binding sites.
      However, the kinase domain lacks key catalytic residues and is predicted to
      be catalytically inactive (pseudokinase).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The UniProt annotation indicates ATP binding sites at positions 206-214
      and 235. While NIPI-3 is a pseudokinase, pseudokinases often retain nucleotide
      binding capability even though they lack catalytic activity. The IEA annotation
      based on keyword mapping is appropriate as it does not imply catalytic function.

core_functions:
- description: NIPI-3 functions as an adapter pseudokinase that binds to and negatively
    regulates the CEBP-1 transcription factor. Through this interaction, NIPI-3 coordinates
    innate immune responses in epidermis (antifungal) and intestine (antibacterial)
    and modulates MAPK signaling and transcription factor activity.

    supporting_text: One prominent candidate interacting partner was CEBP-1, a member
      of the C/EBP family of transcription factors
  - reference_id: PMID:18394898
    supporting_text: We identify a kinase, NIPI-3, related to human Tribbles homolog
      1, that is likely to act upstream of the MAPKK SEK-1.
- description: NIPI-3 negatively regulates transcription of cebp-1, preventing excessive
    CEBP-1 activity that would cause developmental arrest and impaired immunity. This
    repression is central to both developmental and immune functions of NIPI-3.
