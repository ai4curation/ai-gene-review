### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** G5EED4
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Protein nipi-3 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=No induction of peptide after drechmeria infection protein 3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:K09A9.1}; AltName: Full=Tribbles homolog nipi-3 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:27927200, ECO:0000303|PubMed:27927209, ECO:0000303|PubMed:34407394};
- **Gene Information:** Name=nipi-3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:K09A9.1}; ORFNames=K09A9.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:K09A9.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CAMK Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719); Tribbles/Ser_Thr_kinase_40. (IPR024104); Pkinase (PF00069)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "nipi-3" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'nipi-3' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **nipi-3** (gene ID: nipi-3, UniProt: G5EED4) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

- Synthesize into a comprehensive, well-cited research report with URLs and dates. (Completed)

Verification of target identity and domains
- Identity and organism: nipi-3 is the Caenorhabditis elegans Tribbles-family ortholog (gene K09A9.1), consistent with UniProt G5EED4, discovered in innate immune studies; no symbol ambiguity with other organisms was encountered in the sources examined (2008 Current Biology; 2016 BMC Biology). NIPI-3 is repeatedly described as a Tribbles-like kinase/pseudokinase in C. elegans and placed functionally in innate immunity and development (Pujol et al., 2008, Current Biology, Apr 2008, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.079; Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (pujol2008distinctinnateimmune pages 6-8, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)
- Domains/family: NIPI-3 bears a kinase-like domain characteristic of the Tribbles family and is considered a conserved pseudokinase lacking key catalytic residues, aligning with the CAMK-like protein kinase superfamily annotations. Functional data support a regulatory/scaffolding role rather than demonstrated catalytic activity (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 1-2)

Key concepts and current understanding
- Core role and pathway placement: In the epidermal innate immune response to infection/wounding, NIPI-3 acts upstream of a conserved p38 MAPK cascade (TIR-1/SARM1 → NSY-1/MAP3K → SEK-1/MAP2K → PMK-1/p38), promoting antimicrobial peptide (AMP) induction (e.g., nlp-29). Genetic analyses place NIPI-3 as an activator or permissive regulator upstream of TIR-1/NSY-1/SEK-1 in the epidermis (Pujol et al., 2008, Current Biology, Apr 2008, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.079). (pujol2008distinctinnateimmune pages 6-8)
- Context-dependent regulation: During organismal development, complete loss of nipi-3 causes larval arrest and lethality driven by excessive CEBP-1 activity and hyperactivation of the PMK-1/p38 cascade. NIPI-3 normally represses the bZIP factor CEBP-1, thereby restraining transcription of sek-1 (MAP2K) and downstream PMK-1 activation; cebp-1 loss or disruption of the PMK-1 pathway (e.g., sek-1, pmk-1 mutants) suppresses the nipi-3(0) arrest. Thus, NIPI-3 can both promote PMK-1 signaling in epidermal immunity and restrain it during development via CEBP-1, revealing tissue- and context-dependent control (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 9-11, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 1-2)
- Intestinal surveillance immunity: In the intestine, NIPI-3 mediates immune gene expression following translational inhibition by Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ToxA), and functions largely in parallel to PMK-1 signaling in this context. nipi-3(fr4) mutants (I307N in the kinase-like domain) are hypersusceptible to P. aeruginosa and ToxA and show broad misregulation of immune/stress genes (McEwan et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0334-6). (mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 2-4, mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 1-2)

Molecular function, partners, and substrates
- Pseudokinase/regulatory adaptor: Tribbles-family proteins typically function as adaptors/scaffolds. In C. elegans, biochemical and genetic data support that NIPI-3 interacts with and represses the bZIP transcription factor CEBP-1; a yeast two-hybrid mapped CEBP-1 binding to its N-terminus (aa 1–115). No direct kinase catalytic activity or direct phosphorylation substrates of NIPI-3 have been demonstrated in the cited studies; the prevailing model is regulatory rather than enzymatic catalysis (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)
- Pathway partners and feedback: Genetic epistasis places CEBP-1 downstream of NIPI-3; CEBP-1 directly promotes sek-1 transcription (supported by ChIP-seq), and elevated CEBP-1 in nipi-3(0) leads to PMK-1 hyperactivation. Forward genetic suppressor screens uncovered additional components and feedback: mak-2/pmk-1 and sek-1 exhibit positive feedback on sek-1 transcription, and novel regulators such as the NatC N-terminal acetyltransferase complex and HDAC hda-4 modulate development via the NIPI-3 → CEBP-1 → PMK-1 axis (Malinow et al., 2022, Scientific Reports, Sep 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20361-x). (malinow2022forwardgeneticscreening pages 11-12, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanisms pages 83-90)

Pathways, signaling, and biological processes
- Epidermal innate immunity: NIPI-3 is required cell-autonomously in the epidermis for AMP gene induction in response to fungal infection, acting with or upstream of PKCδ/TPA-1 and the TIR-1/NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 cascade (Pujol et al., 2008, Current Biology, Apr 2008, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.079). (pujol2008distinctinnateimmune pages 6-8)
- Intestinal translational surveillance: NIPI-3 is upregulated by translational inhibition (ToxA), promotes intestinal immune gene expression post-developmentally, and negatively regulates CEBP-1 to enable protective immunity. nipi-3(fr4) animals are hypersensitive to translational inhibitors beyond ToxA, consistent with a surveillance role (McEwan et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0334-6). (mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 1-2, mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 2-4)
- Developmental control: nipi-3 null mutants arrest at L2–L3 with lethality that can be fully suppressed by cebp-1 loss; overactive PMK-1 signaling contributes to the arrest. This establishes NIPI-3 as a master regulator coordinating development with stress/immune signaling (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 9-11, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)

Subcellular localization and tissue expression
- Expression and localization: pnipi-3::GFP reporters show expression in epidermis, intestine, head neurons, and motoneurons; expression is evident in embryos and adults. Genetic mosaic and rescue analyses indicate epidermal cell-autonomous action for AMP induction, while development requires NIPI-3 activity in multiple tissues; NIPI-3 shows predominantly nuclear localization (Pujol et al., 2008, Current Biology, Apr 2008, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.079; Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (pujol2008distinctinnateimmune pages 6-8, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)

Recent developments and latest research (emphasis on 2022 and context-limited later work)
- Genetic suppressor screens uncovered chromatin and N-terminal acetylation regulators acting downstream of NIPI-3/CEBP-1 and documented transcriptional feedback within the p38 module (Malinow et al., 2022, Scientific Reports, Sep 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20361-x). These data reinforce the centrality of NIPI-3 in balancing development and stress responses by tuning PMK-1 activity via CEBP-1 (Malinow, 2022, thesis/compendium; context excerpt emphasizes regulatory role) (malinow2022forwardgeneticscreening pages 11-12, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanisms pages 83-90).
- Note on 2023–2024: While our search identified multiple 2023–2024 papers linking PMK-1 regulation to other cellular processes (e.g., mitochondrial metabolism, bZIP regulators, ADARs), the current gathered evidence set does not include extractable nipi-3–specific data from these articles, so we avoid overinterpreting them here. The most recent nipi-3–centric mechanistic updates in this context are from 2022 suppressor and feedback analyses (malinow2022forwardgeneticscreening pages 11-12, malinow2022novelsignalingmechanisms pages 83-90).

Quantitative data and statistics from primary studies
- Intestinal induction and survival: nipi-3 is induced 4.3-fold by ToxA; nipi-3(fr4) mutants show significantly reduced survival upon ToxA exposure (P < 0.0001), and widespread misregulation of immune/stress genes confirmed by NanoString (e.g., 49 genes altered on P. aeruginosa, 27 on ToxA; 26/27 candidates validated) (McEwan et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0334-6). (mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 2-4, mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 1-2)
- Developmental lethality and suppression: nipi-3 null mutants arrest at L2–L3 with death 5–10 days post-hatch; cebp-1 loss fully suppresses lethality, and reducing PMK-1 pathway components (e.g., sek-1) rescues, supporting the NIPI-3 → CEBP-1 → sek-1 → PMK-1 axis (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 9-11)
- Epidermal AMP induction: nipi-3(fr4) fails to induce nlp-29 upon infection; a genomic nipi-3(+) transgene restores induction; quantification used Biosort reporter fluorescence (Pujol et al., 2008, Current Biology, Apr 2008, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.079). (pujol2008distinctinnateimmune pages 6-8)
- Suppressor screens and feedback: unbiased suppressor screens of nipi-3(0) lethality recovered cebp-1, mak-2, tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1 mutations; a sek-1 transcriptional reporter revealed that pmk-1 and mak-2 positively feed back to sek-1 expression (Malinow et al., 2022, Scientific Reports, Sep 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20361-x). (malinow2022forwardgeneticscreening pages 11-12)

Expert opinions and authoritative reviews (contextual summaries)
- Reviews integrating innate immune signaling in C. elegans describe NIPI-3/Tribbles as a cross-tissue regulator of PMK-1/p38, with NIPI-3 restraining PMK-1 during development via CEBP-1 yet promoting epidermal immune activation, exemplifying the integration of stress and developmental programs (Kim & Ewbank, 2018 WormBook; Harding & Ewbank, 2021 Biochem Soc Trans). These perspectives are consistent with our primary-source synthesis above (Kim et al., 2016; McEwan et al., 2016) (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 1-2, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5, mcewan2016tribblesortholognipi3 pages 1-2).

Current applications and real-world implementations
- NIPI-3 serves as a tractable genetic entry point to dissect epithelial immune surveillance (translation stress sensing), to model developmental-immune crosstalk, and to identify modifiers (chromatin and protein N-terminal acetylation) that tune MAPK output. The genetic suppression of nipi-3 lethality provides an assay to discover regulators of the p38 module with potential relevance to conserved Tribbles–C/EBP circuits in higher organisms (Malinow et al., 2022, Scientific Reports, Sep 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20361-x; Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (malinow2022forwardgeneticscreening pages 11-12, kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)

Limitations and open questions
- Biochemistry: Direct catalytic kinase activity of NIPI-3 has not been demonstrated; evidence supports a pseudokinase/adaptor model. Direct substrates are unknown from the cited work. Dissecting how NIPI-3 molecularly represses CEBP-1 (e.g., recruitment of corepressors, proteostasis, or chromatin changes) remains a key question (Kim et al., 2016, BMC Biology, Dec 2016, https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z). (kim2016coordinatedinhibitionof pages 2-5)
- Tissue specificity and signaling inputs: The upstream cues that engage NIPI-3 differently in epidermis (pro-immune) versus development (anti-PMK-1 via CEBP-1 repression) are incompletely defined, as is the extent of non-cell-autonomous control (Kim et al., 2016; Pujol et al., 2008).

Conclusions
- NIPI-3 (G5EED4) is a C. elegans Tribbles-family pseudokinase that integrates developmental and innate immune signaling. In epidermal defense, it acts upstream of the canonical p38 MAPK pathway to drive AMP gene induction. In development, it restrains PMK-1 activity by repressing CEBP-1 and its target sek-1, preventing lethal hyperactivation of the p38 module. Tissue-restricted, largely nuclear expression and strong genetic interactions with CEBP-1 and p38 pathway genes position NIPI-3 as a master regulator of stress–development tradeoffs. 2022 suppressor and reporter studies expanded this framework, revealing feedback and chromatin/N-terminal acetylation modulators downstream of NIPI-3. Open biochemical questions remain regarding direct molecular mechanisms of CEBP-1 repression and any catalytic functions of NIPI-3. Collectively, these data establish NIPI-3 as a central adaptor orchestrating context-dependent control of p38 MAPK signaling in vivo (Pujol et al., 2008; McEwan et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Malinow et al., 2022).
