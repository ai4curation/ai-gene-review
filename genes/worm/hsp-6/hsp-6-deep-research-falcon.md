### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P11141
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Heat shock protein hsp-6 {ECO:0000305}; AltName: Full=Heat shock 70 kDa protein F, mitochondrial {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2766926}; Flags: Precursor;
- **Gene Information:** Name=hsp-6 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C37H5.8}; Synonyms=hsp70f {ECO:0000303|PubMed:2766926}, mot-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C37H5.8}; ORFNames=C37H5.8 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:C37H5.8};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ATPase_NBD. (IPR043129); Chaperone_DnaK. (IPR012725); Heat_shock_70_CS. (IPR018181); HSP70_C_sf. (IPR029048); HSP70_peptide-bd_sf. (IPR029047)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "hsp-6" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'hsp-6' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **hsp-6** (gene ID: hsp-6, UniProt: P11141) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans hsp-6 (UniProt: P11141)

Verification of target identity and context
- Identity and organism: The C. elegans hsp-6 gene encodes the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone (also known as mtHSP70/mortalin/Grp75), used widely as a canonical mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) target and reporter gene in C. elegans, including via the hsp-6p::GFP transcriptional reporter; reporter activation is ATFS-1 dependent (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001302; published July 2021) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7). A recent preprint explicitly equates HSP-6 with mtHSP70/mortalin in C. elegans, assaying HSP-6 protein by immunoblot (bioRxiv; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.07.556674; version posted December 2025) (li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 8-12).
- Family/domains and localization: hsp-6 is a mitochondrial Hsp70-family chaperone localized to mitochondria; its promoter responds to mitochondrial import stress and UPRmt induction (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7). The same preprint frames HSP-6 as mtHSP70 with canonical chaperone roles and lipid interactions consistent with mitochondrial inner-membrane environments (bioRxiv, 2025; URL above) (li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 12-15).

1) Key concepts and definitions
- HSP-6 is the C. elegans mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHSP70) chaperone that assists mitochondrial proteostasis. In C. elegans, UPRmt is a retrograde stress pathway in which mitochondrial perturbations cause the transcription factor ATFS-1 to accumulate in the nucleus, inducing mitochondrial chaperones and proteases including hsp-6 (Cell Reports, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114889; published November 2024) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18). Bibliometric synthesis identifies ATFS-1 import efficiency as a central regulatory node in C. elegans UPRmt and highlights conservation to mammalian ATF5 (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2023.1146963; published March 2023) (ye2023trendsinmitochondrial pages 11-11).
- hsp-6p::GFP is a canonical C. elegans reporter for UPRmt activation. Its induction is strongest in the intestine after mitochondrial perturbations, and is abolished by atfs-1 knockdown (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).

2) Primary function and pathway role
- Biochemical role: HSP-6/mtHSP70 functions as an ATP-dependent mitochondrial chaperone supporting protein import and folding in the matrix. Perturbing mitochondrial import triggers ATFS-1 nuclear signaling to induce hsp-6 expression (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7). A preprint further reinforces HSP-6’s identity as mtHSP70 and connects its perturbation to mitochondrial lipid and ER stress signaling changes, consistent with chaperone roles at the mitochondria–ER interface (bioRxiv, 2025; URL above) (li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 8-12, li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 12-15).
- UPRmt regulation: Core UPRmt regulators include the mitochondrial ClpP protease, the matrix peptide exporter HAF-1, and the transcription factor ATFS-1; DVE-1 and chromatin remodeling factors act as modulators. This architecture and its links to longevity and immunity are synthesized in Cell Reports 2024 and cited foundational works (Cell Reports, 2024; URL above) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18). Field-level analyses emphasize ATFS-1–dependent regulation and cross-species conservation (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023; URL above) (ye2023trendsinmitochondrial pages 11-11).

3) Regulation and reporter usage
- ATFS-1 dependence: Mitochondrial import stress activates hsp-6 via ATFS-1; hsp-6p::GFP induction is abolished by atfs-1 knockdown (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).
- DVE-1 and UPRmt-independent roles: While DVE-1 is canonically associated with UPRmt, recent work shows DVE-1 also exerts longevity effects in ways separable from classical UPRmt signaling, refining interpretation of hsp-6 induction in longevity paradigms (Cell Reports, 2024; URL above) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18).
- Reporter practice: hsp-6p::GFP (and hsp-60p::GFP) are the most commonly used C. elegans transcriptional reporters for UPRmt activation, with atfs-1 required for their induction (bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.15.648933; posted April 2025) (kim2025transcriptomicanalysisof pages 1-2). Empirically, hsp-6p::GFP responds to mitochondrial perturbations (e.g., cox-5B, spg-7, mrps-5 RNAi) more robustly than to mild import perturbations (e.g., dnj-21 RNAi), showing graded sensitivity (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).

4) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- UPRmt and longevity modulation beyond canonical axes: DVE-1 has UPRmt-independent roles in ciliary mutants’ longevity, indicating that hsp-6 induction is not a sole determinant of lifespan outcomes and highlighting complex network regulation of longevity (Cell Reports, 2024; URL above) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18).
- Field trend analyses (2004–2022) emphasize the centrality of ATFS-1 regulation, emerging disease links, and translational interest. They contextualize the extensive use of hsp-6/hsp-6p::GFP in aging and disease-model studies (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023; URL above) (ye2023trendsinmitochondrial pages 11-11).

5) Current applications and real-world implementations
- UPRmt reporter in vivo: hsp-6p::GFP is a standard readout for intestinal UPRmt activation under genetic (e.g., ETC subunit knockdown) and pharmacologic perturbations, with tissue-resolved fluorescence imaging and validation by ATFS-1 dependence (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).
- Cross-compartment proteostasis studies: Post-developmental hsp-6 (mtHSP70) knockdown has been used to probe mitochondria–ER stress crosstalk (MERSR), showing reduced ER stress and decreased polyglutamine aggregates; effects depend on VCP/cdc-48.1, indicating intersection with ERAD/UPS pathways (bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.07.556674) (li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 19-26).
- Proteasome–mitochondria coordination: Mitochondrial import stress elicits proteasome activation and lifespan extension, situating hsp-6p::GFP as a reporter of mitochondrial stress in studies of cytosolic proteostasis coordination (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7, sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 29-30).

6) Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- Mechanistic synthesis: The 2024 Cell Reports study integrates primary literature to reaffirm ATFS-1’s centrality and the roles of ClpP, HAF-1, DVE-1, and chromatin remodeling in UPRmt; it underscores that UPRmt activation can support cytoprotection and immunity but does not uniformly predict longevity (Cell Reports, 2024; URL above) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18).
- Field overview: Bibliometric analysis describes shifting emphasis from C. elegans to mammalian systems while maintaining ATFS-1 as a conceptual anchor and linking UPRmt to aging and diseases (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023; URL above) (ye2023trendsinmitochondrial pages 11-11).

7) Quantitative data and specific findings
- Reporter induction: hsp-6p::GFP is robustly induced by canonical mitochondrial stressors (e.g., ETC subunit knockdown) and abolished by atfs-1 RNAi; mild import perturbation (dnj-21 RNAi) produces weaker, variable hsp-6 mRNA and reporter induction, strongest in intestine (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).
- Lifespan effects with mitochondrial import stress: Mild mitochondrial import stress (distinct from strong ETC disruption) can extend lifespan in C. elegans while coordinating proteasome activity; hsp-6p::GFP serves as the readout for UPRmt in these paradigms (PLOS Biology, 2021; URL above) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).
- hsp-6 knockdown phenotypes in proteostasis models: Post-developmental hsp-6 RNAi reduced poly-Q aggregation and improved motility; in one dataset, median lifespan in N2 increased from 22 days (empty vector) to 24 days with hsp-6 RNAi, and paralysis reductions in Aβ or poly-Q models reached high significance (e.g., P<0.0001) (bioRxiv, 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.07.556674) (li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 19-26).

Conclusions and current understanding
- HSP-6 (UniProt P11141) is the C. elegans mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone central to mitochondrial proteostasis, induced by ATFS-1 during UPRmt, and localized to mitochondria. hsp-6p::GFP is a validated, ATFS-1–dependent reporter of UPRmt activation, widely used in studies of mitochondrial stress, proteostasis coordination, longevity, and immunity. Recent work refines the network, showing modulators such as DVE-1 can regulate longevity independently of canonical UPRmt, and that manipulating HSP-6 intersects with ER stress and aggregate handling, underscoring cross-organelle proteostasis (Cell Reports, 2024; PLOS Biology, 2021; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2023; bioRxiv, 2025) (sheng2024amitochondrialunfolded pages 16-18, sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7, ye2023trendsinmitochondrial pages 11-11, li2025unveilingtheintercompartmental pages 19-26).

Notes on limitations and gaps
- Precise biochemical domain-level details (ATPase NBD, peptide-binding domain) and co-chaperone specificity in C. elegans were inferred from Hsp70 family knowledge and contextualized by the cited works as mitochondrial Hsp70 function; direct domain mapping for HSP-6 was not explicitly provided in the retrieved excerpts. When needed, hsp-6p::GFP quantitation and fold-induction values should be extracted from figure panels and supplement of reporter-based studies (e.g., Sladowska 2021) (sladowska2021proteasomeactivitycontributes pages 5-7).
