description: HSP-6 is the C. elegans mitochondrial HSP70 chaperone (mtHSP70/mortalin
  ortholog) that functions as the primary ATP-dependent chaperone in the mitochondrial
  matrix. It is essential for mitochondrial protein import, serving as the import
  motor that drives translocation of precursor proteins across the inner membrane.
  HSP-6 also participates in protein folding within the matrix and is involved in
  iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. The hsp-6 gene is a canonical marker of the mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPR-mt), with hsp-6p::GFP being the standard reporter
  for UPR-mt activation. Expression is strongly induced by mitochondrial proteotoxic
  stress in an ATFS-1-dependent manner. Knockdown of HSP-6 causes reduced ATP levels,
  abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and progeria-like phenotypes including shortened
  lifespan.

    summary: IBA annotation indicating cytoplasmic localization based on phylogenetic
      inference. While some HSP70 family members have cytoplasmic pools, HSP-6 is
      specifically the mitochondrial HSP70 with a mitochondrial transit peptide (residues
      1-27) and is experimentally localized to mitochondria.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: HSP-6 has an N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptide (UniProt FT TRANSIT
      1..27) and is characterized as the mitochondrial matrix HSP70. While precursor
      protein may transiently exist in cytoplasm before import, the functional protein
      is mitochondrial. The IBA annotation likely reflects the broader HSP70 family
      distribution rather than HSP-6 specifically. However, this annotation is not
      incorrect as the precursor does exist in the cytoplasm before mitochondrial
      import.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: HSP70 family members functionally interact with co-chaperones and other

    reason: While HSP-6 is indeed induced by stress (mitochondrial stress specifically),
      this term is too general. The protein is already annotated to GO:0034514 (mitochondrial

      protein handling, as neither heat-shock nor endoplasmic reticulum stress nor
      manipulations that impair mitochondrial steps in intermediary metabolism or
      ATP synthesis activated the mitochondrial chaperone genes.
proposed_new_terms: []
suggested_questions:
- question: What specific co-chaperones (DNJ proteins) work with HSP-6 in C. elegans
    mitochondria?
  experts:
  - Mitochondrial proteostasis researchers
  - C. elegans geneticists
- question: Is HSP-6 involved in the folding of specific mitochondrial protein substrates,
    or is its substrate specificity broad?
  experts:
  - HSP70 chaperone biochemists
  - Mitochondrial protein import researchers
- question: What is the relative contribution of HSP-6 to import motor function versus
    post-import folding assistance?
  experts:
  - Mitochondrial protein import specialists
  - TIM23 complex researchers
suggested_experiments:
- description: Immunofluorescence or GFP-tagging to confirm mitochondrial matrix localization
    specifically (vs. outer membrane or intermembrane space)
  experiment_type: Subcellular localization
  hypothesis: HSP-6 localizes specifically to the mitochondrial matrix compartment
- description: Co-immunoprecipitation to identify specific protein interaction partners
    and substrates
  experiment_type: Protein interaction analysis
  hypothesis: HSP-6 interacts with TIM23 complex components and specific mitochondrial
    substrate proteins
- description: Genetic epistasis experiments with TIM23 complex components to confirm
    import motor function
  experiment_type: Genetic epistasis
  hypothesis: HSP-6 functions downstream of TIM23 in the protein import pathway
