Research plan and verification
We verified the target identity against UniProt and the literature: cdc-48.1 (UniProt P54811) encodes a Caenorhabditis elegans AAA+ ATPase of the CDC48 (p97/VCP) subfamily, with characteristic N-terminal N-domains and tandem AAA domains that form a hexameric unfoldase/segregase. C. elegans has two highly similar paralogs, cdc-48.1 and cdc-48.2, which function redundantly in several pathways; organism-specific studies explicitly analyze CDC-48 with UFD-1/NPL-4 in worm embryos and tissues (e.g., DNA replication and ERAD-linked stress responses) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2).

Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
• Molecular function and catalytic activity: CDC-48.1 is a hexameric AAA+ ATPase (EC 3.6.4.6) that uses ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive polypeptide translocation through a central pore, extracting and/or unfolding clients from membranes and macromolecular complexes. This “segregase/unfoldase” activity underlies protein-quality control, membrane protein extraction, and disassembly of chromatin complexes. Substrate selection is adapter-driven; UFD‑1/NPL‑4 typically recognizes K48-linked polyubiquitin on clients, whereas SEP-domain adapters (p37/p47 family) can promote ubiquitin-independent disassembly of specific complexes. These mechanisms are conserved and directly applicable to C. elegans CDC-48.1 (review synthesis and structural advances) (Journal of Biological Chemistry, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105182) (braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2); (Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9).
• Substrates and specificity: CDC-48.1 recognizes ubiquitylated substrates primarily via the UFD‑1·NPL‑4 heterodimer, which binds polyubiquitin and can initiate unfolding within the ubiquitin chain; UBX cofactors modulate this process and lower the “ubiquitin threshold” required for client processing. These principles, defined across eukaryotes, rationalize worm observations of CDC-48–dependent replisome disassembly and ERAD (eLife, Aug 2022, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76763) (fujisawa2022multipleubxproteins pages 1-2).

Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 emphasis)
• Adapter-mediated control and structural mechanisms: 2023–2024 studies elucidate how adapters remodel p97/CDC-48 to control hexamer opening, ATPase rates, client threading, and substrate hand-off. High-resolution analyses of adapter modules (UBX, eUBX, PUB) and N-domain dynamics reveal how adapter engagement determines pathway choice (JBC review, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105182) (braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2); a 2024 mechanistic review compiles substrate-engaged structures that explain recognition, extraction, and release of ubiquitinated clients (Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19). Conformational analyses of N-domains underscore their large-amplitude motions that regulate adapter binding and client loading (IJMS, Mar 2024, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25063371) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9).
• Ubiquitin-threshold modulation by UBX cofactors: UBX proteins (e.g., FAF1/FAF2/UBXN7 in mammals; UBXN-family in worms) reduce the polyubiquitin chain-length requirement for UFD‑1/NPL‑4–dependent unfolding, thereby accelerating processing of clients such as the CMG helicase. This mechanistic finding refines how CDC-48/Cdc48 systems engage DNA replication and ERAD substrates (eLife, Aug 2022, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76763) (fujisawa2022multipleubxproteins pages 1-2).
• ERAD–immune stress crosstalk in C. elegans: A 2024 study shows that CDC‑48 is required for proper activation of SKN‑1–dependent antioxidant and immune responses during pathogen challenge; cdc‑48 RNAi induces the ER unfolded protein response (UPRER) and disrupts SKN‑1C nuclear translocation, indicating that CDC‑48/ERAD activity is central to orchestrating ER proteostasis and immune signaling (Genetics, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2).

Primary function, pathways, cofactors, and complexes in C. elegans
• DNA replication and chromatin-associated degradation (CAD): In worm embryos, the CDC‑48UFD‑1/NPL‑4 complex promotes replication fork progression by extracting ubiquitylated licensing and replisome factors. Depletion of cdc‑48.1/2, ufd‑1, or npl‑4 causes reduced DNA synthesis, S‑phase delay, and embryonic lethality. CDC‑48 activity facilitates turnover of CDT‑1 and release of CDC‑45/GINS from chromatin; the UBX adaptor UBXN‑3/FAF1 acts as a substrate-selection module at replication forks. A sensitized cdc‑48.1(tm544) allele reduces total CDC‑48 protein by ~80% in embryos, illustrating dosage sensitivity (PNAS, Sep 2008, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105; Nat Commun, Feb 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2).
• ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and stress responses: CDC‑48.1 participates in ERAD, retrotranslocating misfolded or regulated ER proteins for proteasomal degradation. In vivo, CDC‑48 is necessary to mount SKN‑1C-dependent antioxidant responses during infection; when CDC‑48 is lost, UPRER dominates and SKN‑1 signaling is blunted, revealing functional coupling of ER proteostasis and innate immune activation (Genetics, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2).
• Adapter dependence and mechanistic diversity: The UFD‑1·NPL‑4 heterodimer is the primary ubiquitin receptor/cofactor across many pathways; UBX adaptors such as UBXN‑3/FAF1 promote chromatin-associated substrate selection, while SEP-domain adapters (p37/p47 family) enable ubiquitin-independent disassembly for certain complexes. Recent structural studies delineate how adapters bind the N-domain, remodel the hexamer, and position substrates for pore threading (JBC, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105182; Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9).

Subcellular localization and cellular context
• Nuclear/chromatin localization: In C. elegans embryos, CDC‑48 and UFD‑1/NPL‑4 localize to nuclei after mitotic reformation and act on chromatin-bound replication factors, consistent with a direct role in CAD at replication sites (PNAS, Sep 2008, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105; Nat Commun, Feb 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2).
• ER/ERAD localization: CDC‑48 acts at the cytosolic face of the ER to extract retrotranslocated substrates and interface with the proteasome; in the intestine, this activity conditions SKN‑1C nuclear translocation under pathogen or oxidative stress (Genetics, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2).

Signaling and biochemical pathways
• Ubiquitin-directed segregase pathway (UFD‑1/NPL‑4): Recognition of K48-linked polyubiquitin and client delivery to the CDC‑48 pore; unfolding may begin within the ubiquitin chain itself. UBX cofactors lower chain-length thresholds and enhance processing of key clients such as CMG during replication termination, a principle likely conserved in worms via UBXN-family proteins (eLife, Aug 2022, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76763) (fujisawa2022multipleubxproteins pages 1-2).
• Ubiquitin-independent SEP pathway: p37/p47 adapters deliver specific clients without ubiquitin tags, positioning them for threading and selective complex disassembly, expanding CDC‑48 pathway breadth (Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19).

Current applications and implementations
• Research tools and probes: Small-molecule ATPase inhibitors and structural biology now guide functional dissection of CDC‑48 pathways and adapter interfaces; these tools have been used to perturb substrate-engaged states and validate threading models, with implications for worm ortholog studies using genetic perturbations (Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19). Adapter-centric mechanisms suggest the feasibility of targeting adapter–CDC‑48 interactions to modulate pathway specificity in vivo (JBC, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105182) (braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2).

Expert opinions and authoritative syntheses
• Consensus mechanism: Recent authoritative reviews converge on a model in which adapter choice and N-domain conformation determine client selection and fate; substrate threading through the central channel is key to both degradation-linked extraction (e.g., ERAD, replisome disassembly) and regulatory complex remodeling. These principles unify CDC‑48.1 activities observed in C. elegans with cross-species structural and biochemical data (JBC, Nov 2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2023.105182; Preprints, Sep 2024, https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.1194.v1) (braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9).

Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
• Replication/CAD in nematodes: Depletion of cdc‑48.1/2 or ufd‑1/npl‑4 in worm embryos causes pronounced S-phase delay and reduced DNA synthesis; the cdc‑48.1(tm544) sensitized allele lowers total CDC‑48 levels by ~80% in embryos, underscoring dosage sensitivity of chromatin functions (PNAS, Sep 2008, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805944105; Nat Commun, Feb 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10612) (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2).
• ERAD–immunity coupling in nematodes: RNAi of cdc‑48 strongly induces the UPRER and blocks SKN‑1C nuclear translocation during infection, functionally linking ER proteostasis to innate immune signaling and pathogen response (Genetics, Aug 2024, https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyae131) (gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2).
• Ubiquitin chain threshold in eukaryotes: UBX cofactors (FAF1/FAF2/UBXN7) lower the polyubiquitin chain-length requirement for UFD‑1/NPL‑4–dependent unfolding, explaining how CDC‑48 pathways efficiently process clients across contexts; this supports analogous regulation in worms via conserved UBXN adaptors (eLife, Aug 2022, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76763) (fujisawa2022multipleubxproteins pages 1-2).

*Table: Compact, citable table summarizing organism‑verified functions, cofactors, pathways, and key sources for C. elegans CDC‑48.1 (UniProt P54811); useful as a quick reference for functional annotation and literature linkage.*

Ambiguity check and scope
The symbol cdc-48 is historically used across species for CDC48/p97 orthologs. Here, we restricted our functional annotation to C. elegans CDC‑48.1 (P54811) and its paralog-dependent context, cross-referencing only worm and conserved CDC48/p97 literature. Where direct worm data were required (e.g., DNA replication defects, ERAD–immune crosstalk), we cited C. elegans studies. Broader mechanistic claims are supported by 2023–2024 structural/biochemical work on conserved CDC48/p97 systems and mapped to worm CDC‑48.1 by domain and functional conservation (mouysset2008cellcycleprogression pages 1-2, franz2016chromatinassociateddegradationis pages 1-2, gabaldon2024skn1activationduring pages 1-2, braxton2023structuralinsightsof pages 1-2, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 18-19, mirzadeh2024molecularmechanismof pages 7-9, fujisawa2022multipleubxproteins pages 1-2).
