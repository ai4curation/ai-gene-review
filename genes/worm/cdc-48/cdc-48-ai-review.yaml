description: CDC-48.1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian p97/VCP, a highly conserved
  AAA+ ATPase that functions as a molecular chaperone. It forms homohexameric or heterohexameric
  rings (with CDC-48.2) and uses ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical force for unfolding
  substrate proteins, disassembling protein complexes, and disaggregating protein
  aggregates. CDC-48.1 is essential for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), working
  with UFD-1/NPL-4 adaptors to extract misfolded proteins from the ER for proteasomal
  degradation. It also functions in DNA replication by promoting degradation of CDT-1
  and disassembly of replication complexes, cell cycle progression, chromatin-associated
  protein degradation, mitotic spindle disassembly, and spermatogenesis regulation.
  CDC-48.1 works with various UBX domain-containing cofactors (UBXN-1 through UBXN-6)
  that determine substrate specificity.
