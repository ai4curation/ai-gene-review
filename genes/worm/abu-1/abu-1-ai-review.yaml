description: ABU-1 (Activated in Blocked Unfolded protein response) is a type I transmembrane
  protein that functions in an alternative ER stress response pathway. Unlike canonical
  UPR genes that are induced by the IRE1-XBP-1 pathway, abu-1 is specifically upregulated
  when this canonical pathway is blocked. ABU-1 localizes to the ER membrane and intracellular
  vesicular structures. The protein contains a signal sequence, a lumenal domain with
  similarity to scavenger receptors, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic
  tail. ABU-1 is essential for survival of animals with a blocked UPR under ER stress
  conditions, suggesting it provides a backup mechanism for handling misfolded ER
  client proteins. The lumenal domain shares similarity with mammalian scavenger receptors
  and C. elegans CED-1, suggesting ABU-1 may bind to altered ER client proteins and
  modulate their intracellular fate.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: ABU-1 localization to ER membrane is well-supported by experimental data.
      In C. elegans, ABU-1-GFP localizes to vesicular structures within the endomembrane
      system (PMID:12186849). When expressed in mammalian COS-1 cells, FLAG-tagged
      ABU-1 shows a diffuse reticular pattern that colocalizes with the ER marker
      ribophorin I. The protein is retained in the ER by its transmembrane domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is consistent with direct experimental evidence from
      PMID:12186849 showing ABU-1 colocalization with ER marker ribophorin I in mammalian
      cells and association with the endomembrane system in C. elegans. The IDA annotation
      from the same publication provides experimental validation.

    label: endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: The IBA annotation for ER UPR involvement is appropriate but requires
      careful interpretation. ABU-1 is part of an ALTERNATIVE pathway that is activated
      when the canonical IRE1-XBP-1 UPR pathway is blocked. It is not induced by ER
      stress in wild-type animals but specifically in xbp-1 mutants (PMID:12186849).
      The GO term captures the general involvement in ER stress response, though the
      mechanism is distinct from canonical UPR.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While ABU-1 functions in an alternative rather than canonical UPR pathway,
      the GO term GO:0030968 (endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response) is
      appropriately broad to encompass this function. The term definition includes
      responses to unfolded proteins in the ER, which ABU-1 participates in, albeit
      through a non-canonical mechanism. RNAi knockdown of abu-1 causes ER stress
      and kills ER-stressed animals with blocked UPR, demonstrating its role in maintaining
      ER homeostasis.

  review:
    summary: The HEP (high-throughput expression pattern) annotation is based on microarray
      expression data from PMID:12186849 showing that abu-1 is induced by ER stress
      (tunicamycin treatment) specifically in xbp-1 mutant animals. Northern blot
      analysis confirmed this expression pattern.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The expression pattern evidence correctly captures that abu-1 is transcriptionally
      induced during ER stress conditions, specifically in animals with blocked canonical
      UPR. This is valid evidence for involvement in ER stress response processes.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: The ND (No biological Data) annotation indicates that no specific molecular
      function has been experimentally determined for ABU-1. While the protein has
      sequence similarity to scavenger receptors and may bind to altered ER client
      proteins, this has not been directly demonstrated.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is an appropriate use of ND. Although PMID:12186849 suggests that
      ABU proteins may bind to altered ER client proteins based on sequence similarity
      to scavenger receptors, no direct biochemical demonstration of a specific molecular
      function has been published. The authors state this is a hypothesis.

      is retained in the ER by its transmembrane domain, as deletion of this domain
      leads to secretion.

  review:
    summary: 'The IMP (Inferred from Mutant Phenotype) annotation is supported by
      RNAi knockdown experiments in PMID:12186849. Inactivation of abu-1 by RNAi:
      (1) activated the ER stress marker hsp-4::gfp in otherwise normal animals, indicating
      development of ER stress; (2) killed approximately 50% of ER-stressed ire-1
      and xbp-1 mutant animals; (3) had synthetic interactions with sel-1 (ERAD component).
      These phenotypes demonstrate a functional role in ER stress response.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IMP evidence from RNAi experiments clearly demonstrates that abu-1
      functions in ER homeostasis. Loss of function causes ER stress (hsp-4::gfp activation)
      and is lethal in combination with canonical UPR mutants under stress conditions.
      This is strong genetic evidence for involvement in ER stress response pathways.
