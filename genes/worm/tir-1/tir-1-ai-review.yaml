description: 'TIR-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian SARM1 (Sterile Alpha and
  TIR Motif-containing protein 1). It functions as an NAD+ hydrolase (NADase) that
  cleaves NAD+ to produce ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. TIR-1 plays dual roles in the
  nematode: (1) as a central component of TLR-independent innate immunity, acting
  upstream of the NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 p38 MAPK signaling cascade to regulate antimicrobial
  peptide gene expression in response to bacterial and fungal pathogens; and (2) in
  neuronal development, specifically in the specification of asymmetric AWC olfactory
  neuron identity through its signaling adaptor function and localization to postsynaptic
  regions via its SAM domains. The TIR domain mediates the NADase enzymatic activity
  while the SAM domains mediate oligomerization and synaptic localization. TIR-1 also
  regulates serotonin biosynthesis in ADF chemosensory neurons in response to pathogenic
  food and participates in axon degeneration pathways. The protein homodimerizes and
  interacts with UNC-43/CaMKII, NSY-1/ASK1, and small GTPases like RAB-1.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference from PANTHER. The mammalian
      ortholog SARM1 is localized to dendrites. In C. elegans, TIR-1 has been shown
      to localize to postsynaptic regions of axons in AWC neurons (PMID:15625192),
      though dendrite localization has not been directly demonstrated. Given the conserved
      function and the evidence for synaptic localization, this is a reasonable inference.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Phylogenetic inference is reasonable given the conservation of SARM1 function.
      While direct evidence in C. elegans shows axon/postsynaptic localization, the
      IBA annotation from PANTHER reflects likely conserved subcellular distribution
      patterns.

      for innate immune response and defense responses to pathogens are already present

core_functions:
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0003953
    label: NAD+ nucleosidase activity
  description: TIR-1 is an NAD+ hydrolase that cleaves NAD+ to produce ADP-ribose
    and nicotinamide. This enzymatic activity is mediated by the TIR domain and requires
    self-association/oligomerization. This is the primary conserved molecular function
    of the SARM1 family.
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0035591
    label: signaling adaptor activity
  description: TIR-1 functions as a signaling adaptor that assembles signaling complexes
    linking upstream signals to the NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 p38 MAPK cascade. It binds to
    UNC-43/CaMKII and localizes NSY-1/ASK1 to postsynaptic regions.
suggested_questions:
- question: Does C. elegans TIR-1 produce cyclic ADP-ribose as a product of NAD+ hydrolysis,
    or exclusively linear ADP-ribose? The EC:3.2.2.6 annotation suggests cyclic ADP-ribose
    generating activity, but structural studies show linear ADP-ribose as the primary
    product.
- question: What is the relative importance of TIR-1's NADase activity versus its
    signaling adaptor function in innate immune responses? TIR-1 has dual functions
    but it is unclear if immune signaling depends on NADase activity or scaffolding
    function or both.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Test catalytically dead TIR-1 mutants for immune signaling function
    to separate NADase activity from adaptor function in immunity. If adaptor function
    is sufficient, catalytically dead mutants should rescue immune defects. If NADase
    is required, they should fail to rescue.
