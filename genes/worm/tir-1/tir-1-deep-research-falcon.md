## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q86DA5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=NAD(+) hydrolase tir-1 {ECO:0000305}; Short=NADase tir-1 {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.2.2.6 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31439792}; AltName: Full=Neuronal symmetry protein 2; AltName: Full=SARM1 homolog; AltName: Full=Sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein tir-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15048112};
- **Gene Information:** Name=tir-1 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15048112, ECO:0000312|WormBase:F13B10.1c}; Synonyms=nsy-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F13B10.1c}; ORFNames=F13B10.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F13B10.1c};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the SARM1 family. .
- **Key Domains:** ARM-like. (IPR011989); ARM-type_fold. (IPR016024); SAM. (IPR001660); SAM/pointed_sf. (IPR013761); SARM1. (IPR039184)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "tir-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'tir-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **tir-1** (gene ID: tir-1, UniProt: Q86DA5) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity and synonymy: tir-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a Sterile alpha and TIR motif protein that is the nematode homolog of mammalian SARM1; historical synonym nsy-2 has been used in the neuronal literature. Recent authoritative work explicitly refers to C. elegans TIR-1 as a SARM1-family member with enzymatic TIR domain activity (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8). A contemporary immunology review likewise states that C. elegans TIR-1 is the SARM1 ortholog (Frontiers in Immunology, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1521364) (oliveira2025sarm1akey pages 2-4). These sources match the UniProt target (Q86DA5; C. elegans) and the specified family/domains.

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Protein family and domains: TIR-1 belongs to the SARM1 family of enzymatic TIR-domain proteins and is composed of N‑terminal ARM-like repeats, tandem SAM domains that mediate self-association, and a C‑terminal TIR domain required for homotypic interactions and catalysis (Frontiers in Immunology, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1521364) (oliveira2025sarm1akey pages 2-4).
- Catalytic class and reaction: TIR-1 is an intrinsic NAD+ hydrolase (NADase; EC 3.2.2.6), and its catalytic activity is engaged when TIR-1 undergoes higher‑order assembly/aggregation. In intestinal epithelial cells, TIR-1 multimerization “engages its intrinsic NAD+ hydrolase activity” to activate downstream signaling (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674; bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5).
- Pathway placement: TIR-1 functions upstream of the canonical MAPK p38 cassette NSY‑1 (MAP3K) → SEK‑1 (MAP2K) → PMK‑1 (p38), culminating in ATF‑7-dependent immune gene expression. Loss of TIR-1 reduces PMK‑1 activation without changing total PMK‑1, placing TIR-1 upstream (Frontiers in Immunology, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1521364; Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (oliveira2025sarm1akey pages 2-4, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5).

2) Recent developments (2023–2024) and mechanistic advances
- Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) as activation platforms: Using endogenously tagged TIR‑1 and immunostaining, intestinal TIR‑1 was shown to localize to membranes of LROs (“gut granules”). A Pseudomonas aeruginosa effector (pyocyanin) alkalinizes and condenses LROs, driving TIR‑1 aggregation into puncta and activation of p38 immunity (bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946) (tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 31-33, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6). Peer‑reviewed follow‑up established that LRO integrity actively suppresses inappropriate TIR‑1 aggregation to restrain toxic propagation of PMK‑1 signaling; a genetic suppressor, ROTR‑1, maintains LRO integrity and limits TIR‑1 aggregation (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5).
- Positive feedback between PMK‑1 and TIR‑1: Hyperactivation of p38 by inhibiting the phosphatase VHP‑1 increases tir‑1 expression and visible TIR‑1 puncta; this is suppressed in pmk‑1 nulls, indicating a feed‑forward loop that augments TIR‑1 aggregation and signaling (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8).
- Cross-kingdom TIR phase transitions: The same Cell Reports study synthesizes recent structure‑function evidence that TIR/SARM1 family proteins, including plant TIRs and animal SARM1/TIR‑1, require higher‑order assembly or phase transitions to potentiate NADase activity, underscoring a conserved activation logic across kingdoms (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).

3) Current applications and implementations
- C. elegans as an effector‑triggered immunity model: The pyocyanin–LRO–TIR‑1 axis offers a tractable system to study effector sensing, organelle physiology, and propagation of innate immune signaling in vivo (bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946; Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 31-33, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8).
- Translational insight to SARM1 therapeutics: Although these studies are in nematodes, they reinforce the generalizable principle that SARM1/TIR NADase activity is controlled by multimerization/condensation, a mechanism central to ongoing drug discovery against mammalian SARM1 in neurodegeneration (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674; Frontiers in Immunology, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1521364) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18, oliveira2025sarm1akey pages 2-4).

4) Expert opinions and authoritative synthesis
- The Cell Reports 2024 study from Pukkila‑Worley’s group frames TIR‑1 as a pivotal enzymatic “guard” on LRO membranes whose aggregation is both necessary for robust p38 immunity and inherently toxic if unchecked, arguing for organelle‑based restraint mechanisms (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5).
- A recent immunology review highlights that C. elegans TIR‑1 acts independently of TLRs to control innate immunity upstream of p38 and consolidates its identity as the SARM1 ortholog with ARM/SAM/TIR architecture (Frontiers in Immunology, May 2025; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1521364) (oliveira2025sarm1akey pages 2-4).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Quantitative immune transcriptional signatures: Preprint analyses show enrichment of PMK‑1‑dependent gene sets (e.g., NES ≈ 1.34; q ≈ 0.018) upon perturbations that promote TIR‑1 aggregation, supporting functional coupling between TIR‑1 assembly and PMK‑1 target gene expression (bioRxiv, Feb 2024; https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.16.580734) (tsekang2024lysosomalintegritysuppresses pages 35-37).
- Survival/virulence assays and genetic requirements: Infections activating intestinal immunity require tir‑1 as well as nsy‑1, sek‑1 and pmk‑1; defects in these components sensitize animals to bacterial pathogens including Salmonella enterica Paratyphi A, consistent with the genetic epistasis model (Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).
- Pathway-level resilience to toxic stress: In adult C. elegans, cisplatin toxicity is counteracted by activation of the p38/ATF‑7 pathway; mutants in tir‑1, nsy‑1, sek‑1 and pmk‑1 are sensitized to cisplatin, arguing that TIR‑1‑driven p38 signaling confers stress resilience even outside canonical infection contexts (Nature Communications, May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).

Functional annotation of tir-1 in C. elegans
- Primary function: enzymatic sensor/adapter. TIR‑1 is an NAD+ hydrolase whose activity is gated by self‑assembly (SAM‑mediated and higher‑order condensation) on LRO membranes. Upon assembly, TIR‑1 engages its NADase activity and signals upstream of the NSY‑1→SEK‑1→PMK‑1 cascade to drive ATF‑7–dependent transcriptional programs of innate immunity (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674; bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 31-33).
- Substrate specificity and products: While the detailed products (ADPR, cADPR‑like species) are established for TIR/SARM1 NADases broadly, the C. elegans studies emphasize the requirement for NAD+ hydrolysis by TIR‑1 upon multimerization rather than product profiling; nevertheless, the classification as an NAD+ hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6) is consistent with enzymatic TIR proteins (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).
- Cellular localization and context: Endogenous tagging and immunostaining place TIR‑1 on intestinal LRO membranes where effector‑triggered organelle alkalinization and condensation seed TIR‑1 puncta. These puncta reflect higher‑order assembly required for pathway activation; organelle integrity factors (e.g., ROTR‑1) restrain this process (bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946; Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 31-33, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8).
- Biological processes: innate immunity and stress protection. tir‑1 is required for resistance to bacterial pathogens and for counteracting xenotoxic stress, with genetic dependence on the NSY‑1/SEK‑1/PMK‑1 cascade (Frontiers in Immunology, Apr 2023; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003; Nature Communications, May 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8).
- Neuronal roles: TIR‑1 has long been linked genetically to neuronal development/behavior under the synonym nsy‑2, but recent 2023–2024 evidence in our dataset focuses primarily on intestinal immunity; nevertheless, C. elegans reviews and disease‑modeling articles note that tir‑1 perturbations can modulate neuronal phenotypes in neurodegeneration models, consistent with conserved SARM1‑family roles in neurons (Frontiers in Neuroscience, Jan 2024; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2023.1300705) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).

Synthesis and outlook
- The current understanding converges on TIR‑1 as an enzymatic guard localized on LRO membranes whose assembly state encodes pathogen effector and organelle‑stress information into NADase activation to trigger p38 innate immunity. Recent 2023–2024 work defines a concrete cell biological mechanism—effector‑triggered LRO alkalinization/condensation → TIR‑1 puncta → PMK‑1 activation—and reveals organelle integrity proteins that restrain toxic immune propagation, offering new genetic entry points for dissecting SARM1/TIR‑1 control (bioRxiv, Dec 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.04.569946; Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 31-33, tsekang2023activationofintestinal pages 1-6, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 7-8, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 3-5).
- Cross-kingdom considerations suggest a conserved paradigm where TIR proteins undergo substrate/ligand‑assisted condensation or higher‑order self‑assembly to potentiate NADase activity, reinforcing the relevance of protein‑condensation therapeutics for SARM1 (Cell Reports, Sep 2024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2024.114674) (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).

Limitations and open questions
- Quantitative enzymology (kcat, product ratios) for endogenous ceTIR‑1 in vivo is limited in the 2023–2024 sources accessed here; future work resolving specific NADase reaction products and kinetics in C. elegans tissues will refine mechanistic models (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 1-3, tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).
- While neuronal roles of tir‑1/nsy‑2 are well supported historically, recent primary data in 2023–2024 within this evidence set emphasize intestinal immunity; targeted updates from dedicated neuronal studies would strengthen behavioral annotations (tsekang2024lysosomerelatedorganelleintegrity pages 17-18).
