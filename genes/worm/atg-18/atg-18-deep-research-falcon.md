# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O16466
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Autophagy-related protein 18 {ECO:0000305};
- **Gene Information:** Name=atg-18 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F41E6.13a}; Synonyms=atgr-18 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F41E6.13a}, tag-283 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F41E6.13a}; ORFNames=F41E6.13 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:F41E6.13a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the WD repeat PROPPIN family. .
- **Key Domains:** PROPPIN. (IPR048720); WD40/YVTN_repeat-like_dom_sf. (IPR015943); WD40_repeat_dom_sf. (IPR036322); WD40_rpt. (IPR001680); PROPPIN (PF21032)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "atg-18" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'atg-18' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **atg-18** (gene ID: atg-18, UniProt: O16466) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan overview
- Verified identity: C. elegans atg-18 (UniProt O16466) encodes a PROPPIN/WD-repeat β-propeller protein in the WIPI/ATG18 family, consistent with the provided UniProt domains (WD40, PROPPIN). Evidence summarized below supports FRRG/LRRG phosphoinositide-binding sites, seven-bladed β-propeller architecture, and conserved roles in early autophagy membranes. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26, gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report: atg-18 (O16466) in C. elegans
1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and family: ATG-18 is a PROPPIN (β-propeller that binds polyphosphoinositides), a member of the WIPI/ATG18 family that recognizes PI3P-enriched membranes via conserved F/LRRG (FRRG) motifs residing on blades 5–6 of the seven‑bladed β‑propeller. These motifs confer phosphoinositide binding central to recruitment to early autophagic membranes (omegasomes/phagophores). Publication details: EMBO Reports, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00215-5 (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2). Additional structural/biochemical context from cross-species PROPPIN literature: WIPI/ATG18 proteins possess two binding sites; blade 6 contributes a hydrophobic loop whose amphipathic helix aids membrane insertion. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26, gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2)
- Canonical binding specificity: PROPPINs are effectors of VPS34-produced PI3P and also show binding to PI(3,5)P2; site 2 (blade 6) is particularly important for PI(3,5)P2 recognition. These biochemical features underpin localization to PI3P-rich omegasomes and potentially endolysosomal compartments where PI(3,5)P2 is enriched. Source and date: Thesis summary of primary literature (Jan 2020; URL: https://doi.org/10.17863/cam.47731). (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26)
- Complex formation with ATG-2: ATG-18 family proteins physically and functionally pair with ATG-2. The ATG2–WIPI/ATG18 complex tethers membranes and promotes bulk lipid transfer to expand the phagophore. ATG2 can bind and transfer ~20 lipid molecules per molecule in vitro; curvature sensitivity and WIPI-dependent tethering of larger vesicles (>140 nm) have been reported (cross-species). (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 26-30)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 priority)
- ULK1-dependent phospho-regulation of WIPI/PROPPIN membrane association: In 2024, Gubas et al. defined that mammalian WIPI2b is directly phosphorylated by ULK1 at S284 and S68, modulating ATG16L1 binding and membrane association via an amphipathic helix in the 6CD loop. Phospho-mimic S284D reduced membrane binding and autophagosome formation; S284A increased association. Though shown for WIPI2b, the mechanistic principles (FRRG-mediated PI3P recognition, amphipathic helix-assisted insertion, upstream kinase control) generalize to PROPPINs, informing hypotheses for C. elegans ATG‑18 regulation at phagophores. EMBO Reports, Aug 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s44319-024-00215-5. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 9-11, gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2)
- Quantitative findings from 2024 study: phospho-site functional data included significant changes in WIPI2 puncta and LC3 lipidation (e.g., WT vs S68A P = 0.0079; WT vs S68D P = 0.0002; LC3-II quantification n=3 with P values 0.0376 and 0.01), reinforcing that PROPPIN phosphorylation tunes early autophagosome assembly. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 9-11)
- Contemporary context (2020s) for PROPPIN architecture and binding: FRRG/LRRG dual PIP-binding sites and hydrophobic loop/helix functions across PROPPINs consolidate a conserved biophysical model of recruitment: electrostatics and helix insertion precede PI3P-dependent retention. These mechanisms are consistent with ATG‑18 family roles at omegasomes and fit structural mapping of Atg2-binding and lipid-binding faces on opposite sides of the propeller. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Functional inference to nematode autophagy: In worms, WIPI/PROPPIN family genetics define early autophagy steps and cargo clearance. epg-6 (worm WIPI4 ortholog) physically interacts with ATG‑2; the EPG‑6–ATG‑2 complex regulates omegasome/phagophore growth and the distribution of ATG‑9 and ATG‑13. Mutants show enlarged or abnormal omegasomes and unclosed isolation membranes, with altered LGG-1 puncta formation; starvation survival is reduced (e.g., L1 survival: ~13 days wild-type vs ~3 days epg-6 mutants), illustrating physiological impact of PROPPIN-mediated early autophagosome biogenesis. While centered on EPG‑6, these implementations map onto the conserved ATG‑2–WIPI/ATG18 axis that includes ATG‑18. (sultana2019parallelfunctionof pages 42-47)
- Genetic epistasis in C. elegans: Cross-species and worm epistasis analyses summarized in 2020 indicate that atg-18, atg-2, atg-9, and core conjugation genes act upstream of epg-6 in autophagosome formation, with atg‑18 loss reducing autophagosome number and epg‑6 loss causing autophagosome accumulation. These relationships position atg‑18 in early membrane supply/expansion and ATG9 retrieval, aligning with PROPPIN functions. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 18-21)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Family-level synthesis places ATG‑18 (worm) closest to the WIPI1/2 subgroup in function: Atg18 orthologs are key PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 effectors coupling ATG2-mediated lipid transfer to phagophore growth and Atg9 recycling. Structural mapping supports simultaneous PI binding and ATG2 interaction on opposite propeller faces. These expert-compiled conclusions derive from integrative analyses of structural, biochemical, and genetic data and are widely used to interpret nematode ATG‑18. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26, zhu2020studiesonthe pages 26-30)
- 2024 expert mechanistic extension: PROPPIN activity is tunable by upstream autophagy kinases (ULK1), modifying both effector binding (e.g., ATG16L1) and membrane residency through an amphipathic helix, providing a framework to probe analogous regulation of C. elegans ATG‑18. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 9-11, gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- WIPI2b phospho-regulation (2024): Quantitative effects on puncta and LC3-II levels (e.g., P = 0.0079, 0.0002; n=3 biological repeats) demonstrate sensitivity of early autophagosome assembly to PROPPIN phosphorylation and helix formation. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 9-11)
- ATG2 lipid-transfer capacity and geometry (cross-species): Each ATG2 molecule can carry ~20 lipids; curvature preferences (<80 nm SUVs vs >140 nm LUVs when complexed with WIPI) elucidate how ATG2–WIPI/ATG18 tethers and supplies lipids to growing phagophores. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 26-30)
- Worm physiology: L1 starvation survival decrement in epg-6 mutants (∼3 days vs ∼13 days wild type) reflects autophagy dependence on the ATG2–WIPI axis; these data exemplify phenotypic magnitudes relevant to ATG‑18 pathway function. (sultana2019parallelfunctionof pages 42-47)

Functional role, localization, and pathway placement for C. elegans ATG‑18
- Primary function: Lipid-binding adapter/effector (not an enzyme) that reads PI3P (and likely PI(3,5)P2) via conserved FRRG/LRRG sites to recruit/retain the ATG2–ATG18 module on early autophagic membranes and to promote phagophore expansion and ATG9 retrieval; this positions ATG‑18 upstream in autophagosome biogenesis. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26, zhu2020studiesonthe pages 26-30)
- Localization: Predicted/observed family behavior places ATG‑18 at PI3P-rich omegasomes/phagophores and potentially endolysosomal compartments where PI(3,5)P2 is enriched; WIPI family proteins are among the earliest factors at nascent autophagic membranes. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2, zhu2020studiesonthe pages 21-26)
- Pathway context: ATG‑18 acts downstream of class III PI3K (VPS34/BEC‑1 complexes generating PI3P), together with ATG2 and the ATG9 trafficking network. Epistasis and genetic interactions in worms place atg‑18 upstream of epg‑6 (WIPI4) and in concert with atg‑2 and atg‑9, consistent with conserved PROPPIN roles in membrane supply and organization before LC3/LGG-1 conjugation. (zhu2020studiesonthe pages 18-21, sultana2019parallelfunctionof pages 42-47)
- Regulatory layer (inferred from PROPPIN advances): ULK1-family kinase control of PROPPINs via phosphorylation of the amphipathic-helix loop and effector-binding segments likely tunes ATG‑18 membrane residence and partner interactions in worms, as shown for mammalian WIPI2b in 2024. This is a strong, mechanistically grounded hypothesis for C. elegans ATG‑18 regulation. (gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 9-11, gubas2024wipi2brecruitmentto pages 1-2)

Notes on symbol/organism verification and ambiguity
- The target herein is atg‑18 from Caenorhabditis elegans (UniProt O16466), a PROPPIN/WD repeat protein. All interpretations and generalizations adhere to WIPI/ATG18 family mechanisms and worm-specific genetic context when available. No claims are made for similarly named genes in other organisms.

Limitations and gaps
- Direct 2023–2024 publications on C. elegans atg‑18 per se were not captured in the current evidence set; therefore, some mechanistic updates (ULK1-dependent regulation, amphipathic helix control) are extrapolated from highly conserved WIPI/PROPPIN studies (mammalian), which are appropriate given family conservation but may require targeted worm experiments for confirmation.
