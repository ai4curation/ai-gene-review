description: ATG-18 is a PROPPIN (beta-propeller that binds 
  polyphosphoinositides) family protein and WD40 repeat-containing autophagy 
  factor. It functions as a PI3P/PI4P/PI5P/PI(3,5)P2 effector that is recruited 
  to early autophagic membranes (omegasomes/phagophores) via its conserved FRRG 
  motif. ATG-18 plays a distinct role from EPG-6 (WIPI4 ortholog) in 
  autophagosome formation and is required for degradation of protein aggregates,
  apoptotic cell clearance, xenophagy, and various selective autophagy 
  processes. It acts as a phosphoinositide-binding adapter that promotes 
  phagosome maturation and RAB-5 recruitment during apoptotic cell corpse 
  degradation in phagocytes.

core_functions:
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0032266
    label: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding
  description: ATG-18 is a PROPPIN family phosphoinositide effector that binds 
    PI3P (and other phosphoinositides including PI4P, PI5P, and PI(3,5)P2) via 
    its conserved FRRG motif (amino acids 227-230). This PI3P binding is 
    essential for recruitment to early autophagic membranes 
    (phagophores/omegasomes) and phagosomes, and is absolutely required for its 
    function in autophagy and cell corpse clearance. The RR->KK mutation 
    abolishes binding and function (PMID:21802374, PMID:22451698).
- molecular_function:
    id: GO:0030674
    label: protein-macromolecule adaptor activity
  description: ATG-18 functions as an adaptor/effector that bridges 
    PI3P-containing membranes to downstream autophagy machinery. Its WD40 repeat
    beta-propeller structure provides binding surfaces for both 
    phosphoinositides and protein partners. In phagocytosis, ATG-18 is 
    co-recruited with RAB-5 and is required for efficient RAB-5/RAB-7 
    recruitment and phagosome maturation (PMID:22451698).

suggested_questions:
- question: What are the specific protein partners that ATG-18 recruits or 
    interacts with at the phagophore assembly site in C. elegans, beyond the 
    known ATG-2 interaction? Human WIPI2 recruits ATG16L1 to phagophores. The C.
    elegans ATG-18 interaction partners for recruiting the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 
    conjugation complex are not fully characterized.
- question: Does ATG-18 have distinct functions from EPG-6 (WIPI4 ortholog) 
    beyond their different roles in autophagosome biogenesis? Lu et al. 2011 
    established that ATG-18 and EPG-6 have distinct roles, but the molecular 
    basis for this specificity is not fully understood.
suggested_experiments:
- description: Systematic identification of ATG-18 interacting proteins using 
    co-immunoprecipitation or proximity labeling approaches to identify effector
    binding partners. While PI binding is well characterized, the protein 
    interaction network of C. elegans ATG-18 is incomplete compared to mammalian
    WIPI proteins.
- description: Live imaging of ATG-18 dynamics at nascent autophagosomes to 
    determine temporal relationship with ATG-2, ATG-9, and conjugation 
    machinery. Understanding the precise ordering of ATG-18 recruitment relative
    to other autophagy factors would clarify its mechanistic role.
