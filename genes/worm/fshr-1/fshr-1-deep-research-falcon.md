## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** L8EC40
- **Protein Description:** SubName: Full=G-protein coupled receptors family 1 profile domain-containing protein {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCQ25711.1};
- **Gene Information:** Name=fshr-1 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCQ25711.1, ECO:0000313|WormBase:C50H2.1b}; ORFNames=C50H2.1 {ECO:0000313|WormBase:C50H2.1b}, CELE_C50H2.1 {ECO:0000313|EMBL:CCQ25711.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** GPCR_Rhodpsn. (IPR000276); GPCR_Rhodpsn_7TM. (IPR017452); Gphrmn_rcpt_fam. (IPR002131); Leu-rich_rpt. (IPR001611); LRR_dom_sf. (IPR032675)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "fshr-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'fshr-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **fshr-1** (gene ID: fshr-1, UniProt: L8EC40) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans fshr-1 (C50H2.1; UniProt L8EC40)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Gene/protein identity and family: fshr-1 (locus C50H2.1) encodes FSHR-1, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing, rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is the sole LGR-type, LRR-containing GPCR in C. elegans identified in an RNAi-based screen of LRR receptors for pathogen susceptibility phenotypes (publication: Feb 2009; URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813048106) (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 2-3, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 1-2).
- Domain architecture and structural features: The extracellular domain contains approximately nine LRRs; the receptor has seven transmembrane helices (7TM) and a large C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, consistent with rhodopsin-like GPCRs (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 2-3).
- Primary biological role: FSHR-1 is required for the innate immune response of C. elegans to multiple bacterial pathogens (Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6).

2) Mechanistic function, pathways, and signaling context
- Pathway relationships: Genetic interaction studies indicate that FSHR-1 signals in parallel to the p38 MAPK pathway (PMK-1) and the insulin/IGF (DAF-2) pathway. Double mutants (e.g., pmk-1; fshr-1) exhibit additive or enhanced pathogen sensitivity, and sets of pathogen-response genes regulated by FSHR-1 and PMK-1 overlap but are not identical, arguing against a simple linear pathway (publication date: Feb 2009; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813048106) (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 1-2).
- Transcriptional responses: In fshr-1 loss-of-function, induction of multiple PA14-response genes is markedly reduced, with several targets showing ≥10-fold lower induction compared to wild type upon PA14 exposure, demonstrating a role in mounting inducible antimicrobial responses rather than maintaining basal expression (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5).
- Ligand knowledge: No endogenous ligand has been defined. C. elegans lacks canonical vertebrate FSH subunits, leading to two broad hypotheses: FSHR-1 could be a noncanonical hormone receptor for an unknown worm ligand or a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-like sensor whose extracellular LRRs detect host- or microbe-derived cues (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6).

3) Cellular and tissue localization
- Tissue expression and site of action: FSHR-1 is expressed in several somatic tissues, most strongly in the intestine and neurons. Functional assays demonstrate that its intestinal activity is necessary and sufficient for pathogen resistance: intestinal-specific RNAi phenocopies systemic knockdown; intestinal expression (ges-1 promoter) rescues the pathogen sensitivity of the fshr-1(ok778) deletion; neuronal expression provides only partial rescue (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4).
- Subcellular localization: Precise apical/basolateral membrane localization in intestinal cells was not resolved in the primary study; consequently, whether FSHR-1 acts as an apical PRR interacting directly with luminal cues, or as a basolateral/systemic receptor responding to endogenous signals remains undetermined (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6).

4) Experimental phenotypes and evidence strength
- Loss-of-function allele and RNAi: The fshr-1(ok778) deletion removes most LRRs and all seven transmembrane regions, behaving as a genetic null. fshr-1(ok778) mutants show increased sensitivity to PA14, S. aureus, and E. faecalis in bacterial killing assays, without shortened lifespan on nonpathogenic E. coli OP50, indicating a specific defect in pathogen resistance rather than general debility (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 2-3, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 6-6).
- Rescue and sufficiency: Transgenic rescue with a genomic fragment or an intestinal ges-1::fshr-1 construct restores pathogen resistance to wild-type levels; neuronal ric-19::fshr-1 expression confers only partial rescue, supporting a primary intestinal role (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 6-6, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5).
- Pathway genetics: pmk-1; fshr-1 double mutants and combinations with upstream p38 components (tir-1, nsy-1) show additive/enhanced sensitivity, reinforcing that FSHR-1 does not lie upstream of PMK-1 but in a parallel pathway converging on antimicrobial gene regulation (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 6-6).

5) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 emphasis)
- Literature availability: Using the available tools, no additional peer-reviewed sources from 2023–2024 focusing specifically on C. elegans fshr-1 could be retrieved. The foundational Powell et al., 2009 PNAS study remains the primary, authoritative source defining FSHR-1’s role in innate immunity, intestinal site of action, and parallel signaling with PMK-1 and DAF-2 (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 1-2, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4). We note this as a limitation and encourage checking WormBase/UniProt release notes and recent reviews for updates beyond the scope of the retrieved evidence.

6) Applications and real-world implementations
- Conceptual and methodological applications: FSHR-1 serves as a model to study LRR-containing GPCRs (LGRs) as potential PRR-like sensors in barrier tissues. The intestinally-acting, LRR-bearing GPCR paradigm illustrates how animals without canonical TLRs in key contexts can deploy alternative receptor families to detect and orchestrate defense, providing a framework for comparative immunology and for designing genetic screens for barrier defense GPCRs in other organisms (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 1-2, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6).

7) Expert opinions and analysis from the primary source
- Interpretive conclusions by the authors: The authors propose that FSHR-1 promotes innate immune responses by enhancing inducible antimicrobial gene expression and that it may function either as a PRR-like sensor or a noncanonical hormone receptor; pathway genetics place it in parallel to PMK-1/p38 and DAF-2/insulin signaling (Feb 2009; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813048106) (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5).

8) Quantitative data and statistics
- Domain count: ~9 extracellular LRRs; 7 transmembrane helices (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 2-3).
- Transcriptional effects: Multiple PA14-response genes show ≥10-fold reduced induction in fshr-1(ok778) compared to wild type following pathogen exposure (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 3-4).
- Pathogen spectrum and phenotype: Increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa PA14 (Gram-negative), S. aureus, and E. faecalis (Gram-positive) in survival assays; no reduced lifespan on E. coli OP50 under nonpathogenic conditions (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 2-3).

9) Open questions
- Endogenous ligand(s) remain unidentified; mechanistic placement relative to cell-surface vs systemic cues is unresolved. Subcellular localization in intestine and any neuron-to-intestine regulatory axis require further clarification (powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 5-6, powell2009thegproteincoupled pages 4-5).
