description: FSHR-1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with leucine-rich 
  repeats in its extracellular domain that functions in the C. elegans intestine
  as an essential component of the innate immune response. Unlike its mammalian 
  FSHR ortholog which responds to follicle-stimulating hormone, FSHR-1 has been 
  repurposed in C. elegans to detect and respond to infection and oxidative 
  damage. FSHR-1 signals in parallel to the p38 MAPK pathway to activate 
  transcription of antimicrobial effectors and oxidative stress response genes 
  (including gcs-1). It is required for defense against diverse pathogens 
  including Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Gram-positive 
  bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and fungal pathogens 
  (Candida albicans). FSHR-1 also mediates survival of oxidative stress 
  (paraquat) and heavy metal stress (cadmium), but not thermal stress. 
  Additionally, FSHR-1 is required for learned aversive behavior toward 
  pathogens. The broad specificity of response suggests FSHR-1 acts as an 
  indirect sensor of infection, possibly detecting host damage-associated 
  molecular patterns rather than pathogen molecular patterns directly.

    review:
      summary: FSHR-1 is a multi-pass transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 
        localized to the plasma membrane. UniProt annotations indicate Cell 
        membrane localization. The IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic 
        inference from mammalian FSHR orthologs which are established plasma 
        membrane receptors.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: The plasma membrane localization is consistent with FSHR-1 being a
        GPCR that functions in intestinal cells to sense and respond to 
        pathogens and stress. Intestinal expression of fshr-1 rescues the 
        pathogen sensitivity phenotype (PMID:26360906). The seven transmembrane 
        domains predicted in UniProt support plasma membrane localization.

    evidence_type: IBA
    original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
    review:
      summary: The IBA annotation infers adenylate cyclase-activating GPCR 
        signaling based on phylogenetic relationships with mammalian 
        glycoprotein hormone receptors (FSHR, TSHR, LHCGR) which canonically 
        couple to Gs and activate adenylate cyclase. While FSHR-1 is 
        structurally related to these receptors, direct evidence for 
        cAMP/adenylate cyclase activation in C. elegans FSHR-1 signaling is 
        limited.
      action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
      reason: The annotation is phylogenetically reasonable based on FSHR-1 
        belonging to the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. However, the core
        function of FSHR-1 in C. elegans appears to be immune signaling rather 
        than hormone response. The downstream signaling mechanism in C. elegans 
        has not been fully characterized, and FSHR-1 signals in parallel to p38 
        MAPK pathway (PMID:19196974). Keep as non-core since the precise 
        signaling mechanism in worms may differ from mammals.

    review:
      summary: This IBA annotation is based on phylogenetic inference from 
        mammalian FSH receptor, which mediates follicle-stimulating hormone 
        signaling. However, there is no evidence that FSHR-1 functions in 
        hormone signaling in C. elegans.
      action: REMOVE
      reason: While FSHR-1 is structurally related to mammalian hormone 
        receptors, its characterized function in C. elegans is in innate 
        immunity and stress response, not hormone signaling. C. elegans lacks 
        the gonadotropin hormones (FSH, LH, TSH) present in vertebrates. The 
        publications (PMID:19196974, PMID:26360906) characterize FSHR-1 
        exclusively as an immune/stress response regulator. This annotation 
        represents phylogenetic over-extension of function that does not apply 
        to C. elegans.

    review:
      summary: The IBA annotation infers peptide receptor activity based on

        ligand for FSHR-1 in C. elegans has not been identified.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: FSHR-1 is a GPCR but its ligand in C. elegans is unknown. The term
        "G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity" implies binding to a 
        peptide ligand, which is unconfirmed. Given that FSHR-1 may detect 
        damage-associated molecular patterns or other infection-related signals 
        rather than peptide hormones, the more general term "G protein-coupled 
        receptor activity" is more appropriate. The ligand could be a DAMP or 
        stress signal rather than a peptide.

          LRR-containing TLRs and NLRs, we propose that FSHR-1 is an indirect 
          sensor of infection

        supporting_text: We screened all LRR-containing transmembrane receptors 
          in C. elegans and identified the G protein-coupled receptor FSHR-1 as 
          an important component of the C. elegans immune response to 
          Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens

          infection response genes in infected worms and delays accumulation of 
          the ingested pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa

      activation of detoxification genes including gcs-1, protecting the host 
      from ROS damage during infection and from exogenous oxidative stressors.

  - question: What is the endogenous ligand for FSHR-1 in C. elegans? Does it 
      bind a DAMP, pathogen-derived molecule, or host peptide?
    experts:
      - GPCR pharmacologists
      - C. elegans innate immunity researchers
  - question: How does FSHR-1 signal to activate gene expression - what G 
      protein subunits are involved?

      - GPCR signaling specialists
      - C. elegans signaling researchers
  - question: What is the relationship between FSHR-1 and the p38 MAPK/pmk-1 
      pathway at the molecular level?
    experts:
      - C. elegans immunity researchers
      - MAPK signaling specialists
  - question: Does FSHR-1 have any function in reproduction or development given
      its sequence similarity to mammalian FSH receptor?

suggested_experiments:
  - experiment_type: Biochemical ligand identification
    description: Identify FSHR-1 ligand through biochemical purification or 
      receptor-ligand screens using infected worm extracts or 
      pathogen-conditioned media
    hypothesis: FSHR-1 binds a damage-associated molecular pattern or host 
      stress signal rather than a peptide hormone
  - experiment_type: G protein coupling analysis
    description: Determine G protein coupling specificity using mutant analysis 
      of Gs, Gq, and other G protein subunits in combination with fshr-1
    hypothesis: FSHR-1 couples to specific G protein subunits to activate immune
      gene expression
  - experiment_type: ROS sensing analysis
    description: Investigate potential role of FSHR-1 in detecting reactive 
      oxygen species or lipid peroxidation products as DAMPs
    hypothesis: FSHR-1 senses oxidative damage caused by infection rather than 
      pathogen molecules directly
  - experiment_type: Tissue-specific RNAi
    description: Test whether FSHR-1 functions in other tissues besides 
      intestine using tissue-specific RNAi or rescue
    hypothesis: FSHR-1 function is restricted to the intestine where it 
      encounters ingested pathogens
