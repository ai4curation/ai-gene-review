description: MEG-2 (Maternal Effect Germ cell defective 2) is a highly intrinsically
  disordered protein (87% disordered residues) that localizes to P granules during
  C. elegans embryogenesis. It functions redundantly with MEG-1 to regulate P granule
  dynamics through phase separation mechanisms. MEG-2 has an acidic predicted pI of
  6.04 and a serine-rich N-terminus characteristic of MEG proteins. Phosphorylation
  of MEG-1/2 by kinase MBK-2 promotes P granule disassembly in the anterior cytoplasm,
  while dephosphorylation by PP2A promotes P granule assembly in the posterior. This
  asymmetric regulation ensures proper segregation of P granules to the germline during
  early embryonic divisions. Loss of meg-2 in combination with meg-1 causes sterility
  and P granule mis-segregation to somatic blastomeres.

  review:
    summary: High-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen identified interaction between
      MEG-2 and EYA-1 (O17670). The publication describes a large-scale interactome
      mapping effort detecting over 4000 interactions. While the interaction may be
      real, the generic 'protein binding' term provides no functional insight. No
      specific functional context for this interaction is established in the literature.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: The 'protein binding' term is uninformative as a GO annotation per curation
      guidelines. High-throughput Y2H interactions without validation or functional
      characterization should not be annotated with this generic term. The MEG-2/EYA-1
      interaction has no established biological significance in germline development
      or P granule function.

  review:
    summary: This is from a second high-throughput yeast two-hybrid mapping effort
      (Worm Interactome 2007). The publication describes quality-controlled protein-protein
      interaction mapping detecting the same MEG-2/EYA-1 interaction. While the interaction
      was detected in two independent screens, no functional context is established.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Same rationale as the previous annotation - 'protein binding' is uninformative
      and does not capture any specific molecular function. The duplicate annotation
      from a related interactome study adds no additional functional information.
      If a more specific binding function were established (e.g., specific role in
      P granule assembly), a more informative MF term should be used.

  review:
    summary: Well-supported annotation based on genetic interaction evidence. Wang
      et al. (2014) demonstrated that MEG-1 and MEG-2 are required for P granule dynamics
      in embryos. The publication shows that phosphorylation of MEG proteins by MBK-2/DYRK
      kinase promotes granule disassembly in the anterior cytoplasm (PMID:25535836).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures a core molecular function of MEG-2.
      The IGI evidence from PMID:25535836 demonstrates that simultaneous loss of meg-1
      and meg-2 causes defects in P granule disassembly, with P granules failing to
      disassemble properly in the anterior cytoplasm of the P1 blastomere.

  review:
    summary: Cellular component annotation demonstrating MEG-2 localization to P granules
      during embryogenesis. Leacock and Reinke (2008) showed that MEG-1 and MEG-2
      are embryo-specific P granule components that localize to P granules from the
      4-8 cell stage through subsequent P cell divisions (PMID:18202375).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core cellular localization for MEG-2. The IDA evidence from
      direct observation of MEG-2 localization to P granules in embryos is well-established.
      MEG-2 is one of the defining embryo-specific components of P granules.

  review:
    summary: Proposed new annotation based on evidence from Wang et al. (2014) showing
      that dephosphorylated MEG-1/MEG-2 promotes P granule assembly in the posterior
      cytoplasm. The literature establishes a dual role for MEG proteins in both assembly
      and disassembly depending on phosphorylation state.
    action: NEW
    reason: 'The existing annotations only capture the disassembly function, but MEG-2
      also has a documented role in promoting P granule assembly when dephosphorylated.
      UniProt annotation states: "Together with dephosphorylated meg-1, promotes the
      assembly and accumulation of zygotic P granules in the posterior cytoplasm of
      pre-gastrulation embryos."'

  review:
    summary: MEG-2 regulates overall P granule organization through its role in controlling
      both assembly and disassembly dynamics. This is more general than the specific
      assembly/disassembly terms and captures the full scope of MEG-2 function.
    action: NEW
    reason: P granule organization (GO:0030719) is the parent term that encompasses
      both assembly and disassembly. MEG-2 participates in both processes depending
      on phosphorylation state, making this term an appropriate annotation.
