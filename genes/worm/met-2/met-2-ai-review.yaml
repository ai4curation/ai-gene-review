description: MET-2 is the principal H3K9 mono- and dimethyltransferase in C. elegans,
  homologous to mammalian SETDB1. It catalyzes the sequential addition of one or two
  methyl groups to lysine 9 of histone H3 using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl
  donor, producing H3K9me1 and H3K9me2. MET-2-mediated H3K9 methylation is essential
  for heterochromatin formation, perinuclear chromatin anchoring, and transcriptional
  silencing of repetitive elements and developmental genes. The protein functions
  in a complex with LIN-65 (an ATF7IP homolog that mediates nuclear import and focus
  formation) and ARLE-14 (which stabilizes chromatin association). MET-2 has both
  catalytic and noncatalytic roles in gene silencing; even catalytically inactive
  MET-2 can form foci and maintain some repression by constraining histone acetylation.
  The enzyme primes chromatin for SET-25-mediated H3K9 trimethylation and is required
  for multiple developmental processes including vulval cell fate specification, meiotic
  sex chromosome inactivation, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: MET-2 negatively regulates gene expression through H3K9 methylation-mediated
      heterochromatin formation. Multiple studies demonstrate that MET-2 represses
      transcription of lin-3 EGF (PMID:17634190), genes on the X chromosome during
      MSCI (PMID:21909284), and subtype-specific neuronal genes (PMID:24348272). The
      IBA annotation based on phylogenetic inference is well-supported by experimental
      evidence.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This annotation accurately captures a core function of MET-2. As an H3K9
      methyltransferase, MET-2 deposits repressive chromatin marks that silence gene
      expression. This is supported by multiple experimental studies in C. elegans.

      MET-2-dependent H3K9me2 is required for perinuclear anchoring of heterochromatin

  review:
    summary: This annotation is inferred from the MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain)
      present in MET-2. However, MET-2's primary substrate is histone H3, not DNA
      directly. While the MBD domain may contribute to chromatin targeting, there
      is no direct experimental evidence for sequence-specific DNA binding activity.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: The IEA annotation based on InterPro MBD domain is technically accurate
      as MET-2 contains an MBD domain (IPR001739), but DNA binding is not the primary
      or core function. MET-2 functions as a histone methyltransferase and its chromatin
      targeting involves protein-protein interactions with LIN-65 and ARLE-14 rather

      and biochemical specificity. SETDB1-family proteins are H3K9-specific methyltransferases.
      The observed H3K36me3 phenotype in met-2 mutants is more likely an indirect

  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:21437264
  review:
    summary: Koester-Eiserfunke & Fischle demonstrated that MET-2 functions in vulval
      cell fate determination through H3K9 methylation. LIN-61 acts with HPL-2 and
      MET-2 in this pathway. Double mutants between lin-61 and met-2 show enhanced
      vulval defects.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: Vulval development is a well-studied context for MET-2 function, but this
      is a tissue-specific manifestation of the general gene silencing function rather
      than a core function of the protein.

  review:
    summary: Andersen & Horvitz showed that MET-2 represses lin-3 EGF transcription.
      Genetic interactions demonstrate that met-1 and met-2 act redundantly with HP1
      homologs to repress transcription.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct evidence for transcriptional repression function. This is more
      specific than the general "negative regulation of gene expression" and captures
      the mechanism of action.

  review:
    summary: MET-2 negatively regulates vulval development by repressing lin-3 EGF
      expression. Genetic interactions with HP1 homologs and NuRD complex components
      support this role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While experimentally validated with strong genetic evidence, vulval development
      regulation is a tissue-specific phenotype resulting from MET-2's general function
      in transcriptional repression rather than a core function.

    action: NEW
    reason: This specific enzymatic activity is a core molecular function of MET-2

  description: MET-2 is the principal H3K9 mono- and dimethyltransferase in C. elegans,
    homologous to mammalian SETDB1. It catalyzes sequential addition of methyl groups
    to H3K9 using SAM as methyl donor. This is supported by genetic evidence (met-2
