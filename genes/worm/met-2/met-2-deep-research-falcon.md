## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P34544
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase met-2; EC=2.1.1.- {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22939621}; EC=2.1.1.367 {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22939621};
- **Gene Information:** Name=met-2; ORFNames=R05D3.11;
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the class V-like SAM-binding methyltransferase
- **Key Domains:** DNA-bd_dom_sf. (IPR016177); Methyl_CpG_DNA-bd. (IPR001739); Post-SET_dom. (IPR003616); Pre-SET_dom. (IPR007728); SET_dom. (IPR001214)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "met-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'met-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **met-2** (gene ID: met-2, UniProt: P34544) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Identity check: We confirm the target is C. elegans met-2 (UniProt P34544), encoding a SET domain class V-like SAM-dependent histone-lysine N-methyltransferase homologous to vertebrate SETDB1/SETDB2. Literature consistently assigns MET-2 as the principal H3K9 mono- and di-methyltransferase in C. elegans embryos; SET-25 catalyzes H3K9 trimethylation. Key cofactors LIN-65 (ATF7IP-like) and ARLE-14 (ARL14EP-like) modulate MET-2 localization and chromatin association. These features align with the UniProt family and domain annotations (Pre-SET/SET/Post-SET) and with conserved SETDB biology. We find no conflicting use of the symbol “met-2” that would suggest a different gene in C. elegans. (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2, padeken2022establishmentofh3k9methylated pages 2-3, jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4, delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)

Comprehensive research report
1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Enzymatic identity and reaction: MET-2 is the C. elegans SETDB1-like histone methyltransferase that deposits H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 in vivo, using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as methyl donor. SET-25 performs most H3K9me3 deposition. This division of labor is supported by genetic and biochemical evidence in worms and is consistent with conserved SETDB1 functions in other animals. (jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4, padeken2022establishmentofh3k9methylated pages 2-3)
  • Jash & Csankovszki (2024, review; DNA 4(1):64–83; published Feb 2024) summarize that MET-2 deposits H3K9me1/2 and SET-25 deposits H3K9me3 in C. elegans embryos; they compile multiple primary studies supporting this model. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/dna4010004 (jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4)
  • Padeken, Methot & Gasser (2022, review; Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 23:623–640; May 2022) discuss conserved H3K9 HMT modules and note worm MET-2’s SETDB-like features and partners; SET-25 catalyzes H3K9me3 including de novo nucleation via small-RNA pathways. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-022-00483-w (padeken2022establishmentofh3k9methylated pages 2-3)
- Substrate specificity: In embryos, H3K9me2 rises sharply at gastrulation with MET-2 nuclear accumulation; H3K9me1 rises modestly; H3K9me3 also increases but is largely SET-25–dependent downstream of MET-2 priming. Quantitation by Mutlu et al. shows ~10-fold H3K9me2 increase between ~20–50 and 51–100 cell stages, ~2-fold H3K9me1, and ~6-fold H3K9me3, linking MET-2 activity to heterochromatin onset. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aat6224 (Aug 2018) (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2)
- Biological role: H3K9 methylation marks heterochromatin at repeats/transposons and lineage-restricted genes, promoting transcriptional silencing, nuclear lamina association, and normal development. MET-2-dependent H3K9me2 is crucial for perinuclear anchoring; SET-25-mediated H3K9me3 is not strictly required for lamina tethering. URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201811038 (Mar 2019) (delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Developmental timing via XOL-1→MET-2 axis (2024): Jash et al. (PLOS Genetics; Aug 15, 2024) show that the sex-determination factor XOL-1, although low in hermaphrodites, regulates embryonic developmental timing and dosage compensation by modulating MET-2. Loss of xol-1 causes increased MET-2 expression and altered H3K9me2/3 in 20–100 cell embryos; met-2;xol-1 double mutants partially or fully reverse several accelerated-development phenotypes and precocious DCC loading. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011238 (jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 3-5, jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 15-17)
  • Quantitative highlights: H3K9me2/H3 levels significantly increase in xol-1 embryos at 20–50 cell (p=2.9×10−6) and 50–100 cell (p=4.2×10−14); H3K9me3 also increases (p=6.1×10−7 at 50–100 cells), and timing phenotypes (8-cell→bean, bean→2-fold transitions) are delayed toward WT when met-2 is removed in the xol-1 background. (jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 15-17)
- H3K9me readers in lifespan/aging (2023): Hou et al. (Nature Communications; Mar 2023) systematically map chromodomain proteins and identify CEC-5 as an H3K9me1/2 reader whose chromatin association requires MET-2 and H3K9me1/2 at a substantial fraction of sites; both MET-2 and CEC-5 are required for normal lifespan. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36898-y (hou2023systematiccharacterizationof pages 8-11)
  • Imaging/ChIP data show that met-2 mutation disrupts CEC-5 puncta and reduces CEC-5 binding at 779/3558 peaks enriched for H3K9me2; set-25 loss alone has minimal impact on these CEC-5 sites. (hou2023systematiccharacterizationof pages 8-11)
- Updated perspectives on embryonic chromatin organization (2024): Jash & Csankovszki review (Feb 2024) integrate MET-2’s nuclear hub formation with lamina tethering and the timing of heterochromatin onset; they emphasize LIN-65–mediated nuclear import and ARLE-14–mediated chromatin association, and note temperature/S-phase influences on MET-2 nuclear accumulation. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/dna4010004 (jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Temporal control of heterochromatin via MET-2 nuclear targeting: Mutlu et al. (2018) demonstrate that enforced nuclear accumulation of MET-2 leads to precocious H3K9 methylation and early heterochromatin domain formation, identifying a lever to time epigenome transitions during embryogenesis. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aat6224 (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 8-9, mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2)
  • Quantitative kinetics: nuclear MET-2 accumulation correlates with linear H3K9me2 increase; wild-type slopes vs arle-14 mutants show attenuated accumulation (e.g., 1–20 to 51–100 cells: slope ~0.41 WT vs ~0.15 arle-14), indicating ARLE-14’s role in chromatin engagement kinetics. (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 8-9)
- Nuclear lamina/heterochromatin anchoring readouts: Delaney et al. (2019) use LEM-2 ChIP-seq, FISH, and reporters to show that met-2 loss abolishes peripheral association of autosomal arms whereas set-25 loss largely retains arm-periphery enrichment—implicating MET-2/H3K9me2 in perinuclear organization used as a cellular readout for heterochromatin integrity under stress or genetic perturbation. URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201811038 (delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)
- Noncatalytic MET-2 function as a tool: Delaney et al. (2022) engineered a catalytically deficient MET-2 allele (C1237A; met-2-CD) that still forms LIN-65–dependent foci and partially maintains gene silencing and developmental fitness; this tool separates catalytic from structural roles for mechanistic dissection. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-021-00712-4 (Jan 2022) (delaney2022setdb1likemet2promotes pages 4-5)
- Lifespan and chromodomain reporters: Hou et al. (2023) CRISPR-tagged chromodomain factors including CEC-5, enabling in vivo readouts of heterochromatin states sensitive to MET-2 and SUMOylation; platform applicable to aging and stress studies. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36898-y (hou2023systematiccharacterizationof pages 8-11)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Conserved SETDB modules and reader/writer logic: Padeken et al. (2022) emphasize that MET-2 (worm SETDB1-like) associates with ATF7IP-like LIN-65 and ARLE-14, paralleling vertebrate SETDB1 with ATF7IP/KAP1/HP1. They highlight H3K9me1 as a priming state for SUV39-family H3K9me2/3 and the role of readers (HP1-like HPL-2; CEC-4/CEC-5) in chromatin compaction and nuclear architecture. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-022-00483-w (padeken2022establishmentofh3k9methylated pages 2-3)
- Developmental timing of heterochromatin: Mutlu et al. (2018) provide a widely cited mechanistic framework: MET-2’s regulated nuclear accumulation establishes the onset of heterochromatin domains, with LIN-65 rate-limiting for nuclear entry and ARLE-14 stabilizing chromatin association. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aat6224 (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2, mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 8-9)
- Nuclear lamina tethering: Delaney et al. (2019) argue MET-2/H3K9me2 is essential for perinuclear anchoring of autosomal arms, whereas H3K9me3 is dispensable for this specific architectural feature—refining the functional map of H3K9 states. URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201811038 (delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)
- 2024 synthesis: Jash & Csankovszki (2024) incorporate new developmental regulators (e.g., XOL-1) and physiological variables (temperature, S-phase) into the MET-2 timing model, underscoring system-level control. URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/dna4010004 (jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4)

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent and foundational studies
- H3K9 dynamics at gastrulation (Mutlu 2018, Sci Adv): ~10× increase in H3K9me2 (with MET-2 hubs), ~2× H3K9me1, ~6× H3K9me3 between ~20–50 and 51–100 cell stages; MET-2/LIN-65/ARLE-14 move from cytosol to nuclear hubs with development. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aat6224 (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2)
- ARLE-14 effect sizes (Mutlu 2018): Early accumulation slopes of H3K9me2 are reduced in arle-14 mutants (e.g., 1–20→5–20 cells: ~0.11 WT vs ~0.02 arle-14; later 51–100 cells: ~0.41 WT vs ~0.15 arle-14), quantifying its role in MET-2 chromatin association. URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aat6224 (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 8-9)
- Perinuclear tethering dependency (Delaney 2019, JCB): met-2 mutants abolish peripheral enrichment of autosomal arms measured by LEM-2 ChIP-seq and FISH; set-25 mutants retain arm-periphery enrichment, indicating H3K9me2 (not me3) is crucial for lamina association. URL: https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201811038 (delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)
- Noncatalytic MET-2 function (Delaney 2022, NSMB): met-2-CD reduces H3K9me2/3 to met-2Δ levels yet forms normal foci; met-2-CD animals show higher fertility than met-2Δ and maintain silencing at select loci by preventing H3K9/H3K27 acetylation increase. URLs: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-021-00712-4 (delaney2022setdb1likemet2promotes pages 4-5)
- XOL-1→MET-2 developmental timing (Jash 2024, PLOS Genet): xol-1 null elevates H3K9me2/3 in staged embryos (p-values: 2.9×10−6, 4.2×10−14 for H3K9me2; 6.1×10−7 for H3K9me3) and accelerates development; met-2 loss in xol-1 reverses accelerated transitions (8-cell→bean, bean→2-fold) and reduces precocious DCC loading categories. URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011238 (jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 3-5, jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 15-17)
- H3K9me reader dependence and lifespan (Hou 2023, Nat Commun): CEC-5 puncta require MET-2; 779/3558 CEC-5 ChIP peaks reduced in met-2;set-25 double mutants and met-2 single mutants, but not set-25 alone; MET-2 and CEC-5 are both required for normal lifespan. URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36898-y (hou2023systematiccharacterizationof pages 8-11)

Mechanistic synthesis: function, localization, partners, pathways
- Catalysis and pathway placement: MET-2 lays down H3K9me1/2 that primes and scaffolds heterochromatin formation, including recruitment/propagation of H3K9me3 by SET-25 at select loci (some via NRDE-3-dependent small RNA pathways). MET-2’s H3K9me2, more than H3K9me3, underpins lamina-associated domain (LAD) tethering in embryos. (jash2024chromatinorganizationduring pages 2-4, padeken2022establishmentofh3k9methylated pages 2-3, delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)
- Localization: Endogenous MET-2 is nuclear throughout development but concentrates into subnuclear hubs/foci at gastrulation; these foci are enriched at the periphery and co-localize with H3K9me2, while excluding active marks. Foci display stress-responsive dynamics (heat shock dispersal and recovery) paralleling LIN-65 behavior. (delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10, mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2)
- Cofactors: LIN-65 is ATF7IP-like, largely unstructured, and rate-limits MET-2 nuclear accumulation and focus formation; its loss destabilizes nuclear MET-2, lowers H3K9me2, disperses foci, and derepresses repeats and MET-2 targets. ARLE-14 enhances MET-2’s stable chromatin association and the kinetics of H3K9me2 accumulation; arle-14 mutants show delayed H3K9me2 accumulation with reduced slopes. (mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 8-9, mutlu2018regulatednuclearaccumulation pages 1-2, delaney2019heterochromaticfociand pages 8-10)
- Noncatalytic role: MET-2—via LIN-65–dependent foci—can repress specific genes and maintain fertility/fitness independently of H3K9 methyltransferase activity, in part by constraining histone acetylation (H3K9ac/H3K27ac). This separates structural/organizational functions from catalytic ones. (delaney2022setdb1likemet2promotes pages 4-5)
- Readers and aging: CEC-5 reads H3K9me1/2 in vitro and in vivo, requiring MET-2 for proper chromatin association and nuclear puncta; MET-2 and CEC-5 jointly support normal lifespan in C. elegans, linking MET-2’s marks to aging biology. (hou2023systematiccharacterizationof pages 8-11)
- Dosage compensation/sex determination: XOL-1 modulates MET-2 expression and thereby the H3K9 landscape and developmental timing in hermaphrodite embryos; MET-2 loss suppresses accelerated developmental phenotypes and precocious DCC loading in xol-1 mutants. (jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 3-5, jash2024xol1regulatesdevelopmental pages 15-17)

Limitations and open questions
- How MET-2 is targeted to specific sequences (e.g., repeats vs developmental genes) remains an active area, likely involving small RNAs (NRDE-3) and readers like CEC proteins. The exact biochemical determinants of LIN-65/ARLE-14 interactions and whether MET-2–LIN-65 hubs are phase-separated condensates warrant further biophysical work.

Conclusions
MET-2 (UniProt P34544) is the principal H3K9me1/2 writer in C. elegans that times heterochromatin establishment through regulated nuclear accumulation and formation of LIN-65/ARLE-14–dependent nuclear hubs. Its catalytic output (H3K9me2) is essential for lamina tethering and repression of repeats, while a distinct, LIN-65–dependent noncatalytic function helps maintain gene silencing and developmental fitness. In 2023–2024, work linked MET-2’s H3K9 landscape to developmental timing via XOL-1 and to lifespan via the H3K9me1/2 reader CEC-5, highlighting MET-2 as a central hub integrating gene regulation, nuclear architecture, development, and aging.
