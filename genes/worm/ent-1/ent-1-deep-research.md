# Introduction 
The **ent-1** gene in *Caenorhabditis elegans* encodes an *equilibrative nucleoside transporter* (CeENT1), a membrane protein involved in moving nucleosides across cell membranes. This gene (sequence tag ZK809.4) is one of seven ENT-family members in *C. elegans* and is highly similar (94% amino acid identity) to the ent-2 gene, suggesting a recent gene duplication ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L133%20relatively%20close,relatively%20recent%20gene%20duplication%20event)). Worm ENT proteins are homologous to the human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs) of the SLC29A family ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)). Below is a comprehensive overview of **ent-1** including its molecular function, localization, biological roles, relevant phenotypes, structural features, expression regulation, evolutionary conservation, and key experimental evidence supporting its annotation.

## Gene Function and Molecular Mechanism 
The ent-1 gene product is a facilitative **nucleoside transporter** that enables the uptake and release of nucleosides across cell membranes. Functional characterization studies demonstrated that CeENT1 (ENT-1) can transport a broad range of nucleosides (both purine and pyrimidine) similar to human ENT1/ENT2 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)). Unlike concentrative transporters, equilibrative nucleoside transporters do not couple to ion gradients; instead, ENT-1 facilitates diffusion down concentration gradients (equilibrative transport). Worm ENT-1 and its paralog ENT-2 share overlapping substrate specificity for nucleosides, yet they differ in transporting free nucleobases ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)). In particular, CeENT1 and CeENT2 resemble hENT1/hENT2 in broad nucleoside permeability, but show differing selectivity for nucleobases ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)), implying one may more efficiently transport nucleobase metabolites than the other. Biochemical assays in heterologous systems confirmed ENT-1’s activity: for example, expressed CeENT1 is insensitive to classic mammalian ENT inhibitors (e.g. NBMPR, dilazep) but is inhibited by dipyridamole ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=%28ent,Their%20potential%20roles)), matching the inhibitor profile of equilibrative nucleoside transporters. These findings establish **ENT-1 as a nucleoside transmembrane transporter** (GO:0005337) responsible for **nucleoside transport** across cell membranes ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=have%20now%20demonstrated%20that%20the,permeant%20specificities%20for%20nucleosides%2C%20while)). By mediating nucleoside uptake, ENT-1 plays a key role in nucleotide salvage pathways, providing purine and pyrimidine building blocks for DNA/RNA synthesis in cells that cannot meet demands via de novo synthesis alone.

## Cellular Localization and Subcellular Component  
ENT-1 is an **integral membrane protein** localized to the cell plasma membrane. The Uniprot entry (G5EDJ3) predicts ENT-1 is membrane-associated, and functional studies confirm it acts at the cell surface ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=178339#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20nucleoside,Human%20ortholog%28s%29%20of)). CRISPR knock-in reporters tagging endogenous ENT-1 with fluorescent proteins showed that **ENT-1 is expressed on the membranes of specific tissues, notably the intestinal cells and the germline** (gonadal) cells in adult worms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=CRISPR%20knock,intestine%20and%20germline%20in%20the)). In the intestine, ENT-1 is found in the intestinal epithelium (likely at the basolateral membrane facing the body cavity), while in the reproductive system it localizes to germ cells in the gonad ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=CRISPR%20knock,intestine%20and%20germline%20in%20the)). ENT-1 is thereby positioned at the interface between cells and the pseudocoelomic fluid (worm body cavity), consistent with its role in moving metabolites between tissues. The protein’s structure is typical of membrane transporters: ENT-1 spans the membrane multiple times (predicted 10–12 transmembrane helices) forming a channel or carrier pore ([tcdb.org](https://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.57#:~:text=TCDB%20%C2%BB%20SEARCH%20The%20generalized,ENT%29%20Family)). No signal peptide or luminal domains are present; instead, both the N- and C-termini face the cytosol, with a large cytosolic loop between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (a conserved topology among ENT/SLC29 transporters) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5359181/#:~:text=,Sundaram%20et%20al)). This multi-pass membrane architecture places the key ligand-binding sites and gating elements within the membrane, enabling ENT-1 to undergo conformational changes that alternately expose its nucleoside-binding pocket to the extracellular space or the cytosol ([tcdb.org](https://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.57#:~:text=TCDB%20%C2%BB%20SEARCH%20The%20generalized,ENT%29%20Family)). In summary, **ENT-1 is a polytopic membrane protein** (approximately 445 amino acids) embedded in the plasma membrane of specific cell types, aligning with Gene Ontology cellular component terms such as *integral component of plasma membrane* (GO:0005887).

## Biological Processes and Pathways 
**ENT-1 is critically involved in nucleoside homeostasis and inter-tissue metabolite transport**, which in turn impacts key biological processes like development and reproduction. As a nucleoside importer/exporter, ENT-1 participates in the **nucleoside salvage pathway** by transporting preformed nucleosides into cells (GO:0015858 nucleoside transport) that can be phosphorylated into nucleotides for DNA/RNA synthesis. This function is especially important in rapidly dividing or nutrient-dependent cells. Notably, ENT-1 works in concert with its paralog ENT-2 to shuttle nucleosides between the intestine (a nutrient-absorbing tissue) and the germline (where rapid DNA replication occurs during gametogenesis) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=found%20that%20C.%20elegans%20ENT,Their%20synergistic)). A recent study revealed a **novel soma-germline metabolic coupling**: ENT-2 in intestinal cells exports nucleosides (particularly purine nucleosides) into the pseudocoelomic fluid, and ENT-1 on germ cells imports them from the fluid into the germline ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=found%20that%20C.%20elegans%20ENT,Their%20synergistic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20germline%20is,1%20in%20the)). This **cell-non-autonomous supply of nucleosides** is pivotal for reproduction – it ensures that developing oocytes and sperm have adequate nucleotides for genome replication. In ent-1 and ent-2 double-knockdown worms, severe deficits in the purine pool were observed in germ cells, accompanied by transcriptional up-regulation of purine biosynthesis genes as a compensatory response ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L410%20both%20ENT,alterations%20of%20purine%20biosynthesis%20genes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20germline%20is,1%20in%20the)). However, this compensation was insufficient: the double disruption dramatically reduced the guanosine (Guan) levels in germ cells and caused sterility, which could be rescued by supplementing guanosine directly to the body cavity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=mediating%20nucleoside%20coordination%20between%20the,ENT%20double%20knockdown%2C%20whereas%20adenosine)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20germline%20is,1%20in%20the)). These findings highlight **guanosine transport as a rate-limiting process for fertility**, linking ENT-1 activity to the biological process of reproduction. Consistently, ent-1 (with ent-2) is required for normal brood sizes and reproductive span ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=found%20that%20C.%20elegans%20ENT,Their%20synergistic)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=ENT,together%20to%20regulate%20reproduction)). Beyond reproduction, **ENT-1 is also involved in developmental processes**. When ent-1 function is simultaneously lost with ent-2, worms exhibit pronounced developmental defects and growth arrest ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=adenosine%2C%20and%20inosine,as%20the%20primary%20source%20for)). RNAi of both genes in larvae led to abnormal development of the intestine and vulva structures ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=match%20at%20L17%20expression,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)), indicating that nucleoside transport is required during organ development (likely by supporting the rapid cell divisions in those tissues). Thus, through its role in salvaging nucleosides, **ENT-1 influences multiple biological processes** including nucleotide biosynthesis, embryonic development, larval growth, and germline development, all of which can be linked to GO terms such as *nucleoside transmembrane transport*, *purine nucleotide biosynthetic process*, *reproduction*, and *embryo development*. 

## Disease Associations and Phenotypic Effects 
In *C. elegans*, **loss of ent-1 alone causes only subtle phenotypes due to compensation by ent-2**, but combined loss of ent-1 and ent-2 leads to severe defects. Single-gene knockout strains for ent-1 (e.g. ent-1(ok743) null) are viable and generally healthy with no obvious developmental abnormalities ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=locations%20in%20the%20adult%2C%20including,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)). This lack of phenotype is attributed to functional redundancy: ENT-2 can fulfill much of the nucleoside transport need in the absence of ENT-1 ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=locations%20in%20the%20adult%2C%20including,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)). However, when **both ent-1 and ent-2 are inactivated, worms become sterile and exhibit stunted growth or developmental arrest**, underscoring their essential, overlapping roles ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L528%20ENT,In%20this%20study%2C%20we)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=ENT,In%20this%20study%2C%20we)). Double-knockout animals cannot produce progeny and often die or fail to develop past early larval stages ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=adenosine%2C%20and%20inosine,as%20the%20primary%20source%20for)). At the cellular level, germ cells in ent-1;ent-2 deficient worms show cell cycle/meiotic defects consistent with nucleotide starvation, explaining the sterility ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20germline%20is,1%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L528%20ENT,In%20this%20study%2C%20we)). These **worm phenotypes** (sterility, developmental arrest, vulval malformation) demonstrate the critical requirement of nucleoside transport for normal physiology. No direct “disease” in *C. elegans* is associated with ent-1, as worms do not have diseases in the human sense; instead researchers assess phenotypes like fertility and growth. 

In a broader context, the human orthologs of ENT-1 are medically significant. Human **hENT1 (SLC29A1)** is widely expressed and is the major transporter for adenosine and chemotherapy nucleoside drugs. While mutations in SLC29A1 are not known to cause Mendelian diseases, ENT1 levels have clinical importance – for example, low ENT1 expression in tumors is associated with resistance to nucleoside analog drugs (like gemcitabine) and poorer patient outcomes ([lookformedical.com](https://lookformedical.com/en/web/equilibrative-nucleoside-transport-proteins#:~:text=Web%20lookformedical.com%20%20,are%20specialized%20proteins%20that%20mediate)). Additionally, another family member SLC29A3 (hENT3) is implicated in a rare histiocytosis syndrome when mutated. These human correlations underscore that **ENT transporters are crucial in pathology and pharmacology**, though in *C. elegans* the relevance is seen as essential physiological roles rather than disease. The conservation of function allows *C. elegans* ent-1 to serve as a model for studying nucleoside transporter function and drug responses. In summary, **ent-1 is essential for viability and fertility in worms (in combination with ent-2)**, and by orthology it relates to human ENT1 which has roles in drug uptake and can be a biomarker in diseases like cancer ([lookformedical.com](https://lookformedical.com/en/web/equilibrative-nucleoside-transport-proteins#:~:text=Web%20lookformedical.com%20%20,are%20specialized%20proteins%20that%20mediate)).

## Protein Domains and Structural Features 
The ENT-1 protein is characterized by **multiple transmembrane domains and conserved motifs typical of equilibrative nucleoside transporters**. It is ~445 amino acids in length ([string-db.org](https://string-db.org/network/6239.ZK809.4a.1#:~:text=%7C%20%20%7C%20ent,0.748)) and belongs to the Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter family (SLC29), which is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters ([tcdb.org](https://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.57#:~:text=TCDB%20%C2%BB%20SEARCH%20The%20generalized,ENT%29%20Family)) ([tcdb.org](https://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.57#:~:text=members%20is%3A%20Nucleoside%20,ENT%29%20Family)). Like other MFS transporters, ENT-1 is predicted to fold into 12 α-helical transmembrane segments arranged into two pseudo-symmetrical halves (each half typically contains 6 TMs) that form a central solute-translocation channel. ENT-1’s topology includes a large intracellular loop between TM6 and TM7 and short extracellular loops, with both N- and C-termini residing in the cytoplasm ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5359181/#:~:text=,Sundaram%20et%20al)). This topology is supported by experimental findings on hENT1 and modeling of related parasite ENTs, which indicate **conserved helix arrangements and gating mechanisms** ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3979384/#:~:text=Equilibrative%20nucleoside%20transporters%20of%20the,transporter%20FucP%20and%20have%20identified)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3979384/#:~:text=no%20crystal%20structure%20is%20available,The%20results)). ENT-1 contains sequences corresponding to ENT family signatures, for example a conserved NXXE motif (Asn-x-x-Glu) in one of the transmembrane segments known to be important for nucleoside binding/translocation in hENT1. Additionally, ENT-1 lacks obvious signal peptides or globular domains, consistent with its role as a channel-like transporter. Its primary structure shares significant homology with other ENT family proteins – *C. elegans* ENT-1 and ENT-2 are 94% identical at the amino acid level ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L133%20relatively%20close,relatively%20recent%20gene%20duplication%20event)), and both share about 50–60% identity with human ENT1/ENT2, indicating strong conservation of the transporter domain. **Conserved domain analysis** (NCBI’s CDD) identifies ENT-1 as part of the *“Equilibrative nucleoside transporter”* conserved family (cl15430), reinforcing that it harbors the typical domains required for nucleoside recognition and translocation ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Cmd=DetailsSearch&Db=gene&Term=178339#:~:text=Summary%20Predicted%20to%20enable%20nucleoside,Human%20ortholog%28s%29%20of)). In terms of structural features, ENT-1 is predicted to form an inward-open and outward-open state during transport. Computational and mutagenesis studies on ENT homologs (e.g., Leishmania NT1 and human ENT1) have identified helical bundles that act as gates on either side of the membrane ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3979384/#:~:text=for%20treatment%20of%20cancer%2C%20AIDS%2C,The%20results)). By analogy, CeENT-1 likely has similar gating helices that regulate access of nucleosides. No high-resolution structure exists for ENT-1, but AlphaFold and homology models (using bacterial MFS transporters as templates) predict a canonical MFS fold. Therefore, **ENT-1’s protein architecture** can be summarized as an MFS-type transporter with a dozen transmembrane helices and critical conserved residues forming the nucleoside translocation pore and gating structures.

## Expression Patterns and Regulation 
The expression of ent-1 in *C. elegans* is **spatially and temporally regulated**, with highest expression in tissues that demand active nucleoside transport. Reporter gene analyses and fluorescence-tagged endogenous protein have shown that **ent-1 is expressed in the adult intestinal cells and in the germline** (developing oocytes and/or sperm) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=CRISPR%20knock,intestine%20and%20germline%20in%20the)). ENT-1 expression in the intestine is detected in most or all intestinal cells, whereas in the gonad it is present in germ cells throughout the syncytial ovary, ensuring that maturing oocytes are supplied with nucleosides. Some earlier observations also noted ent-1 promoter activity in the pharynx of adult worms ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=to%20the%20classic%20inhibitors%20of,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)), indicating expression in a subset of cells in the head; the pharyngeal expression might relate to nucleoside transport from ingested bacteria. During development, ent-1 appears to be expressed at lower levels in larvae, which correlates with the fact that single ent-1 mutants develop normally unless ent-2 is also absent. However, when ent-2 is knocked out, **ent-1 expression is up-regulated as a compensatory response**: in ent-2 null mutants, ENT-1 protein levels increase in both the intestine and germline ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=of%20the%20other%20at%20the,Fig%20%20and%20%2027)). Conversely, loss of ent-1 triggers up-regulation of ENT-2 in the intestine and gonadal sheath cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=of%20the%20other%20at%20the,Fig%20%20and%20%2027)). This suggests a regulatory feedback mechanism at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, whereby the worm adjusts ENT transporter abundance to maintain nucleoside homeostasis. The ent-1 gene’s transcription is likely constitutive in key tissues, but might be modulated by metabolic cues – for instance, low internal nucleotide levels may induce ent-1 expression to enhance salvage. Indeed, the double knockdown of ent-1 and ent-2 led to activation of purine biosynthetic genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L410%20both%20ENT,alterations%20of%20purine%20biosynthesis%20genes)), implying that normally the presence of ENT-mediated salvage represses de novo synthesis to some extent. No specific transcription factors for ent-1 have been reported, but its expression in germline vs somatic tissues suggests regulation by developmental programs (e.g. germline-specific expression could be controlled by germline-promoting factors). Also, nutrient availability might influence ent-1: worms feeding on nucleoside-rich vs nucleoside-poor bacterial diets could potentially alter ent-1 levels (one study showed ent-1 RNAi effects on reproduction were consistent on both standard and nucleotide-supplemented diets ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=used%20for%20RNAi,S1A%20and%20S1B%20Fig)), indicating diet does not bypass the need for ENT-1). In summary, **ent-1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner (intestine, gonad, pharynx)** with built-in redundancy with ent-2, and is subject to feedback regulation to ensure a steady supply of nucleosides. Developmentally, its expression in the germline ramps up as worms reach reproductive age (adulthood), aligning with the onset of high nucleotide demand for embryogenesis.

## Evolutionary Conservation 
Equilibrative nucleoside transporters are **highly conserved across eukaryotes**, and ent-1 exemplifies this conservation. The *C. elegans* ent-1 gene is one of several paralogs that arose within nematodes; *C. elegans* has seven ENT-related genes (ent-1 through ent-7) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=In%20humans%2C%20four%20ENT%20members,1%20to)), compared to only four in humans (hENT1–4), indicating some lineage-specific expansion. The strong sequence identity between worm ENT-1 and ENT-2 (94% amino acid identity ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L133%20relatively%20close,relatively%20recent%20gene%20duplication%20event))) suggests a recent gene duplication in the *C. elegans* lineage, resulting in two nearly redundant transporters. Phylogenetic analyses cluster CeENT1 and CeENT2 closely together and somewhat separate from other worm ENTs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=In%20humans%2C%20four%20ENT%20members,1%20to)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=relatively%20close%20to%20each%20other,relatively%20recent%20gene%20duplication%20event)). Both are most similar to the **mammalian ENT1/ENT2 clade**, whereas worm ENT-3 to ENT-7 may correspond to other subfamilies (for instance, some might be more divergent or localize to intracellular organelles like hENT3). The fundamental transport mechanism and key residues of ENT proteins have been preserved: for example, yeast have a related transporter (Fun26) that functions in vacuolar nucleoside transport, and protozoan parasites have ENT-like permeases for salvaging host purines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2898299/#:~:text=DISCUSSION%20The%20localization%20of%20PfNT2,membranes%20where%20they%20are%20thought)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2898299/#:~:text=intracellular%20transporters,membranes%20where%20they%20are%20thought)). ENT homologs are even found in some bacteria, as suggested by bioinformatic discovery of ENT-like sequences in prokaryotes ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/19/12/2199/997571#:~:text=Molecular%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Equilibrative,Nieweg%20and%20Bremer%201997)), underscoring the ancient origin of this protein family. The *C. elegans* ENT-1 protein shares significant homology to **human SLC29A1 (hENT1)** and SLC29A2 (hENT2): it resembles hENT1 in broad substrate profile and hENT2 in inhibitor sensitivity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=%28ent,Their%20potential%20roles)). Functionally, human ENT1 can substitute for worm ENT-1 to some extent – previous heterologous expression experiments and cross-species comparisons indicate that the transport kinetics of adenosine/uridine are conserved ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)). This evolutionary conservation extends to the physiological role: nucleoside transport via ENT proteins is crucial in organisms from worms to mammals for sustaining nucleotide pools in cells that cannot synthesize all nucleotides de novo. Because of this, ENT-1 in *C. elegans* can be viewed as an orthologous counterpart of hENT1, making worms a useful model to study nucleoside transporter function and regulation. In evolutionary terms, **ENT-1 has retained the core features of the ENT family over hundreds of millions of years**, highlighting the selective pressure to maintain nucleoside salvage mechanisms. The variations among the ENT family members (e.g., number of genes, subcellular targeting) reflect adaptation to organism-specific needs, but the ent-1 gene’s basic role in equilibrative transport is a conserved and fundamental aspect of nucleotide metabolism.

## Key Experimental Evidence and Literature 
Multiple lines of experimental evidence support the above understanding of *C. elegans* ent-1. **Molecular identification and transport assays:** The ent-1 (ZK809.4) open reading frame was initially identified from the worm genome and functionally characterized by Fraser et al. (2004), who cloned ent-1 and ent-2 and demonstrated their nucleoside transporter activity ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=vasoactive%20drug%20dipyridamole,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)). Using Xenopus oocyte uptake assays, this study showed ENT-1 transports radiolabeled nucleosides, defining its substrate range and pharmacology ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=%28ent,Their%20potential%20roles)). **Genetic interaction and RNAi studies:** The same study and others used RNA interference to knock down ent-1, ent-2, or both, revealing no phenotype for single knockdowns but severe developmental defects for the double, thereby establishing their redundant function in development ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=locations%20in%20the%20adult%2C%20including,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=expression.%20Although%20disruption%20of%20ent,involving%20the%20intestine%20and%20vulva)). **GFP reporter and CRISPR tagging:** Follow-up research by Guan *et al.* (2023) created CRISPR knock-in strains tagging ENT-1 with fluorescent proteins, precisely mapping its expression to germline and intestinal cells ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=CRISPR%20knock,intestine%20and%20germline%20in%20the)). This allowed visualization of ENT-1 in vivo and showed adaptive up-regulation when ent-2 is lost ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=of%20the%20other%20at%20the,Fig%20%20and%20%2027)). **Physiological assays for reproduction:** Guan *et al.* also performed brood size and sterility assays, finding that simultaneous knockdown of ent-1 and ent-2 leads to complete sterility, an effect rescueable by guanosine injection ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=mediating%20nucleoside%20coordination%20between%20the,ENT%20double%20knockdown%2C%20whereas%20adenosine)). They measured nucleoside levels and gene expression changes, linking ENT-1/2 loss to reduced germline guanine nucleotides and activation of compensatory purine synthesis genes ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L410%20both%20ENT,alterations%20of%20purine%20biosynthesis%20genes)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20germline%20is,1%20in%20the)). **Biochemical and structural modeling:** Studies on human and protozoan ENT proteins have been extrapolated to worm ENT-1. For instance, Yegutkin *et al.* (2014) identified gating helices in an ENT via homology modeling ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3979384/#:~:text=for%20treatment%20of%20cancer%2C%20AIDS%2C,The%20results)), providing insight into how ENT-1 might function at the molecular level. No direct structural study on ENT-1 exists, but the AlphaFold model for ENT-1 (available via UniProt/AlphaFold database) predicts a structure consistent with the ENT family. **WormBase and genetic resources:** ent-1 has a defined genetic position (Chromosome IV: 11,653,417–11,655,470) and a deletion allele ent-1(ok743) available from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which has been used in studies of nucleoside transporter function ([cgc.umn.edu](https://cgc.umn.edu/gene/ent-1#:~:text=Strain%20%20,Paper_evidence%20WBPaper00041807)). The WormBase database consolidates these findings and curates GO annotations: for example, ent-1 is annotated with *nucleoside transmembrane transporter activity* and *plasma membrane localization*, backed by the experiments cited above. 

In conclusion, the *C. elegans* **ent-1 gene encodes a conserved equilibrative nucleoside transporter** that localizes to cell membranes of the intestine and germline, mediates nucleoside uptake critical for nucleotide biosynthesis, and is functionally redundant with ent-2 to support normal development and fertility ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15371014/#:~:text=rationale%20underlying%20the%20multiplicity%20of,of%20green%20fluorescent%20protein%20reporter)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151481/#:~:text=found%20that%20C.%20elegans%20ENT,Their%20synergistic)). Its study has provided valuable insights into cell-nonautonomous metabolic regulation and has parallels in human physiology and disease, underscoring the importance of ENT-1 in both basic biology and translational contexts.
