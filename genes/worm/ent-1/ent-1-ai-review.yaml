description: "ENT-1 is an equilibrative nucleoside transporter (CeENT1) that belongs to the SLC29A/ENT transporter family. It is a multi-pass membrane protein (~445 amino acids with 10-12 predicted transmembrane helices) that transports nucleosides with broad permeant specificity similar to human ENT1. ENT-1 exhibits functional redundancy with ENT-2 (94% amino acid identity), and both transporters are required for proper C. elegans development and reproduction. The protein localizes to plasma membrane and is expressed in intestine, pharynx, and critically in germline cells where it mediates cross-tissue nucleoside coordination. ENT-1 is inhibited by dipyridamole but insensitive to classic mammalian nucleoside transport inhibitors like nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and dilazep. Together with ENT-2, it forms a metabolic coupling system where intestinal ENT-2 exports nucleosides to the pseudocoelom and germline ENT-1 imports them, with guanosine transport being particularly critical for fertility."
