description: ENT-1 is an equilibrative nucleoside transporter (CeENT1) that belongs to the SLC29A/ENT
  transporter family. It is a multi-pass membrane protein (~445 amino acids with 10-12 predicted transmembrane
  helices) that transports nucleosides with broad permeant specificity similar to human ENT1. ENT-1 exhibits
  functional redundancy with ENT-2 (94% amino acid identity), and both transporters are required for proper
  C. elegans development and reproduction. The protein localizes to plasma membrane and is expressed in
  intestine, pharynx, and critically in germline cells where it mediates cross-tissue nucleoside coordination.
  ENT-1 is inhibited by dipyridamole but insensitive to classic mammalian nucleoside transport inhibitors
  like nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and dilazep. Together with ENT-2, it forms a metabolic coupling
  system where intestinal ENT-2 exports nucleosides to the pseudocoelom and germline ENT-1 imports them,
  with guanosine transport being particularly critical for fertility.
