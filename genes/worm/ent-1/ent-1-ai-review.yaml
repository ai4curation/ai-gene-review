description: "ENT-1 is an equilibrative nucleoside transporter (CeENT1) that belongs to the SLC29A/ENT transporter family. It is a multi-pass membrane protein that transports nucleosides with broad permeant specificity similar to human ENT1. ENT-1 exhibits functional redundancy with ENT-2, and both transporters are required for proper C. elegans development. The protein is localized to plasma membrane and expressed in limited tissues including intestine and pharynx. ENT-1 is inhibited by dipyridamole but insensitive to classic mammalian nucleoside transport inhibitors like nitrobenzylthioinosine."
