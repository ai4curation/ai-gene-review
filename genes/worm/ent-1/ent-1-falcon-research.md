This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene ent-1 (UniProt ID: G5EDJ3, Entry Name: G5EDJ3_CAEEL), focusing on its gene function, molecular mechanisms, cellular localization, involvement in biological processes, disease-associated phenotypes, protein domains and structural features, expression patterns, regulatory aspects, evolutionary conservation, and the experimental evidence supporting its annotation. The ent-1 gene encodes the CeENT1 protein, which belongs to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family and plays a central role in mediating sodium-independent nucleoside transport processes critical for cell metabolism and reproduction (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2).

I. Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms  
CeENT1 functions as an equilibrative transporter that facilitates the bidirectional passage of nucleosides, enabling the uptake and release of substrates such as uridine and guanosine across cellular membranes in a sodium‐independent manner (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5). At the molecular level, the protein mediates the diffusion of nucleosides along their concentration gradients, which is essential for maintaining nucleotide pools required for DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and overall cell viability (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3). Functional studies based on RNA interference (RNAi) experiments indicate that disruption of ent-1 alone does not always produce a severe phenotype due to compensatory activity by the closely related CeENT2; however, simultaneous interference with both transporter functions has been shown to lead to significant developmental defects and reproductive failure (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 10-11). Moreover, the CeENT1 protein exhibits inhibitor sensitivity to compounds such as dipyridamole, suggesting that its nucleoside transport activity can be modulated pharmacologically, a characteristic that further aligns it with its mammalian homologs (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12). The molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of CeENT1 therefore also involve precise interactions with substrates and inhibitors, which serve to regulate its transport efficiency and, by extension, impact nucleotide salvage pathways critical for cellular metabolism (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2).

II. Cellular Localization and Subcellular Components  
The CeENT1 protein is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, as indicated by both its UniProt metadata and experimental evidence (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3). Detailed expression studies have revealed that CeENT1 is enriched in the intestinal cells and pharyngeal musculature of C. elegans, cell types that are intricately involved in nutrient uptake and energy processing (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 9-10). In addition to these somatic tissues, CeENT1 is functionally significant in the germline, where its activity is critical for the proper transfer of nucleosides from the surrounding pseudocoelom to developing gametes (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 5-7). This specialized localization supports a role in cross‐tissue communication, where proper nucleoside distribution is essential for supporting rapid nucleotide turnover during development and reproduction (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 12-14).

III. Biological Processes Involvement  
CeENT1 is implicated in several vital biological processes, foremost among which is its role in nucleoside transport critical for maintaining nucleotide balance within the organism. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that RNAi-mediated knockdown of ent-1 leads to diminished progeny numbers and altered reproductive timing, thereby underscoring its essential contribution to reproductive processes (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5). Specifically, CeENT1 acts in concert with CeENT2 to facilitate the uptake of nucleosides into the germline, ensuring that sufficient nucleotide precursors are available for DNA replication and cell division during gametogenesis (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 10-12, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 5-7). In scenarios where both CeENT1 and CeENT2 are impaired, severe phenotypes emerge, including complete sterility and morphological defects such as a protruding vulva, which are indicative of the critical nature of these transporters in coordinating developmental and reproductive pathways (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 10-11, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 5-6). Additionally, studies have noted that the loss of ENT-1 function can trigger compensatory mechanisms, such as the upregulation of purine biosynthesis pathways, to mitigate reduced nucleoside uptake, thereby reinforcing the centrality of CeENT1 in overall cellular homeostasis (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 10-12, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 12-14).

IV. Disease Associations and Phenotypes  
Although Caenorhabditis elegans is not a human model for direct disease studies, the significant sequence and functional conservation between CeENT1 and human ENT homologs suggests that defects in nucleoside transport may have broader implications. In the nematode, loss-of-function mutations or RNAi-mediated knockdowns of ent-1 do not act in isolation; rather, they highlight a functional redundancy with CeENT2 that is critical for maintaining reproductive health. When both transporters are compromised, the resultant phenotypes include severe reproductive impairments, such as decreased brood size and complete sterility, demonstrating that CeENT1 is essential for proper developmental progression (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 5-7). The manifestation of these phenotypes in C. elegans parallels observations in higher organisms wherein disruptions in nucleoside transport can affect tissue homeostasis and may contribute to disorders related to impaired nucleotide metabolism, thereby providing a valuable model for studying the molecular underpinnings of such conditions (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12).

V. Protein Domains and Structural Features  
Structurally, CeENT1 is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) transporter superfamily and exhibits the hallmark features of equilibrative nucleoside transporters. It is encoded by a gene that comprises six exons, with the translated protein containing multiple transmembrane helices that facilitate its integration into the plasma membrane (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3). These transmembrane domains are critical for forming the channel or pore through which nucleosides are shuttled across the lipid bilayer, and conserved structural motifs within these regions have been linked to substrate binding and transport activity (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5). Comparative sequence analyses confirm that CeENT1 shares significant structural similarity with human ENT proteins, revealing conserved residues and potential sites for N-linked glycosylation that may influence protein folding, stability, and function (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 6-9, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12). Furthermore, kinetic studies using heterologous expression systems have demonstrated that CeENT1 has a high transport capacity for specific nucleoside analogs, lending insight into its substrate specificity and the influence of molecular conformation on interaction with inhibitors like dipyridamole (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12).

VI. Expression Patterns and Regulation  
Investigations into the spatial expression of ent-1 in C. elegans have revealed that CeENT1 is predominantly expressed in tissues integral to nutrient assimilation and reproductive success. Promoter-reporter assays and CRISPR-mediated tagging experiments have consistently shown robust expression in the intestinal epithelium and pharyngeal musculature, as well as in the germline cells where its function is most critical (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 9-10). The tissue-specific expression pattern indicates that CeENT1 is finely regulated, likely through coordinated transcriptional control mechanisms that ensure optimal nucleoside uptake during periods of high metabolic demand, such as embryogenesis and gametogenesis (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 12-14). Moreover, the presence of feedback regulatory mechanisms has been inferred from studies reporting compensatory upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis pathways in response to impaired nucleoside transport, suggesting that CeENT1 not only serves as a conduit for nucleosides but also indirectly influences gene expression networks governing cellular metabolism (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 10-12, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 12-14).

VII. Evolutionary Conservation  
The CeENT1 transporter is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic species, and detailed phylogenetic studies have placed it within the ENT 1/2/3 lineage of nucleoside transporters (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3). C. elegans exhibits a broader repertoire of ENT isoforms—with up to seven identified isoforms, six of which belong to the ENT 1/2/3 lineage—suggesting that gene duplication events have not only provided functional redundancy but may also have allowed for nuanced, tissue-specific roles in nucleoside transport (ashraf2008molecularevolutionof pages 59-63, ashraf2008molecularevolutionofa pages 59-63). The conservation of key transmembrane domains, substrate-binding residues, and overall membrane topology among these isoforms highlights the evolutionary pressure to maintain the essential function of nucleoside transport across diverse biological contexts (ashraf2008molecularevolutionof pages 59-63, ashraf2008molecularevolutionof pages 63-68, ashraf2008molecularevolutionofb pages 63-68). Such evolutionary conservation reinforces the relevance of studying CeENT1 as a model to better understand the mechanistic and regulatory underpinnings of nucleoside transport in more complex organisms, including humans (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12).

VIII. Key Experimental Evidence and Literature  
A variety of experimental approaches have been employed to elucidate the function and importance of the ent-1 gene. RNA interference studies have been pivotal in demonstrating that silencing ent-1 leads to diminished brood sizes and disrupted reproductive timing, underscoring its essential role in coordinating nucleoside supply during reproduction (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2). In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout models have been used to generate mutants lacking ent-1 activity; these models, when combined with concurrent reduction of ent-2 expression, exhibit immediate reproductive failure and severe developmental abnormalities, thereby providing direct evidence for the functional interdependence of these transporters (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5). Electrophysiological and kinetic analyses performed using oocyte expression systems have shed light on the substrate specificity of CeENT1, revealing its high transport capacity for nucleoside analogs and its characteristic inhibitor sensitivity to drugs such as dipyridamole (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12). Furthermore, molecular analyses involving promoter-reporter fusions have mapped the spatial expression of ent-1 to critical tissues like the intestine, pharyngeal musculature, and germline, thereby corroborating its proposed role in nutrient and nucleoside distribution (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 9-10, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 5-7). Collectively, these studies provide a robust experimental framework that supports the current understanding of CeENT1 function and validates its inclusion in gene ontology annotations related to nucleoside transport, membrane localization, and reproductive processes (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 10-11).

IX. Implications for Gene Ontology Annotation Curation  
For curators working on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, the ent-1 gene represents a well-characterized example of a membrane-bound nucleoside transporter with broad implications in nucleotide metabolism and reproductive biology. The documented roles in nucleoside uptake, cross-tissue signaling between somatic and germline compartments, and the essential nature of its function for proper developmental timing and fertility provide multiple facets that can be mapped to relevant GO terms. For instance, GO annotations related to “nucleoside transmembrane transporter activity,” “integral component of membrane,” “reproductive process,” “nucleotide metabolic process,” and “developmental process” can all be supported by the data outlined above (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3). Additionally, the experimentally confirmed subcellular localization to the plasma membrane, as well as the evolutionary conservation with human ENT family members, further strengthen its annotation under GO terms that pertain to “membrane organization” and “evolutionarily conserved pathways” (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3, ashraf2008molecularevolutionof pages 59-63). The interplay between ent-1 and its paralog ent-2 also highlights the importance of considering genetic redundancy and compensatory mechanisms when annotating phenotypic outcomes associated with nucleoside transport deficiency (appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 10-11).

X. Conclusion  
In summary, the Caenorhabditis elegans ent-1 gene encodes the CeENT1 protein, a key member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family that is responsible for mediating sodium-independent nucleoside transport across the plasma membrane. Through its activity, CeENT1 plays an essential role in ensuring the proper distribution of nucleosides necessary for DNA replication, RNA synthesis, and cellular energy metabolism, with particularly critical implications for reproductive processes. Its expression in the intestine, pharyngeal musculature, and germline, combined with functional redundancy alongside CeENT2, underscores a sophisticated regulatory mechanism that ensures nucleotide homeostasis across tissues. The protein’s structural features—comprising multiple transmembrane helices and conserved motifs—underscore its close evolutionary relationship with mammalian nucleoside transporters, further emphasizing its significance as a model system for understanding fundamental aspects of nucleoside transport and potential pharmacological targeting. The extensive experimental evidence, ranging from RNAi knockdown and CRISPR knockout studies to heterologous expression and inhibitor sensitivity assays, has firmly established the biological importance of ent-1 in C. elegans. These insights not only inform the functional annotation of this gene in the context of GO curation but also provide a basis for comparative analyses across species, which may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of disorders related to aberrant nucleoside transport in higher organisms (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 1-2, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 10-11, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 2-3, appleford2004functionalredundancyof pages 3-5, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 10-12, young2008humanequilibrativenucleoside pages 10-12).

Taken together, the multifaceted role of CeENT1 in nucleoside transport, reproduction, and cellular metabolism, supported by robust experimental data and evolutionary conservation, makes ent-1 a prime candidate for detailed GO annotation. Future research aimed at further characterizing the regulatory networks modulating this transporter, as well as its interactions with other members of the ENT family, will continue to enhance our understanding of its biological significance and provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing nucleoside homeostasis in diverse organisms (guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 2-5, guan2025crosstissuecoordinationbetween pages 12-14).
