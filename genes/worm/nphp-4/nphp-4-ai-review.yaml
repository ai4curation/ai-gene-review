description: NPHP-4 is the C. elegans ortholog of human nephrocystin-4 (NPHP4), a
  protein that localizes to the ciliary transition zone (TZ) and ciliary basal body.
  Together with NPHP-1, NPHP-4 forms the NPHP module at the TZ, which acts redundantly
  with the MKS module to establish basal body membrane associations, regulate TZ Y-link
  formation, and establish the ciliary diffusion barrier (gate). Single nphp-4 mutants
  have relatively mild cilia defects, but nphp-4 mutants in combination with mutations
  in MKS module genes (mks-1, mks-2, mks-5, mks-6) exhibit severe ciliary phenotypes
  including loss of dye-filling, defective TZ ultrastructure, and impaired ciliogenesis.
  NPHP-4 regulates ciliary access of specific IFT components including OSM-6 and BBS
  proteins, and shows a specific genetic interaction with the kinesin OSM-3. Expression
  is in ciliated sensory neurons, and the protein functions in sensory signal transduction
  required for male mating behaviors and chemosensation.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation inferred from phylogeny. Human NPHP4 has been implicated
      in Wnt signaling regulation, and the mammalian TZ has roles in compartmentalizing
      signaling molecules. However, direct evidence for NPHP-4 involvement in Wnt
      signaling in C. elegans is limited.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While human NPHP4 has been linked to Wnt signaling regulation and TZ proteins
      can modulate ciliary signaling, the core function of C. elegans NPHP-4 is in
      TZ structure and ciliary gating rather than specific signaling pathway regulation.
      This may represent a conserved but secondary function.

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The TZ is often co-isolated with the basal body, and NPHP-4 is found at

core_functions:
- description: NPHP-4 is a core component of the NPHP module at the ciliary transition
    zone, where it functions to establish the ciliary gate and regulate protein access
    to the ciliary compartment. Multiple IDA studies demonstrate specific localization
    to the TZ (PMID:21422230, PMID:21689635, PMID:18316409, PMID:15817158).
