### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9U1S7
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Polycystin-2 {ECO:0000303|PubMed:15862350}; Short=CePc2; AltName: Full=Polycystic kidney disease 2 protein homolog {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q13563};
- **Gene Information:** Name=pkd-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y73F8A.1}; Synonyms=pdk-2 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y73F8A.1}; ORFNames=Y73F8A.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y73F8A.1};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the polycystin family. .
- **Key Domains:** PKD1_2_channel. (IPR013122); PKD_2. (IPR003915); Polycystin. (IPR051223); Polycystin_dom. (IPR046791); PKD_channel (PF08016)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pkd-2" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pkd-2' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pkd-2** (gene ID: pkd-2, UniProt: Q9U1S7) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan
- Verify identity and organism-specificity; confirm polycystin/TRPP2 family and ciliary channel context. Compile foundational and most recent (2023–2024) primary literature. Extract precise evidence on molecular function, interacting partners, pathways, localization (neurons, subcellular), extracellular vesicle (EV) biology, and quantitative data. Summarize applications and expert perspectives. Provide URLs and publication dates.

Gene/protein verification and core definitions
- Identity and organism. pkd-2 (ORF Y73F8A.1) in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes the nematode polycystin‑2 (TRPP2) homolog, a ciliary membrane protein required for male mating behaviors; this matches UniProt Q9U1S7 and the polycystin family assignment (polycystin/TRPP channel) (Barr and Sternberg, Nature, 1999; Current Biology 2001) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4).
- Protein family and domains. pkd-2 encodes a TRP polycystin-2–type channel (TRPP family) that forms complexes with the polycystin‑1 homolog LOV-1; live imaging shows PKD‑2 co-traffics and co-releases with the LOV-1 C‑terminal fragment on ciliary EVs, consistent with conserved polycystin complex biology (Walsh et al., PLOS Genetics, 2022; Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021) (walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3). Based on TRPP2 family conservation, PKD‑2 is inferred to be a Ca2+-permeable cation channel acting in sensory transduction, although direct single-channel biophysics in C. elegans is not detailed in the retrieved 2021–2024 sources (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4).

Primary function and pathway context
- Function. PKD‑2 acts as a ciliary TRP channel central to male-specific sensory transduction and behavior. It functions with LOV‑1/PKD‑1 in a shared genetic pathway; mutations in lov‑1 or pkd‑2 cause similar defects in male mating behaviors, including response to contact and location of the vulva (Barr and Sternberg, Nature, 1999; Walsh et al., PLOS Genetics, 2022) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4).
- Polycystin complex and EV signaling. PKD‑2 and LOV‑1 C‑terminus are co-transported from the ER through dendritic vesicles to cilia and co-released on the same environmentally shed EVs, indicating coordinated trafficking and signaling output from cilia (Walsh et al., 2022) (walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4). Ciliary EVs are a regulated signaling output of sensory neurons; PKD‑2 EVs originate from distinct ciliary microdomains (see below) and can be directionally transferred to mating partners (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021; Current Biology, 2020) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 5-6, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 2-5).

Cellular and subcellular localization
- Neuron classes. pkd‑2 is expressed in male-specific ciliated sensory neurons, including the four CEM head neurons, HOB (hook B-type), and multiple ray B neurons (RnB) in the male tail; expression mapping and EV proteogenomics link these cells to PKD‑2 EV biology (Nikonorova et al., Current Biology, 2022; Nikonorova et al., bioRxiv, 2024) (nikonorova2022isolationprofilingand pages 1-3, nikonorova2024polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 1-3).
- Subcellular compartments and transport. PKD‑2 is transported along dendrites to the ciliary membrane and is enriched at the distal tip and along the shaft; it localizes on cilia-derived EVs released to the environment (Walsh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021) (walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).

Extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, sites, and deposition
- Two EV subtypes and release sites. Live Airyscan imaging established two spatially distinct PKD‑2 EV biogenesis sites: (1) distal ciliary tip, generating environmental EVs; and (2) periciliary membrane compartment (PCM) at the ciliary base, producing base EVs that include axonemal/transition-zone markers (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021; bioRxiv, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4). All examined cilia shed base EVs (n=35), while tip EV shedding occurred in 25/35 cilia (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).
- Mechanoresponsive release and directional transfer during mating. PKD‑2 EV release is triggered by mechanical stimulation of male ciliary tips: imaging males first under an agarose‑padded coverslip (few EVs) and then under a bare coverslip (abundant EVs) showed significant mechanoresponsiveness (Kruskal–Wallis p<0.01, n=39). EVs were more frequently released from ray cilia tips adjacent to the stimulus; dorsal vs ventral release differences were quantified (n=56 vs 42, two‑proportion Z‑test) (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2020; bioRxiv, 2020) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 5-6, wang2020polycystin2ciliaryextracellular pages 1-4, wang2020polycystin2ciliaryextracellular pages 4-6). During mating, male-derived PKD‑2::GFP EVs are deposited onto the hermaphrodite vulval cuticle, with no EVs detected inside the uterus (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2020) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 5-6, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 2-5).
- Dynamic sustained release. Time-lapse in vivo imaging shows cilia can sustain PKD‑2 tip EV release for up to approximately two hours without synaptic transmission; sustained release requires ciliary-intrinsic membrane replenishment mechanisms (Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2024) (wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6).

Regulators and interacting partners
- Trafficking/EV regulators. Distal tip enrichment of PKD‑2 and tip EV release require the myristoylated coiled‑coil protein CIL‑7 and motor activity from kinesin‑3 KLP‑6 and IFT kinesin‑2; blocking tip shedding increases base shedding (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021; bioRxiv, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4). Under mating‑partner exposure, males alter EV cargo composition, increasing the PKD‑2:CIL‑7 EV ratio (per-animal mean PKD‑2 EVs 28.7 ± 31.4 in virgins vs 47.9 ± 64.4 with partners; CIL‑7 EVs 36.9 ± 33.9 vs 26.6 ± 33.0) (Wang et al., 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 6-7).
- Sustained‑release machinery. Extended (but not initial) PKD‑2 tip EV release requires the transition‑zone protein NPHP‑4 and the dihydroceramide desaturase ortholog TTM‑5 (ceramide pathway); ttm‑5 is enriched in EV‑releasing neurons and localizes to cilia (Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2024) (wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6).
- EV cargo recruitment by polycystins. Using an EV‑TurboID proximity labeling strategy, polycystin complexes were shown to recruit distinct EV cargoes: PACL‑1 (channel‑like), PAML‑1/2 (transmembrane C‑type lectins, with dorsoventral bias), and TRAF‑family adaptors TRF‑1/2. Loading of these components into cilia/EVs relies on LOV‑1, and trf/paml/pacl mutants show impaired response and vulva‑location behaviors (Nikonorova et al., bioRxiv, 2024; Nature Communications, 2025) (nikonorova2024polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 3-5, nikonorova2025polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 13-14).

Behavioral roles and quantitative phenotypes
- Genetic pathway and behavior. pkd‑2 and lov‑1 act in the same pathway controlling male mating behaviors; loss impairs response to contact and vulva location (Barr and Sternberg, Nature, 1999; Barr et al., Current Biology, 2001) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4). PKD‑2 EV shedding is modulated by partner presence (above); individual detonation-like bursts at the tip can release several to hundreds of EVs (Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2021; Current Biology, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).

Recent developments (2023–2024 priority) and latest research
- Ciliary intrinsic control of sustained EV release (2023/2024). Cilia maintain extended PKD‑2 EV output via transition‑zone and lipid pathway factors (NPHP‑4, TTM‑5), independent of synaptic transmission; authors estimate that a cilium’s membrane area is roughly equivalent to about 60 EVs, highlighting the need for rapid membrane replenishment during sustained release (Wang et al., bioRxiv, posted Nov 3, 2023; updated 2024) (wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6).
- Polycystin‑guided EV cargo recruitment (2024). A modular EV‑TurboID method mapped PKD‑2/LOV‑1 EV microenvironments and uncovered LOV‑1‑dependent loading of PACL‑1, PAMLs, and TRF‑1/2 to specific EV subtypes, linking polycystin complexes to cargo selection and male‑mating behaviors (bioRxiv Apr 17, 2024; DOI 10.1101/2024.04.17.588758) (nikonorova2024polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 3-5). These findings advanced into peer-reviewed publication (Nature Communications, Apr 2025) consolidating the recruitment model and behavioral impact (nikonorova2025polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 13-14).

Applications and real-world implementations
- C. elegans as a model for polycystin biology and ciliopathies. The worm system provides in vivo access to ciliary trafficking, EV biogenesis, and polycystin complex function, paralleling conserved features with vertebrate cilia and informing ADPKD-related pathways (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021; Nikonorova et al., Current Biology, 2022; Walsh et al., 2022) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, nikonorova2022isolationprofilingand pages 1-3, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4). The MyEVome resource and large-scale EV proteome (2,888 proteins) facilitate cross-tissue and cell-type inference for EV cargo, including ciliary proteins (Nikonorova et al., 2022) (nikonorova2022isolationprofilingand pages 1-3).
- Mechanosensitive EV signaling during mating as a paradigm. The directional deposition of PKD‑2 EVs onto hermaphrodite vulva establishes a tractable model to study inter-animal EV transfer, cargo targeting, and potential antimicrobial or re-mating modulation functions suggested by EV cargo signatures (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2020; 2021) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 2-5, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).

Expert perspectives
- Current expert consensus frames ciliary EVs as regulated outputs of sensory cilia, with the polycystin complex acting both as a sensory hub and as a cargo organizer for EV subtype specialization; kinesin motors and ciliary membrane microdomains orchestrate where and when EVs bud (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021; Akella and Barr, Developmental Neurobiology review, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4). The newest work places emphasis on transition zone gating and lipid remodeling in sustaining prolonged EV output, adding physiological depth to earlier trafficking-centric models (Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2024) (wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6).

Relevant statistics and quantitative data (selected)
- Mechanoresponsive release: padded vs bare coverslip imaging, Kruskal–Wallis p<0.01 (n=39); dorsal vs ventral ray release, two-proportion Z‑test (n=56 dorsal, n=42 ventral) (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2020; bioRxiv, 2020) (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 5-6, wang2020polycystin2ciliaryextracellular pages 4-6, wang2020polycystin2ciliaryextracellular pages 1-4).
- EV site prevalence: base EVs observed in all cilia examined (n=35); tip EV shedding observed in 25/35 (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).
- Partner‑dependent EV modulation: mean per‑animal counts show PKD‑2 EVs 28.7 ± 31.4 (virgins) vs 47.9 ± 64.4 (with partners); CIL‑7 EVs 36.9 ± 33.9 vs 26.6 ± 33.0 (Wang et al., Current Biology, 2021) (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 6-7).
- Sustained release capacity: continuous PKD‑2 tip EV shedding sustained up to ~2 hours; ciliary membrane approximates the area of ~60 EVs, indicating substantial membrane turnover needs (Wang et al., bioRxiv, 2024) (wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6).

Key concepts and definitions (consolidated)
- PKD‑2: C. elegans polycystin‑2/TRPP2 family ciliary channel localized to male sensory cilia; functions with LOV‑1/PKD‑1 in mating behavior and EV signaling (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3).
- EV subtypes: tip‑derived environmental EVs vs PCM‑derived base EVs with differing marker content and regulation (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4).
- Regulators: CIL‑7 (myristoylated), KLP‑6 (kinesin‑3), IFT kinesin‑2 for tip sorting/shedding; NPHP‑4 and TTM‑5 (DEGS) for sustained release (wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, wang2024ciliaryintrinsicmechanisms pages 3-6, wang2021sensoryciliaacta pages 1-4).
- Cargo recruitment: Polycystin complexes recruit defined cargo (PACL‑1, PAML‑1/2, TRF‑1/2) into EVs, often LOV‑1‑dependent; associated mutants exhibit mating behavior deficits (nikonorova2024polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 3-5, nikonorova2025polycystinsrecruitcargo pages 13-14).

Notes on gene symbol ambiguity
- We verified organism specificity (C. elegans) and the polycystin/TRPP2 family identity of pkd‑2 throughout all cited work. If encountering pkd2 literature in other organisms (e.g., human PKD2), do not conflate; all evidence here is worm-specific and cross-validated with conserved polycystin biology (wang2020releaseandtargeting pages 1-2, wang2021sensoryciliaact pages 1-3, walsh2022trackingnand pages 2-4).
