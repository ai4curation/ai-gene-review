description: PKD-2 (Polycystin-2) is a calcium-permeable TRP (transient receptor
  potential) cation channel that is the C. elegans ortholog of human PKD2/TRPP2.
  It functions together with LOV-1 (the PKD1 ortholog) in male-specific sensory 
  neurons (ray neurons, hook neurons, and CEM neurons) where it localizes to 
  sensory cilia and is required for male mating behaviors including response to 
  hermaphrodite contact and vulva location. PKD-2 acts as an intracellular 
  calcium release channel that accelerates Ca2+ release from intracellular 
  stores, working alongside IP3 and ryanodine receptors. Its ciliary 
  localization is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-534 by CK2 and 
  dephosphorylation by calcineurin. The LOV-1/PKD-2 complex represents an 
  evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory receptor-channel system.

  review:
    summary: PKD-2 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with 6 transmembrane 
      helices and a pore-forming region (PMID:11553327). Membrane localization 
      is well-established across all PKD2 family members phylogenetically.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PKD-2 is a classic ion channel with multiple transmembrane domains. 
      This IBA annotation is appropriate and supported by extensive experimental
      evidence including GFP fusion studies showing membrane localization 
      (PMID:11553327).

  review:
    summary: PKD-2 functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel, directly 
      demonstrated by electrophysiological studies in C. elegans 
      (PMID:15862350). This is a core molecular function conserved across the 
      TRPP family.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a core molecular function of PKD-2. The IBA annotation is

      are proposed to act as sensors of the extracellular environment.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This is a well-supported function for the polycystin complex. The 
      LOV-1/PKD-2 complex functions similarly to mammalian PC1/PC2 as
