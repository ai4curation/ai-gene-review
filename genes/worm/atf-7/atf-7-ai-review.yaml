description: ATF-7 is a CREB/ATF family bZIP transcription factor that functions as
  the key downstream effector of the PMK-1 p38 MAPK innate immune signaling pathway
  in C. elegans. It is a direct substrate of PMK-1 and undergoes phosphorylation-dependent
  switching from a transcriptional repressor to an activator upon pathogen infection.
  ATF-7 binds to CRE-like DNA elements (5'-GACgTCA-3' consensus) and directly regulates
  the transcription of over 50% of all pathogen-induced genes, including antimicrobial
  effectors such as C-type lectins and lysozymes. Beyond innate immunity, ATF-7 also
  regulates serotonin biosynthesis in ADF chemosensory neurons and metallothionein
  expression in response to metal ions and oxidative stress. ATF-7 cooperates with
  the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 for p38-dependent immune gene induction in the
  intestine. It is expressed primarily in intestinal cells and localizes to the nucleus
  and chromatin.

    summary: ATF-7 is a bZIP transcription factor that directly binds DNA and regulates
      RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. ChIP-seq demonstrated ATF-7 binding
      to promoter regions of target genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner (PMID:30789901).

      immune signaling
    supporting_text: elegans ATF-7, a member of the conserved cyclic AMP-responsive
      element binding (CREB)/activating transcription factor (ATF) family of basic-region
      leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and an ortholog of mammalian ATF2/ATF7,
      has a pivotal role in the regulation of PMK-1-mediated innate immunity
  - statement: ATF-7 switches from repressor to activator upon phosphorylation by
      PMK-1

  - statement: ATF-7 physically interacts with PMK-1
    supporting_text: We used a mutated version of PMK-1 that does not have kinase
      activity to establish that ATF-7 and PMK-1 physically interact. Immunoprecipitation
      using the T7 antibody, followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA, revealed an
      HA-PMK-1(kinase-dead)-T7-ATF-7 interaction that was dependent on the activated
      form of PMK-1

      \ under the control of the endogenous promoter and 3\u2032 UTR was strongly\
      \ expressed in the nuclei of intestinal cells"

  title: Global transcriptional regulation of innate immunity by ATF-7 in C. elegans.
  findings:
  - statement: ATF-7 regulates over 50% of all pathogen-induced genes
    supporting_text: We observed that 70% of genes significantly induced two-fold
      or greater by P. aeruginosa exposure were no longer fully induced upon loss
      of pmk-1, and that 53% of upregulated genes were no longer fully induced upon
      loss of atf-7

      enrichment for the motif GACgTCA, which corresponds to the Jun D bZIP motif

  - statement: ATF-7 chromatin occupancy is PMK-1-dependent at pathogen-induced genes
    supporting_text: ATF-7 is preferentially located at the promoter regions of genes
      that are increased in expression by P. aeruginosa, and that this enrichment
      for ATF-7 is lessened by pmk-1 loss

      lgg-1)

      by P. aeruginosa, without affecting survival on non-pathogenic E. coli

suggested_questions:
- question: What are the specific phosphorylation sites on ATF-7 that are modified
    by PMK-1, and how do they affect ATF-7's switch from repressor to activator?
- question: Does ATF-7 form heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors, and
    how does dimerization affect target gene specificity?
- question: What is the mechanism by which ATF-7 represses transcription in its unphosphorylated
    state - does it recruit corepressors or block activator access?
suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: Specific phosphorylation sites on ATF-7 control its switch from repressor
    to activator
  description: Mass spectrometry analysis of ATF-7 phosphorylation sites in wild-type
    vs pmk-1 mutant backgrounds, with and without pathogen exposure. This would identify
    specific PMK-1-dependent phosphorylation sites and enable structure-function analysis
    of the repressor-to-activator switch.
- hypothesis: ATF-7 dimerization partners and co-regulators determine target gene
    specificity
  description: Co-IP/mass spectrometry to identify ATF-7 dimerization partners and
    transcriptional co-regulators in different conditions. This would reveal how ATF-7
    achieves target gene specificity and functional diversity in immune vs stress
    responses.
