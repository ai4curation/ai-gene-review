this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Comprehensive research report: C. elegans atf-7 (UniProt Q86MD3)

Verification of identity and scope
- Gene/protein: atf-7 (locus C07G2.2), a CREB/ATF-family basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor in Caenorhabditis elegans; orthologous to mammalian ATF2/ATF7/CREB5. This matches UniProt Q86MD3. The foundational genetic and biochemical work places ATF-7 downstream of the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway in immunity (Shivers et al., 2010). ATF-7 localizes to intestinal nuclei, consistent with a transcription factor role in gut immunity (Shivers et al., 2010) (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8, pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 57-64, pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 40-45).

1) Key concepts and definitions with current understanding
- Molecular function: ATF-7 is a transcription factor that toggles between repressor and activator modes depending on phosphorylation by PMK-1 (p38 MAPK). In the absence of stress or infection, ATF-7 represses PMK-1-regulated immune genes; upon pathogen-triggered PMK-1 activation, ATF-7 is phosphorylated and switches to an activator that induces antimicrobial effectors (e.g., C-type lectins, lysozymes) (Shivers et al., 2010; Fletcher et al., 2019) (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 9-10).
- Pathway position: ATF-7 is the principal downstream transcriptional effector of the canonical TIR-1→NSY-1 (MAP3K)→SEK-1 (MAP2K)→PMK-1 (p38 MAPK) innate immune signaling cascade in the intestine (summarized in Kim & Ewbank, WormBook) (pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 30-36, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Cellular and tissue localization: Functional action is nuclear in intestinal epithelial cells, the primary immune tissue in C. elegans (Shivers et al., 2010) (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritize 2023–2024)
- Drug/toxin resilience via PMK-1→ATF-7: In adults (post-mitotic soma), cisplatin exposure activates PMK-1 and ATF-7; an upstream IRE-1/TRF-1 module engages the p38 pathway. Proteomics identified hundreds of cisplatin-induced, PMK-1-dependent proteins; several innate immune effectors (catp-3, clec-4, dod-24, lys-1) require intact PMK-1 signaling for induction and protection from necrotic death (Raj et al., 2023, Nature Communications; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; published May 2023) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7).
- Bioactive modulation: A designed antimicrobial peptide (2K4L) protected C. elegans during bacterial challenge while reducing p38 phosphorylation and modulating expression of PMK-1/ATF-7 pathway genes (Ji et al., 2024, Scientific Reports; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9; July 2024) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Host–pathogen modeling reviews: A 2024 review emphasizes intestinal PMK-1→ATF-7 as central to defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, integrating surveillance of cellular stress and neuroendocrine control (Hajdú et al., 2024, IJMS; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034; June 2024) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Reproductive axis during infection: Exposure to pathogenic P. aeruginosa induces germline mitotic quiescence and apoptosis; infection-response mutants show altered kinetics (pmk-1, zip-2) although ATF-7 was not directly tested in the excerpted pages (Bollen et al., 2024, Genetics; URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyad197; Nov 2024) (bollen2024germlinemitoticquiescence pages 3-5).

3) Primary functions, pathways, and localization in detail
- Mechanism of action: ATF-7 physically interacts with PMK-1 and is phosphorylated in a PMK-1–dependent manner. A classic atf-7 gain-of-function allele (qd22, P58S) behaves as a phosphorylation-defective repressor that impairs induction of PMK-1 targets; intragenic suppressors restore function. Genetic epistasis shows ATF-7 is required for pathogen-induced activation of PMK-1-regulated genes while repressing them basally (Shivers et al., 2010) (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8, pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 40-45).
- Genome-wide regulation: RNA-seq and ATF-7 ChIP-seq demonstrate that the PMK-1–ATF-7 module regulates the majority of pathogen-induced genes during P. aeruginosa infection. ATF-7 occupies regulatory regions of these genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner; functional RNAi of ATF-7-bound, induced genes increases susceptibility to infection (Fletcher et al., 2019; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007830; Feb 2019) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 9-10).
- Tissue/subcellular site of action: ATF-7 and PMK-1 act in the intestine for immune defense. ATF-7 function is nuclear; PMK-1 shows regulated localization with stress (e.g., heat-induced nuclear translocation) (Shivers et al., 2010; Mertenskötter et al., 2013; URL: https://doi.org/10.1007/s12192-012-0382-y; May 2013) (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Upstream inputs beyond pathogens: The IRE-1/TRF-1 module activates PMK-1→ATF-7 under cisplatin, linking ER stress sensors to innate immune transcription in post-mitotic tissues (Raj et al., 2023) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13).

4) Roles in innate immunity, stress physiology, and aging/immunosenescence
- Innate immunity: ATF-7 is essential for pathogen-induced transcriptional responses and resistance to Gram-negative pathogens (P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens); the PMK-1 pathway with ATF-7 provides pathogen-specific responses distinct from SKN-1–mediated oxidative stress (Pagano dissertation excerpt; Shivers et al., 2010) (pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 57-64, shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8).
- Heavy metals and ROS: ATF-7 regulates cadmium-inducible metallothionein mtl-1; PMK-1 and insulin pathway components (PDK-1, AKT-1/2) also contribute, suggesting conserved control of ROS-handling genes and potential links to longevity (Hall et al., 2017, PLoS ONE; URL: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177432; June 2017) (pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 30-36).
- Heat stress and proteostasis: PMK-1 supports chaperone expression and heat tolerance, consistent with p38-mediated activation of stress transcription (Mertenskötter et al., 2013) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Aging and immunosenescence: Reviews highlight PMK-1/ATF-7’s contribution to age-related immune decline and its crosstalk with SKN-1 and ZIP-10 (Kim et al., 2022, Immunity & Ageing; URL: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-022-00314-8; Nov 2022) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).

5) Quantitative data and statistics from recent and core studies
- Genome-wide response to infection: During PA14 infection, 890 genes were ≥2-fold upregulated and 803 downregulated; PMK-1–ATF-7 signaling controlled over half of pathogen-induced genes. Of 43 ATF-7-bound, infection-induced genes tested, RNAi of 13 increased susceptibility (Fletcher et al., 2019) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 9-10).
- Cisplatin stress proteomics: Cisplatin led to changes in 3,586 proteins (FDR<0.05), with 121 increased >2-fold and 158 decreased <−2-fold; the largest enriched category (166 proteins) were immune-related. Induction of clec-4, catp-3, dod-24, lys-1 required PMK-1 and the upstream IRE-1/TRF-1; mutants in these targets showed markedly reduced survival (Raj et al., 2023) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13).
- Pathogen defense phenotypes: atf-7 mutants display significant sensitivity to P. aeruginosa; multiple alleles and rescue experiments report p-values < 0.0001 in pathogenesis assays (Pagano excerpts; Shivers et al., 2010) (pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 40-45, pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 57-64, shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8).
- Bioactive modulation: 2K4L peptide attenuated p38 phosphorylation and altered PMK-1/ATF-7 pathway gene expression while protecting worms in infection models (Ji et al., 2024). Exact fold-changes are reported in the paper; directionality and protective outcome are clear (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).

6) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Chemical resilience screens: The PMK-1→ATF-7 axis is a mechanistic handle to identify compounds that modulate stress tolerance (e.g., cisplatin resilience via p38 activation; Raj et al., 2023). This suggests translational strategies for reducing chemotoxicity by engaging p38/ATF-7–dependent protective programs in post-mitotic tissues (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7).
- Anti-infective discovery: ATF-7–dependent transcriptional readouts (e.g., ATF-7 target reporters) can function as screening endpoints for host-directed anti-infective leads (e.g., 2K4L in worms and mouse sepsis model; Ji et al., 2024) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Nutraceuticals and stress modulators: Botanical polysaccharides enhanced pathogen resistance of radiation-damaged worms via intestinal PMK-1 with downstream SKN-1/ATF-7 engagement, illustrating a pipeline for nutraceutical evaluation against innate immune decline (Liu et al., 2022; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23095034; May 2022) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).

7) Expert opinions and integrative analyses
- Consensus model: Reviews and syntheses converge on a conserved metazoan principle—p38 MAPK phosphorylates ATF-family bZIPs to control stress and innate immune transcription, with C. elegans PMK-1→ATF-7 providing a genetically tractable exemplar (Kim & Ewbank, WormBook; 2018) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7).
- Network integration: ATF-7 binds regulatory regions of xbp-1 (UPR), skn-1 (oxidative stress), lgg-1 (autophagy), hlh-30/zip-2 (immunity), situating it as a node integrating multiple stress axes during infection or chemical stress (Fletcher et al., 2019) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2).

8) Specific signaling and biochemical pathway placement
- Upstream: TIR-1 (TIR-domain adaptor) → NSY-1 (MAP3K) → SEK-1 (MAP2K) → PMK-1 (p38) phosphorylates ATF-7. In post-mitotic adults and under cisplatin, IRE-1/TRF-1 can function upstream to trigger this module (Raj et al., 2023) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13).
- Downstream: ATF-7 directly regulates antimicrobial effectors (e.g., clec, lyso genes) and, secondarily, drivers of other stress pathways, thereby coupling innate immunity with proteostasis, UPR, and oxidative defenses (Fletcher et al., 2019) (fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2).

9) Gene targets and biological outputs (examples)
- Direct/functional targets implicated in defense and stress: clec-4, clec-66, lys-1, dod-24, catp-3 (Raj et al., 2023) and many C-type lectins/lysozymes genome-wide (Fletcher et al., 2019). Knockdown or mutation increases pathogen susceptibility or cisplatin sensitivity (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2).
- Metallothionein regulation linking immunity and metal detoxification: mtl-1 induction requires ATF-7, PMK-1, and insulin-pathway nodes, supporting cross-talk to ROS and lifespan phenotypes (Hall et al., 2017) (pagano2014geneticanalysisof pages 30-36).

10) Limitations and open questions
- Phosphosite mapping: Although PMK-1 phosphorylation of ATF-7 is well supported functionally and biochemically, exact phosphorylation sites in vivo remain to be fully defined in the provided excerpts. Interplay with other PTMs and co-factors under distinct stresses requires further resolution (review synthesis) (balasubramaniam2025unzippingthedefense pages 8-9).
- Germline link to ATF-7: 2024 germline-infection work quantifies PMK-1-dependent kinetics but the direct role of ATF-7 in these germline effects was not detailed in the excerpted material (bollen2024germlinemitoticquiescence pages 3-5).

Overall conclusions
ATF-7 (Q86MD3) is the bZIP transcriptional switch that operationalizes PMK-1/p38 signaling into broad, tissue-specific (intestinal) immune and stress transcription in C. elegans. Foundational work established the PMK-1 phosphorylation–dependent repressor→activator mechanism and intestinal nuclear localization. Genome-scale studies show ATF-7 directly governs over half of the pathogen-induced transcriptome and binds regulatory nodes connecting immunity with UPR, autophagy, and oxidative stress. Recent (2023–2024) work extends ATF-7’s relevance beyond classical infection models to clinically relevant contexts: chemotherapy resilience via IRE-1/TRF-1→p38→ATF-7 signaling and modulation by bioactive peptides. These findings emphasize ATF-7 as a central, conserved control point for host defense and stress physiology across life stages and stressors (shivers2010phosphorylationofthe pages 6-8, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 4-7, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 1-2, fletcher2019globaltranscriptionalregulation pages 9-10, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 10-13, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, bollen2024germlinemitoticquiescence pages 3-5).
