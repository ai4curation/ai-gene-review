description: CLPP-1 is the proteolytic subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent
  ClpXP protease complex in C. elegans. It is a serine-type endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.92)
  of the peptidase S14 family that forms a tetradecameric barrel composed of two heptameric
  rings in the mitochondrial matrix. CLPP-1 functions with the ClpX ATPase to degrade
  unfolded, misfolded, or damaged matrix proteins. Beyond its housekeeping proteolytic
  role, CLPP-1 is essential for signaling the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
  (UPR-mt) by generating peptide signals that are exported from the mitochondria via
  HAF-1 to activate nuclear transcription factors including DVE-1/UBL-5 and ATFS-1.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CLPP-1 is the proteolytic core of the ClpXP protease complex. The protein
      forms a homo-oligomeric barrel (two heptameric rings) that assembles with ClpX
      ATPase to form the functional ATP-dependent protease in the mitochondrial matrix.
      This annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic inference from characterized
      ClpP proteins across species.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation correctly identifies CLPP-1 as part of the endopeptidase
      Clp complex. CLPP-1 assembles as a homo-oligomeric barrel that partners with
      the AAA+ ATPase ClpX to form the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease. The ClpP proteolytic
      chamber requires association with ClpX ATPase for substrate recognition and
      unfolding.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CLPP-1, as the proteolytic subunit of the ClpXP complex, degrades misfolded
      and damaged proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. This represents a core housekeeping
      function of the protein, providing protein quality control within the mitochondria.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation correctly captures the protein quality control function
      of CLPP-1. As the proteolytic core of ClpXP, CLPP-1 degrades unfolded or selected
      proteins that are recognized, unfolded, and translocated by ClpX into the CLPP-1
      chamber.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CLPP-1 is a serine-type endopeptidase belonging to the peptidase S14
      family. The protein contains conserved ClpP catalytic motifs with active site
      serine and histidine residues essential for proteolytic activity (EC 3.4.21.92).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation correctly identifies the serine-type endopeptidase
      activity of CLPP-1. This is a core molecular function supported by domain architecture
      (ClpP domain with conserved Ser and His active sites), family membership (peptidase
      S14), and experimental validation in C. elegans.

    label: ATP-dependent peptidase activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: CLPP-1 as the proteolytic subunit of the ClpXP complex exhibits ATP-dependent
      peptidase activity. While CLPP-1 itself does not hydrolyze ATP (that function
      resides in ClpX), the functional complex requires ATP hydrolysis by ClpX for
      substrate unfolding and translocation into the CLPP-1 proteolytic chamber.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation is accurate for the ClpXP holoenzyme function. ATP
      hydrolysis is required for CLPP-1-mediated proteolysis in vivo. In isolated
      C. elegans mitochondria, ATP-dependent matrix proteolysis is CLPP-dependent
      and can be inhibited by the ClpP inhibitor LY-CMK.

    label: ATPase binding

  review:
    summary: CLPP-1 binds to the AAA+ ATPase ClpX to form the functional ClpXP protease
      complex. This interaction is essential for CLPP-1 function as ClpX provides
      substrate recognition, unfolding, and translocation into the CLPP-1 proteolytic
      chamber.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The IBA annotation correctly identifies the ATPase binding function of
      CLPP-1. CLPP-1 partners with ClpX ATPase to form the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease.
      This is a conserved feature of all ClpP proteases that require AAA+ ATPase partners

    action: ACCEPT
    reason: This IEA annotation is redundant with the IDA annotation for the same

      2007. clpp-1(RNAi) attenuates UPR-mt activation, blocking DVE-1 nuclear redistribution

    reason: This is a core biological process annotation with strong experimental
