description: CGH-1 (Conserved Germline Helicase 1) is a DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA
  helicase and the C. elegans ortholog of yeast Dhh1p/human DDX6/Drosophila Me31B.
  It is germline-enriched, localizing to P granules (germ granules) and P-bodies (processing
  bodies), where it functions in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation. CGH-1 is essential
  for gametogenesis in both sexes and plays a protective role against physiological
  germline apoptosis - loss of cgh-1 was the first identified stimulus that triggers
  excessive germline apoptosis. CGH-1 forms RNA-dependent complexes with CAR-1, PAB-1,
  and OMA-1/2, functioning in translational repression and maternal mRNA protection
  during oogenesis. The protein also contributes to P-body assembly and is involved
  in stress granule dynamics.

    summary: CGH-1 localization to P-bodies is well-supported by phylogenetic inference.
      The yeast ortholog Dhh1p is a core component of P-bodies, and direct experimental
      evidence in C. elegans confirms CGH-1 localizes to P-bodies (PMID:16207815,
      PMID:24367695).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: IBA annotation is consistent with experimental IDA evidence in C. elegans
      showing CGH-1 localizes to P-bodies. P-body localization is a conserved feature
