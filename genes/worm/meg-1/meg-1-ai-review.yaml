description: 'MEG-1 (maternal-effect germ cell defective 1) is an intrinsically disordered,
  serine-rich protein that is a core component of P granules during embryonic germline
  segregation in C. elegans. MEG-1 is expressed maternally and localizes exclusively
  to P granules from the 4-8 cell stage through early embryogenesis, with expression
  diminishing at the 100-cell stage. The protein functions redundantly with MEG-2
  to regulate P granule dynamics through phosphorylation-dependent phase transitions:
  phosphorylation by MBK-2/DYRK kinase promotes granule disassembly in anterior cytoplasm,
  while dephosphorylation by PP2A(PPTR-1/2) promotes assembly in posterior cytoplasm.
  MEG-1 is essential for proper P granule segregation during embryonic cell divisions,
  germ cell proliferation during larval development, and ultimately fertility. Loss
  of meg-1 causes P granule mis-segregation, underproliferation of larval germ cells,
  aberrant P granule morphology, and sterility. MEG-1 localization to P granules depends
  on the membrane-bound protein MES-1.'

      summary: MEG-1 is required for germ cell proliferation during larval 
        development. meg-1 mutants show underproliferation of germ cells 
        (PMID:18202375). The IGI annotation with meg-3 and meg-4 reflects that 
        MEG proteins contribute redundantly to germ cell viability and 
        proliferation (PMID:25535836, PMID:21305687). MEG-1 may function with 
        nanos family members nos-2 and nos-3 to promote germ cell proliferation.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation is well-supported by multiple publications. 
        PMID:18202375 states that meg-1 mutants exhibit underproliferation in 
        larval germ cells. PMID:25535836 demonstrates that MEG proteins are 
        required redundantly for fertility and germ cell development. The IGI 
        evidence from genetic interactions with other MEG family members is 
        appropriate.

    review:
      summary: MEG-1 in its phosphorylated form promotes P granule disassembly 
        in the anterior cytoplasm of pre-gastrulation embryos. This is a key 
        function of MEG proteins - phosphorylation by MBK-2 promotes granule 
        disassembly while dephosphorylation promotes assembly (PMID:25535836). 
        The annotation is supported by the finding that MEG-1 and MEG-2 
        knockdown results in defective P granule disassembly in anterior 
        cytoplasm.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately captures a specific aspect of MEG-1 
        function. The phosphorylated form of MEG-1 promotes P granule 
        disassembly. While MEG-1 also promotes assembly in its dephosphorylated 
        form, the disassembly annotation is correct and well-supported by 
        experimental evidence showing defective disassembly upon MEG-1/MEG-2 
        knockdown.

      summary: MEG-1 has documented physical interactions with PPTR-1, PPTR-2 
        (PP2A regulatory subunits), and PGL-1 (a P granule component) based on 
        PMID:25535836. However, 'protein binding' (GO:0005515) is an 
        uninformative annotation that does not describe the molecular function.
      action: MODIFY
      reason: GO curation guidelines recommend avoiding generic 'protein 
        binding' annotations when more specific terms are available. MEG-1 
        interacts with phosphatase subunits PPTR-1/PPTR-2 and with P granule 
        component PGL-1. More informative annotations would be phosphatase 
        binding or RNA granule component binding if such terms exist. 
        Alternatively, this should be removed as uninformative.

    review:
      summary: MEG-1 localizes to P granules during embryonic germline

        MEG-2 were first characterized as P granule components. The protein is 
        expressed in the P lineage from the 4-8 cell stage and localizes 
        exclusively to P granules during this developmental window.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This is a well-supported cellular component annotation with direct
        experimental evidence (IDA). PMID:18202375 clearly demonstrates that 
        MEG-1 encodes a protein that localizes exclusively to P granules during 
        embryonic germline segregation. The localization depends on MES-1.

    review:
      summary: MEG-1 in its dephosphorylated form promotes P granule assembly in
        the posterior cytoplasm. This annotation is missing from the existing 
        GOA annotations but is equally supported by the literature as P granule 
        disassembly. PMID:25535836 clearly states that dephosphorylated MEG 
        proteins promote assembly.

      reason: The current annotations include P granule disassembly but not P 
        granule assembly, despite MEG-1 being involved in both processes
