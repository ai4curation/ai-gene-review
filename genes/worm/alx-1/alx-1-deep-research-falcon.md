## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** P34552
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X 1; AltName: Full=Prion-like-(Q/N-rich) domain-bearing protein 58; AltName: Full=Protein YNK1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=alx-1; Synonyms=pqn-58; ORFNames=R10E12.1;
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** ALIX_V_dom. (IPR025304); BRO1_dom. (IPR004328); BRO1_sf. (IPR038499); ALIX_LYPXL_bnd (PF13949); BRO1 (PF03097)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "alx-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'alx-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **alx-1** (gene ID: alx-1, UniProt: P34552) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Comprehensive Research Report: alx-1 (C. elegans; UniProt P34552)

Identity verification and domain architecture
- Correct gene/protein: The C. elegans gene alx-1 (synonyms pqn-58; locus R10E12.1) encodes the sole worm ortholog of mammalian ALIX (PDCD6IP/AIP1) and yeast Bro1p, establishing it as a Bro1/ALIX-family ESCRT accessory protein. Shi’s worm-focused work explicitly identifies alx-1/pqn-58 as the C. elegans Alix/Bro1 homolog (ArXiv, 2010; URL: https://doi.org/10.7282/t33j3d2j). The organism context and symbol thereby match the UniProt entry (P34552) provided by the user (pqn-58 is a recorded synonym). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 30-35)
- Domains: Conserved ALIX architecture comprises an N-terminal Bro1 domain, a central V (ALIX_V) domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD). The Bro1 domain binds ESCRT-III CHMP4/Snf7; the V domain mediates YPXnL/LYPXL late-domain interactions; and the PRD scaffolds regulatory and ESCRT-I (TSG101) contacts. Reviews and experimental summaries concur on these features (e.g., Larios 2018, URL: https://doi.org/10.13097/archive-ouverte/unige:106922; Elias et al., Science Advances, 2023, URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3913). (larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50, elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)

Key concepts and current understanding
- Molecular role as ESCRT accessory: ALX-1/ALIX promotes recruitment and activation (closed-to-open transition) of ESCRT-III/CHMP4 polymerization via Bro1–CHMP4 binding, providing an ESCRT-0/–I/–II-independent entry point under some contexts. Mechanistically, ALIX can drive CHMP4 activation and organization at scission sites; NMR-guided analyses show ALIX triggers CHMP4 activation that is required for abscission. (Elias 2023, Science Advances, published July 2023; URL above). (elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)
- YPXnL/LYPXL binding by the V domain: The ALIX V domain is a reader for YPXnL/LYPXL motifs (e.g., retroviral Gag late domains), which explains its adaptor role in budding and related inverse-topology scission processes. This mode is conserved and underpins ALIX’s capacity to recruit ESCRT-III independent of ESCRT-I/II in some contexts. (Larios 2018; URL above). (larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)
- Lipid and ESCRT connectivity: ALIX cooperates with LBPA/BMP at late endosomes, and active ALIX can nucleate CHMP4 on endosomal membranes, supporting ALIX-dependent sorting of specific transmembrane cargo to ILVs. (Larios 2018; URL above). (larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)

C. elegans-specific experimental evidence: function, localization, phenotypes
- Function in endocytic recycling and MVB/late endosome pathways: In the intestine, ALX-1 physically interacts with the recycling regulator RME-1 and is required for basolateral recycling; alx-1 loss leads to accumulation of clathrin-independent recycling cargo (hTAC-GFP) and defective recruitment of the F-BAR protein SDPN-1 (syndapin) to basolateral endosomes. Quantitatively, alx-1 mutants show about a threefold increase in hTAC-GFP puncta and increased number/size of RME-1–positive endosomes, indicating ALX-1 acts to maintain recycling endosome organization and export capacity. (Shi 2010; URL: https://doi.org/10.7282/t33j3d2j). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 39-43)
- Degradative/MVB pathway contribution: alx-1 mutants exhibit delayed degradation of membrane cargo (e.g., CAV-1-GFP, RME-2-GFP), increased MVB/late endosome size and number (GFP–RAB-7, LMP-1-GFP), whereas early endosomes (RAB-5) are largely unaffected. The reported magnitude includes a roughly two-fold increase in MVE number/size in alx-1 mutants, consistent with impaired ILV sorting and/or maturation. (Shi 2010; URL above). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 43-48)
- Localization: ALX-1 localizes to basolateral recycling endosomes and to multivesicular/late endosomes in worm intestine; these localizations align with its biochemical interactions (RME-1/EH-domain interfaces and ESCRT/MVB machinery). (Shi 2010; URL above). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 7-9)

Cellular compartments and conserved roles beyond worm
- Midbody/abscission checkpoint: In metazoan cells, ALIX accumulates at the midbody and within abscission checkpoint bodies (ACBs), where ALIX contributes to ACB biogenesis/stability and to the timing of cytokinetic abscission. These roles are linked to ALIX’s capacity to recruit and activate CHMP4. (Elias 2023; Science Advances; published July 2023; URL above). (elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)
- Helical scaffolds with ESCRT-I in vivo: Recent in vivo imaging suggests ALIX co-assembles with ESCRT-I in helical scaffolds that interweave with CHMP4B filaments during abscission in human cells, reinforcing ALIX’s role as an upstream organizer of ESCRT-III at membrane necks. This is a 2024 preprint and thus should be considered preliminary (bioRxiv, posted May 2, 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.01.592080). (spada2024humanescrtiand pages 16-19, spada2024humanescrtiand pages 25-27)

Recent developments and latest research (emphasizing 2023–2024)
- Phase separation and PTM control: ALIX undergoes reversible phase separation into nondynamic condensates mediated by an amyloidogenic segment of its PRD. Src kinase–driven tyrosine phosphorylation and PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation toggle condensate dissolution/reformation, thereby modulating sequestration of CHMP4 paralogs and coordinating abscission timing through ACBs. These findings revise our understanding of ALIX regulation by linking condensate biology with ESCRT activation states and checkpoint control. (Science Advances, July 2023; URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg3913). (elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)
- Abscission scaffolding models: Preprint evidence indicates ALIX and ESCRT-I form scaffolding helical filaments that template ESCRT-III assembly and may contribute to genome partitioning within membrane neck lumens; perturbation delays abscission and produces chromatin segregation defects. Though in human cells, the conserved nature of ALIX/Bro1 suggests analogous organizing roles in metazoans generally. (bioRxiv, May 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.01.592080). (spada2024humanescrtiand pages 16-19, spada2024humanescrtiand pages 25-27)

Biochemical pathways and mechanistic roles
- MVB/ILV biogenesis: ALX-1 acts at late endosomes/MVBs, promoting CHMP4/ESCRT-III recruitment and ILV cargo sorting; its interaction with LBPA/BMP and ESCRT subunits supports an ESCRT-III–proximal role. Worm genetics demonstrate consequences of alx-1 loss consistent with impaired MVB sorting (enlarged late endosomes, delayed membrane cargo degradation). (Shi 2010; Larios 2018). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 43-48, larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)
- Endocytic recycling: ALX-1 partners with RME-1 to maintain basolateral recycling. Genetic interaction mapping supports a functional interface between RME-1’s C-terminal YPSL motif and ALX-1 NPF elements, influencing recruitment of actin-tubulation machinery (SDPN-1) and cargo export. (Shi 2010). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 43-48, shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 39-43)
- Cytokinesis/abscission: Conserved ALIX-mediated recruitment and activation of CHMP4 is required for proper timing and execution of abscission, with ALIX also contributing to ACB formation under checkpoint conditions. (Elias 2023). (elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)

Current applications and real-world implementations (conserved context)
- Viral budding and membrane scission: ALIX’s YPXnL/LYPXL binding and ESCRT-III recruitment are exploited by enveloped and quasi-enveloped viruses; mechanistic frameworks derived from ALIX-driven abscission apply to antiviral strategies targeting ALIX–CHMP4 and ALIX–TSG101 interfaces. While these are primarily demonstrated in mammalian systems, they illuminate conserved functional surfaces in ALIX-family proteins like ALX-1. (Larios 2018). (larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)

Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- ESCRT branching and ALIX as an alternative ESCRT-III nucleator: Reviews and experimental syntheses emphasize that ALIX can bypass canonical ESCRT-0/–I/–II routes under specific conditions by directly engaging CHMP4 via Bro1 and LBPA-enriched membranes, highlighting ALIX as a versatile adaptor/nucleator of ESCRT-III. (Larios 2018). (larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)
- Checkpoint control via condensates: The 2023 work positions ALIX as a regulatory hub integrating PTMs (tyrosine phosphorylation) with phase-separated biochemistry to choreograph abscission timing and safeguard genome integrity—an expert-level refinement of ALIX’s role beyond static scaffolding. (Science Advances, 2023). (elias2023reversiblephaseseparation pages 1-2)

Relevant statistics and quantitative data from worm studies
- Recycling defects: alx-1 mutants display ≈3-fold increase in hTAC-GFP puncta, indicating impaired clathrin-independent recycling; RME-1–positive endosome puncta number and size also increase significantly. (Shi 2010; URL: https://doi.org/10.7282/t33j3d2j). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 39-43)
- Late endosome/MVE abnormalities: alx-1 mutants exhibit ≈2-fold increases in MVE number/size and delayed degradation of membrane cargo such as CAV-1-GFP and RME-2-GFP, consistent with MVB sorting defects. (Shi 2010; URL above). (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 43-48)

Inference and limits
- Ambiguity check: The symbol “alx-1” can refer to a vertebrate ALX1 homeobox transcription factor unrelated to ESCRT. Here, identity is unambiguous due to the organism (C. elegans) and orthology/domain architecture consistent with Bro1/ALIX family. (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 30-35)
- Where worm-specific cytokinesis data for ALX-1 are limited, mechanistic roles are inferred from strong conservation of ALIX/Bro1 in metazoans and yeast and from direct worm evidence of ESCRT/MVB functions and CHMP4-related interfaces. (shi2010regulationofendocytic pages 43-48, larios2018regulationofescrt pages 45-50)
