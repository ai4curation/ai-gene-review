description: >-
  ALX-1 is the sole C. elegans ortholog of mammalian ALIX (PDCD6IP/AIP1) and yeast Bro1p,
  functioning as a Bro1/ALIX-family ESCRT accessory protein. It contains an N-terminal
  Bro1 domain (binds ESCRT-III CHMP4/Snf7), a central V (ALIX_V) domain (mediates YPXnL/LYPXL
  late-domain interactions), and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) that scaffolds
  regulatory and ESCRT-I contacts. ALX-1 has dual functions in endocytic recycling
  (via physical interaction with RME-1) and in MVB/late endosome cargo sorting for lysosomal
  degradation. It is required for post-internalization trafficking and degradation of
  LIN-12/Notch in vulval precursor cells.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is inferred by phylogenetic analysis from mammalian ALIX (PDCD6IP) and
      Drosophila ALiX (FBgn0086346). Mammalian ALIX has a well-established role in cytokinetic
      abscission, where it recruits and activates CHMP4/ESCRT-III at the midbody and contributes
      to abscission checkpoint body (ACB) formation. However, there is no direct experimental
      evidence for ALX-1 function in cytokinesis in C. elegans. The worm literature focuses on
      endosomal recycling and MVB functions (PMID:17997305, PMID:16236769).
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: >-
      While the IBA annotation is phylogenetically sound based on conserved ALIX function in
      mammals and flies, there is no C. elegans-specific experimental evidence for ALX-1 in
      cytokinesis. The annotation should be retained as non-core since ALIX family function
      in cytokinesis is evolutionarily conserved, but the primary characterized functions of
      ALX-1 in worm are in endocytic recycling and MVB sorting.

  review:
    summary: >-
      This annotation is phylogenetically inferred. ALX-1 localizes to both recycling endosomes
      and multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) in C. elegans intestine, as demonstrated by Shi et al. 2007
      (PMID:17997305). The IBA annotation to the generic term "endosome" is consistent with
      experimental data, though more specific localizations have been experimentally determined.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: >-
      The annotation is correct and well-supported by experimental evidence in C. elegans showing
      ALX-1 localization to endosomal compartments. The term is appropriately general as ALX-1
      functions at multiple endosomal subcompartments (recycling endosomes and MVEs).

      This is an automated annotation from ARBA. As a cytosolic protein that associates with

      extremely broad and provides little functional information.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED

      While technically correct, this IEA annotation to "cytoplasm" is too general to be

      This annotation is from Ruck et al. 2011, a study focused on BEC-1/Beclin1 function in

      The annotation is experimentally supported and consistent with ALX-1 function in basolateral

      This annotation indicates ALX-1 binds to LIN-12/Notch (WBGene00003001). The Shaye & Greenwald
      2005 paper identifies ALX-1 as required for post-internalization trafficking and degradation
      of LIN-12, but the paper shows ALX-1 affects LIN-12 subcellular localization and activity
      rather than demonstrating direct physical binding between ALX-1 and LIN-12.
    action: UNDECIDED

      The IPI evidence code suggests physical interaction was demonstrated, but the abstract
      of PMID:16236769 describes ALX-1 as "required for post-internalization trafficking and

      through its role in ESCRT/MVB sorting machinery. Without access to the full text to verify
