description: EPG-5 (Ectopic P granules protein 5) is a metazoan-specific autophagy
  tethering factor that functions as a RAB-7 effector to determine the fusion specificity
  of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes. EPG-5 binds RAB-7 on late endosomes/lysosomes
  and engages LGG-1 (C. elegans LC3/ATG8 ortholog) via conserved LIR motifs on autophagosomes.
  It coordinates the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP7/8 trans-SNARE machinery to promote correct
  autophagosome-lysosome fusion and prevent aberrant SNARE pairing. Loss of epg-5
  causes accumulation of non-degradative hybrid vesicles bearing both autophagosomal
  and endosomal markers, impaired lysosomal acidification, and defective autophagy
  flux. EPG-5 also functions in LAP (LC3-associated phagocytosis) to promote delivery
  of engulfed apoptotic cells to lysosomes. Human ortholog EPG5 mutations cause Vici
  syndrome, a severe multisystem disorder.

    label: cytoplasm
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: EPG-5 is localized to the cytoplasm with partial localization to late
      endosome/lysosome membranes and autophagosome-lysosome contact sites. The IBA
      annotation is consistent with the general cytoplasmic distribution of this protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: EPG-5 is a cytoplasmic protein that is recruited to late endosomes/lysosomes
      via RAB-7 interaction. The cytoplasm annotation accurately reflects the general
      localization of EPG-5 before it is recruited to specific membrane compartments
      for its fusion-tethering function.

  evidence_type: IBA

  review:
    summary: EPG-5 is essential for autophagosome maturation, functioning as a RAB-7
      effector that determines fusion specificity of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes.
      This is a core function of the protein conserved across metazoans.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Autophagosome maturation is a core function of EPG-5. The protein acts
      as a tethering factor that binds RAB-7 on late endosomes/lysosomes and LGG-1
      on autophagosomes, coordinating SNARE-mediated fusion. epg-5 mutants accumulate
      non-degradative autolysosomes indicating impaired maturation.

  review:
    summary: EPG-5 is involved in autophagy, specifically in the late autophagosome
      maturation/fusion step. This IEA annotation from UniProt keyword mapping is
      correct but more general than the specific function (autophagosome maturation).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: While GO:0097352 (autophagosome maturation) is more specific for EPG-5's
      function, the parent term GO:0006914 (autophagy) is not incorrect. The IEA annotation
      provides a valid broader annotation that complements the more specific IBA annotation.

    label: negative regulation of autophagosome assembly
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:24374177
  review:
    summary: This annotation suggests EPG-5 negatively regulates autophagosome assembly.
      However, EPG-5 functions at the autophagosome maturation step, not assembly.
      The observed increase in autophagosomes in epg-5 mutants is due to blocked fusion/degradation,
      not increased assembly rate.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation appears to be based on the observation that epg-5 mutants
      cause accumulation of autophagosomes. However, this accumulation results from
      impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation, not from increased autophagosome
      formation. EPG-5 acts downstream at the maturation step. The correct interpretation
      is that EPG-5 is involved in autophagosome maturation (GO:0097352) or autophagosome-lysosome
      fusion (GO:0061909). The term GO:1902902 misrepresents the mechanism.

      and demonstrated that it is required for starvation-induced autophagy. While
      autophagosome maturation is the more specific step, macroautophagy accurately

    action: NEW
    reason: PMID:20550938 demonstrated that EPG-5 is required for formation of degradative
      autolysosomes. Later work definitively established that EPG-5 is a Rab7 effector
      that determines the fusion specificity of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes.
      This term should be added with IMP evidence.
