description: DCT-1 (DAF-16/FOXO controlled germline tumor affecting-1) is the C. elegans
  ortholog of mammalian BNIP3/NIX, functioning as an outer mitochondrial membrane
  (OMM) mitophagy receptor. DCT-1 contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain for OMM
  localization and a conserved WXXL LIR (LC3-interacting region)-like motif that enables
  direct binding to LGG-1/Atg8 to recruit autophagosomes to mitochondria. DCT-1 operates
  in a genetic pathway with PINK-1 and PDR-1/Parkin; under oxidative stress, DCT-1
  is ubiquitinated at Lys-26 in a PINK-1-dependent manner. DCT-1 is transcriptionally
  regulated by DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf2, forming a homeostatic feedback loop that
  coordinates mitophagy with mitochondrial biogenesis. Loss of dct-1 leads to accumulation
  of dysfunctional mitochondria, increased ROS, decreased ATP, and shortened lifespan
  in long-lived mutants. DCT-1 also has ancestral roles in apoptosis, interacting
  with CED-3 and CED-9, though killing occurs through a BH3- and caspase-independent
  mechanism.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation inferred from phylogenetic analysis. DCT-1/ceBNIP3 has
      documented roles in programmed cell death pathways. Early studies showed DCT-1
      interacts with CED-9 (Bcl-2 homolog) and CED-3 (caspase) and can initiate apoptosis
      when overexpressed in mammalian cells (PMID:11114722, PMID:9824163). However,
      DCT-1 kills through a BH3- and caspase-independent mechanism, and the primary
      physiological function in C. elegans is mitophagy rather than apoptosis.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While DCT-1 has ancestral apoptosis-related functions inherited from the
      BNIP3 family, the primary characterized function in C. elegans is as a mitophagy
      receptor. The apoptotic function appears to be a secondary/ancestral role. IBA
      annotation is phylogenetically appropriate but represents a non-core function.

  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for nuclear localization. No direct experimental evidence
      for nuclear localization of DCT-1 in C. elegans was found in the literature
      reviewed. The primary localization is to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Some
      BNIP3 family members in mammals can localize to the nucleus, but this may not
      apply to DCT-1.
    action: UNDECIDED
    reason: The IBA inference is based on mammalian BNIP3/NIX data where some nuclear
      localization has been reported. However, all C. elegans experimental data describes
      mitochondrial localization. Without direct evidence in C. elegans, this annotation
      cannot be confidently accepted or rejected.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: IBA annotation for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
      BNIP3 family members in mammals can induce MOMP during apoptosis. DCT-1 in C.
      elegans interacts with CED-9/Bcl-2 and may influence mitochondrial membrane
      integrity, but its primary function is in mitophagy rather than MOMP-mediated
      apoptosis.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: While BNIP3 family proteins can influence MOMP, DCT-1's primary function
      in C. elegans is as a mitophagy receptor. The MOMP-related function may be an
      ancestral property but is not the core characterized function. DCT-1 kills through
      a BH3- and caspase-independent mechanism (PMID:11114722), suggesting the mechanism
      differs from classical MOMP.

core_functions:
- description: DCT-1 is the key mitophagy receptor in C. elegans. It is required for
    stress-induced mitophagy and works in a pathway with PINK-1 and PDR-1/Parkin.
    Loss of dct-1 leads to accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria with increased
    mass, decreased ATP, increased ROS, and membrane depolarization.

suggested_questions:
- question: Does DCT-1 interact directly with LGG-1/Atg8 in C. elegans?
- question: What is the physiological significance of DCT-1's apoptotic function vs
    mitophagy function?
suggested_experiments:
- hypothesis: DCT-1 directly binds LGG-1/Atg8 via its WXXL LIR-like motif
  description: Co-immunoprecipitation of DCT-1 and LGG-1 in C. elegans would directly
    demonstrate DCT-1-LGG-1 interaction in vivo.
- hypothesis: The WXXL motif is required for DCT-1-mediated mitophagy
  description: Structure-function analysis of DCT-1 WXXL motif in mitophagy. While
    mutation of the WXXL motif impairs stress resistance, direct demonstration that
    this is due to loss of LGG-1 binding would strengthen the mitophagy receptor function
    annotation.
