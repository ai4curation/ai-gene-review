1. **Check if the gene symbol "dct-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'dct-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **dct-1** (gene ID: dct-1, UniProt: Q09969) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Research report: dct-1 (C14F5.1) in Caenorhabditis elegans (UniProt Q09969)

Identity verification and gene/protein definition
- Gene/protein identity: The C. elegans gene dct-1 (locus C14F5.1) encodes DCT-1, the nematode homolog of mammalian BNIP3/NIX, a member of the NIP3 family of Bcl-2-interacting proteins. Foundational work in worms explicitly identifies DCT-1 as the BNIP3/NIX homolog and places it in the mitophagy receptor class (outer mitochondrial membrane proteins that recruit the autophagy machinery) (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 1-4). The organism is Caenorhabditis elegans, consistent with UniProt Q09969 (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 1-4).
- Protein family and domains: DCT-1 carries characteristic features of BNIP3-family mitophagy receptors, including a predicted transmembrane segment for mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM) targeting and a conserved WXXL motif that functions as an LC3-interacting region (LIR)-like sequence for binding to the Atg8/LC3 ortholog LGG-1; mutation of this motif impairs stress resistance (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 1-4). These features align with the NIP3/BNIP3 protein family annotation provided (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).

Key concepts and current understanding (function, mechanism, localization)
- Subcellular localization: DCT-1 is an integral OMM protein. In vivo imaging and protease protection assays show DCT-1::GFP co-localizes with mitochondrial markers and is proteinase K–accessible, consistent with OMM exposure; matrix HSP-60 is protected, confirming OMM localization (Nature 2015) (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11).
- Molecular function: DCT-1 acts as an OMM mitophagy receptor. It colocalizes with LGG-1/Atg8 and facilitates recruitment of the autophagy machinery to mitochondria, engaging receptor-mediated mitophagy similar to mammalian BNIP3/NIX (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 1-4, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3). DCT-1 functions in concert with the PINK-1–PDR-1 (Parkin) ubiquitin pathway; DCT-1 can be ubiquitinated (e.g., on K26) in a PINK-1–dependent manner and colocalizes with PDR-1 during mitophagy, a modification that supports mitophagy activation rather than proteasomal degradation (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8).
- Mechanistic motifs and interactions: DCT-1 contains a functional WXXL LIR-like motif that mediates interaction with LGG-1; disrupting this motif compromises stress resistance, consistent with a cargo-receptor role. Under oxidative/mitophagy-inducing stress, DCT-1 is ubiquitinated (K26) in a PINK-1–dependent manner and associates with PDR-1 (Parkin), integrating receptor- and ubiquitin-driven mitophagy mechanisms (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11). Reviews place DCT-1 within the BNIP3/NIX receptor paradigm that uses LIR motifs to bind LC3-family proteins (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 13-14).
- Tissue expression: dct-1 is broadly expressed from embryo through adulthood “in all somatic tissues of adult animals, including neurons, the pharynx, the intestine, body wall muscles and vulva muscles” (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11).

Regulatory network and pathway positioning
- Transcriptional regulation: dct-1 expression is induced by the longevity/stress transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf2. Genetic and reporter analyses show that both DAF-16 and SKN-1 are required to drive dct-1 expression and mitophagy under stress or reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling, forming a homeostatic feedback where mitochondrial dysfunction activates SKN-1 to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy genes including dct-1 (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8). Recent pharmacology demonstrates an additional axis: the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12/FXR upregulates HLH-30/TFEB and dct-1, linking steroid signaling to mitophagy control (Nature Aging 2023) (chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 6-10).
- Pathway interactions: DCT-1 functions within a common genetic pathway with PINK-1 and PDR-1 (Parkin) to execute mitophagy; DCT-1 overexpression confers stress protection that requires PINK-1 and PDR-1. Impairing dct-1, pink-1, or pdr-1 abrogates elevated autophagy in long-lived daf-2 (IIS-deficient) animals and shortens their lifespan, without markedly affecting basal autophagy or wild-type lifespan (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3). DCT-1 also interfaces with ubiquitin-binding cargo receptors such as SQST-1/p62 within PINK-1/PDR-1–dependent mitophagy, consistent with mixed receptor/ubiquitin pathways in the worm (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 13-14).
- Signaling crosstalk: Mitophagy deficiency leads to accumulation of damaged mitochondria and triggers a mitochondrial-to-nuclear retrograde response via SKN-1. Calcium signaling (elevated cytosolic Ca2+; modulation by CAMKII homolog UNC-43) participates in SKN-1 activation under mitophagy inhibition (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8). Evidence for direct AMPK regulation of dct-1 in C. elegans was not identified in the retrieved primary excerpts; regulation is clearly supported for DAF-16, SKN-1, and HLH-30 (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6).

Phenotypes and quantitative data
- Loss-of-function: dct-1 deletion or knockdown increases mitochondrial mass, produces fragmented/disorganized mitochondrial networks, membrane depolarization, decreased ATP, increased ROS, and elevated cytosolic Ca2+. In Nature 2015, dct-1 or pink-1 knockdown increased mitochondrial mass (e.g., n = 120; ***P < 0.001); SKN-1 reporter pgst-4::GFP was activated when mitophagy was inhibited (n = 180; ***P < 0.001) (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3). Reviews summarizing primary data in disease models reiterate reduced ATP, increased ROS and depolarization upon DCT-1 deficiency (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 13-14).
- Genetic interactions and lifespan: Loss of dct-1/pink-1/pdr-1 curtails longevity of mitophagy-boosted long-lived strains (e.g., daf-2, isp-1, clk-1, eat-2), indicating mitophagy via DCT-1 is a major contributor to lifespan extension in these contexts (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3). Chelation of calcium (EGTA) reduces SKN-1 activation and shortens the lifespan of mitophagy-deficient animals, supporting the calcium–SKN-1 axis under impaired mitophagy (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4).
- Gain-of-function: DCT-1 overexpression confers resistance to mitophagy stress, but this protection is lost when PINK-1 or PDR-1 are depleted, placing DCT-1 functionally within the PINK-1/PDR-1 pathway (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).

Recent developments (2023–2024) and applications
- Pharmacological induction via DAF-12→HLH-30→DCT-1: A 2023 Nature Aging study identified a drug-like benzocoumarin compound (MIC) that engages DAF-12/FXR, upregulates HLH-30/TFEB and dct-1, induces mitophagy, improves mitochondrial function, and extends lifespan. Lifespan extension is robust in wild type (example cohort: +32% median lifespan, p < 0.0001), but is abolished in daf-12, hlh-30, and dct-1 mutants, demonstrating that the DAF-12→HLH-30→DCT-1 axis is necessary for the pharmacological benefit (Nov 2023; https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00524-9) (chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 6-10). A preprint iteration offered additional quantitative data on HLH-30 activation (~6-fold promoter activity; ~2-fold HLH-30 protein increase) and oxygen consumption gains, with lifespan extension requiring dct-1 (Jul 2022; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1840028/v1) (chamoli2022adruglikemolecule pages 7-11).
- Neurodegeneration models: A 2024 review focusing on C. elegans Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models highlights DCT-1 as an OMM mitophagy receptor that interacts with LGG-1 and operates in PINK-1/PDR-1–dependent mitophagy. DCT-1 deficiency exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction (↑mitochondrial accumulation and depolarization, ↓ATP, ↑ROS), whereas pharmacologic mitophagy stimulation can rescue AD-related phenotypes in a DCT-1–dependent manner (Nov 2024; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13111343) (ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 13-14). Expert reviews in 2023 synthesize neuronal mitophagy evidence and underscore receptor-mediated mitophagy (including nematode DCT-1) as central for long-term neuronal homeostasis (Jun 2023; https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.260638) (chamoli2022adruglikemolecule pages 7-11), aligning with broader mechanistic frameworks (EMBO J 2021; https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020104705) (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).

Real-world implementations and tools
- In vivo mitophagy reporters: The mtRosella dual-fluorophore reporter enables tissue-resolved, quantitative assessment of mitophagy in C. elegans. Using mtRosella, DCT-1 is required for mitophagy induction under multiple stresses (e.g., heat, oxidative, mitochondrial stress, reduced IIS) and during aging (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 1-4). These assays are widely used in the field to screen mitophagy modulators and map pathway dependencies.
- Therapeutic exploration: The DAF-12–HLH-30–DCT-1 axis provides a tractable pharmacological entry point for inducing mitophagy in vivo. The Nature Aging 2023 study demonstrates drug-like engagement of this axis, showing efficacy and genetic specificity for mitophagy and lifespan endpoints in animals (chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 6-10).

Expert opinions and synthesis
- Authoritative reviews converge on a model in which DCT-1 is a central, receptor-class mediator of mitophagy in C. elegans, working with the PINK-1/PDR-1 system and responsive to transcriptional regulation by DAF-16, SKN-1, and HLH-30. These reviews position DCT-1 at the heart of mitochondrial quality control, organismal stress resistance, and aging, with implications for neurodegenerative disease modeling (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, chamoli2022adruglikemolecule pages 7-11, palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8).

Relevant statistics and data points (selected)
- dct-1 or pink-1 RNAi increases mitochondrial mass; example quantification reported with n = 120 animals, ***P < 0.001 (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11).
- SKN-1 retrograde response (pgst-4::GFP) activated by mitophagy inhibition; n = 180 animals, ***P < 0.001 (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).
- DCT-1 ubiquitination at K26 under mitophagy-inducing stress; PINK-1–dependent; DCT-1 colocalizes with PDR-1 (Parkin) (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-4, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).
- Pharmacology: MIC treatment increases wild-type lifespan (example cohort +32% median lifespan; p < 0.0001), with no significant benefit in dct-1(tm376), daf-12, or hlh-30 mutants (Nov 2023) (chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6). Preprint reports HLH-30 activation (~6× promoter; ~2× protein), improved respiration (~+88% OCR in one assay), and lifespan extension dependent on dct-1 (Jul 2022) (chamoli2022adruglikemolecule pages 7-11).

Limitations and open questions
- While DCT-1 clearly integrates receptor-mediated and ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy pathways with PINK-1/PDR-1, details such as the full complement of DCT-1 post-translational modifications, dimerization/oligomerization dynamics in vivo, and direct AMPK involvement in dct-1 transcriptional control in worms remain to be clarified in primary C. elegans studies (palikaras2015couplingmitogenesisand pages 4-8, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3).

Conclusion
DCT-1 (C14F5.1; UniProt Q09969) in C. elegans is an outer mitochondrial membrane mitophagy receptor of the BNIP3/NIX family. It uses a functional LIR-like WXXL motif to engage the autophagy machinery and works in a pathway with PINK-1 and PDR-1/Parkin, including PINK-1–dependent ubiquitination of DCT-1, to drive clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria. dct-1 is transcriptionally controlled by DAF-16 and SKN-1 and, as recent work demonstrates, can be pharmacologically induced through a DAF-12→HLH-30/TFEB axis that requires DCT-1 for lifespan benefits. Loss of dct-1 causes mitochondrial accumulation and dysfunction, while appropriate activation supports stress resistance and longevity, underscoring its central role in mitochondrial quality control and its translational potential as a mitophagy target (palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 8-11, palikaras2015coordinationofmitophagy pages 3-3, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 1-6, chamoli2023adruglikemolecule pages 6-10, ganguly2024mitochondrialqualitycontrol pages 14-15).
