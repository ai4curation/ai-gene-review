description: 'NPHP-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of human nephrocystin-1 (NPHP1), a
  protein mutated in nephronophthisis. It localizes specifically to the ciliary transition
  zone (TZ) in sensory neurons and functions as part of the NPHP module that works
  redundantly with the MKS module to establish the ciliary gate. NPHP-1 plays important
  roles in ciliary structure, sensory signal transduction, and male mating behaviors.
  The protein contains an SH3 domain and requires NPHP-4 for proper TZ localization.
  Together with NPHP-4, it regulates ciliary access of IFT machinery components, axonemal
  structural proteins, and signaling molecules.

    zone?
- question: Are there specific protein-protein interactions mediated by NPHP-1 that
    are essential for ciliary gate function?
suggested_experiments:
- description: Identify direct binding partners of NPHP-1 using immunoprecipitation
    or proximity labeling approaches
  hypothesis: NPHP-1 interacts with specific TZ proteins through its SH3 domain
- description: Determine if the SH3 domain is required for TZ localization using domain
    deletion constructs
  hypothesis: The SH3 domain mediates protein-protein interactions required for TZ
    anchoring
- description: Examine whether NPHP-1 is a structural component of Y-links using immuno-EM
  hypothesis: NPHP-1 may be a direct structural component of Y-link connectors
