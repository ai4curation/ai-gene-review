=== DeepTMHMM Analysis Instructions for LRX-1 ===

1. Go to: https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM

2. Paste this FASTA sequence:
{fasta}

3. Click "Run" and wait for results (~30 seconds)

4. Check the results for:
   - Signal peptide (SP) prediction
   - Transmembrane helix (TM) predictions
   - Overall topology classification
   - Probability plot showing confidence

5. Key questions to answer:
   - Is there a TM helix after the signal peptide?
   - What is the overall topology prediction?
   - Does it predict "SP+Globular" (secreted) or "SP+TM" (membrane)?

6. Expected result based on our analysis:
   - Signal peptide: YES (positions ~1-19)
   - TM helices: NONE
   - Topology: SP+Globular (secreted protein)
   
7. If DeepTMHMM predicts membrane protein:
   - Check the probability scores
   - Look at the specific region predicted as TM
   - Compare hydrophobicity of that region
