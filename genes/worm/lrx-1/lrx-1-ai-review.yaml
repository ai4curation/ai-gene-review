description: LRX-1 is a poorly characterized cysteine-rich protein of unknown function
  in C. elegans.  Despite its name suggesting "LRP cross-hybridizing", bioinformatic
  analysis reveals it is  NOT a true LRP family member. The protein contains 30 cysteines
  (8.1% of sequence) in  17 potential cysteine-rich regions, but these do NOT form
  canonical LDL receptor Class A  domains as incorrectly annotated. The protein lacks
  essential LRP features including  β-propeller and EGF-like domains, and is much
  smaller (369 aa) than true LRP proteins  (>4000 aa). Likely a secreted protein rather
  than membrane-bound, with C. elegans-specific  cysteine-rich domains of unknown
  structure and function. High-throughput screens identified  interactions with RSP-4,
  PFD-3, and PERM-4 (eggshell integrity protein), suggesting potential  involvement
  in extracellular matrix organization, though biological significance remains unclear.
