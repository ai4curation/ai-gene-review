  LRX-1 is a poorly characterized cysteine-rich protein of unknown function in C. elegans. 
  Despite its name suggesting "LRP cross-hybridizing", bioinformatic analysis reveals it is 
  NOT a true LRP family member. The protein contains 30 cysteines (8.1% of sequence) in 
  17 potential cysteine-rich regions, but these do NOT form canonical LDL receptor Class A 
  domains as incorrectly annotated. The protein lacks essential LRP features including 
  β-propeller and EGF-like domains, and is much smaller (369 aa) than true LRP proteins 
  (>4000 aa). Likely a secreted protein rather than membrane-bound, with C. elegans-specific 
  cysteine-rich domains of unknown structure and function. High-throughput screens identified 
  interactions with RSP-4, PFD-3, and PERM-4 (eggshell integrity protein), suggesting potential 
  involvement in extracellular matrix organization, though biological significance remains unclear.
