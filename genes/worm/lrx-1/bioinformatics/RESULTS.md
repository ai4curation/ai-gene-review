# LRX-1 Bioinformatics Analysis Results

## Executive Summary

Initial bioinformatics analysis of the C. elegans LRX-1 protein suggests it may have been misannotated. While described as having similarity to mammalian LRP2 receptor with multiple LDL receptor domains, detailed analysis in the lrx-1-bioinformatics directory reveals LRX-1 is likely a small secreted protein without canonical LDL-A domains or transmembrane regions.

## Key Findings

### Protein Characteristics
- **Length**: 368 amino acids
- **Predicted topology**: Secreted protein (signal peptide, no TM helices)
- **Cysteine content**: 30 cysteines (8.15%) in non-canonical patterns
- **Domain content**: No verified LDL-A or LRP-family domains detected

### Structural Analysis
- **Signal peptide**: Positions 1-19 (confirmed by DeepTMHMM)
- **Transmembrane helices**: 0 (contrary to UniProt annotation)
- **AlphaFold confidence**: Low overall (mean pLDDT 54.17)
- **Likely structure**: Cysteine-rich secreted protein of unknown fold

### Functional Implications
- NOT an LRP family protein despite nomenclature
- NOT a membrane protein as annotated
- Likely secreted with unknown function
- Cysteine-rich regions suggest disulfide-bonded structure
