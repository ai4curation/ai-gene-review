description: 'DAF-19 is the sole RFX-type transcription factor in C. elegans, functioning
  as the master regulator of ciliogenesis in sensory neurons. It activates expression
  of ciliary genes by binding to X-box promoter sequences. Multiple isoforms exist
  with distinct functions: DAF-19C is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons
  and is sufficient for ciliogenesis, while DAF-19A/B function in nonciliated neurons
  for synaptic maintenance. daf-19 mutants lack sensory cilia, are chemosensory defective,
  and form constitutive dauer larvae. DAF-19 also plays roles in innate immunity and
  serotonin biosynthesis in response to pathogenic bacteria, working with ATF-7 to
  regulate tph-1 expression in ADF neurons.'

    review:
      summary: DAF-19 is an RFX-type transcription factor that binds X-box 
        sequences in promoters of ciliary genes. RFX transcription factors are 
        known to recognize specific DNA sequences in cis-regulatory regions. The
        IBA annotation is phylogenetically inferred from other RFX family 
        members including mammalian orthologs that have been experimentally 
        characterized.
      action: ACCEPT
      reason: This annotation accurately reflects DAF-19's function as a 
        sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor. RFX family members 
        bind to X-box sequences. The IBA inference from characterized RFX 
        orthologs is well-supported and consistent with the UniProt domain 
        annotation showing an RFX-type winged-helix DNA-binding domain (aa 
        260-334).

    title: Distinct roles of transcription factors EGL-46 and DAF-19 in 
      specifying the functionality of a polycystin-expressing sensory neuron 
      necessary for C. elegans male vulva location behavior.
    findings:
      - statement: DAF-19 is the ciliogenic pathway regulator
        supporting_text: The ciliogenic pathway regulator DAF-19 affects 
          downstream components of the HOB-specific program indirectly and is 
          independent of EGL-46 activity.
      - statement: DAF-19 regulates a general ciliogenic program distinct from 
          cell-type-specific pathways
        supporting_text: This EGL-46- regulated program is specific to HOB and 
          is distinct from a general ciliogenic pathway functioning in all 
          ciliated neurons

      ciliogenesis and maintenance of synaptic activity.
    findings:
      - statement: DAF-19C specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons
        supporting_text: The short isoform DAF-19C is specifically expressed in 
          ciliated sensory neurons and sufficient to rescue all cilia-related 
          phenotypes of daf-19 mutants.
      - statement: DAF-19A/B function in nonciliated neurons for synaptic 
          maintenance
        supporting_text: In contrast, the long isoforms DAF-19A/B function in 
          basically all nonciliated neurons.
      - statement: daf-19 mutants lack cilia on 60 sensory neurons
        supporting_text: In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, lack of the RFX 
          transcription factor DAF-19 leads to the absence of cilia normally 
          found on 60 sensory neurons.
      - statement: daf-19 mutants have synaptic maintenance phenotypes
        supporting_text: We discovered behavioral and cellular phenotypes in 
          daf-19 mutants that depend on the isoforms daf-19a/b. These novel 
          synaptic maintenance phenotypes are reminiscent of synaptic decline 
          seen in many human neurodegenerative disorders.

        supporting_text: daf-19 is required for tph-1 expression in the ADF 
          neurons.
      - statement: DAF-19 works with ATF-7 to regulate immune genes
        supporting_text: We show that DAF-19 concerts with ATF-7, a member of 
          the activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP response 
          element-binding B (CREB) family of transcription factors, to regulate 
          tph-1 and antimicrobial genes, reminiscent of RFX-CREB interaction in 
          human immune cells.
      - statement: daf-19 mutants have heightened susceptibility to PA14
        supporting_text: daf-19 mutants display heightened susceptibility to 
          killing by PA14.
      - statement: DAF-19 suppresses hyperactive TIR-1 immunity
        supporting_text: A forward genetic screen for suppressors of the 
          hyperactive TIR-1 led to the identification of DAF-19, an ortholog of 
          regulatory factor X (RFX) transcription factors that are required for 
          human adaptive immunity.

          transition zone genes
        supporting_text: Mechanistic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans showed 
          that TMEM-107 controls ciliary composition and functions redundantly 
          with NPHP-4 to regulate cilium integrity, TZ docking and assembly of 
          membrane to microtubule Y-link connectors.

    description: DAF-19 is the sole RFX-type transcription factor in C. elegans.
      It binds to X-box promoter sequences and activates transcription of 
      ciliary genes. The RFX DNA-binding domain (aa 260-334) mediates 
      sequence-specific recognition of target promoters.
