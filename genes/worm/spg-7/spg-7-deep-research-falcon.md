## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q9N3T5
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=AFG3-like protein spg-7 {ECO:0000305}; EC=3.4.24.- {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Y4W6};
- **Gene Information:** Name=spg-7 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y47G6A.10}; ORFNames=Y47G6A.10 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:Y47G6A.10};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** In the C-terminal section; belongs to the peptidase M41
- **Key Domains:** AAA+_ATPase. (IPR003593); AAA_lid_3. (IPR041569); ATP-dep_Zn_Metalloprotease. (IPR050928); ATPase_AAA_core. (IPR003959); ATPase_AAA_CS. (IPR003960)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "spg-7" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'spg-7' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **spg-7** (gene ID: spg-7, UniProt: Q9N3T5) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Plan: We verified identity and domains, then gathered recent (2023–2024) authoritative reviews on mitochondrial AAA proteases to anchor function/localization and mechanistic roles. Direct, recent C. elegans spg-7 primary data proved limited in the retrieved evidence set; therefore, we clearly distinguish conserved-mechanism inferences from explicitly demonstrated findings in other systems.

Executive summary
spg-7 (UniProt Q9N3T5) in Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a conserved mitochondrial inner-membrane m-AAA metalloprotease subunit (peptidase M41 family) bearing an AAA+ ATPase module and a zinc-dependent protease domain. By strong conservation with mammalian AFG3L2/SPG7 complexes, spg-7 is expected to assemble into hexameric m-AAA protease complexes on the matrix side of the inner membrane to drive ATP-dependent protein processing and degradation central to mitochondrial protein quality control, biogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex assembly. Contemporary reviews (2023–2024) synthesize mechanistic roles of m-AAA proteases in processing OXPHOS subunits, ribosomal factors, and elements of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter machinery, linking activity to mitochondrial dynamics and stress signaling. Where C. elegans-specific experimental data are not directly available in our retrieved corpus, we explicitly indicate inference from orthologs. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 5-7, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and family: spg-7 encodes an m-AAA protease subunit (peptidase M41) with an N-terminal transmembrane region, AAA+ ATPase domain (Walker A/B and SRH motifs), and a C-terminal zinc metalloprotease active site (HExxH/HxxEH motif variants), characteristic of inner-mitochondrial-membrane AAA proteases that face the matrix. This architecture underpins ATP-driven substrate engagement and threading into the proteolytic chamber for processing. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5)
- Subcellular localization: m-AAA proteases (including SPG7 orthologs) reside in the inner mitochondrial membrane with catalytic activity on the matrix side, executing proteolysis and chaperone-like processing that maintain mitochondrial proteostasis and support biogenesis. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)
- Assembly and mechanism: m-AAA proteases function as homo- or hetero-hexamers; in mammals, AFG3L2 forms homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers with SPG7 (paraplegin). Substrate handling involves ATPase-mediated capture via pore loops, translocation, and proteolysis at the zinc-active site. Autocatalytic maturation and MPP processing are part of biogenesis. These principles inform spg-7 function in worm by conservation. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5)
- Biological roles: m-AAA proteases maintain protein quality, support mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis (e.g., bL32m/MrpL32 processing) and co-/post-translational maturation of OXPHOS components, and contribute to mitochondrial DNA stability, respiratory chain assembly, and regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling via uniporter complex components such as EMRE/MCU. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

2) Recent developments and latest research (2023–2024 focus)
- Integrated mechanism and disease linkage (2024): A comprehensive review details AFG3L2/SPG7 structure-function, stepwise substrate processing by the AAA+ module and protease, and roles in OXPHOS assembly and proteostasis. It highlights that loss of m-AAA activity destabilizes mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits (e.g., COX1, COX3, CYTB) and impairs respirasome formation, integrating proteostasis with respiratory competence. These mechanistic insights strongly support analogous roles for C. elegans spg-7. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)
- PQC and calcium homeostasis (2023): A recent review emphasizes m-AAA protease participation in maturation of EMRE and modulation of MCU activity, linking SPG7/m-AAA function to mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and organelle stress responses—mechanisms likely conserved across metazoans, including nematodes. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)
- UPRmt intersection (2024): Reviews synthesize that m-AAA defects provoke mitochondrial proteostatic stress and fragmentation via OMA1/OPA1 processing, thereby engaging mitochondrial stress axes. Although transcriptional induction patterns can differ across species and cell types, the mechanistic coupling of m-AAA function to mitochondrial stress and dynamics is well supported. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 5-7, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

3) Current applications and implementations
- Research models: m-AAA perturbations (AFG3L2/SPG7) in vertebrate systems are used to model OXPHOS assembly defects, proteotoxic stress, and mitochondrial fragmentation for disease-relevant studies (ataxias, optic atrophy). These paradigms guide use of spg-7 perturbations in C. elegans to induce mitochondrial stress and probe UPRmt and proteostasis pathways, by conservation. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9, khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)
- Mechanistic reconstitution: Subunit composition determines substrate preferences of m-AAA complexes; this is applied experimentally to dissect processing of dynamin-like GTPases (e.g., OPA1) and OXPHOS subunits in model systems, informing expected substrate classes for spg-7 in worm. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

4) Expert opinions and authoritative analysis
- m-AAA as central proteostasis hubs: Contemporary expert reviews frame AFG3L2/SPG7 m-AAA proteases as multifunctional hubs that coordinate mitochondrial proteostasis, respiratory chain assembly, and stress signaling. They argue that defects lead to selective instability of mitochondrial-encoded subunits and trigger OMA1 activation with fragmentation, providing a unifying mechanism for diverse phenotypes. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)
- Calcium uniporter regulation: Reviews highlight SPG7/m-AAA involvement in EMRE maturation and MCU complex regulation, proposing that m-AAA activity restrains excessive Ca2+ influx and associated mitochondrial damage, a concept with implications for neuronal and metabolic resilience. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data
- Respiratory biogenesis dependency: Loss of AFG3L2 reduces mitochondrial-encoded respiratory subunits (COX1, COX3, CYTB, ND2) relative to nuclear-encoded components and impairs respirasome assembly; while the review consolidates multiple primary measurements, specific percentages vary by experimental system and are not enumerated in the extracted sections. Nevertheless, the qualitative direction and selectivity of effects are clear. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)
- Stress-axis coupling: Reviews summarize increased OMA1 activity and OPA1 cleavage under m-AAA deficiency, with consequent mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased membrane potential/respiration in cellular and animal models. Quantitative magnitudes depend on model and mutation, but the mechanistic linkage is robust across studies. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 5-7, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

Function, substrates, and pathways (integrated narrative)
- Molecular function: spg-7 is inferred to encode an ATP-dependent, zinc metalloprotease that assembles into the m-AAA complex on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It uses its AAA+ module to recognize and unfold substrates and its protease domain to cleave them, thereby executing quality control and specific maturation steps. This is based on conserved m-AAA domain architecture and mechanism. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5, khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)
- Substrate specificity (inferred by conservation): Classes include (i) co-/post-translationally inserted OXPHOS subunits that require surveillance and processing; (ii) mitochondrial ribosomal proteins essential for translation (e.g., bL32m/MrpL32); and (iii) elements of the uniporter complex (EMRE), collectively linking spg-7 to respiration, translation capacity, and Ca2+ handling. Direct worm substrates were not delineated in the retrieved texts; the substrate classes follow conserved m-AAA biology. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)
- Localization and site of action: Inner mitochondrial membrane, matrix-facing active site, enabling surveillance of matrix-exposed membrane proteins and soluble matrix proteins near the membrane. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)
- Pathway context: spg-7 is positioned within mitochondrial protein quality control, OXPHOS assembly, and mitochondrial dynamics regulation via OMA1/OPA1 balance, with downstream consequences for mitochondrial unfolded protein response signaling when proteostasis is perturbed. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 5-7, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9, khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8)

Phenotypes upon loss or perturbation (interpretation for C. elegans)
- By conservation with vertebrate models, spg-7 loss-of-function is expected to impair mitochondrial respiration (reduced membrane potential, oxygen consumption), fragment mitochondrial networks via OMA1 activation, and destabilize mitochondrial-encoded respiratory subunits, thereby triggering stress responses. Direct C. elegans RNAi or mutant quantitative data were not captured in the retrieved 2023–2024 sources used here; thus, these predictions are labeled as inference from orthologs. (dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 5-7, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 7-9)

Limitations of the current evidence set
- The sources retrieved and analyzed here are recent, authoritative reviews that robustly define m-AAA protease biology. However, we did not retrieve C. elegans spg-7-specific primary experiments with quantitative phenotypes in 2023–2024 within this evidence set. Consequently, we clearly demarcate conserved-mechanism inferences from directly demonstrated worm data. (khalimonchuk2023moleculardeterminantsof pages 6-8, dastidar2024multifacetedrolesof pages 2-5)

Conclusion
The C. elegans gene spg-7 (Q9N3T5) encodes a conserved m-AAA protease subunit with AAA+ ATPase and M41 metalloprotease domains, localized to the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. By strong conservation with AFG3L2/SPG7 biology, spg-7 is expected to mediate ATP-dependent proteolysis and maturation of key mitochondrial proteins, sustaining OXPHOS assembly, mitochondrial translation capacity, and Ca2+ homeostasis, and to interface with mitochondrial stress signaling when proteostasis is challenged. Recent (2023–2024) expert reviews integrate these roles into a coherent view linking m-AAA proteases to respiratory biogenesis, membrane dynamics, and disease mechanisms, providing a robust framework for interpreting spg-7 function in worm and prioritizing targets for experimental validation.
