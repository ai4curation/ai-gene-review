description: SPG-7 is the C. elegans ortholog of human AFG3L2 (not SPG7/paraplegin
  as the gene name might suggest; the true SPG7 ortholog is ppgn-1). It encodes a
  subunit of the mitochondrial m-AAA protease complex, an ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease
  localized to the matrix-facing surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane. SPG-7
  functions in mitochondrial protein quality control by degrading misfolded or unassembled
  inner membrane proteins and processing newly imported mitochondrial proteins. Loss
  of SPG-7 function causes mitochondrial stress that activates the mitochondrial unfolded
  protein response (UPRmt) via the transcription factor ATFS-1, leading to transcriptional
  upregulation of mitochondrial chaperones (hsp-6, hsp-60) and innate immune genes.
  SPG-7 is essential for normal mitochondrial respiratory function and morphology.

  review:
    summary: SPG-7 is a well-established component of the m-AAA protease complex based
      on phylogenetic analysis (IBA from PAINT) and conserved domain architecture
      with mammalian AFG3L2. UniProt explicitly notes SPG-7 is an ortholog of human
      AFG3L2 and yeast AFG3, both core m-AAA complex subunits. Deep research confirms
      conserved m-AAA domain architecture (file:worm/spg-7/spg-7-deep-research-falcon.md).
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The IBA annotation is well-supported by phylogenetic conservation and

    label: positive regulation of nematode male tail tip morphogenesis
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:21408209
  review:
    summary: In a genome-wide RNAi screen for male tail tip morphogenesis genes, spg-7
      RNAi resulted in a "Lep" (leptoderan) phenotype - retention of the pointed larval
      tail tip. This was identified alongside 211 other genes. The annotation represents
      a high-throughput screen hit rather than focused investigation of spg-7's role.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation is technically valid - spg-7 RNAi does cause a male tail
      tip morphogenesis defect. However, this is likely a pleiotropic consequence
      of general mitochondrial dysfunction rather than a direct role in morphogenesis.
      The paper identified spg-7 as one of 41 suppressors of let-7 lethality with
      morphogenesis phenotypes, suggesting this reflects general cellular fitness
      rather than a specific role in tail tip development. This should be kept but

  review:
    summary: When SPG-7 is functional, it suppresses expression of stress-response
      genes by maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis. Loss of spg-7 leads to upregulation
      of UPRmt target genes and innate immune genes via ATFS-1.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The annotation is technically accurate but captures an indirect effect.
      SPG-7 does not directly regulate gene expression - rather, its proteolytic activity
      maintains mitochondrial health, which in turn keeps ATFS-1 in mitochondria where
      it is degraded. A more appropriate annotation would be to the upstream process

    action: MODIFY
    reason: Similar to the IMP annotation above, this captures an indirect effect.
      SPG-7 does not directly regulate gene expression but rather maintains mitochondrial
      proteostasis. The effects on gene expression are mediated by ATFS-1 when mitochondrial

  review:
    summary: Pellegrino et al. (2014) showed that spg-7(RNAi) pre-treatment activates
      the UPRmt, which in turn induces innate immune genes (abf-2, lys-2, clec-4,
      clec-65). This provides resistance to P. aeruginosa infection. The immune response
      is ATFS-1 dependent and represents a coupling of mitochondrial stress to innate
      immunity.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: This annotation reflects a downstream consequence of SPG-7 dysfunction
      rather than a direct role in immunity. When SPG-7 is lost, mitochondrial stress
      activates ATFS-1-dependent innate immune genes. While experimentally valid,
      this represents a stress response pathway activation rather than a core immune
      function of SPG-7. The core function is mitochondrial protein processing; immune

  review:
    summary: m-AAA proteases are required for assembly of mitochondrial respiratory
      chain complexes. This function is well-established in yeast and mammals and
      is conserved in C. elegans based on domain architecture and phenotypic effects.
    action: NEW
    reason: This core function is implicit in UniProt annotation but not currently
      in GO. UniProt states the m-AAA protease complex is necessary for the assembly
      of mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATPase complexes. PMID:25773600 shows
      spg-7(RNAi) reduces oxygen consumption, indicating respiratory defects.
