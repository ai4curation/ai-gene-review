## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** O16850
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Forkhead box protein O {ECO:0000305}; Short=FOXO {ECO:0000303|PubMed:12750521}; AltName: Full=Abnormal dauer formation protein 16 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R13H8.1h};
- **Gene Information:** Name=daf-16 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R13H8.1h}; ORFNames=R13H8.1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:R13H8.1h};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Not specified in UniProt
- **Key Domains:** Fork_head_dom. (IPR001766); TF_fork_head_CS_2. (IPR030456); WH-like_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036388); WH_DNA-bd_sf. (IPR036390); Forkhead (PF00250)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "daf-16" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'daf-16' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **daf-16** (gene ID: daf-16, UniProt: O16850) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

Research plan
- Verify identity and domain architecture; confirm organism and family.
- Compile recent (2023–2024 priority) primary literature and reviews on daf-16 (FOXO) function, regulation, localization, and pathways.
- Extract mechanistic evidence on upstream regulators (DAF-2/AGE-1/AKT, 14-3-3, stress kinases; new regulators), downstream targets/processes (dauer, longevity, stress resistance, metabolism), and tissue/cell-non-autonomous actions.
- Summarize subcellular localization dynamics and tissue context, including embryonic roles.
- Add current applications, expert perspectives, and quantitative/statistical data where available.
- Synthesize into a comprehensive, well-cited report with URLs and publication dates.

Mandatory verification of the research target
- Gene/protein symbol: daf-16, organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. DAF-16 is the C. elegans FOXO transcription factor ortholog, a forkhead family DNA-binding protein regulated by insulin/IGF signaling; recent work places a regulatory phosphosite (S249) within the conserved Forkhead DNA-binding domain, consistent with forkhead domain architecture (PF00250) and FOXO family identity (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 1-6). No conflicting gene symbol usages in other organisms are used here; all evidence pertains to C. elegans DAF-16.

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Core identity and function: DAF-16 is a FOXO-family transcription factor that integrates environmental and endocrine signals to regulate gene expression programs governing dauer formation, lifespan, stress resistance, metabolism, and proteostasis in C. elegans (Biomolecules review, Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101235) (jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 3-5). Under high insulin/IGF (DAF-2) signaling, a PI3K→PDK-1→AKT kinase cascade phosphorylates DAF-16, leading to its cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins and transcriptional repression; reduced IIS or stress allows dephosphorylated DAF-16 to enter nuclei and activate stress resistance and longevity genes (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 1-6).
- Domain regulation: A conserved serine (S249) within the Forkhead domain is phosphorylated by PAR-1/MARK kinase, providing an additional regulatory layer that promotes cytoplasmic localization and dampens DAF-16 activity (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).
- Cooperative axes: DAF-16 cooperates with the TFEB ortholog HLH-30 to control lysosome-related programs; recent work proposes a DAF-16/HLH-30 axis that induces tubular lysosomes, linking lysosomal remodeling to healthspan (Research Square preprint, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4049366/v1) (ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19).

2) Recent developments and latest research (prioritizing 2023–2024)
- Cell-non-autonomous stem cell protection via Notch: A 2024 Nature Communications study used tissue-specific DAF-16 transcriptomics to identify dos-3, a non-canonical Notch ligand, as a direct DAF-16 target. DOS-3 mediates cell-non-autonomous DAF-16 activity to preserve germline stem/progenitor cells (GSPCs) with age; notably, a human homolog can substitute for DOS-3, arguing functional conservation (Nature Communications, Jun 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49318-6) (zhang2024dos3mediatescellnonautonomous pages 1-2).
- Embryonic patterning and cell-cycle timing: bioRxiv 2024 live imaging of endogenous DAF-16::GFP revealed nuclear enrichment specifically in germ precursor nuclei during early embryogenesis (P-lineage from 8-cell stage). This enrichment depends on PIE-1/POS-1, PI3K/AGE-1 and PTEN/DAF-18, and USP7/MATH-33, but is independent of DAF-2 and AKT, and DAF-16 modulates early cell-cycle pacing, particularly in germline cells (bioRxiv, May 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.13.594029) (mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 1-5, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 27-29).
- Cooperation with HLH-30/TFEB to induce tubular lysosomes: A 2024 preprint reported that daf-16 and hlh-30 act combinatorially to induce tubular lysosomes, contributing to proteostasis and systemic health benefits in late age; intestinal SVIP overexpression can stimulate this program, even with compromised DAF-16 (Research Square, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4049366/v1) (ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19).
- New upstream regulation by PAR-1/MARK: Proximity labeling of endogenous DAF-16 combined with genetics uncovered PAR-1 as a DAF-16-proximal kinase whose activity is stimulated by DAF-2 signaling; PAR-1 phosphorylates DAF-16 at S249 in vitro and in vivo, promotes cytoplasmic accumulation, reduces DAF-16 stability, and limits longevity. A phosphomimetic DAF-16(S249D) suppresses daf-2 mutant longevity and dauer, whereas S249A increases nuclear localization and modestly extends lifespan (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).
- DAF-16-independent longevity cases: A 2024 Frontiers in Endocrinology study in a cancer/diabetes model context reported that the combination of metformin and high glucose increased lifespan in C. elegans in a DAF-16-independent manner, while altering daf-16 isoform expression (Frontiers in Endocrinology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1435098) (berk2024thecombinationof pages 4-7, berk2024thecombinationof pages 7-10).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Lysosomal remodeling for healthspan: The DAF-16/HLH-30 axis controlling tubular lysosome induction suggests lysosomal morphological programming as a therapeutic target; SVIP overexpression in gut induced systemic benefits, highlighting a manipulable pathway to enhance proteostasis even when one arm (DAF-16) is limited (Research Square, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4049366/v1) (ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19).
- Targeting PAR-1/MARK to relieve repression of DAF-16: Pharmacologic inhibition of MARK/PAR-1 (compound 39621, 20 µM) extended C. elegans lifespan in a DAF-16-dependent manner, and auxin-mediated PAR-1 depletion increased lifespan; these data position PAR-1 as a druggable node modulating FOXO activity in vivo (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 15-20).
- DAF-16 reporters and interaction mapping: Proximity labeling with endogenous TurboID-tagged DAF-16 uncovered regulatory complexes (e.g., PAR-1/MARK, ZFH-2/ZFHX3) and nuclear cofactors (SWI/SNF subunits, DNA repair proteins), providing a roadmap to functionally test DAF-16 modulators and co-regulators in aging interventions (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 6-11, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 1-6).

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Reviews and syntheses emphasize DAF-16/FOXO as a central longevity and stress regulator in C. elegans, integrating IIS with other nutrient/stress signals (AMPK, JNK, mTOR/HLH-30 cooperation), consistent with conserved aging mechanisms across taxa (Biomolecules review, Sep 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14101235) (jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 3-5). The 2024 preprint argues that DAF-16 and HLH-30 form a cooperative regulatory axis for lysosomal adaptation important to healthspan (Research Square, Mar 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4049366/v1) (ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19). Nature Communications 2024 and 2025 articles provide high-quality mechanistic evidence for cell-non-autonomous actions via Notch (dos-3) and for a new DAF-2→PAR-1→DAF-16 phosphorylation axis, respectively, refining canonical IIS models (Nature Communications, Jun 2024; Dec 2025) (zhang2024dos3mediatescellnonautonomous pages 1-2, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Embryonic localization and quantification: DAF-16 nuclear enrichment in germ precursors (P3/P4) versus somatic AB cells was quantified using endogenously tagged DAF-16::GFP; analyses reported sample sizes (e.g., N=3 experiments; n up to 59 nuclei), normalized fold-enrichment, and significance by t-tests/ANOVA with thresholds (n.s. >0.05, * ≤0.05, ** ≤0.01, **** ≤0.0001). PIE-1 RNAi reduced germline nuclear enrichment; IIS lipid regulators AGE-1 and DAF-18 were required for robust enrichment (bioRxiv, May 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.13.594029) (mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 27-29).
- PAR-1/MARK–DAF-16 phosphoregulation and lifespan: Genetic PAR-1 depletion significantly increased lifespan, fully dependent on daf-16; a selective MARK inhibitor (compound 39621, 20 µM) extended lifespan in a daf-16-dependent manner. DAF-16(S249A) increased nuclear localization and modestly extended lifespan; DAF-16(S249D) reduced lifespan and nearly fully suppressed the constitutive dauer of daf-2(e1370) mutants, consistent with S249 as an inhibitory phosphosite (Nature Communications, Dec 2025; URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66409-0) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 15-20, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).
- DAF-16-independent lifespan extension: In a 2024 study, metformin combined with high glucose increased longevity in a daf-16-independent manner, while individual treatments showed expected effects (glucose reduced lifespan; metformin alone extended lifespan). The paper reported mean ± SEM and significant p-values in figures; exact percent change values were presented in figures (Frontiers in Endocrinology, Nov 2024; URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2024.1435098) (berk2024thecombinationof pages 4-7, berk2024thecombinationof pages 7-10).

Mechanistic roles, pathways, and localization
- Upstream regulation: IIS via DAF-2→AGE-1→PDK-1→AKT-1/2 directly phosphorylates and inhibits DAF-16, enabling 14-3-3–mediated cytoplasmic sequestration. Stress/nutrient cues (AMPK, JNK; mTOR inhibition) permit nuclear translocation, and new data add a DAF-2–stimulated PAR-1/MARK arm that phosphorylates DAF-16 at S249 to further promote cytoplasmic localization and reduce stability (Biomolecules review, 2024; Nature Communications, 2025) (jeayeng2024caenorhabditiselegansas pages 3-5, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 1-6, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).
- Subcellular dynamics and tissue context: DAF-16 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus depending on signaling state in larvae/adults, and shows patterned nuclear enrichment in embryonic germ precursors independent of DAF-2/AKT but dependent on AGE-1, DAF-18, and germline determinants, consistent with context-specific upstream inputs (Nature Communications, 2025; bioRxiv, 2024) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 1-6, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 1-5, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 27-29).
- Downstream outputs: DAF-16 upregulates stress-protective and metabolic genes (e.g., mtl-1, sod-3 reporters), controls dauer formation, and extends lifespan under reduced IIS. Nuclear cofactors (ZFH-2) and chromatin regulators (SWI/SNF subunits) are enriched near nuclear DAF-16, supporting DNA repair and chromatin remodeling interfaces. Phospho-regulation at S249 modulates dauer and longevity phenotypes (Nature Communications, 2025) (artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 6-11, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64).
- Cooperative and non-autonomous circuits: DAF-16 acts in cross-tissue circuits, exemplified by the DAF-16→dos-3→Notch axis that maintains germline stem/progenitor cells, and by cooperative control of lysosomal remodeling with HLH-30/TFEB that enhances proteostasis organism-wide (Nature Communications, 2024; Research Square, 2024) (zhang2024dos3mediatescellnonautonomous pages 1-2, ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19).

Notes on scope and evidence
- Several 2024 insights derive from a preprint on DAF-16/HLH-30 cooperation; conclusions should be considered provisional pending peer review (ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19). The 2024 embryonic work is also a preprint (mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 1-5, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 27-29). Nonetheless, both provide timely mechanistic advances complementing established IIS–DAF-16 paradigms corroborated by peer-reviewed studies.

Conclusion
DAF-16 (FOXO) in C. elegans is a forkhead transcription factor that serves as a pivotal effector of the IIS pathway and broader stress/nutrient signaling. 2024–2025 studies add important dimensions: a cell-non-autonomous Notch axis safeguarding germline stem cells; patterned embryonic nuclear enrichment and roles in early cell-cycle timing with non-canonical upstream inputs; cooperation with HLH-30 to remodel lysosomes for proteostasis; and a new DAF-2–activated PAR-1/MARK phosphorylation control at S249 modulating nuclear localization, stability, dauer, and lifespan. These advances refine our mechanistic model of DAF-16 as a context-sensitive regulator with tissue- and system-level actions and point to actionable nodes (e.g., MARK/PAR-1, lysosomal programs) for interventions in aging biology (zhang2024dos3mediatescellnonautonomous pages 1-2, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 1-5, mauro2024patterningregulationand pages 27-29, ricaurteperez2025daf16foxoandhlh30tfeb pages 16-19, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 20-24, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 11-15, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 60-64, artan2025proximitylabelingof pages 15-20).
