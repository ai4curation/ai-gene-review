description: 'DAF-16 is a forkhead box transcription factor (FOXO) that is the primary
  downstream effector of the insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway in C. elegans.
  It functions as a key regulator of longevity, stress resistance, dauer larval development,
  innate immunity, and metabolism. Under conditions of reduced IIS (e.g., daf-2 mutants),
  DAF-16 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it activates transcription
  of target genes involved in stress response, metabolism, and longevity. DAF-16 is
  negatively regulated by AKT-1, AKT-2, and SGK-1 kinases, which phosphorylate DAF-16
  and promote cytoplasmic retention via 14-3-3 protein binding (FTT-2). Multiple DAF-16
  isoforms exist (a, b, c, d, e, f, h) with distinct expression patterns and potentially
  different functions in lifespan modulation. The intestine is the primary tissue
  for DAF-16-dependent longevity signaling.

  description: 'DAF-16 is a forkhead transcription factor that binds DNA through its
    forkhead domain and regulates transcription of target genes. This is the core
    molecular function of DAF-16.

  description: 'Longevity regulation is the best-characterized function of DAF-16.
    It is absolutely required for lifespan extension in daf-2/insulin receptor mutants
    and many other longevity paradigms. DAF-16 activates genes involved in stress
    resistance, proteostasis, and metabolism that collectively extend lifespan.

  description: 'DAF-16 is the major downstream effector of the insulin/IGF-1-like
    signaling pathway in C. elegans. It is negatively regulated by AKT kinases downstream
    of DAF-2 receptor signaling. This is fundamental to DAF-16 biology.

suggested_questions:
- question: What are the distinct functions of DAF-16 isoforms (a, d/f) in 
    different tissues?
- question: How does DAF-16 coordinate transcriptional activation and 
    repression?
suggested_experiments:
- description: ChIP-seq across conditions and tissues to identify 
    isoform-specific target genes
  hypothesis: 'Comprehensive genome-wide binding analysis would reveal the full scope
    of DAF-16 targets and potential isoform-specific binding patterns.

- description: Single-cell analysis of DAF-16 nuclear translocation dynamics
  hypothesis: 'Cell-type-specific dynamics of DAF-16 regulation could reveal tissue-specific
    mechanisms of DAF-16 activation.
