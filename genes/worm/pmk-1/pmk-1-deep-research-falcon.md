### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q17446
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Mitogen-activated protein kinase pmk-1; EC=2.7.11.24 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11703092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16166371, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22308034}; AltName: Full=Stress-activated protein kinase pmk-1; AltName: Full=p38 MAP kinase 1;
- **Gene Information:** Name=pmk-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:B0218.3}; ORFNames=B0218.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:B0218.3};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. CMGC Ser/Thr
- **Key Domains:** Kinase-like_dom_sf. (IPR011009); MAP_kinase. (IPR050117); MAP_kinase_CS. (IPR003527); MAPK_p38-like. (IPR008352); Prot_kinase_dom. (IPR000719)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "pmk-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'pmk-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **pmk-1** (gene ID: pmk-1, UniProt: Q17446) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

Plan and verification
- Target identity: pmk-1 encodes the C. elegans p38-class mitogen-activated protein kinase PMK-1 (EC 2.7.11.24), a CMGC Ser/Thr protein kinase that functions in canonical MAPK cascades; it is activated by dual phosphorylation in the activation loop and transduces stress and innate immunity signals. This matches the UniProt record (Q17446) and literature referring to PMK-1 as the C. elegans p38 MAPK ortholog. Organism is Caenorhabditis elegans. The upstream MAP3K→MAP2K→MAPK module (NSY-1→SEK-1→PMK-1) and TIR-1/SARM adaptor are consistently reported, aligning with MAP_kinase and p38-like domain annotations. No conflicting gene symbol usage from other organisms is used in this report. (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7, ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2)

Comprehensive research report on pmk-1 (C. elegans; UniProt Q17446)

1) Key concepts and definitions
- Molecular identity and catalytic activity: PMK-1 is the p38 MAP kinase ortholog in C. elegans; as a Ser/Thr kinase (EC 2.7.11.24), it is activated by upstream MAP2K SEK-1 and phosphorylates downstream transcription factors to regulate innate immunity and stress responses. PMK-1 signaling canonically proceeds via TIR-1 (TIR-domain adaptor) → NSY-1 (MAP3K) → SEK-1 (MAP2K) → PMK-1 (MAPK). (Raj et al., Nature Communications, 2023-05-20; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7)
- Upstream activators and sensors: Pathogen- and damage-associated signals can engage TIR-1/SARM, with additional inputs from organelle stress (e.g., IRE-1/TRF-1 axis), lysosome-related organelles, and lipid/nutrient cues that converge on the NSY-1→SEK-1→PMK-1 module. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Hajdú et al., IJMS, 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)
- Downstream substrates/effectors: PMK-1 phosphorylates ATF-7 to switch it from a repressor to an activator of immune effector genes; it also controls SKN-1/Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress/detoxification programs under some contexts. Multiple bZIP factors integrate with PMK-1, including ZIP-10/BATF3 as a negative regulator of PMK-1 signaling. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Afridi et al., International Immunology, 2023-11-15, https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxac053) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 1-2, afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 15-15)
- Tissues and subcellular/localization context: PMK-1 signaling is prominent in the intestinal epithelium for innate defense and stress tolerance; epidermal immune responses to cuticle/collagen damage can be partly PMK-1-dependent; PMK-1 also participates in non-autonomous circuits affecting other tissues via neuroendocrine and germline-intestinal axes. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Zhu et al., Cells, 2023-09-06, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182223; Zhang et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-10-19, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249436; Hajdú et al., 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 2-4, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 1-2, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 2-4, hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)
- Core biological roles: PMK-1 drives transcriptional programs of innate immunity (lysozymes, C-type lectins, AMPs), integrates oxidative/ER/lysosomal stress signals, and contributes to pathogen resistance and toxin resilience. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Ding et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-04-12, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003; Hajdú et al., 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2, hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)

2) Recent developments and latest research (priority 2023–2024)
- Cisplatin resilience via intestinal PMK-1/ATF-7: In adult post-mitotic C. elegans, cisplatin exposure (e.g., 300 μg/mL; 6–24 h) induces ROS and activates PMK-1 and ATF-7; mutants in tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1, or pmk-1 are hypersensitive (LD50 shift; sek-1(km4) LD50 ~150 μg/mL, ~3.5× lower than WT). IRE-1 and TRF-1 act upstream of PMK-1 in a UPRER-independent route. Proteomics showed innate immune proteins are the most enriched induced class (>160 proteins). Conclusion: innate immune arm via PMK-1→ATF-7 is pivotal for cisplatin resilience in adults. (Nature Communications, 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 2-4, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7)
- Epidermal collagen damage sensing: C. elegans hemidesmosomes sense specific cuticle collagen damage; DPY-collagen substructures and BLI-1 interacting with MUP-4 disengage upon damage, releasing STA-2 to drive AMP genes. Loss of PMK-1 partially suppresses nlp-29 induction in dpy mutants, indicating a partial dependence of epidermal AMP induction on p38/PMK-1. (Cells, 2023-09-06, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182223) (zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 2-4)
- Intestinal lysosome–PMK-1 crosstalk governed by gonadal signaling: A germline gap junction INX-14/Notch GLP-1 axis suppresses intestinal defense by acting through an intestinal lysosome pathway upstream of PMK-1; inx-14 or glp-1 disruption enhances PA14 resistance, reduces gut colonization, and upregulates lysosome and PMK-1 pathway genes. Tissue-specific RNAi pinpoints the germline as the site of inx-14 action affecting intestinal PMK-1. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-10-19, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249436) (zhang2023agonadalgap pages 1-2, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 2-4)
- Diet/probiotic/peptide modulation: An antimicrobial peptide (2K4L) reduces bacterial burden and inflammation and downregulates PMK-1 phosphorylation and “core gene” expression in the p38/PMK-1 pathway in worms infected with A. baumannii, improving worm survival; this links anti-infective interventions to PMK-1 pathway attenuation under certain pathogen contexts. (Scientific Reports, 2024-07-09, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 1-2, ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 2-4)
- Pathogen models beyond PA14: Salmonella Paratyphi A infection engages tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1, pmk-1, mpk-1, skn-1 and insulin pathway components; pmk-1(km25) is used as a sensitized background confirming PMK-1’s role in defense and oxidative stress responses. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-04-12, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003) (ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2)
- Integrative reviews underscore lysosome-related organelles (LROs) and metabolic cues (cholesterol status) as inputs to TIR-1/NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 and emphasize cross-talk with UPRER and insulin signaling. (IJMS review, 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Chemotherapy toxicity modeling: Adult C. elegans lacking proliferative somatic cells offer a model for post-mitotic tissue responses to cisplatin; PMK-1/ATF-7 activation and its upstream IRE-1/TRF-1 link provide a platform for screening modulators of chemo-toxicity resilience and innate immune proteome remodeling. (Nature Communications, 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7)
- Innate immunity and barrier damage sensing: The epidermal collagen-damage sensor that partially requires PMK-1 supports the use of C. elegans to dissect epithelial DAMP surveillance and AMP regulation mechanisms with potential parallels in skin/mucosal immunity. (Cells, 2023-09-06, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182223) (zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 2-4)
- Host–microbe and lysosome signaling axes: The INX-14/GLP-1→lysosome→PMK-1 pathway demonstrates how reproductive tissues non-autonomously tune intestinal immunity, informing studies on neuroendocrine and gonadal regulation of mucosal defense. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-10-19, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249436) (zhang2023agonadalgap pages 1-2, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 2-4)
- Anti-infective discovery: AMPs and other interventions altering PMK-1 activity (e.g., 2K4L attenuating PMK-1 phosphorylation in infection) can be read out in C. elegans survival and colonization assays, bridging to mammalian models. (Scientific Reports, 2024-07-09, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 1-2, ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 2-4)

4) Expert opinions and analysis from authoritative sources
- Nature Communications 2023 emphasizes that in adult post-mitotic worms, the innate immune branch via PMK-1→ATF-7, triggered upstream by IRE-1/TRF-1 and the canonical NSY-1→SEK-1 module, is more critical for cisplatin resilience than SKN-1-dependent detoxification, reframing PMK-1’s role in chemotherapy stress. (2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7)
- International Immunology 2023 identifies a conserved suppressive bZIP factor (BATF3/ZIP-10) that attenuates PMK-1-dependent immunity, highlighting transcriptional checkpoints that tune p38 signaling intensity during infection. (2023-11-15, https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxac053) (afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 1-2, afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 15-15)
- IJMS 2024 review synthesizes PMK-1’s integration with organelle stress (lysosome/LROs, ER) and endocrine cues, and its tissue focus in the intestine, consolidating the model that PMK-1 is a central node for surveillance immunity and metabolic state coupling. (2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)

5) Relevant statistics and quantitative data (recent studies)
- Cisplatin responses: sek-1(km4) LD50 ~150 μg/mL cisplatin vs higher WT LD50 (~3.5× difference); proteomics after 6 h at 300 μg/mL identified 3,586 proteins with significant changes (FDR < 0.05), including 121 upregulated >2-fold and 158 downregulated <−2-fold, with innate immune proteins the most enriched category; MitoTempo reduces cisplatin-induced PMK-1 phosphorylation; somatic depletion of SEK-1 (auxin 1 mM, 2 h) reduces p-PMK-1 and survival. (Nature Communications, 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7)
- Epidermal collagen damage: Loss of PMK-1 partially suppresses Pnlp-29::GFP elevation in dpy collagen mutants, consistent with partial PMK-1 dependence of AMP induction; epidermal AMP families include NLPs and CNCs, which are under p38/PMK-1 and/or TGF-β control depending on the stimulus. (Cells, 2023-09-06, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182223) (zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 2-4)
- Germline–intestine axis: inx-14(ag17) mutants show significantly longer survival on PA14; germline-specific inx-14 RNAi phenocopies resistance, while intestine-, neuron-, muscle-, or hypodermis-specific inx-14 RNAi do not; PA14::GFP gut accumulation and CFU counts are reduced in inx-14 mutants; germline expression of inx-14 rescues susceptibility. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-10-19, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249436) (zhang2023agonadalgap pages 1-2, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 2-4)
- Antimicrobial peptide 2K4L intervention: In infected worms, intestinal CFU reduced by ~77.3% within 6 h after 2K4L treatment; lifespan improved under A. baumannii exposure; biochemical readouts show reduced PMK-1 phosphorylation and decreased expression of PMK-1 pathway “core genes.” (Scientific Reports, 2024-07-09, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64511-9) (ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 2-4, ji2024antimicrobialpeptide2k4l pages 1-2)
- Salmonella Paratyphi A infection: Genetic dependency on tir-1, nsy-1, sek-1, pmk-1, mpk-1, skn-1, daf-2, and daf-16; pmk-1(km25) allele used to demonstrate sensitivity; infection increases oxidative stress as measured by H2O2 assays; qRT-PCR confirms immune gene regulation pattern. (Frontiers in Immunology, 2023-04-12, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003) (ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2)

Pathways and mechanistic synthesis
- Canonical cascade: TIR-1/SARM1 (often localized to lysosome-related organelles upon specific stresses) activates NSY-1 (MAP3K), which activates SEK-1 (MAP2K) to phosphorylate and activate PMK-1 (p38 MAPK). Activated PMK-1 phosphorylates ATF-7 to induce innate immune effectors (lysozymes, C-type lectins, AMPs) and can engage SKN-1 under oxidative stress. (Hajdú et al., 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034; Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Ding et al., 2023-04-12, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003) (hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2)
- Tissue specificity: Intestine is the principal effector tissue; epidermis uses a damage-sensing hemidesmosome/collagen mechanism that can partially recruit PMK-1; germline signals (INX-14/GLP-1) modulate intestinal lysosome signaling that funnels into PMK-1 activation state. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Zhu et al., 2023-09-06, https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182223; Zhang et al., 2023-10-19, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1249436) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 1-2, zhu2023c.eleganshemidesmosomes pages 2-4, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 1-2, zhang2023agonadalgap pages 2-4)
- Context dependence: Under cisplatin stress in adults, innate immune outputs via ATF-7 dominate resilience, whereas SKN-1 detoxification can be dispensable or even inversely related to survival; under microbial infection, PMK-1 coordinates with SKN-1 and DAF-16 depending on pathogen and stress type. (Raj et al., 2023-05-20, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38568-5; Ding et al., 2023-04-12, https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1118003; Hajdú et al., 2024-06-27, https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137034) (raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 1-2, raj2023cisplatintoxicityis pages 4-7, ding2023salmonellaentericaserovar pages 1-2, hajdu2024modelinghost–pathogeninteractions pages 6-7)
- Transcriptional regulation: ATF-7 is a direct PMK-1 substrate switching from repression to activation upon phosphorylation; PMK-1 activity is itself modulated by bZIP repressors like ZIP-10/BATF3, integrating small RNA and metabolic signals to tune defense intensity. (Afridi et al., 2023-11-15, https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxac053) (afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 1-2, afridi2023thebziptranscription pages 15-15)

Conclusions and outlook
PMK-1 (Q17446) is a prototypical p38 MAPK in C. elegans that integrates danger signals from pathogens, toxins, and tissue damage to orchestrate innate immune and stress-protective programs, primarily in the intestine but also in epidermal and inter-tissue circuits. Recent work (2023–2024) reveals: (i) a central role for PMK-1→ATF-7 in adult cisplatin resilience; (ii) epidermal collagen damage sensing where PMK-1 partially contributes to AMP induction; (iii) a germline INX-14/GLP-1→lysosome→PMK-1 axis controlling gut defense; and (iv) diet/anti-infective interventions that modulate PMK-1 phosphorylation and target gene expression in vivo. These findings refine pathway topology (additional upstream IRE-1/TRF-1 and lysosome cues) and underscore PMK-1 as a tractable node for screening therapeutics that modulate innate immunity and stress tolerance.
