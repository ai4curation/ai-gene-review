description: PMK-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian p38 MAPK, functioning as
  a central stress-activated protein kinase in innate immunity and oxidative stress
  response. It operates within the conserved TIR-1-NSY-1-SEK-1-PMK-1 signaling cascade,
  where it is activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr-191 and Tyr-193 by the upstream
  MAPKK SEK-1. PMK-1 phosphorylates key transcription factors including SKN-1 (triggering
  its nuclear translocation during oxidative stress) and ATF-7 (converting it from
  a repressor to an activator of immune effector genes). The kinase is essential for
  defense against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungal pathogens, and
  various environmental stresses including osmotic stress and reactive oxygen species.
