## Question

# Gene Research for Functional Annotation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gene/Protein Identification Context

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN RESEARCH:** You MUST verify you are researching the CORRECT gene/protein. Gene symbols can be ambiguous, especially for less well-characterized genes from non-model organisms.

### Target Gene/Protein Identity (from UniProt):
- **UniProt Accession:** Q22592
- **Protein Description:** RecName: Full=Beclin homolog {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T19E7.3a};
- **Gene Information:** Name=bec-1 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T19E7.3a}; Synonyms=atg-6 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T19E7.3a}; ORFNames=T19E7.3 {ECO:0000312|WormBase:T19E7.3a};
- **Organism (full):** Caenorhabditis elegans.
- **Protein Family:** Belongs to the beclin family. .
- **Key Domains:** Atg6/Beclin. (IPR007243); Atg6/Beclin_C_sf. (IPR038274); Atg6/beclin_CC. (IPR041691); Atg6_BARA. (IPR040455); APG6 (PF04111)

### MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. **Check if the gene symbol "bec-1" matches the protein description above**
2. **Verify the organism is correct:** Caenorhabditis elegans.
3. **Check if protein family/domains align with what you find in literature**
4. **If you find literature for a DIFFERENT gene with the same or similar symbol, STOP**

### If Gene Symbol is Ambiguous or You Cannot Find Relevant Literature:

**DO NOT PROCEED WITH RESEARCH ON A DIFFERENT GENE.** Instead:
- State clearly: "The gene symbol 'bec-1' is ambiguous or literature is limited for this specific protein"
- Explain what you found (e.g., "Found extensive literature on a different gene with the same symbol in a different organism")
- Describe the protein based ONLY on the UniProt information provided above
- Suggest that the protein function can be inferred from domain/family information

### Research Target:

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene **bec-1** (gene ID: bec-1, UniProt: Q22592) in worm.

The research report should be a detailed narrative explaining the function, biological processes, and localization of the gene product. Citations should be given for all claims.

You should prioritize authoritative reviews and primary scientific literature when conducting research. You can supplement
this with annotations you find in gene/protein databases, but these can be outdated or inaccurate.

We are specifically interested in the primary function of the gene - for enzymes, what reaction is catalyzed, and what is the substrate specificity? For transporters, what is the substrate? For structural proteins or adapters, what is the broader structural role? For signaling molecules, what is the role in the pathway.

We are interested in where in or outside the cell the gene product carries out its function.

We are also interested in the signaling or biochemical pathways in which the gene functions. We are less interested in broad pleiotropic effects, except where these elucidate the precise role.

Include evidence where possible. We are interested in both experimental evidence as well as inference from structure, evolution, or bioinformatic analysis. Precise studies should be prioritized over high-throughput, where available.

## Output

*Table: Compact, evidence-backed summary of identity, function, localization, pathway roles, recent C. elegans findings (2023–2024), and common experimental tools for bec-1 (UniProt Q22592). Useful as a quick reference for experimental planning and literature review.*

1) Key concepts and definitions (current understanding)
- Identity and family: bec-1 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of Beclin/Atg6 (yeast Vps30/Atg6), a core component of class III PI3K (PI3KC3/VPS-34) machinery. It belongs to the Beclin family and contains conserved coiled-coil and BARA-like domains that mediate complex assembly and membrane engagement; the worm identity and family membership match the UniProt specification (Organism: C. elegans). These features underpin a primary role as a scaffold/adaptor, not as the lipid kinase itself (VPS-34 is the enzyme) (konstantinidis2021molecularbasisof pages 7-8, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5).
- PI3KC3 complexes: BEC-1 assembles with VPS-34 and VPS-15, plus complex-defining subunits to form PI3KC3-C1 (with ATG14/EPG-8) for autophagosome nucleation and PI3KC3-C2 (with UVRAG-like/VPS-38) for endocytic/endolysosomal maturation. In C. elegans, these assignments are supported by genetic and cell-biological studies linking BEC-1 to autophagy initiation and endocytic trafficking (swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40, maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5, fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22).
- Canonical vs noncanonical roles: Beyond canonical macroautophagy initiation, BEC-1 participates in LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and phagosome maturation in vivo, reflecting noncanonical deployment of core autophagy proteins in single-membrane trafficking processes (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22).

2) Recent developments and latest research (emphasis 2023–2024)
- Neuronal autolysosome reformation (ALR): 2023 in vivo work shows that perturbing PI3KC3 components in C. elegans neurons (including bec-1/beclin and vps-15) causes accumulation of elongated autolysosomal tubules and reduced autophagic flux, implicating bec-1 in ALR and clathrin-dependent regulation of autolysosomal tubules (swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40).
- Autophagy–apoptosis coupling in ageing: 2023 data link autophagy to longevity via mitochondrial apoptosis regulators; inhibition of autophagy by bec-1(RNAi) blunts lifespan extension phenotypes in genetic models, supporting a functional requirement for BEC-1-mediated autophagy in pro-longevity pathways (ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7).
- Stress and infection responses: 2024 preprint evidence uses bec-1 RNAi as a core autophagy control in models of stress resistance and infection, reinforcing the standard role of bec-1 in autophagy induction during physiological challenge in worms (chung2024c.eleganshuntingtin pages 21-23).

3) Current applications and real-world implementations
- Genetic perturbation: bec-1(RNAi) and loss-of-function alleles are routine to inhibit autophagy in vivo for lifespan studies, neuronal trafficking, and stress-resistance assays; these manipulations predictably reduce autophagic flux and can negate longevity phenotypes contingent on autophagy (ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7, konstantinidis2021molecularbasisof pages 7-8).
- Imaging reporters and flux assays: GFP::LGG-1 (LC3 family) reporters (plgg-1::GFP::LGG-1) monitor puncta and flux; BEC-1 localization and function are inferred from LGG-1/2 dynamics and from BEC-1::GFP enrichment at phagosomes. These tools are deployed in neuronal ALR studies and phagosome maturation/LAP analyses (swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40, fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7).
- Physiological phenotyping: Autophagy-dependent phenotypes (e.g., lifespan modulation, proteostasis, infection survival, neuronal autolysosome dynamics) are interrogated with bec-1 perturbations to establish causal roles of autophagy in whole-animal physiology (ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7, chung2024c.eleganshuntingtin pages 21-23).

4) Expert opinions and analysis (authoritative sources)
- Consensus view: Authoritative reviews and syntheses position BEC-1 as a central scaffold of PI3KC3 complexes controlling autophagosome nucleation and endolysosomal traffic; conserved domain architecture underlies its partnership with VPS-34/VPS-15 and complex-specific adaptors (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5).
- Worm-specific context: Reviews focused on neuronal autophagy and ageing in C. elegans emphasize that bec-1 (with vps-34, vps-15, epg-8/ATG14) executes vesicle nucleation, and that autophagy genes including bec-1 are required for longevity in classic insulin/IGF-1 pathway mutants (konstantinidis2021molecularbasisof pages 7-8).
- Noncanonical autophagy: In vivo cell-biology evidence in C. elegans supports noncanonical roles (LAP) for BEC-1 and LGG-1/2 in the degradation of phagosomal cargo (midbodies), expanding the scope of Beclin-dependent membrane processing (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22).

5) Relevant statistics and data from recent studies
- Neuronal ALR phenotypes: Loss of bec-1/beclin in C. elegans neurons leads to accumulation of grossly elongated autolysosomal tubules and lowered autophagic flux; ALR defects are shared with other PI3KC3 regulators (e.g., vps-15), indicating a conserved requirement of BEC-1 for ALR (qualitative neuronal phenotypes reported with fluorescence markers) (swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40).
- Lifespan dependence on BEC-1: In genetic combinations that extend lifespan via mitochondrial apoptosis pathway modulation, autophagy suppression by bec-1(RNAi) eliminates the lifespan extension, indicating quantitative lifespan outcomes depend on intact BEC-1-mediated autophagy (qualitative conclusion; exact lifespans reported in the study’s figures) (ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7).
- LAP/phagosome maturation: BEC-1::GFP is enriched around internalized midbody phagosomes; BEC-1 and LGG-1/LGG-2 are required for timely midbody degradation, consistent with a requirement for PI3KC3 activity in single-membrane phagosome processing (qualitative imaging and dependency data) (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22).

Functional annotation of bec-1 (Q22592)
- Primary molecular role: BEC-1 is a scaffold/adaptor within class III PI3K complexes. In PI3KC3-C1 (VPS-34–VPS-15–EPG-8/ATG14–BEC-1), it promotes autophagosome nucleation by positioning VPS-34 to generate PI3P at ER-derived omegasomes and nascent phagophores. In PI3KC3-C2 (VPS-34–VPS-15–VPS-38/UVRAG–BEC-1), it supports endocytic/phagosomal maturation and endolysosomal trafficking, including LAP and ALR (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5, fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40).
- Not an enzyme: BEC-1 does not catalyze lipid phosphorylation; VPS-34 is the PI3P-generating kinase. BEC-1’s domains mediate partner selection and membrane targeting, regulating VPS-34 activity and pathway specificity (maheshwari2025thebiologicalrole pages 3-5).
- Subcellular localization: BEC-1 localizes to ER-associated omegasomes/phagophores during autophagy initiation, to autophagosomes, and to single-membrane phagosomes during LAP; it is also implicated at autolysosomes during ALR in neurons (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7, swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40).
- Pathways: BEC-1 acts at the vesicle nucleation stage of macroautophagy, contributes to endocytic trafficking and phagosome maturation (LAP), and is required for autolysosome reformation to sustain lysosomal capacity, particularly in neurons (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40).

Experimental evidence and tools
- Genetic models: bec-1 loss-of-function or RNAi is used to inhibit autophagy; genetic epistasis demonstrates that longevity phenotypes and stress-resistance gains often require bec-1 (ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7, chung2024c.eleganshuntingtin pages 21-23).
- Imaging reporters: plgg-1::GFP::LGG-1 reporters quantify autophagic puncta/flux; BEC-1::GFP enriches at phagosome rims (midbodies) and autophagy-associated membranes; neuronal ALR studies use autolysosomal tubule reporters to diagnose ALR defects upon bec-1 perturbation (fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40, ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7).

Notes on verification and ambiguity
- Symbol and organism verification: The gene symbol bec-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans corresponds to UniProt Q22592 (Beclin homolog). Literature cited above consistently uses bec-1 as the C. elegans Beclin/ATG6 ortholog; no conflicting usage was identified during this review (konstantinidis2021molecularbasisof pages 7-8).

Conclusion
C. elegans bec-1 (Q22592) encodes the conserved Beclin/ATG6 scaffold that directs VPS-34 lipid kinase activity within PI3KC3 complexes to regulate autophagosome nucleation, noncanonical phagosome maturation (LAP), and neuronal autolysosome reformation. Recent 2023 in vivo studies highlight bec-1’s specific requirement for ALR and show that genetic longevity/stress phenotypes are bec-1-dependent, reaffirming its central, adaptor-mediated role across canonical and noncanonical membrane remodeling pathways in vivo (swords2023aconservedrequirement pages 37-40, fazeli2016c.elegansmidbodies pages 20-22, ploumi2023couplingofautophagy pages 6-7).
